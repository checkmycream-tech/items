            <li>Braun also recommends using tap water for washing, but I doubt it is good to do this daily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is a good product albeit somewhat pricy</li>
            <li>A good value for the dollar,</li>
            <li>These are just as good and arrived in good condition and in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Good price for replacement refills.</li>

            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>As described, good value</li>
            <li>The trade-off is convenience; and the shaver itself is a good one.</li>

            <li>good product.</li>

            <li>it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  </li>

            <li>Product what I needed and pleased to be able to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>They also seem more money.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Much better price point too.</li>
            <li>seems okay</li>
            <li>Authentic Braun cartridge refill replacements work well with my Series 7 electric razor.  </li>

            <li>The options are whether you want 2, 3 or more refills at one time.  </li>
            <li>Requires replacing a lot more often than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are genuine Braun!</li>
            <li>The product does mostly what it ways.  </li>

            <li>you be sure</li>
            <li>I love the fact that Braun now has a four-pack of cartridge refills.  </li>
            <li>Much more convenient than the two- or three-pack.</li>
            <li>After each use, I make sure to seal up the cartridge and keep it separate from the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>So satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>they work great thanks</li>

            <li>A couple Christmases ago I was giving the shaver that using this product and as for the shaver I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve never had better result in my life.</li>

            <li>Excellent buy when you consider what you would pay for 2 at a Big Box store!</li>
            <li>Plus they do a better job than I do...</li>
            <li>The price wasn&#x27;t much better than bed bath &amp; beyond</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Have used these many times before.</li>
            <li>I tried using my own alcohol solution to refill these because I was too cheap to pay the price for them at the store.  </li>
            <li>So much better than Walmart even</li>
            <li>The price is even better than Sam&#x27;s Club</li>
            <li>It also keeps the Braun Series 5 running better longer.</li>

            <li>I love my shaver but the cleaner is a problem with replacements.  </li>
            <li>Granted, paying for disposable razor blades is more costly</li>
            <li>If these were cheaper I believe more people would use and replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because I am not going to say &amp;#34;I Love it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>200.00 for a top of the line, made in Germany shaver</li>
            <li>Sure, one could mix up some mineral oil, alcohol, and water</li>
            <li>I use the periodic shipment from Amazon to save money and make sure I always have some on hand.</li>
            <li>It would not let me just tell my opinion without adding more words</li>
            <li>Arrived just when I needed it most.</li>

            <li>/&gt;And how many of us TRULY disinfected our razors in alcohol *</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it</li>
            <li>Better in my Pocket than theirs</li>
            <li>I saw that I could buy in bulk, which was a better deal.</li>
            <li>the best razor there is, then add in the C&amp;R and it only gets better.</li>
            <li>more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>Everything was packaged in the air cushion package material to keep safe.</li>
            <li>Gotta love Braun :)</li>
            <li>Everytime I went to purchase more of the cleaning product at the stores they never had it or they were sold out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
            <li>I found these online at a better price (for purchasing 4 at a time)</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it comes in bundles, can&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
            <li>Price is better than going to the store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Braun for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure its cheaper than what you would pay in a store</li>
            <li>Love that they sell these in bulk</li>
            <li>This saves even more on cost without sacrificing the life.</li>
            <li>These seem to have more solution in them than the ones I used to get.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>After cleaning the razor seems to give much better shaves.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great price</li>
            <li>this reminds me I better shave</li>
            <li>I will re-order when I need more with no problems.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s as I expected-I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this product when needed because I can tell that my shaver works better after it is cleaned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there are better cleaning systems, so  </li>
            <li>Went from using a safety razor all of my 72 years to the Braun and it works even better.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Nothing more.</li>
            <li>Just pull off the top and slide it in the docking station</li>

            <li>It provides a significant benefit that I feel is worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Also, the shaver is one of the best rated, I believe, partly due to</li>

            <li>The products work fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Short: I liked the packaging, Braun was able to give me 4 refills that matched my machine shaver well and started to clean it fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and indeed frustration free.</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>Product works fine</li>
            <li>This cleaning solution refill does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>WORKS FINE</li>
            <li>and they are fine.  </li>
            <li>Its fine.</li>

            <li>Just fine cleaner.  </li>
            <li>these things work just fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the cleaning system super often, but when I do it sure does make a difference.</li>
            <li>Super buy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps hubby&#x27;s shaver clean, so I don&#x27;t have to clean it!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s really pleased with the way they clean and keep his shaver clean.</li>
            <li>This solution works great at cleaning the razor, and we love the convenience of being able to buy them in bulk online so that we never run out and don&#x27;t have to go chasing them down at a store.</li>
            <li>If I clean the stubble out with some compressed air (not to high PSI), it&#x27;s good to go.  </li>
            <li>There was no problem with fit and the function seemed fine, but it seemed a bit off.</li>
            <li>First of all original that made in IRELAND much more better that this.</li>
            <li>Its kind of funny reviewing this as hey, it fits my braun shaver and keeps it clean.</li>
            <li>Good deal, no mess no fuss!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  </li>
            <li>cost of these, in my opinion, is worth the price for a smooth shave every time without any fuss of having to take the shaver apart to clean it, or having to remember to make sure to lubricate the blades as frequently - plus the lemon scent is a nice added bonus!</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to change out the Clean and Renew Cartridge without having to go out each month and buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost, but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see a huge difference in the closeness of the shave and almost zero skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Huge savings over store prices</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a huge savings buying off of Amazon</li>
            <li>Its filled with alcohol which evaporates.  </li>
            <li>The frustration free packaging is the way to go for price and storage.</li>

            <li>Easy to use cartridges for the Braun charge and clean.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pass it up with free shipping.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Braun shaver for a gazillion years now and I clean and charge it once a week.  </li>
            <li>This item is an OEM product and is designed to swap out the fluids in your Clean &amp; Renew unit.  </li>
            <li>so I can keep my shaver clean.  </li>
            <li>I have already switched to a Panosic shaver from Amazon that you clean by rinsing it with water.</li>
            <li>They clean my razor and lubricate just as intended.</li>
            <li>I tested it by not shaving for three days and then shaved and stuck it on auto clean.  </li>
            <li>Also, you&#x27;d have to clean the gunk out of the package.</li>
            <li>But he absolutely loves it and feels so smooth and sexy afterwards.</li>
            <li>I thought these clean &amp; renew cartridges were just a scam to generate a revenue stream from their customers.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my razor clean and go through these quite often.</li>
            <li>The Braun Clean cartridges contain lubricants that keep blades from rusting.</li>

            <li>I like it because I always feel like my shaver is clean.</li>

            <li>The Braun Clean and Renew system is a boon.</li>
            <li>Does the job, but I would not run it after every shave, everytime you charge would be sufficient to clean it</li>
            <li>This Braun Series 7 electric razor system is the easiest to keep clean.</li>
            <li>We have been buying and over paying for this Braun Clean &amp; Renew from Target and Walmart for about 10 years now.  </li>
            <li>While I know it is an inconvenience to clean the razor</li>
            <li>Worked in my Braun 7526 clean and charge stand.</li>

            <li>I bought this product to help clean my electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I am supposed to write something about Braun Clean and renew cartridges.</li>
            <li>The light lemon smell and the clean shave each time makes this worth every penny and they are worth it!</li>
            <li>The first one was not their top of the line, the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and gets to all the right spots.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using the 1st cartridge (which is still FULL and looks clean).</li>
            <li>So if you have a Braun clean and rinse cartridge shaver you&#x27;d be very smart to purchase them in the four count box from Amazon!</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>the price is right!</li>
            <li>price is right!</li>
            <li>Also warms the blades right before you shave!</li>
            <li>This cleaning fluid makes your shaver clean and smells good.</li>
            <li>These last quite a while and do a good job keeping the shaver lubricated and clean</li>

            <li>keep my razor clean, bacteria free, lubricated and lemon fresh..</li>
            <li>As expected, great price, will probably order again.</li>
            <li>Great  just what I expected</li>
            <li>Product was delivered as expected and words great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d consider a generic option if there was one, to see if there was a difference, but until I find one, I&#x27;m pretty happy with these</li>
            <li>Brown box, four cartridges, all full.</li>
            <li>The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>Nothing more, thanks.</li>
            <li>Those drain quite fast if you don&#x27;t close the lid on the top</li>
            <li>About a year ago, this changed so that each cartridge was only good for just over a month.</li>
            <li>Good, the only one to buy for your braun!!</li>
            <li>Sweet deal on this razor cleaner.</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff, just like you would buy at well-known stores for a greater price.</li>
            <li>I just have too many of them now, haha</li>
            <li>Product was received undamaged, all cartridges were sealed and completely full.  </li>
            <li>This way most of the hairs are cleaned out in the sink, and these cartridges don&#x27;t collect much of anything (just use them for the cleaning/sanitizing).</li>
            <li>Standard product, good price.</li>
            <li>I found this helped get more life out of the cartridge since you don&#x27;t lose as much alcohol to evaporation.  </li>
            <li>A really good deal of you subscribe, which gives you the added benefit of not having to go hunting for them when you realize you have none left.  </li>
            <li>Good packing and my shaver is back with fragrance..</li>
            <li>good price compared to local stores</li>
            <li>At the moment, I don&#x27;t really think there&#x27;s too many problems that I can notice.</li>
            <li>Though one can do it yourself with some Rubbing Alcohol, and scent/lubricant packs, the price is fair enough.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good deal.</li>
            <li>I was able to get these much cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li>Now only if Braun could make their cutter blocks good again...</li>
            <li>but I love my braun too much to experiment.</li>
            <li>These will last me a couple of years probably and the price was good for 4.</li>
            <li>The fluid does a good job cleaning the razor.</li>
            <li>Nicely packed in a group of 4 in a small box that will be good for storage.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Compared to the price of cutter / screen, this is not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>I knocked one star off for value but in the bulk pack its not a bad deal delivered.</li>
            <li>A package of four lasts me about six months, so that&#x27;s not a bad cost.</li>
            <li>Not a bad value for this quantity.</li>
            <li>have not had to use yet but is just like the one that came with the new shaver braun series 7-790cc which works great so far</li>
            <li>Pleasant non offensive odor, feels fresh next use.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Packaging is nice and easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Something doesn&#x27;t fit right it liks when working.</li>
            <li>The genuine article at the right price point.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for me, I find I get a much better shave when I clean more regularly.</li>
            <li>They clean my shaver very well----just the ticket!!</li>
            <li>I clean my shaver after every use--I mostly run an ecco or normal cleaning--and one cartridge lasts me about 1 month when I use it 4 times a week.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the purchase of the Braun Clean &amp; Renew refill cartridges and would definitely recommend them!!</li>
            <li>Does a great job cleaning the razor and keeping the blades sharp.  </li>
            <li>Other than the price these are work great and saves you time.</li>
            <li>Yes it costs money to refill, but it cleans it a lot better than a water rinse....feels brand new!</li>
            <li>The first time was fine, that&#x27;s why I ordered 2 4pack.</li>

            <li>Cleans well, they just seem to evaporate quickly..  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Buying them in bulk this way is also definitely the way to go, as they can get a bit pricey, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve gotten a better shave from an electric, and if these help keep my razor in tip-top shape then all the better.</li>
            <li>The product is the original provided by Braun, it contains 4 refills, rather than the two found in a store, the price is right, and it is delivered to your door.  </li>

            <li>When the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; light comes on the first time, I ignore it.</li>
            <li>cheap and exactly what i want.</li>

            <li>Cheap and economical -- the labels are different from the original ones I had purchased, but they look authentic, and do the job just as well as those.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t and just use water to clean it, the shaver cassette blades deteriorate very fast.</li>
            <li>And after using it the first time, I can say it is WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>only thing I&#x27;d give as a suggestion is:  Don&#x27;t go more than about 2 weeks to a month before changing out the cleaning solution!</li>

            <li>Nice smelling cleaning fluid - seems to work well.</li>
            <li>worth the effort to replace when its time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It is definitely an easy way to clean the shaver completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps to keep my razor clean and in good working order and cost a lot less that if purchased in the store.</li>

            <li>It cleans, lubricates and even adds a fresh lime smell to the cassette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Well worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I was tempted to make my own cleaning solution but found this 4 pack priced below what 3 would cost me locally.</li>
            <li>But totally worth it.</li>
            <li>so this was totally worth the money</li>
            <li>A LOT OF FUN,</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying the four pack.</li>
            <li>Useful.</li>
            <li>Cleans the shaver nicely and dries before the next day.  </li>
            <li>Amazon used to send more cartridges in each order, but I&#x27;ve been too busy to do a cost per unit.  </li>
            <li>I like the fresh smell.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money you spend for this product when you have the choice to renew it every couple of months.</li>
            <li>I keep an Braun in my glovebox for really busy days - and love it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth paying for.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s economical.</li>
            <li>Gives it that fresh smell already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I replaced my old one.</li>
            <li>The time I saved searching for cartridge refills is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the price  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that this solution leaves a residue.</li>
            <li>The added expense is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>These are some generic kind, but still cleans well.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Cleans my shaver and leave it smelling lemony fresh.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my razor fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used two since Fathers Day, for what&#x27;s that&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Ive had one cartridge for 4 months and still using it.that said the BRAUN cleaning cartridge is well worth getting.</li>
            <li>While the shave isn&#x27;t as close as premium blades, the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now the price of the cleaner has increased and the useful life has diminished by 25% to 50%.  </li>
            <li>Both my teenage son and my husband each own the Braun shaver</li>
            <li>I like having a fresh razor for every shave and this system does that.  </li>
            <li>The multi pack is really useful in keeping up with the demand of the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth to buy</li>
            <li>Braun designed a useful shaver stand that also cleans the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Now I am paying for 2 or 3 yrs worth of shaver cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Cleans my braun razor well and leaves it smelling lemony fresh.</li>
            <li>Smells nice when it starts to run low</li>
            <li>so I would say it is a success.</li>
            <li>I clearly purchased too many.</li>
            <li>Cleans razor automatically and leaves a fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Nice lemon scent and last for about 6 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>yes, make it easy to clean his new Braun shaver and he will continue to be very desirable to smooch on&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>unbelievable deal, great product and super service one</li>
            <li>So this germ-killing product (water, alcohol, some lubricant for the blades, and lemon smell mostly) really works and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Solution: prime shipping ;-)</li>
            <li>Good way to keep shaver clean with little effort.</li>
            <li>i have a older shaver still works fine.</li>
            <li>I do love my Braun shaver and this cleaner definitely keeps it clean, lubricated and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and quickly provided</li>
            <li>I got them quickly, on time, and exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>And, of course, you need a supply of cartridge refills to be able to clean your razor fully and properly.  </li>
            <li>Works very well with the shaving system and leaves a clean fresh smell when it&#x27;s done.  </li>
            <li>I find that I clean my razor more regularly,</li>
            <li>I clean my shaver once a week, thus allowing the cartridges to last many months.</li>
            <li>They leave the razor clean, fresh smelling, and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Since I travel a lot, I can only clean my razer when I am home, which means weeks and sometimes months go by without being able to take advantage of it.</li>
            <li>Not something I&#x27;m ever going to love, these things are a necessary purchase to keep your Braun shaver clean.</li>
            <li>By doing this, I have extended the use of one refill to more then double the life span of leaving the refill in the Clean &amp; Renew System.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my razor as good as any other braun cleaner</li>
            <li>Good value compared to other sources</li>
            <li>Gotta buy them on line, price is right.</li>
            <li>This I have on automatic order and it ships right on time.  </li>
            <li>I have been geting thjis product for years and the price is right</li>
            <li>These are priced right</li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>If I can&#x27;t smell the freshness right away when I unseal it again</li>
            <li>If you do your shopping right, sometimes you can buy two at a time in bulk, for cheaper than the bundle</li>
            <li>right when I&#x27;m about to run out.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a knockoff brand, but Braun is listed right on the cartridge.</li>
            <li>I felt that the price was right for my Braun refill cleaning solution</li>
            <li>Something didn&#x27;t seem quite right about these cartridges.  </li>
            <li>The four pack seems the right balance between cost and quantity discount.</li>
            <li>Just the right number of refills if you need to buy them online.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right as soon as I used it, my machine did not have any problems detecting this product and started cleaning my shaver.</li>
            <li>Plus they ship them right to your home.</li>
            <li>The price was right and was easier then going to the store to buy two at a time.</li>
            <li>But the price is right, so I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>The Braun refills slip right into the razor cleaning device just like they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell it provides to the razor, seems to keep the razor in new like condition!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to insert a new cleaner.</li>
            <li>These packs are no frustration and easy to pop a new one in.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quick to change and no mess.</li>
            <li>When I opened the first 4 pk box, I noticed one of the cartridge was about 25% filled and the color was very pal.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes his Braun shaver and the way this stuff keeps it clean.  </li>
            <li>The clean and renew cartridge fits my Braun razor cleaner very well.</li>
            <li>They clean my razor very well.  </li>
            <li>Clean razor fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to clean Braun Series 7-790 Pulsonic Shaver System.  </li>
            <li>The whole \\&quot;Clean &amp; Renew\\&quot; process is the biggest scam I have ever fallen for.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about the product, its what the clean and renew system requires.</li>
            <li>If the red light on the Clean &amp; Renew unit comes on too soon, clean the unit as recommended at the Braun website \\&quot;Troubleshooting.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say; the product does what it is supposed to: cleanly, effeciently, but at a somewhatslow pace.</li>
            <li>Decent price with free shipping</li>
            <li>the braun clean and renew refill really work, my braun shaver works like a charm</li>
            <li>Great Pricing, came exactly as explained in plain packaging rather than shelf packaging.</li>
            <li>This is a great price for three refills for the Braun--easy to use and takes up very little space on a shelf.</li>
            <li>Package came in a frustration free box which was easy to open and sealed with no way of accidentally opening.</li>
            <li>packaging was easy to open and light.</li>
            <li>Buying through Amazon give me a great price, the ability to buy in quantity, and saves me from having to drive around to shop..something I do not enjoy!</li>
            <li>My only rant, and its not about this product, is that the charging light doesn&#x27;t go out on the shaver, a bright blue LED, which is distracting at night.</li>
            <li>But now, with Braun&#x27;s clean and renew refills, you just pop the razor back into the stand, wait for the light to signal whether you should do a light or intense cleaning, press the button recommended, and walk away.  </li>
            <li>The shaver still needs ag good wiping down and brushing out every so often.</li>
            <li>The shaver continues to work like new with a comfortable shave without irritation of the skin.</li>
            <li>The price was right, and these were the exact model for my Braun 7 system.</li>
            <li>Then, using the brush, I clean the main shaver part.</li>
            <li>It is also great to have a refill handy instead of letting the shaver get dirty while getting one.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These things are cheap enough, its worth it to me to clean it every time.</li>
            <li>These are a lot more expensive in the stores, so it is a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>Very Nice as usual.  </li>
            <li>Does the job right , specially if more than one is  using her same shaver</li>
            <li>Items were exactly as described, arrived quickly and were priced very competitively.</li>
            <li>Nice product,keeps the razor clean, sharp and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>The solution helps prolonged the blade and the package make it so easy to replace and leave no mess.</li>
            <li>work well and very fast delivery</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Ships very fast.  </li>
            <li>Straight from the factory in a plain container, exactly what I needed and at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I mean realistically, these things are just moulded plastic and alcohol, and I can buy a whole lot more industrial alcohol than this for a lot cheaper, but the convenience of being able to pop one in when the light goes off is</li>
            <li>Not as good as the original, and does not last as long.</li>
            <li>I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on</li>
            <li>These fluid filled cartridges go with the Braun shaving system, which can automatically recharge and clean the razor after each shave.</li>
            <li>I did see how some guys make their own, but I don&#x27;t clean everyday</li>
            <li>Packaging is super easy to open.</li>
            <li>works as advertised, made by Braun and packed well, great value... hard to beat this purchase.</li>
            <li>Put the new one in and voila, clean razor.</li>
            <li>I faithfully clean my Braun 7000 with this and it continues to work as new.  </li>
            <li>Eventually had to buy new shave cartridge and decided skimping on the clean &amp; renew cartridges a mistake.</li>
            <li>When I pull the razor out of the cleaning station it always smells nine and clean and the foil block looks brand new.</li>
            <li>I clean the head after every shave to keep shaver operating like new.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of not having to manually clean my new shaver.</li>
            <li>Since I get new refills (auto-ship) every few months, I clean my Braun shaver fairly often.  </li>
            <li>These refills are easy to use: follow Braun&#x27;s instructions and the old one pops out and voila the new one is in quickly.</li>
            <li>starting to think this is by design to sell more product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like spending the extra money, but the shaver has provided a close shave for more than two years.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and ordered.</li>
            <li>FIrst I&#x27;d found them in a 4 pack...saves hassle and money this way</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is designed to do</li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li>Cartridges arrived exactly as shown, in Braun non-retail packaging.  </li>
            <li>They are in fact OEM refills and work exactly as anticipated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well and is designed exactly for the razor I have.  </li>
            <li>Fits nicely in the holder as expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described üòÄ</li>
            <li>They look and install just like the higher priced versions you buy from the store.</li>
            <li>; This Was The First Time This Has Ever Happened, To My Shaver</li>
            <li>The smell was much more like regular rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>These refills do exactly what they are supposed to do, as you can read in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li>I use to have many in grown hairs and irritation because of regular razors.</li>
            <li>Is exactly what I needed and cheaper than Walmart(without shipping)</li>
            <li>Cost more in the local store for fewer numbers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read where others are using the empty containers to make their own cleaning product.</li>
            <li>I just leave the the shaver in the cradle when I am not using it and run the clear when the light says too.</li>
            <li>Much better price than buying them individually at a local store.  </li>
            <li>They get the job done and the next time I use my razor, the shave is always better.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived and worked exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Only a better price</li>
            <li>I have purchased several times from amazon and have always been pleased</li>
            <li>was exactly what was need and save a lot of money than if I have bought it in the store to the tune of about 25%.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it supposed to</li>
            <li>Affordably priced, more so than local retail options.</li>
            <li>Still on the first one.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li>; on the first one you see.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same product I&#x27;ve bought many times at retail stores such as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, but at a much better price, nevermind the convenience of having it show up at my front door 2 days after hitting &#x27;Submit&#x27; on the order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>How can you love cleaning fluid for your electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I would also recommend taking the foil off and rinsing the blade and foil with water in the sink first.</li>
            <li>My Braun Series 7 790cc shaver seems to glide on my skin better following a cleaning with this product.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my hubby needed and cheaper then</li>
            <li>First of three must have had a defect.  </li>
            <li>and it fits my shaver exactly.</li>
            <li>The online ad with it, implied that the cleaner was included, which was not, so be aware</li>
            <li>I got the first generation Syncro shaver cleaning systems when they first came out.</li>
            <li>The second generation systems are intelligent enough to automatically decide how intense a cleanning session your shaver needs.</li>
            <li>Only electric shaver that I have been able to stay with.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what was wanted.</li>
            <li>Product as described; fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Mine actually lasted for many months.</li>
            <li>I have not used this since I ran out after I first got the razor.  </li>
            <li>Product is authentic and at a price lower than local stores.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>These cartridges did exactly what they promised to do.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a placebo, but after going back to the branded refills, my razor does seem to cut much better after being washed.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast!</li>
            <li>But this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a \\&quot;system\\&quot; that self-cleans the razor.</li>
            <li>but ok finally bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent price and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Thanks for the care that you put into this package!</li>
            <li>These cartridge are exactly what is required for the shaver.</li>
            <li>just more convenient to have on hand and not have to wait for local store to restock.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought the cartridge refill.</li>
            <li>did exactly what it was suppose to.</li>
            <li>Helps to make your daily shave experience better.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>If you are ordering this you already know exactly what you are getting in tems of the product.</li>
            <li>I pay more for a 2 pack locally.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The cause was more than likely my electric razor.  </li>
            <li>and I will definitely get more when they run out.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>My son bought his first one.</li>
            <li>Each refill is lasting more than 2 months.</li>
            <li>It is my second order, love it.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s often pricier to buy the higher count packs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one slipped in to the cleaning system just as described and started working as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Braun cleaning system since it came out, and it&#x27;s never failed.  </li>
            <li>Quality product and fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my wife bought the Braun razor with the self cleaning station for me last year for Fathers Day.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T try knockoff refill solutions, they will cause problems and are nowhere near the quality of this genuine Braun cleaner.</li>
            <li>I love the Braun 790 shaver and this cleaning cartridge makes life simple.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first group from Braun.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as pictured on the box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what i had when i bought the product.</li>
            <li>Also I love the cleaning fluid it uses.</li>
            <li>(glad the shipping boxes are now much smaller!  </li>
            <li>Product is excellent, but rather expensive.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so I am still on my first cartridge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more before running out of this cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>I have two Braun shavers that use these cartridges (8000 and 7000 series), and I&#x27;m glad the same refills work for both.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>WE love the cleaning system and we have these extra for when we need to change.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have been using it regularly and have found that it cleans and lubricates my shaver better than anything else I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have to extend the life of the cartridges, is to pull out the cartridge and close it between uses for the first couple of months.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this shaving system to anyone who wants a great shave everyday!</li>
            <li>I purchased my first electric shaver the Braun Series 7 799-6c and needed spare cartridges.  </li>
            <li>First time have decided to get replacement containers...</li>
            <li>Get a much better price buying these off Amazon than at the local stores.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Braun!</li>
            <li>Will buy more and regularly</li>
            <li>splashes out of cartridge holder when first put in</li>
            <li>I do replace them on the first of every month and recommend the suscribe and save feature here.  </li>
            <li>Problem solved, thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>They are good but we have trouble with the Braun System.  </li>
            <li>is they are not in a braun box and the lable is not the same other wise they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>Very good, but about one in four arrives with considerably less fluid than it should have.</li>
            <li>I compared with original braun clean and renewal, they weren&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>The cartridge is easy to use and effective, it just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Use the plug from the new one to plug the old one just to make sure there is no spillage.</li>
            <li>Far cheaper than even Wal-Mart, not to mention the Prime Shipping makes it easy to get fast.</li>
            <li>I subscribed to the refill program and it works great because he usually forgets he needs the refills until they are all gone!</li>
            <li>My hypothesis: Clean razor when the amber light is on and you will go through these pretty fast but the cutter and foil should last longer.</li>
            <li>Price was right, shipment was fast and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>It must be used very often and the price is right</li>
            <li>I will clean off the blade and foil first with an old toothbrush and then put it in the holder to go through a cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing more than alcolhol with a little lubricant and cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li>has kept it nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>I realized how nice the self cleaning system is on the Braun shavers when i looked at the bottom of my old empty cartridge and it was full of hair.</li>
            <li>Was surprised these 4 cartridges were NOT delivered in the original factory packaging.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband for Christmas and now am stuck with them since they are not returnable due to the fact that they are hazardous materials.  </li>
            <li>Is the original Braun replacements but much cheaper than I can find where I live.</li>
            <li>in this way you can make your refills last significantly longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li>once I ran out a new order came in, It really keeps my razor clean</li>
            <li>kind of wish there were a way to refill these - throwing the whole thing away when it&#x27;s spent</li>
            <li>My old Synchro system uses these cartridges to clean and charge my 78</li>
            <li>By purchasing this quantity, I don&#x27;t have to place frequent reorders and the cartridges keep the shaver clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Syncro shaver system for quite some time, and have always used the Clean &amp; Renew refills to keep my shaver clean, lubricated, and ready to go for the next shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to remove the product from the Clean &amp; Renew System as soon as cleaning cycle is complete, recap it and save the product from evaporating.  </li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard and it really gives me a good shave.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and clean your Braun razor regularly, you know how quickly you run out of cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>I cant believe how much I got for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li>I refilled my last cartridge with straight alcohol and used it many times with no problems.</li>
            <li>My son uses his shaver daily and these keep things nice and clean for long term performance.</li>
            <li>I love purchasing these little packets to keep my Braun Contour shaver clean and maintenance-free.</li>
            <li>It does a fine job of cleaning the razor after each use and seems to make the blade last a little longer and is definitely a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I like that these keep my shaver very clean and ready to go for the next shave.  </li>
            <li>I love Braun products anyway, so I&#x27;m not surprised at all to find the cost so affordable.</li>
            <li>I replace these pretty much quarterly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to make my own solution, but it&#x27;s hard to clean out the plastic container.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have ever used that has given me a shave almost as close as a straight shave, without irritation.</li>
            <li>pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long.</li>
            <li>I found this to be the answer to my problem of having to slook for more and to save a lot in the long run.</li>
            <li>and you pretty much have to use it if you want to keep your shaver lubricated.</li>
            <li>Easy to order keeps my shaver clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Works as expected - Glad to be able to still buy them because no place locally carries this product.</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution works better than water and lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, if you own a Braun shaver, which give a great shave, you need this cleaner fluid.</li>
            <li>Also, this cartridge works for pretty much all Braun shavers (read the description for compatibility).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of trying to make your own.</li>
            <li>The running costs on this shaver are a little high but the cleaner seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Refills fit my device and clean the shaver as expected.</li>
            <li>The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is.</li>
            <li>This fluid allows a braun self cleaning razor to stay both clean and lubricated so your shave is great until the blade goes dull.</li>
            <li>I really like it because it is easy to remove the old cartridge and insert the new one.</li>
            <li>They are identical to the cartridges I normally buy in my drug store but this package of four cost only slightly more than a two-pack of the cartridges I&#x27;ve been buying there.  </li>
            <li>so it evaporates very quickly because of the larger exposed surface</li>
            <li>The cartridges arrived in a cardboard shipping box which was easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Easy open packaging.</li>
            <li>Overall - an easy choice.</li>
            <li>Well, first off the lemon oil helps lubricate the blades so that they are comfortable on your face &amp; help them last longer.  </li>
            <li>No moving parts, simple construction, easy to install.</li>
            <li>These cartridge refills will last you a good long time.</li>
            <li>The quality doesn&#x27;t look the same as the original one that I received with the shaver, but still good enough for regular cleaning.</li>
            <li>Maybe its the way certain Braun models are made?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that, it&#x27;s a smart product, by all means..</li>
            <li>I cover mine with plastic when not in use (and unplug the unit, since a certain amount of heat is generated while it is plugged in).  </li>
            <li>People whine about cleaning cartridges for Braun razors but they really enhance the shave and are pretty cheap when you consider that you only buy one blade cassette a year.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to mess around trying to refill a container with my own formula</li>
            <li>Not so sure about the frustration free part as the solution doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Great buy at almost half the cost of purchasing individually.</li>
            <li>The box is easy to open, and they are the real deal</li>
            <li>No complaints as they are easy to swap out and last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>The frustration free packaging is an easily opened cardboard box just big enough to hold 4 cartridges yet strong enough to hold the bulky cartridges.  </li>
            <li>i believe it was a japanese braun packaging, but works fine for my 3 series braun shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well stocked for months to come with this fluid for this fine razor.</li>
            <li>Only started using one of them, but they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>I hope and trust that Amazon will continue its fine work well into the future.</li>
            <li>I believe that these were originally made for European sales, but none-the-less, work as exact replacements for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Second refill just fine.</li>
            <li>I love buying these in bulk as I seen to go through them quickly and am always forgetting to buy news ones when the old ones are spent.</li>
            <li>Nice way to save a little bit of money (and a trip to a store).</li>
            <li>Having a subscription is a nice way to save a little money on them.</li>
            <li>What can you say these clean and renew cartridges usually go for more money in stores</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is the odor is a little more &amp;#34;bleach-ish&amp;#34; for lack of a better term, than the solution that I bought from the store.</li>
            <li>The cartridges seem to keep the razor clean and have a slight lemon smell that i enjoy</li>
            <li>these are genuine factory cartridges and at a price delivered to my door much cheaper than I can get locally.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and quality product.</li>
            <li>Once I changed it, the light turned blue and all was well again.  </li>
            <li>Just goes to show how much we pay for in packaging for the stores.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get much easier then that.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These are much cheaper than buying through Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, Recommended.</li>
            <li>These are genuine refills of the same quality you get in stores.</li>
            <li>This is a very sanitary shaving system.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Everything was very well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning)</li>
            <li>I know that some people try to refill these with alcohol because of the expense, but really, why bother when you can get a 4-pack at these prices?</li>
            <li>works reasonably well</li>
            <li>and this product does it very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My husband is very perfectionistic and likes to do everything according to the book.</li>
            <li>These came in Braun cardboard packaging - and really saved me money.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well</li>
            <li>And The Whole Cartridge Emptied Out, Meaning It Sucked Up</li>
            <li>So I Cleaned The Whole Device</li>
            <li>Just replace the whole unit.  </li>
            <li>There are ways to refill them, but this is much easier.</li>
            <li>packaged very well too.</li>
            <li>lot of hair builds up in the bottom and because really dirt once used up.  </li>
            <li>These are an absolute must</li>
            <li>but there really isn&#x27;t an alternative.</li>
            <li>Not too much to comment on this product, it does the job.</li>
            <li>But is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li>God bless you all so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>THAT MUCH EASIER.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The razor gets so much cleaner then when he uses a brush alone.</li>
            <li>They were also much cheaper than purchasing them at a retail store.</li>
            <li>a real bargain by buying 4 at a time</li>
            <li>fast service would buy again</li>
            <li>I really like having things I can&#x27;t find around town on Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save option.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>If you have a Braun shaver that takes this cleaning cartridge you really don&#x27;t have a choice.</li>
            <li>Just wish the shaving system would cap these so they don&#x27;t evaporate so fast.</li>
            <li>Each person cleans their shaver depending on how much they care of cleanliness of their shaver.</li>
            <li>Wish they made a refill though to reduce producing so much trash and lower the cost.</li>
            <li>BestBuy.com sells it for the same price with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I wish they would not evaporate so fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The stuff works but the whole &amp;#34;Braun Shaver&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Fast delivery...</li>
            <li>The convenience of not having to search for these cleaning refills coupled with a very competitive price make for a slam dunk when you consider it delivered to your door.</li>
            <li>I really should just use the subscription function and be done with it.</li>
            <li>and I noted prices varying as much a $4 per cartridge.  </li>
            <li>Cleans my braun very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but it does.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain about the renewal price, very competitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really preserves the function.</li>
            <li>We have two razors that use these in the house so a four pack is not too much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;m finished with these cartridges in gonna start straight edge shaving.</li>
            <li>I really like my Braun and the close shave it gets.</li>
            <li>Worth the expense as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>I do not like leaving the whole unit out</li>
            <li>I wish they had bigger packs available</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really have a choice but to use them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!   </li>
            <li>So, I would say don&#x27;t scrimp on the cost, go for the best with this product and you will never be unhappy.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to order this in bulk - this is just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real Braun cartridge replacements.  </li>
            <li>VERY MUCHÔºÅIT HAD GIVEN Me</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>They fit the cleaner properly.</li>
            <li>I really like to use this cleaning &amp; renewing solution from Braun for my shaver.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Much easier to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>It was very convenient.</li>
            <li>Very efficient cleaning system.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pricey but what options do you really have?</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and work well</li>
            <li>The frustration free packaging probably wasn&#x27;t necessary...</li>
            <li>Threw the whole thing in the recycle bin and bought a Norelco</li>
            <li>Keeping the blades away from water really helps.</li>
            <li>I like the automatic cleaning feature that these cartridges are utilized for; the shavers are cleaned very well.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal and very affordable</li>
            <li>I can make it almost a whole year with that method utilizing these four.</li>
            <li>I really like this system.</li>
            <li>It really does work by cleaning and sanitizing your razor.</li>
            <li>The refills are very convenient.  </li>
            <li>packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>Retail, I have paid as much as $16 for one refill cartridge for my Braun razor.</li>
            <li>By cleaning once every week or so, the cleaning cartridge lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>Real Braun stuff here.</li>
            <li>What is there really to say?  </li>
            <li>A smooth shave and no facial irritation.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>the exact solution sold by Braun, so it works exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Easier than making own solution, and roughly the same price when bought in the 4 pack</li>
            <li>The alcohol based cleaning system works really well.</li>
            <li>The price of this pack is reasonable compare with offline shops.</li>
            <li>They work very well for my razor</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this system with his Braun shaver</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a real Braun product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, cheap, and cleans the razor well.</li>
            <li>These are the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>The only thing I will mention is that this is composed primarily of alcohol and it does evaporate.  </li>
            <li>the shave would be much word..</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>These refills save you money over the brick &amp; mortar stores, and the fact that it&#x27;s a 4-pack makes it real convenient too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also come to the realization that there&#x27;s no advantage to buying these cartridges in bulk, especially considering Amazon&#x27;s free shipping.</li>
            <li>Never realized how helpful and important such a cleaning tool could be.  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really a time and money saver.</li>
            <li>and it really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>The system as a whole works really well to extend the life of the screen and blade.</li>
            <li>He loves it and this cleaning system allows for all the blades to be cleaned and ready to go again and again.  </li>
            <li>Fast, reliable, and the cheapest anywhere...packaged for wholesale - no frills</li>
            <li>They shipped them fast and we received them within 3-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The problem I really have is that it evaporates fast .</li>
            <li>Cleans very well.</li>
            <li>looks, feels and smells like the real mccoy</li>
            <li>This way it does not evaporate as much.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>They seemed very competitive.</li>
            <li>but they really aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, the daily cleaning makes for a smooth shave every morning.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It is very helpful to order what we need and have it delivered as opposed to driving seventy miles and coming home empty-handed.</li>
            <li>But then I noticed my shaves were no longer very close.</li>
            <li>but I think my shaves are now closer with the real thing.</li>
            <li>Not much to say  because I have used these shaver refills for many years</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a very convenient item that does the job of cleaning and prolonging the life of your Braun razor&#x27;s blades and screen.</li>
            <li>The liquid is essentially denatured alcohol, readily available in hardware stores.</li>
            <li>The 4 pack is much cheaper than the 2 pack that I have found in stores.</li>
            <li>The self-cleaning system really keeps the shaver working well.  </li>
            <li>This product is very overpriced.  </li>
            <li>Each one lasts about five months, sometimes longer, although I don&#x27;t use them as much as Braun suggests I should.  </li>
            <li>but it still saves money over buying it retail and much easier since it comes to the house.  </li>
            <li>You really do have to have these if you have Braun Electric Razor with cleaning station,  Doubt</li>
            <li>It really does the job cleaning and lubricating the razor though</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say about these.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Product works as I expected, and the price for four of these is way better than you can get in the supermarket.</li>
            <li>Have two different series of Braun razors they fit in.</li>
            <li>The packing is definitely frustration free.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast Amazon shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Came packed well and in reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than  buying in store.</li>
            <li>I pleased that Braun hasn&#x27;t changed the style of their cleaner cartridges as I still had 1 left over from my old Series 3.</li>
            <li>Good shaver, good cleaning solution for the shaver&#x27;s base..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will keep using these as long as I own a Braun Shaver, hopefully the price will go down some day which would encourage me to use the cleaning system more frequently.</li>
            <li>I do a full clean every other day, and one container lasts me over 2 months.</li>
            <li>When I first began using these cartridges with my Braun Shaver, each lasted about two months, used about every four days tor cleaning, before evaporation of the solution led to a red light that  indicated the need for a new cartridge. .</li>
            <li>Works as expected, the right fit and function.</li>
            <li>The cartridges I received are exactly the same as the as the original, however when you order be sure to scroll down and look closely at the $$ price/quantity/supplier differences and do the math.  </li>
            <li>him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new frustration-free packaging is also nice and helps cuts down on waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just finished my first cartridge and installed the new one.  </li>
            <li>This is (as far as I know) the only way to clean the shaver, even so, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon has also packaged these in an easy-to-open box so that 1) it accommodates one extra cleaning cartridge and 2) so that the box is super easy to open.</li>
            <li>I appreciate finding this in large bulk and for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>I had some older razors that didn&#x27;t have the built in cleaning like the Braun does and there is a huge difference to their performance over even a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>Make shaving very confortable, keeps razor clean and the cutter assembly stays sharper and last longer.</li>
            <li>He just has to put his Braun razor in the holder and walk away, the next day the razor is clean and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>This fluid always makes my shaver feel clean and ready to do its job.  </li>
            <li>The cardboard is obviously recyclable or reusable, and very easy to open.</li>
            <li>, it is original product just Chinese writing.</li>
            <li>In the picture the containers look blue like the original renewal containers that come with the shaver.</li>
            <li>I remove the cartridge following every cleaning, and replace the cap that originally came with it.</li>
            <li>The original cartridges contain a scented blue alcohol-based solution.</li>
            <li>I will not discuss other indulgences in this review.  :-)</li>
            <li>This is an original product and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper per unit buying the 4 pack on Amazon than the individual unit cost, even at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>I will update later if I notice any significant changes.</li>
            <li>Even if you clean only once-a-week instead of daily, these cartridges will help your Braun look, feel, and even smell as fresh as the day you bought it!  </li>
            <li>The fluid in these cartridges clean, oil and refresh my razor every time.  </li>
            <li>If you search around on Amazon, you will find the price per unit generally drops more if you order in larger quantities.</li>
            <li>I believe one reason is because it&#x27;s always clean and properly lubricated by using these Renew Cartridges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never once thought it wasn&#x27;t clean enough after running it through a cycle.</li>
            <li>One of these lasts me 6 months; I only clean when battery is low...15 years &amp; counting.</li>
            <li>This fluid keeps my razor clean and running well.  </li>
            <li>The Braun clean and renew cartridge made a big difference on my shaver.</li>
            <li>I used to clean weekly but switched to daily to help control acne, it worked.  </li>
            <li>I clean my razor just once a week and that seems to be enough, so the 4-pack lasts almost two years.</li>
            <li>My husband has had shaver for several years now and can attribute longevity to Braun Clean.</li>
            <li>They are made for the Braun Clean &amp; Charge device which comes with several Braun shaver models and work as advertised.</li>
            <li>I tried using just alcohol, but the filter at the bottom that strains your hair does clog, and is never the same after you try to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep your razor clean and functioning properly.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can get these in just about any size you need depending on how often you use and clean your razor and can set it up on regular shipments and save 5%.</li>
            <li>I have tried the low priced replacement cleaner and they didn&#x27;t leave my shaver looking a clean as the Braun&#x27;s cleaner does.</li>
            <li>Another way to make it last longer is not to clean your shaver after every use, but rather just once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>Protect your pricey investment and keep your beard away by allowing clean blades to do the job properly.</li>
            <li>I only clean when I charge the battery, about once every 1 - 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Lasts 6+ months for me because I alternate with a DE safety razor but clean the Braun after every use.</li>
            <li>I only clean my razor once a week, so I keep the cartridge sealed when not in use.  </li>
            <li>These are the same clean and renew cartridges as the one that came with my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>If you want to save money take it out after each clean and put the lid back on so it dont evaporate.</li>
            <li>If you like to keep your Braun clean, this is essential.</li>
            <li>daily clean with a brush</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to keep your shaver clean.</li>
            <li>Occasionally, I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>The System 7 cleaning system works well for me as I often forgot to clean and oil the shavers regularly.</li>
            <li>My husband like this because it keeps reminding him to clean his razor on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>One cartridge probably last 2 to 3 weeks depending on how often you activate the clean cycle.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t open up the cartridges to clean them out.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY product I use to clean my BRAUN Series 7 shaver.  </li>
            <li>The only way to keep the razor working right!</li>
            <li>These clean my husband&#x27;s Braun Series 5 Razor with a clean and renew base very nicely.</li>
            <li>Packaging looks the same as what you can get at the store for retail prices but some how the actual contents &amp;#34;the blue liquid&amp;#34; inside the plastic cartridge does not last or clean as good as what you can get at a store.</li>
            <li>This is smart buy to keep your Braun shaver like new.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system works well, but is pretty loud.  </li>
            <li>First, I brush out the stubble with an old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s alcohol based cleaner and will evaporate I remove the cartridge and recap it usually daily, and my cartridge of 2 months is still mostly full.  </li>
            <li>These cartridges can be very expensive and this plain-boxed set is the best bang for you buck.</li>
            <li>I am going to try to make my own brew in the near future to see if I get the same results.  </li>
            <li>So far I am on my first cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just the right size for me, keeping an extra on hand always so as to never be caught without then that yellow warning light tells me I&#x27;ll need a replacement in a couple days.  </li>
            <li>One trick I learned is that if you clean the razor every one  or two uses with the brush that is provided these cartridges will last up to twice as long as they would if you don&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li>You should always have a supply of new cartridges on hand!</li>
            <li>it was like having a new shaver!</li>
            <li>Cleans, renews and maintains your Braun like new!</li>
            <li>Can purchase large container of the same cleaner without buying complete set, just clean well and refill</li>
            <li>The shipping was amazingly fast and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;Not much to say about product; same stuff you can buy pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li>that the blades and foils last longer, and because of this, that I get a close, more comfortable shave, even when I&#x27;m tackling a long weekend&#x27;s growth following a bout of sloth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This a very good product which is very easy to use, just open unseal, place at the base of the shaver,&lt;br /&gt;when</li>
            <li>so you have a new one ready when it runs out.</li>
            <li>My Braun Razor is about 12 years old now, and I&#x27;m just really happy they&#x27;re still providing these and haven&#x27;t change their basic auto-cleaner design every few years  just to get you to have to buy new ones.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; woks as expected.</li>
            <li>Works as expected and was easy to purchase.</li>
            <li>They install easily and can be put in the recycle bin when empty.</li>
            <li>The label still clearly stated in english Braun clean and refills so it didn&#x27;t matter too much with me.</li>
            <li>Came as advertised, works in my Braun cleaning system, decent price.</li>
            <li>older model shaver.</li>
            <li>These are a deal and super convenient when placed on instant reorder.</li>
            <li>Considering these units are not refillable, the price seems to be OK and they do seem to last for 30 days if used on the razor on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has cleansed and lubricated both my Braun (significantly older model) shavers.  </li>
            <li>I am glad the refill cartridges are the same for the second generation systems.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a need to clean it everyday, but even if you don&#x27;t use it, the cleaning solution evaporates quickly, so I take the cartridge out between cleanings and replace the cap.</li>
            <li>But a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>This particular cleaner is a must for keeping your Braun shaver working well.</li>
            <li>I finally found this at a better price than I could have at the local wal mart.</li>
            <li>They are the same Barun cleaning cartridges that I have bought for years but at a better price than I can get in a local store.  </li>
            <li>The 4 pack is suffices for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>After my older model braun died, I purchased a Norelco with 3 spinning heads.  </li>
            <li>Lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for this item which is critical to keeping my razor in top shape.</li>
            <li>I had an older model, high end, bit not close in the nature of the shave.</li>
            <li>Keep the tight fitting cap instead of discarding it when the product is opened.  </li>
            <li>I like this, I will highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend both the electric razor and the refills.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have a Series 7 shaver.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I do think US$5 each is high, but it is often the lowest price here.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>As always high quality purchase.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for someone that has the Braun Shavers.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I needed the cartridges for my Braun unit but did not like the high prices at the store</li>
            <li>Works as advertised but the price is too high.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended for any purchasing the Braun Pulsonic</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Consistently high quality, and shipped promptly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>The cartridges do just what they are designed to do as long as the Clean &amp; Renew Stand works.  </li>
            <li>No problem as long as we clean the razor every day.  </li>
            <li>Cartridges last a reasonable amount of time with daily use and are easy to replace.</li>
            <li>So what little money you save you lose on replacing the cartridge more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cost of 4 refills is little more than the price of a 2 pack at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>You need to keep the cutting blades clean for a good shave</li>
            <li>Keeps his shaver head clean, you can actually see all it cleans off when you remove the old refill</li>
            <li>Have been using these now for a few years and my electric shaver is always clean and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>They may be a bit pricey due to some peoples outlook on it, however I see them as well priced and buy them in a 4 pack which easily lasts a years time.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s definitely some merit to the whole concept though - after all you&#x27;re dragging metal across your face and causing abrasions, exactly the kind of situation where you&#x27;d very much want the surfaces involved to be sterilized, or at the very least cleaned with alcohol.  </li>
            <li>This way you aren&#x27;t running the head of the razor under water (this causes rusting, and makes the razor more inefficient and dull, unless you are willing to use lubricant to combat this problem).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  </li>
            <li>the machine works very well so far</li>
            <li>bought these and was surprised to see they were made to sell overseas for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal as these are unnecessarily expensive in stores.</li>
            <li>Although expensive this cleaner does a great job.</li>
            <li>This is a great value and you cannot go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It goes to prove that the old Gillette theory still works--sell the shaver at a reasonable cost but make the profits with replacement blades--in this case with an alcohol cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>I enjoy throwing the spent ones away and seeing all the junk in them that I know is not in my shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is now becoming more expensive to keep buying.</li>
            <li>Although it lasted that long, I don&#x27;t shave everyday so I would say it lasted a good month if compared to continuous use.</li>
            <li>I should be able to buy again in a few months.</li>
            <li>and if you cover the top except to use it, it will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li>Second, without the oil, it is pretty much just alcohol &amp;</li>
            <li>I run mine through when it is either needing a normal or intensive cleaning.</li>
            <li>Rare in today&#x27;s marketplace, this product actually performs as advertised and has extended the life and performance of my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>For me,these time savers are well worth the extra expense of purchasing the boxed, 4-cartridge refill set.  .</li>
            <li>When the next cartridge needs replacing, take the saved cartridge and top off the fill basin with the old fluid.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to close the saved cartridges real well to avoid excessive evaporation.</li>
            <li>Could be normal...  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system cut down on his breakouts and has really made a huge difference in his complexion.</li>
            <li>Always a great buy, and due to the price I always have lots of them in hand and am not afraid to throw one out when it gets dirty, which I believe helps and saves my expensive and excellent Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>Really like the fact that it works on my old razor (at the cabin) and new one (at home) as well.</li>
            <li>The prices at amazon were only cheaper than other online retailers by a miniscule amount, but that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I tried the Panasonic wet razors, but they weren&#x27;t up to my beard and were pretty much a pain to clean, too, especially if you used the creams they hawk with them.  </li>
            <li>The process to order cleaners was very simple and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I run my shaver through a cleaning cycle ~ once a week and put the cover right back on it when it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li>right after it has reached the low indicator.</li>
            <li>This is a simple way to keep a supply if these on hand; they arrived right here at my home.</li>
            <li>As for this product I do not necessarily use this product daily depends on how much against you think I will clean this may be once a week or halfway through the week.</li>
            <li>They do smell clean in a standard alcohol-sort-of-way, but if you really want the lemon scent and don&#x27;t mind paying extra for it, these aren&#x27;t the ones you want to buy.</li>
            <li>The best and least expensive thing to clean your razor with is... tap water.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what you need when you have to be clean shaven everyday.</li>
            <li>Although the product was standard and worked fine, all four must have been seconds, because each cartridge only lasted 2.5-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>frankly they are pointless, you can clean your shaver with water, this is just a gimmick to keep it smell fresh</li>
            <li>Original factory product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li>$20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China, filled with alcohol, coloring, and some other solvent.  </li>
            <li>These was an OEM part and performed as expected with no change in fragrance or volume as the original item.</li>
            <li>All I have done is buy a new shaving head once a year and replaced the cleaning cartridges as needed.</li>
            <li>I pulled out my husbands cartridge to change when I got the new refills</li>
            <li>I bought these refills along with the foil and cutter replacement pack for my husband, in trying not to buy a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li>his razor was brand new.  </li>
            <li>, the new box shows up.  </li>
            <li>the cleaning made the device like new.  </li>
            <li>Shaver feels like new after using the cleaner.</li>
            <li>It made my razor shave like new .</li>
            <li>Along with new foils and blades, the shaver is like new.</li>
            <li>already goes on when the new cartridge is installed..  </li>
            <li>With the purchase of a new model self-cleaner, the evaporation problem has, well, evaporated.  </li>
            <li>We hadn&#x27;t bought a refill for a while and we were thinking he needed a new razor.  </li>
            <li>Once he cleaned the razor in this solution, it was like new again.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your Braun like new.</li>
            <li>This is just what I needed for my new Braun Series 7 Razor.  </li>
            <li>It does work and cleans my Braun razor so that it is like new.</li>
            <li>BUT NOW this new razor does it all thank you</li>
            <li>This product keeps may shaver working like new.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for a shave like a new blade every time.</li>
            <li>There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  </li>
            <li>This cleaning process is something new for me, but I like it.  </li>
            <li>, received a new shaving head for my Braun shaved.</li>
            <li>It leaves the shaver with the &#x27;new&#x27; feel each morning when I use it.</li>
            <li>Every time I install a new one, it overflows &amp; almost 1/3 of the liquid gushes out.</li>
            <li>, they did not make any sort of issues and processed a new shipment at no cost to me.</li>
            <li>Now concerned they may not be NEW.  </li>
            <li>It makes the shaver seem brand new.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s electric razor performed and looked as though it was brand new.</li>
            <li>These are new cartridges not something that has been tampered with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like shaving with a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The solution strips the blades and foil of all gunk, oils and whiskers - it&#x27;s like a brand new razor</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li>If I get this new head for the razor</li>
            <li>I stayed with this one when I needed a new razor.</li>
            <li>I purchased a new electric shaver and soon found I could not find these cartridges anywhere except Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was buying new foil/cutter and just grabbed these too.</li>
            <li>Make the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li>I decided to pay the price for a new cartridge to see if it made a difference.</li>
            <li>my shaver feels new and refreshed</li>
            <li>The picture shows the new lemon scent.</li>
            <li>Liquid appeared new, so I used them, no problem, but I think this was a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li>It keeps the razor feeling and working ike new.</li>
            <li>Good price for an item hard to find locally.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say about these, but they keep my shaver clean.  </li>
            <li>They dry up to quick sometimes.</li>
            <li>I simply put in the cartridge about once a week when I do a full clean and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>This thing does a nice job of cleaning my razor but the price is beyond ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>Started using this around May 14th, it is now July 8th and the light on my Braun just went to the yellow low state.</li>
            <li>I need these cartridges for my electric razor dock, and amazon had the lowest prices I found (online or in stores) for these particular items, so I, naturally, purchased them, here.</li>
            <li>Having a better price, not needing to go to Target and cut through the crazy packaging makes this a better alternative.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;m not told when the last one is put in the unit,so  ordering and getting them here so fast really helps.</li>
            <li>The chrome-colored head around my shaver head gets a greenish-yellow film built up on it, and on occasion the first couple of passes leave a similarly colored streak down my cheek (that easily washes off).</li>
            <li>I thought this stuff was a gimmick, but I really like how clean it gets the razor without any work or mess.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and mess</li>
            <li>The frustration free packaging is a real plus and cuts down on waste - I choose it whenever it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you want your shaver to last if full potential.</li>
            <li>Although a little pricey, they work very well and keep my razor clean.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s less costly than the break down of either the 12 pack or 6 pack shown on Amazon, so I bought 3 packs of the 4 refills, and saved a fair amount.</li>
            <li>The price changes often and often even other drugstores online have the same price or slightly better.</li>
            <li>A simple washing of the razor head under hot water just does not do the job.  </li>
            <li>They last almost exactly one month</li>
            <li>I tried many other Braun shaver cleaning solutions the last one produced even rust on my shaver head.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the 4 pack and consistently ordering when you replace the last one in the shaver</li>
            <li>The packaging is small and appropriate for the size.</li>
            <li>First, they cost me money, second they use a lot of plastic.</li>
            <li>They are made by Braun and are exactly the same as the others.</li>
            <li>You can tell a pretty big difference of you</li>
            <li>These are OEM refills that are exactly the same as the ones sold for twice the price.  </li>
            <li>they are exactly the same...</li>
            <li>The razor station that I have tends to shoot extra alcohol from this the first time it is used.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, they fit my Brawn Series 7 self-cleaning charge base perfectly, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li>Last yr our home burned and that was the first thing I replaced.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered, from Japan I think, but does the same job!</li>
            <li>I usually run the Braun under a water faucet to get most trimmings off, then pop into the cleaner to finish the process and get lubed.</li>
            <li>I love my Braun, but my local Target and WalMarts are starting to not resupply these at a very regular rate.</li>
            <li>This is my first (and only) choice for Braun refills!</li>
            <li>my series charger always tells me my damn cleaner is empty when the thing is still full.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much an alcohol base to clean your electric razor, which is nice.</li>
            <li>This is the only way to purchase the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills and save money at the same time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I don&#x27;t feel like it is absolutely necessary to clean the razor daily.</li>
            <li>It evaporates faster, doesn&#x27;t clean as well and definitely NOT the same quality or product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t clean my razor everyday but probably should because I am not saving much when one considers the evaporation.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t see leaving the lid open 24/7 as the thing would evaporate and the clean cycle only takes about 5 or 6 minutes to run.</li>
            <li>I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean &amp; Renew cartridges have a shorter life span, from about 3 months to less than 2 months, not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to keep my razor clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>Other times just clean head in water.</li>
            <li>this product keeps my blades sharp and clean.</li>
            <li>You can use it like any other shaver and clean it with a brush.</li>
            <li>This way you know it is clean, but not overpowering due to the alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband gives this a 4.5 star because it has kept his shaver clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>Keeps my razor sharp and clean.</li>
            <li>I shave every other day and clean my razor after every shave.</li>
            <li>not only that, all other razors I have used in the past (or when I don&#x27;t clean it for a while) just don&#x27;t feel as nice on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These make my 5+ year old razor like new.</li>
            <li>Makes my old razor work like it is new again.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my 3 year old razor working like a brand new one.</li>
            <li>A way to stretch the cartridges is to save the old cartridge after it says you need a new replacement.</li>
            <li>Used these for years along with the cleaner/charger base they fit; sure beats trying to hand clean a razor.</li>
            <li>Currently the 1st of the pack has lasted a couple of months with a cleaning every week and the indicator only just changed from full to halfway on the solution.</li>
            <li>It is the same tried and true product that I was expecting, only in a value added package.</li>
            <li>I have amassed a whole bunch of these cleaner cartridges but am pleased with the ongoing results, so hopefully I have a stock for the next few years!  </li>
            <li>I cant use it fast enough before a new shipment comes in.</li>
            <li>Have had a Braun for many years now and would typically buy the 2 pack boxes at the local store.  </li>
            <li>Does a simple job well and less expensively--what more could be asked?</li>
            <li>These each used to last a long time, and each time I&#x27;ve ordered them the life-cycle shrinks significantly ...</li>
            <li>Possibly by selling the liquid in a large container, so as the used liquid could be discarded and the container refilled.</li>
            <li>Add a little water if the error light won&#x27;t turn off.</li>
            <li>#34;the frustration free 4 count for little or nothing.</li>
            <li>Keeps shaver head clean sterile and long lasting.</li>
            <li>and i went to clean the bathroom and wipe down his razor and it</li>
            <li>Even though Braun still sells MANY electric razors using these cartridges, they&#x27;re hard to find in any stores.  </li>
            <li>other reviews, the cleaning fluid is easy to spill when removing the plastic seal cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice to buy them in bulk, especially since it&#x27;s hard to find them locally (for a reasonably price, too).</li>
            <li>Like other reviews have suggested I have found that placing the cap back on when your not using the cleaner does help it last longer, but I feel the MOST IMPORTANT step to making it last is to rinse all the hair out of razor and let it dry a bit before you use the cleaning dock.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just surprised that it&#x27;s still made given how frequently things change &amp; newer models are developed.</li>
            <li>I was previously a Norelco shaver user and struggled to manually clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Much better than expected, lasts longer than expected</li>
            <li>it came in a clear liquid.</li>
            <li>Cleaning action is thorough and complete.</li>
            <li>Take the old one out.</li>
            <li>Probably direct import from China.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done to complete satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;Far</li>
            <li>For the price of this product, Braun has clearly designed a product that requires frequent repurchases once you start to like the product.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for this necessary supply.</li>
            <li>Could have refilled my old container.</li>
            <li>The 4 pack offers a cheaper unit price and convenient case to store them away.</li>
            <li>At least with this offering I get more of them for my money.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying these individually at a store.</li>
            <li>It also improves the smell of a scuzzy razor considerably.</li>
            <li>They are lasting much longer and cleaning just as well.</li>
            <li>product arrived early.  </li>
            <li>Bought the value pack and all 4 are the real deal, same labels as my originals.</li>
            <li>not so much the refill&#x27;s fault, but perhaps an overall product design.</li>
            <li>Although, the Frustration Free packaging is marginally more difficult to open than the two packs in the manufacturer packaging.</li>
            <li>I AM 83 YRS OLD AND GETTING TO THE STORE THAT CARRIES</li>
            <li>I think cleaning the razor in necessary, but these are really costly.  </li>
            <li>These are necessary for cleaning my razor and it is much cheaper getting them here than getting them at the store.</li>
            <li>They last much longer this way (when the solution can&#x27;t evaporate).</li>
            <li>Seems to help so far.</li>
            <li>I bought a box of these thinking they would have to be changed frequently.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper then I can find locally.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap Chinese knockoff that is not the same Braun formula and does not have the mesh sreen baring dirt to be cycled back during cleaning.</li>
            <li>So, far, work as advertised.</li>
            <li>Considerable savings over store bought refills.</li>
            <li>Direct replacement.</li>
            <li>It is early days.  </li>
            <li>much cheaper then picking up locally.</li>
            <li>The contents are listed as alchohol, and the heads seem to wear faster than the old method of manually cleaning and oiling the head.</li>
            <li>A real value compared to big box and specialty stores.</li>
            <li>I really like the Braun Cleaning system, but the fluid evaporates on</li>
            <li>Cleans razor head and ready for next use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can smell the alcohol in this product when you remove the seal, but refilling old cartridges does not work well.</li>
            <li>not just leave the open product in the cleaning system for much of it</li>
            <li>Purchasing these through Amazon is Much Cheaper than finding these locally.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this product was made in China......</li>
            <li>No wasted time or gas in the truck just click and its at your door in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>They are much cheaper than the ones at local stores.</li>
            <li>It does not extend the blade life of the razor as far as the owners manual says you can push it, but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need any food coloring for the blue color.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>So in that unit, I began using straight rubbing alcohol -- just enough of a splash to get through a cleaning cycle (or three).</li>
            <li>how much can you say about razor cleaner fluid?  </li>
            <li>There is a considerable saving by purchasing these in bulk.</li>
            <li>My oldest son used my old Braun shaver since I upgraded.  </li>
            <li>This whole replacement business is based on fluid evaporation.</li>
            <li>delivery was fast enough, and are  as advertised.</li>
            <li>I plan to try the refill that Amazon offers that has a lubricant but the shipping charges are stopping me.</li>
            <li>Considerably cheaper buying here than buying through Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li>I really like the Braun Series 7 shaver that I bought recently.  </li>
            <li>Needed this for my Braun shaver now 10 plus yrs old, in part, no doubt, as a result of using this.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need only two for a whole year?</li>
            <li>Cleans the razor completely..</li>
            <li>OEM, as far as I can tell, replacements for my Braun electric shaver cleaning system.</li>
            <li>If you can find at a cheaper price I would be surprised.</li>
            <li>Given that the fluid in these refills evaporate over time, even for long periods when the shaver isn&#x27;t used, I couldn&#x27;t accept that I was losing a full cartridge to maybe 5 cleanings.</li>
            <li>I have a heavy, fast-growing beard, and sensitive skin which leaves me few good options besides Braun.  </li>
            <li>Since it is the only cleaning fluid that I know of for the Braun Series 7 electric shaver, I guess it&#x27;s the right</li>
            <li>Not much you can say about shaver refills - they&#x27;re standard Braun Clean &amp; Renew cartridges, but this is a very inexpensive way to buy them, plus they come in a simple box and you don&#x27;t have to fight through any packaging.  </li>
            <li>I dry the shaver on a towel, making sure it&#x27;s as dry as possible in the time I have</li>
            <li>Using the clean and renew cartages make a noticeable different in the longevity of the cutting head, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I shave daily in the mornings and have quite a bit of stubble but only clean the razor with the fluid 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li>One pack will last you a year if you close it back up after use and only clean once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Another thing I see people saying is its not worth buying  because it evaporates to quick</li>
            <li>save on cartridges, I clean the shaver every day with the little brush.</li>
            <li>The cartridges typically come in cardboard box that&#x27;s fairly easy to open.</li>
            <li>The clean &amp; renew cartridges cleaned my shaver in the old model self-cleaner, but they suffered from heavy rates of evaporation.  </li>
            <li>I had been avoiding purchasing these cleaning units for some time due to their cost, but their ease of use makes the purchase well worth it.</li>
            <li>I had made my own version of the cleaner using an empty cartridge but with the low price of $4, it is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No mess and just throw away</li>
            <li>No mess....</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I still prefer my old Braun and was lucky enough to have bought extra foils prior to them being phased out.</li>
            <li>very smart clean and last long (almost 2 and half month now and still</li>
            <li>He has been using it for 6+ years (only getting a new blade maybe once or twice!).</li>
            <li>I use my razor everyday the cleared keeps my razor clean.</li>
            <li>Content evaporates fast if not closed properly.</li>
            <li>I used my first Braun for about ten years in conjunction with this system, and the only reason I stopped using it is because I couldn&#x27;t find replacement foils/cutters for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>big deal, not recommended unless you have the main cleaner unit.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to how &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; it became but generally think the refill (fluid) cartridge design leaves consumers paying too much too often.</li>
            <li>This will last forever... or a decent amount of time, but when it&#x27;s finished</li>
            <li>Pretty simple product that is the same as you would buy in a store.</li>
            <li>this particular item from Amazon has easy to open packaging and is sold at a significant discount from our local grocer and it gets expensive to change these as often as I need to otherwise.</li>
            <li>Have used these for ten years, including with my old and new Braun Shavers.</li>
            <li>Just save the cap when you open it a new one to use on the old one that it is replacing.</li>
            <li>I like my Braun razor but not having to pay a lot of money for these excessively packaged containers of what I suspect is alcohol/water with some light fragrance added.</li>
            <li>Economical and work as well as more expensive local retailer products</li>
            <li>I switched back to Braun recently, and found that these were much easier to replace than my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m not yet sure if the &amp;#34;Frustration Free&amp;#34; packaging really cuts down on the waste though, the corrugated cardboard seems like more material than the standard thin cardboard box the cartridges normally come in, and mine got mashed in shipping, but the cartridges arrived alright.</li>
            <li>Next time you dock/charge your razor, it&#x27;s cleaning like new.</li>
            <li>It totally cleans my Braun like new.</li>
            <li>The Braun system requires a new cartridge with its hygienic, sterilizing fluid  after about 30 cleanings.</li>
            <li>It operates new because of the daily maintenance provided by the solution in the cartridges,</li>
            <li>We live in a rural area with a 70 mile trip to the nearest shopping area.  </li>
            <li>How do you review a fluid used to clean and slightly lubricate an electric shaver?</li>
            <li>Does the same job as the individually packaged OEM cartridges at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>The whole unit seems well designed, and I only run the cleaner when it requires total cleaning.</li>
            <li>This refill package seems to be the least expensive and when it is done on the auto ship makes perfect sense to me!</li>
            <li>This is now a major factor for me when looking at new potential razors.</li>
            <li>Look at the price for 4 of these units at under $5/ month and which always last me closer to 6 months than 4 coming to less than $3/ month, and understand your blades and foils lasting longer will pay for these even if you don&#x27;t value your time that highly to avoid daily light</li>
            <li>I go through one every two months or so,so the subscribe and save on this is about right, but every once in a while I have to stop it to cut down my stockpile of these things.  </li>
            <li>One trick is to save the cap and place it on between uses but this is a major annoyance to have to take the cap on and off.</li>
            <li>use \\&quot;Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot;, which comes out cheaper than getting it from major retails.</li>
            <li>I will go on line to all of the major department store website, then I will come here.  </li>
            <li>They come in a cardboard box and not much other packaging.</li>
            <li>These do the trick but one of the 4 was only half full.  </li>
            <li>The price is right but each refill lasts a month or less.</li>
            <li>Things cannot be simpler - open up the cleaning station, slide out the old one, open and slide in the new one.  </li>
            <li>Less cardboard waste than the old packaging, and a better price per cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>receiving a single star due to receiving a can of zippo premium butane fuel instead of the Braun clean and renew cartridge refills.</li>
            <li>The cartridges fit in the cleaner that comes with the razors and they do clean and lubricate the cutting surfaces.</li>
            <li>After a stroke several years ago, I&#x27;ve been grooming my husband and floundering with several older model Braun electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>Using the cleaning system with a razor full of hair only dilutes the cleaning solution and makes it not clean as well.</li>
            <li>little hint on making these last longer is when the light turns yellow</li>
            <li>and I only hit the clean button when it hits the third level down.  </li>
            <li>Works great and cost isn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li>I just wish these refills in general lasted longer and were cheaper.  </li>
            <li>This product is clear ad smells like it is just alcohol only.  </li>
            <li>The yellow light (not the green!)</li>
            <li>I recognize this is, clearly, Braun&#x27;s take on Gillette&#x27;s business model of recurring revenue, addicting you to the convenience of their cleaning solution for a low monthly price.  </li>
            <li>How much this expensive fluid adds to it I am not so sure.</li>
            <li>You open your Braun cleaning station, slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal as far as function</li>
            <li>I believe you&#x27;re really not saving much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one so far.</li>
            <li>So far used only 1 refill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, the razor has lasted me five years of daily use.</li>
            <li>Not much to say about this cleaner really.</li>
            <li>am old and only shave 3 to 4 times a week which reduces the need for the cleaning</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like the old commercial &amp;#34; Set it up and leave it&amp;#34; it does the job all by itselg.</li>
            <li>Auto ship and arrives as expected with reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do a great job, but the charging/cleaning base is really handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having used Braun razors for 25 years I can confidently say however that the purchase is unnecessary.  </li>
            <li>This latest batch is even worse.</li>
            <li>Kind of silly to review these.</li>
            <li>The shave is better but not great.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be much easier to clean my new razor, just drop it in and press the button, half hour later it is cleaned, dried and lubricated for my next shave.</li>
            <li>But the convenience and few extra dollars is well worth having your razor work like new even after years of daily use.  </li>
            <li>buying several at once is much cheaper than buying singly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you find in the store for quite a bit less.  </li>
            <li>These things work really well, they just don&#x27;t last long enough.  </li>
            <li>They fit fine, are less expensive in a four-pack</li>
            <li>I purchased a four pack of these with my new razor because these are more expensive almost everywhere else that I have looked for them locally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to say that that works almost as well as these genuine Braun cartridges, minus the rubbing alcohol smell (supposedly solved by adding a few drops of essence of lemon -- not that I&#x27;ve tried it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the store the product has a lemon scent and is blue, where this one is clear and only smells like alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I recommend you pass on the refills unless you personally found a marked improvement in your shaving experience with the trial fluid included with the razor.</li>
            <li>I bought these through subscribe and save for several months until I ran out unexpectedly and bought one from a local store.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to run to my local big box store in the early morning hours.  </li>
            <li>I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I&#x27;m the only one, but so far I give it only 3 stars because of this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each cartridge last much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>These cartridges are apparently all the same</li>
            <li>agent that apparently is in the actual Braun refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do wish there was a better disposal method of the used ones instead of throwing the whole cartridge containing the dirty cleaning fluid into the trash.</li>
            <li>I understand the frustration of paying for a Braun razor (not the cheapest around) and then paying extra money for the replacement foil/cutters annually AND these fluid cartridges, but it seems to me that these cartridges do a good job of cleaning/lubricating the cutting head/foil and that helps to provide a longer use for the product and provide a nicer shave.</li>
            <li>I usually refill each one twice before putting in a factory fresh one again.</li>
            <li>At first, I had a few doubts, but I&#x27;ve never had a shaver like this.  </li>
            <li>Now that the price has gone down, it&#x27;s probably not worth the effort to use the Everclear, Lemon essential oil, light machine oil that I used before.</li>
            <li>I was getting tired of cleaning &amp; oiling my old razor, so I got the Braun Series 5 Clean &amp; Renew system.  </li>
            <li>The product was the correct cleaning refill for the Braun 70s shaver and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans the electric shaver cassette extremely well!</li>
            <li>If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal, covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help.</li>
            <li>Not sure what &#x27;frustration free&#x27; really means.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing holding this back from 5 stars is the pressure you need to pop open the cap without the cartridge sliding out of your grip and the inevitable spray of a few alcohol droplets when you do.</li>
            <li>Small box, no leaks, convenient way to find just the right component.</li>
            <li>The previous cartridge lasted a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>( less pricey and very convenient to have it sent to your front doormat)</li>
            <li>These steps really prolong the life of the individual cartridge and cut down on cost.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy them again, especially knowing that I would pay about five times as much for the same cartridges found in Walgreen&#x27;s and other, similar retailers.</li>
            <li>I do pop the blades off and quickly rinsed out the whiskers before putting in the cleaning base most time.</li>
            <li>After spending a large amount of money on the Braun 7-760 system and it stopped working after a few months.</li>

            <li> Good price for refills that are much more money in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Good to have these packaged in multiples of 4 or more.  </li>
            <li> I owned the unit for about 3 years, or longer, and I haven‚Äôt changed the replaceable unit, even though I own a spare unit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a number of people complain that Braun is just trying to make a cash grab in selling these cleaning cartridges, but to be honest...</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that the razor cleans any more unless it gets changed.  </li>

            <li> it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  </li>

            <li> Product what I needed and pleased to be able to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> They also seem more money.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love my machine.</li>
            <li> Much better price point too.</li>
            <li> seems okay</li>
            <li> Authentic Braun cartridge refill replacements work well with my Series 7 electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend everyone purchasing a Braun shaver that uses this type of cartridge use these cartridges as it extends the lift of the Braun Shaver and gives you the best possible shave.</li>
            <li> Doing so will avoid evaporation - which is what accounts for most of the loss of the</li>

            <li> Requires replacing a lot more often than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are genuine Braun!</li>
            <li> The product does mostly what it ways.  </li>

            <li> you be sure</li>
            <li> I love the fact that Braun now has a four-pack of cartridge refills.  </li>
            <li> Much more convenient than the two- or three-pack.</li>
            <li> After each use, I make sure to seal up the cartridge and keep it separate from the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> So satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> they work great thanks</li>

            <li> A couple Christmases ago I was giving the shaver that using this product and as for the shaver I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve never had better result in my life.</li>

            <li> I think it has helped mine become more efficient and cleaner.  </li>
            <li> the price is much better that what I could find in our town.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy when you consider what you would pay for 2 at a Big Box store!</li>
            <li> Plus they do a better job than I do...</li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t much better than bed bath &amp; beyond</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Have used these many times before.</li>
            <li> I tried using my own alcohol solution to refill these because I was too cheap to pay the price for them at the store.  </li>
            <li> So much better than Walmart even</li>
            <li> The price is even better than Sam&#x27;s Club</li>
            <li> It also keeps the Braun Series 5 running better longer.</li>

            <li> I love my shaver but the cleaner is a problem with replacements.  </li>
            <li> Granted, paying for disposable razor blades is more costly</li>
            <li> If these were cheaper I believe more people would use and replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because I am not going to say &amp;#34;I Love it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> 200.00 for a top of the line, made in Germany shaver</li>
            <li> Sure, one could mix up some mineral oil, alcohol, and water</li>
            <li> I use the periodic shipment from Amazon to save money and make sure I always have some on hand.</li>
            <li> It would not let me just tell my opinion without adding more words</li>
            <li> Arrived just when I needed it most.</li>
            <li> Makes using my Braun even more enjoyable and easier than ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And how many of us TRULY disinfected our razors in alcohol *</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> Better in my Pocket than theirs</li>
            <li> I saw that I could buy in bulk, which was a better deal.</li>
            <li> the best razor there is, then add in the C&amp;R and it only gets better.</li>
            <li> more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Everything was packaged in the air cushion package material to keep safe.</li>
            <li> Gotta love Braun :)</li>
            <li> Everytime I went to purchase more of the cleaning product at the stores they never had it or they were sold out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
            <li> I found these online at a better price (for purchasing 4 at a time)</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it comes in bundles, can&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
            <li> Price is better than going to the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure its cheaper than what you would pay in a store</li>
            <li> Love that they sell these in bulk</li>
            <li> This saves even more on cost without sacrificing the life.</li>
            <li> These seem to have more solution in them than the ones I used to get.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> After cleaning the razor seems to give much better shaves.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price</li>
            <li> this reminds me I better shave</li>
            <li> I will re-order when I need more with no problems.</li>

            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Nothing more.</li>
            <li> Just pull off the top and slide it in the docking station</li>
            <li> Arrived safely.  </li>
            <li> The self-cleaning feature on the Braun razors isn&#x27;t a scam just to sell more products.</li>
            <li> Just like the 2 packs, but packed more &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> If you use that type, you need them :-)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  recommend cleaning the hair particles out of the shaver manually so as to get the most out of the solution.</li>

            <li> It provides a significant benefit that I feel is worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Also, the shaver is one of the best rated, I believe, partly due to</li>

            <li> This solution works great at cleaning the razor, and we love the convenience of being able to buy them in bulk online so that we never run out and don&#x27;t have to go chasing them down at a store.</li>
            <li> If I clean the stubble out with some compressed air (not to high PSI), it&#x27;s good to go.  </li>
            <li> There was no problem with fit and the function seemed fine, but it seemed a bit off.</li>

            <li> /&gt;the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  </li>
            <li> cost of these, in my opinion, is worth the price for a smooth shave every time without any fuss of having to take the shaver apart to clean it, or having to remember to make sure to lubricate the blades as frequently - plus the lemon scent is a nice added bonus!</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to change out the Clean and Renew Cartridge without having to go out each month and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost, but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see a huge difference in the closeness of the shave and almost zero skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Huge savings over store prices</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t pass it up with free shipping.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m still using the 1st cartridge (which is still FULL and looks clean).</li>

            <li> Brown box, four cartridges, all full.</li>
            <li> The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks.</li>
            <li> Nothing more, thanks.</li>
            <li> Those drain quite fast if you don&#x27;t close the lid on the top</li>
            <li> About a year ago, this changed so that each cartridge was only good for just over a month.</li>
            <li> Good, the only one to buy for your braun!!</li>
            <li> Sweet deal on this razor cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff, just like you would buy at well-known stores for a greater price.</li>
            <li> I just have too many of them now, haha</li>
            <li> Product was received undamaged, all cartridges were sealed and completely full.  </li>
            <li> This way most of the hairs are cleaned out in the sink, and these cartridges don&#x27;t collect much of anything (just use them for the cleaning/sanitizing).</li>
            <li> Standard product, good price.</li>
            <li> I found this helped get more life out of the cartridge since you don&#x27;t lose as much alcohol to evaporation.  </li>
            <li> A really good deal of you subscribe, which gives you the added benefit of not having to go hunting for them when you realize you have none left.  </li>
            <li> Good packing and my shaver is back with fragrance..</li>
            <li> good price compared to local stores</li>
            <li> At the moment, I don&#x27;t really think there&#x27;s too many problems that I can notice.</li>
            <li> Though one can do it yourself with some Rubbing Alcohol, and scent/lubricant packs, the price is fair enough.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good deal.</li>
            <li> I was able to get these much cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li> Now only if Braun could make their cutter blocks good again...</li>
            <li> but I love my braun too much to experiment.</li>
            <li> These will last me a couple of years probably and the price was good for 4.</li>
            <li> The fluid does a good job cleaning the razor.</li>
            <li> Nicely packed in a group of 4 in a small box that will be good for storage.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Compared to the price of cutter / screen, this is not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I knocked one star off for value but in the bulk pack its not a bad deal delivered.</li>
            <li> A package of four lasts me about six months, so that&#x27;s not a bad cost.</li>
            <li> Not a bad value for this quantity.</li>
            <li> have not had to use yet but is just like the one that came with the new shaver braun series 7-790cc which works great so far</li>
            <li> Pleasant non offensive odor, feels fresh next use.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Packaging is nice and easy to open.  </li>
            <li> Something doesn&#x27;t fit right it liks when working.</li>
            <li> The genuine article at the right price point.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me, I find I get a much better shave when I clean more regularly.</li>
            <li> They clean my shaver very well----just the ticket!!</li>
            <li> I clean my shaver after every use--I mostly run an ecco or normal cleaning--and one cartridge lasts me about 1 month when I use it 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the purchase of the Braun Clean &amp; Renew refill cartridges and would definitely recommend them!!</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning the razor and keeping the blades sharp.  </li>
            <li> Other than the price these are work great and saves you time.</li>
            <li> Yes it costs money to refill, but it cleans it a lot better than a water rinse....feels brand new!</li>

            <li> While the shave isn&#x27;t as close as premium blades, the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the price of the cleaner has increased and the useful life has diminished by 25% to 50%.  </li>
            <li> Both my teenage son and my husband each own the Braun shaver</li>
            <li> I like having a fresh razor for every shave and this system does that.  </li>
            <li> The multi pack is really useful in keeping up with the demand of the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth to buy</li>
            <li> Braun designed a useful shaver stand that also cleans the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Now I am paying for 2 or 3 yrs worth of shaver cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Cleans my braun razor well and leaves it smelling lemony fresh.</li>
            <li> Smells nice when it starts to run low</li>
            <li> so I would say it is a success.</li>
            <li> I clearly purchased too many.</li>
            <li> Cleans razor automatically and leaves a fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Nice lemon scent and last for about 6 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> yes, make it easy to clean his new Braun shaver and he will continue to be very desirable to smooch on&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> unbelievable deal, great product and super service one</li>
            <li> So this germ-killing product (water, alcohol, some lubricant for the blades, and lemon smell mostly) really works and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Solution: prime shipping ;-)</li>
            <li> Good way to keep shaver clean with little effort.</li>
            <li> i have a older shaver still works fine.</li>
            <li> I do love my Braun shaver and this cleaner definitely keeps it clean, lubricated and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and quickly provided</li>
            <li> I got them quickly, on time, and exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> And, of course, you need a supply of cartridge refills to be able to clean your razor fully and properly.  </li>
            <li> Works very well with the shaving system and leaves a clean fresh smell when it&#x27;s done.  </li>
            <li> I find that I clean my razor more regularly,</li>
            <li> I clean my shaver once a week, thus allowing the cartridges to last many months.</li>
            <li> They leave the razor clean, fresh smelling, and ready to use.</li>
            <li> Since I travel a lot, I can only clean my razer when I am home, which means weeks and sometimes months go by without being able to take advantage of it.</li>
            <li> Not something I&#x27;m ever going to love, these things are a necessary purchase to keep your Braun shaver clean.</li>
            <li> By doing this, I have extended the use of one refill to more then double the life span of leaving the refill in the Clean &amp; Renew System.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my razor as good as any other braun cleaner</li>
            <li> Good value compared to other sources</li>
            <li> Gotta buy them on line, price is right.</li>
            <li> This I have on automatic order and it ships right on time.  </li>
            <li> I have been geting thjis product for years and the price is right</li>
            <li> These are priced right</li>
            <li> The price is right</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> Price was right.</li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t smell the freshness right away when I unseal it again</li>
            <li> If you do your shopping right, sometimes you can buy two at a time in bulk, for cheaper than the bundle</li>
            <li> right when I&#x27;m about to run out.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a knockoff brand, but Braun is listed right on the cartridge.</li>
            <li> I felt that the price was right for my Braun refill cleaning solution</li>
            <li> Something didn&#x27;t seem quite right about these cartridges.  </li>
            <li> The four pack seems the right balance between cost and quantity discount.</li>
            <li> Just the right number of refills if you need to buy them online.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right as soon as I used it, my machine did not have any problems detecting this product and started cleaning my shaver.</li>
            <li> Plus they ship them right to your home.</li>
            <li> The price was right and was easier then going to the store to buy two at a time.</li>
            <li> But the price is right, so I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Braun refills slip right into the razor cleaning device just like they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> The price is right</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell it provides to the razor, seems to keep the razor in new like condition!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to insert a new cleaner.</li>
            <li> These packs are no frustration and easy to pop a new one in.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quick to change and no mess.</li>
            <li> When I opened the first 4 pk box, I noticed one of the cartridge was about 25% filled and the color was very pal.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes his Braun shaver and the way this stuff keeps it clean.  </li>
            <li> The clean and renew cartridge fits my Braun razor cleaner very well.</li>
            <li> They clean my razor very well.  </li>
            <li> Clean razor fast shipping</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to clean Braun Series 7-790 Pulsonic Shaver System.  </li>
            <li> The whole \\&quot;Clean &amp; Renew\\&quot; process is the biggest scam I have ever fallen for.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about the product, its what the clean and renew system requires.</li>
            <li> If the red light on the Clean &amp; Renew unit comes on too soon, clean the unit as recommended at the Braun website \\&quot;Troubleshooting.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say; the product does what it is supposed to: cleanly, effeciently, but at a somewhatslow pace.</li>
            <li> Decent price with free shipping</li>
            <li> the braun clean and renew refill really work, my braun shaver works like a charm</li>
            <li> Great Pricing, came exactly as explained in plain packaging rather than shelf packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for three refills for the Braun--easy to use and takes up very little space on a shelf.</li>
            <li> Package came in a frustration free box which was easy to open and sealed with no way of accidentally opening.</li>
            <li> packaging was easy to open and light.</li>
            <li> Buying through Amazon give me a great price, the ability to buy in quantity, and saves me from having to drive around to shop..something I do not enjoy!</li>
            <li> My only rant, and its not about this product, is that the charging light doesn&#x27;t go out on the shaver, a bright blue LED, which is distracting at night.</li>
            <li> But now, with Braun&#x27;s clean and renew refills, you just pop the razor back into the stand, wait for the light to signal whether you should do a light or intense cleaning, press the button recommended, and walk away.  </li>
            <li> The shaver still needs ag good wiping down and brushing out every so often.</li>
            <li> The shaver continues to work like new with a comfortable shave without irritation of the skin.</li>
            <li> The price was right, and these were the exact model for my Braun 7 system.</li>
            <li> Then, using the brush, I clean the main shaver part.</li>
            <li> It is also great to have a refill handy instead of letting the shaver get dirty while getting one.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These things are cheap enough, its worth it to me to clean it every time.</li>
            <li> These are a lot more expensive in the stores, so it is a great purchase.  </li>
            <li> Very Nice as usual.  </li>
            <li> Does the job right , specially if more than one is  using her same shaver</li>
            <li> Items were exactly as described, arrived quickly and were priced very competitively.</li>
            <li> Nice product,keeps the razor clean, sharp and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> The solution helps prolonged the blade and the package make it so easy to replace and leave no mess.</li>
            <li> work well and very fast delivery</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Ships very fast.  </li>
            <li> Straight from the factory in a plain container, exactly what I needed and at a great price.  </li>
            <li> I mean realistically, these things are just moulded plastic and alcohol, and I can buy a whole lot more industrial alcohol than this for a lot cheaper, but the convenience of being able to pop one in when the light goes off is</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original, and does not last as long.</li>
            <li> I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on</li>
            <li> These fluid filled cartridges go with the Braun shaving system, which can automatically recharge and clean the razor after each shave.</li>
            <li> I did see how some guys make their own, but I don&#x27;t clean everyday</li>
            <li> Packaging is super easy to open.</li>
            <li> works as advertised, made by Braun and packed well, great value... hard to beat this purchase.</li>
            <li> Put the new one in and voila, clean razor.</li>
            <li> I faithfully clean my Braun 7000 with this and it continues to work as new.  </li>
            <li> Eventually had to buy new shave cartridge and decided skimping on the clean &amp; renew cartridges a mistake.</li>
            <li> When I pull the razor out of the cleaning station it always smells nine and clean and the foil block looks brand new.</li>
            <li> I clean the head after every shave to keep shaver operating like new.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of not having to manually clean my new shaver.</li>
            <li> Since I get new refills (auto-ship) every few months, I clean my Braun shaver fairly often.  </li>
            <li> These refills are easy to use: follow Braun&#x27;s instructions and the old one pops out and voila the new one is in quickly.</li>
            <li> starting to think this is by design to sell more product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like spending the extra money, but the shaver has provided a close shave for more than two years.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and ordered.</li>
            <li> FIrst I&#x27;d found them in a 4 pack...saves hassle and money this way</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>

            <li> Does exactly what it is designed to do</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> Cartridges arrived exactly as shown, in Braun non-retail packaging.  </li>
            <li> They are in fact OEM refills and work exactly as anticipated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well and is designed exactly for the razor I have.  </li>
            <li> Fits nicely in the holder as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described üòÄ</li>
            <li> They look and install just like the higher priced versions you buy from the store.</li>
            <li> ; This Was The First Time This Has Ever Happened, To My Shaver</li>
            <li> The smell was much more like regular rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> These refills do exactly what they are supposed to do, as you can read in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li> I use to have many in grown hairs and irritation because of regular razors.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I needed and cheaper than Walmart(without shipping)</li>
            <li> Cost more in the local store for fewer numbers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read where others are using the empty containers to make their own cleaning product.</li>
            <li> I just leave the the shaver in the cradle when I am not using it and run the clear when the light says too.</li>
            <li> Much better price than buying them individually at a local store.  </li>
            <li> They get the job done and the next time I use my razor, the shave is always better.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived and worked exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Only a better price</li>
            <li> I have purchased several times from amazon and have always been pleased</li>
            <li> was exactly what was need and save a lot of money than if I have bought it in the store to the tune of about 25%.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it supposed to</li>
            <li> Affordably priced, more so than local retail options.</li>
            <li> Still on the first one.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> ; on the first one you see.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product I&#x27;ve bought many times at retail stores such as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, but at a much better price, nevermind the convenience of having it show up at my front door 2 days after hitting &#x27;Submit&#x27; on the order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How can you love cleaning fluid for your electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I would also recommend taking the foil off and rinsing the blade and foil with water in the sink first.</li>
            <li> My Braun Series 7 790cc shaver seems to glide on my skin better following a cleaning with this product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my hubby needed and cheaper then</li>
            <li> First of three must have had a defect.  </li>
            <li> and it fits my shaver exactly.</li>
            <li> The online ad with it, implied that the cleaner was included, which was not, so be aware</li>
            <li> I got the first generation Syncro shaver cleaning systems when they first came out.</li>
            <li> The second generation systems are intelligent enough to automatically decide how intense a cleanning session your shaver needs.</li>
            <li> Only electric shaver that I have been able to stay with.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what was wanted.</li>
            <li> Product as described; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Mine actually lasted for many months.</li>
            <li> I have not used this since I ran out after I first got the razor.  </li>
            <li> Product is authentic and at a price lower than local stores.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> These cartridges did exactly what they promised to do.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a placebo, but after going back to the branded refills, my razor does seem to cut much better after being washed.  </li>
            <li> Arrived fast!</li>
            <li> But this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a \\&quot;system\\&quot; that self-cleans the razor.</li>
            <li> but ok finally bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent price and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Thanks for the care that you put into this package!</li>
            <li> These cartridge are exactly what is required for the shaver.</li>
            <li> just more convenient to have on hand and not have to wait for local store to restock.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought the cartridge refill.</li>
            <li> did exactly what it was suppose to.</li>
            <li> Helps to make your daily shave experience better.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> If you are ordering this you already know exactly what you are getting in tems of the product.</li>
            <li> I pay more for a 2 pack locally.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The cause was more than likely my electric razor.  </li>
            <li> and I will definitely get more when they run out.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li> My son bought his first one.</li>
            <li> Each refill is lasting more than 2 months.</li>
            <li> It is my second order, love it.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s often pricier to buy the higher count packs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one slipped in to the cleaning system just as described and started working as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun cleaning system since it came out, and it&#x27;s never failed.  </li>
            <li> Quality product and fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my wife bought the Braun razor with the self cleaning station for me last year for Fathers Day.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T try knockoff refill solutions, they will cause problems and are nowhere near the quality of this genuine Braun cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love the Braun 790 shaver and this cleaning cartridge makes life simple.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first group from Braun.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as pictured on the box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i had when i bought the product.</li>
            <li> Also I love the cleaning fluid it uses.</li>
            <li> (glad the shipping boxes are now much smaller!  </li>
            <li> Product is excellent, but rather expensive.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so I am still on my first cartridge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more before running out of this cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I have two Braun shavers that use these cartridges (8000 and 7000 series), and I&#x27;m glad the same refills work for both.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> WE love the cleaning system and we have these extra for when we need to change.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have been using it regularly and have found that it cleans and lubricates my shaver better than anything else I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I have to extend the life of the cartridges, is to pull out the cartridge and close it between uses for the first couple of months.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this shaving system to anyone who wants a great shave everyday!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first electric shaver the Braun Series 7 799-6c and needed spare cartridges.  </li>
            <li> First time have decided to get replacement containers...</li>
            <li> Get a much better price buying these off Amazon than at the local stores.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Braun!</li>
            <li> Will buy more and regularly</li>
            <li> splashes out of cartridge holder when first put in</li>
            <li> I do replace them on the first of every month and recommend the suscribe and save feature here.  </li>
            <li> Problem solved, thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> They are good but we have trouble with the Braun System.  </li>
            <li> is they are not in a braun box and the lable is not the same other wise they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> Very good, but about one in four arrives with considerably less fluid than it should have.</li>
            <li> I compared with original braun clean and renewal, they weren&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is easy to use and effective, it just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Use the plug from the new one to plug the old one just to make sure there is no spillage.</li>
            <li> Far cheaper than even Wal-Mart, not to mention the Prime Shipping makes it easy to get fast.</li>
            <li> I subscribed to the refill program and it works great because he usually forgets he needs the refills until they are all gone!</li>
            <li> My hypothesis: Clean razor when the amber light is on and you will go through these pretty fast but the cutter and foil should last longer.</li>
            <li> Price was right, shipment was fast and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> It must be used very often and the price is right</li>
            <li> I will clean off the blade and foil first with an old toothbrush and then put it in the holder to go through a cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing more than alcolhol with a little lubricant and cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li> has kept it nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> I realized how nice the self cleaning system is on the Braun shavers when i looked at the bottom of my old empty cartridge and it was full of hair.</li>
            <li> Was surprised these 4 cartridges were NOT delivered in the original factory packaging.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas and now am stuck with them since they are not returnable due to the fact that they are hazardous materials.  </li>
            <li> Is the original Braun replacements but much cheaper than I can find where I live.</li>
            <li> in this way you can make your refills last significantly longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li> once I ran out a new order came in, It really keeps my razor clean</li>
            <li> kind of wish there were a way to refill these - throwing the whole thing away when it&#x27;s spent</li>
            <li> My old Synchro system uses these cartridges to clean and charge my 78</li>
            <li> By purchasing this quantity, I don&#x27;t have to place frequent reorders and the cartridges keep the shaver clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Syncro shaver system for quite some time, and have always used the Clean &amp; Renew refills to keep my shaver clean, lubricated, and ready to go for the next shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to remove the product from the Clean &amp; Renew System as soon as cleaning cycle is complete, recap it and save the product from evaporating.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and it really gives me a good shave.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and clean your Braun razor regularly, you know how quickly you run out of cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how much I got for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> I refilled my last cartridge with straight alcohol and used it many times with no problems.</li>
            <li> My son uses his shaver daily and these keep things nice and clean for long term performance.</li>
            <li> I love purchasing these little packets to keep my Braun Contour shaver clean and maintenance-free.</li>
            <li> It does a fine job of cleaning the razor after each use and seems to make the blade last a little longer and is definitely a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I like that these keep my shaver very clean and ready to go for the next shave.  </li>
            <li> I love Braun products anyway, so I&#x27;m not surprised at all to find the cost so affordable.</li>
            <li> I replace these pretty much quarterly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to make my own solution, but it&#x27;s hard to clean out the plastic container.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever used that has given me a shave almost as close as a straight shave, without irritation.</li>
            <li> pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long.</li>
            <li> I found this to be the answer to my problem of having to slook for more and to save a lot in the long run.</li>
            <li> and you pretty much have to use it if you want to keep your shaver lubricated.</li>
            <li> Easy to order keeps my shaver clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Works as expected - Glad to be able to still buy them because no place locally carries this product.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution works better than water and lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you own a Braun shaver, which give a great shave, you need this cleaner fluid.</li>
            <li> Also, this cartridge works for pretty much all Braun shavers (read the description for compatibility).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of trying to make your own.</li>
            <li> The running costs on this shaver are a little high but the cleaner seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Refills fit my device and clean the shaver as expected.</li>
            <li> The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is.</li>
            <li> This fluid allows a braun self cleaning razor to stay both clean and lubricated so your shave is great until the blade goes dull.</li>
            <li> I really like it because it is easy to remove the old cartridge and insert the new one.</li>
            <li> They are identical to the cartridges I normally buy in my drug store but this package of four cost only slightly more than a two-pack of the cartridges I&#x27;ve been buying there.  </li>
            <li> so it evaporates very quickly because of the larger exposed surface</li>
            <li> The cartridges arrived in a cardboard shipping box which was easy to open.  </li>
            <li> Easy open packaging.</li>
            <li> Overall - an easy choice.</li>
            <li> Well, first off the lemon oil helps lubricate the blades so that they are comfortable on your face &amp; help them last longer.  </li>
            <li> No moving parts, simple construction, easy to install.</li>
            <li> These cartridge refills will last you a good long time.</li>
            <li> The quality doesn&#x27;t look the same as the original one that I received with the shaver, but still good enough for regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> Maybe its the way certain Braun models are made?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that, it&#x27;s a smart product, by all means..</li>
            <li> I cover mine with plastic when not in use (and unplug the unit, since a certain amount of heat is generated while it is plugged in).  </li>
            <li> People whine about cleaning cartridges for Braun razors but they really enhance the shave and are pretty cheap when you consider that you only buy one blade cassette a year.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to mess around trying to refill a container with my own formula</li>
            <li> Not so sure about the frustration free part as the solution doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Great buy at almost half the cost of purchasing individually.</li>
            <li> The box is easy to open, and they are the real deal</li>
            <li> No complaints as they are easy to swap out and last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> The frustration free packaging is an easily opened cardboard box just big enough to hold 4 cartridges yet strong enough to hold the bulky cartridges.  </li>
            <li> i believe it was a japanese braun packaging, but works fine for my 3 series braun shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well stocked for months to come with this fluid for this fine razor.</li>
            <li> Only started using one of them, but they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> I hope and trust that Amazon will continue its fine work well into the future.</li>
            <li> I believe that these were originally made for European sales, but none-the-less, work as exact replacements for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Second refill just fine.</li>
            <li> I love buying these in bulk as I seen to go through them quickly and am always forgetting to buy news ones when the old ones are spent.</li>
            <li> Nice way to save a little bit of money (and a trip to a store).</li>
            <li> Having a subscription is a nice way to save a little money on them.</li>
            <li> What can you say these clean and renew cartridges usually go for more money in stores</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the odor is a little more &amp;#34;bleach-ish&amp;#34; for lack of a better term, than the solution that I bought from the store.</li>
            <li> The cartridges seem to keep the razor clean and have a slight lemon smell that i enjoy</li>
            <li> these are genuine factory cartridges and at a price delivered to my door much cheaper than I can get locally.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and quality product.</li>
            <li> Once I changed it, the light turned blue and all was well again.  </li>
            <li> Just goes to show how much we pay for in packaging for the stores.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get much easier then that.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These are much cheaper than buying through Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, Recommended.</li>
            <li> These are genuine refills of the same quality you get in stores.</li>
            <li> This is a very sanitary shaving system.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Everything was very well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning)</li>
            <li> I know that some people try to refill these with alcohol because of the expense, but really, why bother when you can get a 4-pack at these prices?</li>
            <li> works reasonably well</li>
            <li> and this product does it very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My husband is very perfectionistic and likes to do everything according to the book.</li>
            <li> These came in Braun cardboard packaging - and really saved me money.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well</li>
            <li> And The Whole Cartridge Emptied Out, Meaning It Sucked Up</li>
            <li> So I Cleaned The Whole Device</li>
            <li> Just replace the whole unit.  </li>
            <li> There are ways to refill them, but this is much easier.</li>
            <li> packaged very well too.</li>
            <li> lot of hair builds up in the bottom and because really dirt once used up.  </li>
            <li> These are an absolute must</li>
            <li> but there really isn&#x27;t an alternative.</li>
            <li> Not too much to comment on this product, it does the job.</li>
            <li> But is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li> God bless you all so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> THAT MUCH EASIER.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The razor gets so much cleaner then when he uses a brush alone.</li>
            <li> They were also much cheaper than purchasing them at a retail store.</li>
            <li> a real bargain by buying 4 at a time</li>
            <li> fast service would buy again</li>
            <li> I really like having things I can&#x27;t find around town on Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save option.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> If you have a Braun shaver that takes this cleaning cartridge you really don&#x27;t have a choice.</li>
            <li> Just wish the shaving system would cap these so they don&#x27;t evaporate so fast.</li>
            <li> Each person cleans their shaver depending on how much they care of cleanliness of their shaver.</li>
            <li> Wish they made a refill though to reduce producing so much trash and lower the cost.</li>
            <li> BestBuy.com sells it for the same price with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I wish they would not evaporate so fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The stuff works but the whole &amp;#34;Braun Shaver&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...</li>
            <li> The convenience of not having to search for these cleaning refills coupled with a very competitive price make for a slam dunk when you consider it delivered to your door.</li>
            <li> I really should just use the subscription function and be done with it.</li>
            <li> and I noted prices varying as much a $4 per cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Cleans my braun very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but it does.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain about the renewal price, very competitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really preserves the function.</li>
            <li> We have two razors that use these in the house so a four pack is not too much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m finished with these cartridges in gonna start straight edge shaving.</li>
            <li> I really like my Braun and the close shave it gets.</li>
            <li> Worth the expense as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> I do not like leaving the whole unit out</li>
            <li> I wish they had bigger packs available</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have a choice but to use them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!   </li>
            <li> So, I would say don&#x27;t scrimp on the cost, go for the best with this product and you will never be unhappy.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to order this in bulk - this is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real Braun cartridge replacements.  </li>
            <li> VERY MUCHÔºÅIT HAD GIVEN Me</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> They fit the cleaner properly.</li>
            <li> I really like to use this cleaning &amp; renewing solution from Braun for my shaver.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Much easier to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> It was very convenient.</li>
            <li> Very efficient cleaning system.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pricey but what options do you really have?</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and work well</li>
            <li> The frustration free packaging probably wasn&#x27;t necessary...</li>
            <li> Threw the whole thing in the recycle bin and bought a Norelco</li>
            <li> Keeping the blades away from water really helps.</li>
            <li> I like the automatic cleaning feature that these cartridges are utilized for; the shavers are cleaned very well.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal and very affordable</li>
            <li> I can make it almost a whole year with that method utilizing these four.</li>
            <li> I really like this system.</li>
            <li> It really does work by cleaning and sanitizing your razor.</li>
            <li> The refills are very convenient.  </li>
            <li> packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> Retail, I have paid as much as $16 for one refill cartridge for my Braun razor.</li>
            <li> By cleaning once every week or so, the cleaning cartridge lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> Real Braun stuff here.</li>
            <li> What is there really to say?  </li>
            <li> A smooth shave and no facial irritation.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> the exact solution sold by Braun, so it works exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Easier than making own solution, and roughly the same price when bought in the 4 pack</li>
            <li> The alcohol based cleaning system works really well.</li>
            <li> The price of this pack is reasonable compare with offline shops.</li>
            <li> They work very well for my razor</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this system with his Braun shaver</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> This is a real Braun product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, cheap, and cleans the razor well.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> The only thing I will mention is that this is composed primarily of alcohol and it does evaporate.  </li>
            <li> the shave would be much word..</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> These refills save you money over the brick &amp; mortar stores, and the fact that it&#x27;s a 4-pack makes it real convenient too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also come to the realization that there&#x27;s no advantage to buying these cartridges in bulk, especially considering Amazon&#x27;s free shipping.</li>
            <li> Never realized how helpful and important such a cleaning tool could be.  </li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really a time and money saver.</li>
            <li> and it really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> The system as a whole works really well to extend the life of the screen and blade.</li>
            <li> He loves it and this cleaning system allows for all the blades to be cleaned and ready to go again and again.  </li>
            <li> Fast, reliable, and the cheapest anywhere...packaged for wholesale - no frills</li>
            <li> They shipped them fast and we received them within 3-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The problem I really have is that it evaporates fast .</li>
            <li> Cleans very well.</li>
            <li> looks, feels and smells like the real mccoy</li>
            <li> This way it does not evaporate as much.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> They seemed very competitive.</li>
            <li> but they really aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the daily cleaning makes for a smooth shave every morning.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It is very helpful to order what we need and have it delivered as opposed to driving seventy miles and coming home empty-handed.</li>
            <li> But then I noticed my shaves were no longer very close.</li>
            <li> but I think my shaves are now closer with the real thing.</li>
            <li> Not much to say  because I have used these shaver refills for many years</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is a very convenient item that does the job of cleaning and prolonging the life of your Braun razor&#x27;s blades and screen.</li>
            <li> The liquid is essentially denatured alcohol, readily available in hardware stores.</li>
            <li> The 4 pack is much cheaper than the 2 pack that I have found in stores.</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning system really keeps the shaver working well.  </li>
            <li> This product is very overpriced.  </li>
            <li> Each one lasts about five months, sometimes longer, although I don&#x27;t use them as much as Braun suggests I should.  </li>
            <li> but it still saves money over buying it retail and much easier since it comes to the house.  </li>
            <li> You really do have to have these if you have Braun Electric Razor with cleaning station,  Doubt</li>
            <li> It really does the job cleaning and lubricating the razor though</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say about these.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Product works as I expected, and the price for four of these is way better than you can get in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Have two different series of Braun razors they fit in.</li>
            <li> The packing is definitely frustration free.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast Amazon shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Came packed well and in reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than  buying in store.</li>
            <li> I pleased that Braun hasn&#x27;t changed the style of their cleaner cartridges as I still had 1 left over from my old Series 3.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, good cleaning solution for the shaver&#x27;s base..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will keep using these as long as I own a Braun Shaver, hopefully the price will go down some day which would encourage me to use the cleaning system more frequently.</li>
            <li> I do a full clean every other day, and one container lasts me over 2 months.</li>
            <li> When I first began using these cartridges with my Braun Shaver, each lasted about two months, used about every four days tor cleaning, before evaporation of the solution led to a red light that  indicated the need for a new cartridge. .</li>
            <li> Works as expected, the right fit and function.</li>
            <li> The cartridges I received are exactly the same as the as the original, however when you order be sure to scroll down and look closely at the $$ price/quantity/supplier differences and do the math.  </li>
            <li> him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new frustration-free packaging is also nice and helps cuts down on waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just finished my first cartridge and installed the new one.  </li>
            <li> This is (as far as I know) the only way to clean the shaver, even so, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon has also packaged these in an easy-to-open box so that 1) it accommodates one extra cleaning cartridge and 2) so that the box is super easy to open.</li>
            <li> I appreciate finding this in large bulk and for a decent price.  </li>
            <li> I had some older razors that didn&#x27;t have the built in cleaning like the Braun does and there is a huge difference to their performance over even a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> Make shaving very confortable, keeps razor clean and the cutter assembly stays sharper and last longer.</li>
            <li> He just has to put his Braun razor in the holder and walk away, the next day the razor is clean and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> This fluid always makes my shaver feel clean and ready to do its job.  </li>
            <li> The cardboard is obviously recyclable or reusable, and very easy to open.</li>
            <li> , it is original product just Chinese writing.</li>
            <li> In the picture the containers look blue like the original renewal containers that come with the shaver.</li>
            <li> I remove the cartridge following every cleaning, and replace the cap that originally came with it.</li>
            <li> The original cartridges contain a scented blue alcohol-based solution.</li>
            <li> I will not discuss other indulgences in this review.  :-)</li>
            <li> This is an original product and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper per unit buying the 4 pack on Amazon than the individual unit cost, even at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> I will update later if I notice any significant changes.</li>
            <li> Even if you clean only once-a-week instead of daily, these cartridges will help your Braun look, feel, and even smell as fresh as the day you bought it!  </li>
            <li> The fluid in these cartridges clean, oil and refresh my razor every time.  </li>
            <li> If you search around on Amazon, you will find the price per unit generally drops more if you order in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> I believe one reason is because it&#x27;s always clean and properly lubricated by using these Renew Cartridges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never once thought it wasn&#x27;t clean enough after running it through a cycle.</li>
            <li> One of these lasts me 6 months; I only clean when battery is low...15 years &amp; counting.</li>
            <li> This fluid keeps my razor clean and running well.  </li>
            <li> The Braun clean and renew cartridge made a big difference on my shaver.</li>
            <li> I used to clean weekly but switched to daily to help control acne, it worked.  </li>
            <li> I clean my razor just once a week and that seems to be enough, so the 4-pack lasts almost two years.</li>
            <li> My husband has had shaver for several years now and can attribute longevity to Braun Clean.</li>
            <li> They are made for the Braun Clean &amp; Charge device which comes with several Braun shaver models and work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I tried using just alcohol, but the filter at the bottom that strains your hair does clog, and is never the same after you try to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep your razor clean and functioning properly.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can get these in just about any size you need depending on how often you use and clean your razor and can set it up on regular shipments and save 5%.</li>
            <li> I have tried the low priced replacement cleaner and they didn&#x27;t leave my shaver looking a clean as the Braun&#x27;s cleaner does.</li>
            <li> Another way to make it last longer is not to clean your shaver after every use, but rather just once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Protect your pricey investment and keep your beard away by allowing clean blades to do the job properly.</li>
            <li> I only clean when I charge the battery, about once every 1 - 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Lasts 6+ months for me because I alternate with a DE safety razor but clean the Braun after every use.</li>
            <li> I only clean my razor once a week, so I keep the cartridge sealed when not in use.  </li>
            <li> These are the same clean and renew cartridges as the one that came with my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> If you want to save money take it out after each clean and put the lid back on so it dont evaporate.</li>
            <li> If you like to keep your Braun clean, this is essential.</li>
            <li> daily clean with a brush</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to keep your shaver clean.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The System 7 cleaning system works well for me as I often forgot to clean and oil the shavers regularly.</li>
            <li> My husband like this because it keeps reminding him to clean his razor on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> One cartridge probably last 2 to 3 weeks depending on how often you activate the clean cycle.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t open up the cartridges to clean them out.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY product I use to clean my BRAUN Series 7 shaver.  </li>
            <li> The only way to keep the razor working right!</li>
            <li> These clean my husband&#x27;s Braun Series 5 Razor with a clean and renew base very nicely.</li>
            <li> Packaging looks the same as what you can get at the store for retail prices but some how the actual contents &amp;#34;the blue liquid&amp;#34; inside the plastic cartridge does not last or clean as good as what you can get at a store.</li>
            <li> This is smart buy to keep your Braun shaver like new.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system works well, but is pretty loud.  </li>
            <li> First, I brush out the stubble with an old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s alcohol based cleaner and will evaporate I remove the cartridge and recap it usually daily, and my cartridge of 2 months is still mostly full.  </li>
            <li> These cartridges can be very expensive and this plain-boxed set is the best bang for you buck.</li>
            <li> I am going to try to make my own brew in the near future to see if I get the same results.  </li>
            <li> So far I am on my first cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just the right size for me, keeping an extra on hand always so as to never be caught without then that yellow warning light tells me I&#x27;ll need a replacement in a couple days.  </li>
            <li> One trick I learned is that if you clean the razor every one  or two uses with the brush that is provided these cartridges will last up to twice as long as they would if you don&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li> You should always have a supply of new cartridges on hand!</li>
            <li> it was like having a new shaver!</li>
            <li> Cleans, renews and maintains your Braun like new!</li>
            <li> Can purchase large container of the same cleaner without buying complete set, just clean well and refill</li>
            <li> The shipping was amazingly fast and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;Not much to say about product; same stuff you can buy pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li> that the blades and foils last longer, and because of this, that I get a close, more comfortable shave, even when I&#x27;m tackling a long weekend&#x27;s growth following a bout of sloth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This a very good product which is very easy to use, just open unseal, place at the base of the shaver,&lt;br /&gt;when</li>
            <li> so you have a new one ready when it runs out.</li>
            <li> My Braun Razor is about 12 years old now, and I&#x27;m just really happy they&#x27;re still providing these and haven&#x27;t change their basic auto-cleaner design every few years  just to get you to have to buy new ones.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; woks as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and was easy to purchase.</li>
            <li> They install easily and can be put in the recycle bin when empty.</li>
            <li> The label still clearly stated in english Braun clean and refills so it didn&#x27;t matter too much with me.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised, works in my Braun cleaning system, decent price.</li>
            <li> older model shaver.</li>
            <li> These are a deal and super convenient when placed on instant reorder.</li>
            <li> Considering these units are not refillable, the price seems to be OK and they do seem to last for 30 days if used on the razor on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has cleansed and lubricated both my Braun (significantly older model) shavers.  </li>
            <li> I am glad the refill cartridges are the same for the second generation systems.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a need to clean it everyday, but even if you don&#x27;t use it, the cleaning solution evaporates quickly, so I take the cartridge out between cleanings and replace the cap.</li>
            <li> But a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> This particular cleaner is a must for keeping your Braun shaver working well.</li>
            <li> I finally found this at a better price than I could have at the local wal mart.</li>
            <li> They are the same Barun cleaning cartridges that I have bought for years but at a better price than I can get in a local store.  </li>
            <li> The 4 pack is suffices for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> After my older model braun died, I purchased a Norelco with 3 spinning heads.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for this item which is critical to keeping my razor in top shape.</li>
            <li> I had an older model, high end, bit not close in the nature of the shave.</li>
            <li> Keep the tight fitting cap instead of discarding it when the product is opened.  </li>
            <li> I like this, I will highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend both the electric razor and the refills.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have a Series 7 shaver.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I do think US$5 each is high, but it is often the lowest price here.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> As always high quality purchase.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them for someone that has the Braun Shavers.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I needed the cartridges for my Braun unit but did not like the high prices at the store</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but the price is too high.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended for any purchasing the Braun Pulsonic</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Consistently high quality, and shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The cartridges do just what they are designed to do as long as the Clean &amp; Renew Stand works.  </li>
            <li> No problem as long as we clean the razor every day.  </li>
            <li> Cartridges last a reasonable amount of time with daily use and are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> So what little money you save you lose on replacing the cartridge more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cost of 4 refills is little more than the price of a 2 pack at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> You need to keep the cutting blades clean for a good shave</li>
            <li> Keeps his shaver head clean, you can actually see all it cleans off when you remove the old refill</li>
            <li> Have been using these now for a few years and my electric shaver is always clean and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> They may be a bit pricey due to some peoples outlook on it, however I see them as well priced and buy them in a 4 pack which easily lasts a years time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely some merit to the whole concept though - after all you&#x27;re dragging metal across your face and causing abrasions, exactly the kind of situation where you&#x27;d very much want the surfaces involved to be sterilized, or at the very least cleaned with alcohol.  </li>
            <li> This way you aren&#x27;t running the head of the razor under water (this causes rusting, and makes the razor more inefficient and dull, unless you are willing to use lubricant to combat this problem).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  </li>
            <li> the machine works very well so far</li>
            <li> bought these and was surprised to see they were made to sell overseas for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal as these are unnecessarily expensive in stores.</li>
            <li> Although expensive this cleaner does a great job.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and you cannot go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It goes to prove that the old Gillette theory still works--sell the shaver at a reasonable cost but make the profits with replacement blades--in this case with an alcohol cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I enjoy throwing the spent ones away and seeing all the junk in them that I know is not in my shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is now becoming more expensive to keep buying.</li>
            <li> Although it lasted that long, I don&#x27;t shave everyday so I would say it lasted a good month if compared to continuous use.</li>
            <li> I should be able to buy again in a few months.</li>
            <li> and if you cover the top except to use it, it will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Second, without the oil, it is pretty much just alcohol &amp;</li>
            <li> I run mine through when it is either needing a normal or intensive cleaning.</li>
            <li> Rare in today&#x27;s marketplace, this product actually performs as advertised and has extended the life and performance of my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> For me,these time savers are well worth the extra expense of purchasing the boxed, 4-cartridge refill set.  .</li>
            <li> When the next cartridge needs replacing, take the saved cartridge and top off the fill basin with the old fluid.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to close the saved cartridges real well to avoid excessive evaporation.</li>
            <li> Could be normal...  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system cut down on his breakouts and has really made a huge difference in his complexion.</li>
            <li> Always a great buy, and due to the price I always have lots of them in hand and am not afraid to throw one out when it gets dirty, which I believe helps and saves my expensive and excellent Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Really like the fact that it works on my old razor (at the cabin) and new one (at home) as well.</li>
            <li> The prices at amazon were only cheaper than other online retailers by a miniscule amount, but that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I tried the Panasonic wet razors, but they weren&#x27;t up to my beard and were pretty much a pain to clean, too, especially if you used the creams they hawk with them.  </li>
            <li> The process to order cleaners was very simple and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I run my shaver through a cleaning cycle ~ once a week and put the cover right back on it when it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> right after it has reached the low indicator.</li>
            <li> This is a simple way to keep a supply if these on hand; they arrived right here at my home.</li>
            <li> As for this product I do not necessarily use this product daily depends on how much against you think I will clean this may be once a week or halfway through the week.</li>
            <li> They do smell clean in a standard alcohol-sort-of-way, but if you really want the lemon scent and don&#x27;t mind paying extra for it, these aren&#x27;t the ones you want to buy.</li>
            <li> The best and least expensive thing to clean your razor with is... tap water.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what you need when you have to be clean shaven everyday.</li>
            <li> Although the product was standard and worked fine, all four must have been seconds, because each cartridge only lasted 2.5-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> frankly they are pointless, you can clean your shaver with water, this is just a gimmick to keep it smell fresh</li>
            <li> Original factory product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li> $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China, filled with alcohol, coloring, and some other solvent.  </li>
            <li> These was an OEM part and performed as expected with no change in fragrance or volume as the original item.</li>
            <li> All I have done is buy a new shaving head once a year and replaced the cleaning cartridges as needed.</li>
            <li> I pulled out my husbands cartridge to change when I got the new refills</li>
            <li> I bought these refills along with the foil and cutter replacement pack for my husband, in trying not to buy a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li> his razor was brand new.  </li>
            <li> , the new box shows up.  </li>
            <li> the cleaning made the device like new.  </li>
            <li> Shaver feels like new after using the cleaner.</li>
            <li> It made my razor shave like new .</li>
            <li> Along with new foils and blades, the shaver is like new.</li>
            <li> already goes on when the new cartridge is installed..  </li>
            <li> With the purchase of a new model self-cleaner, the evaporation problem has, well, evaporated.  </li>
            <li> We hadn&#x27;t bought a refill for a while and we were thinking he needed a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Once he cleaned the razor in this solution, it was like new again.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your Braun like new.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed for my new Braun Series 7 Razor.  </li>
            <li> It does work and cleans my Braun razor so that it is like new.</li>
            <li> BUT NOW this new razor does it all thank you</li>
            <li> This product keeps may shaver working like new.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for a shave like a new blade every time.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  </li>
            <li> This cleaning process is something new for me, but I like it.  </li>
            <li> , received a new shaving head for my Braun shaved.</li>
            <li> It leaves the shaver with the &#x27;new&#x27; feel each morning when I use it.</li>
            <li> Every time I install a new one, it overflows &amp; almost 1/3 of the liquid gushes out.</li>
            <li> , they did not make any sort of issues and processed a new shipment at no cost to me.</li>
            <li> Now concerned they may not be NEW.  </li>
            <li> It makes the shaver seem brand new.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s electric razor performed and looked as though it was brand new.</li>
            <li> These are new cartridges not something that has been tampered with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like shaving with a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The solution strips the blades and foil of all gunk, oils and whiskers - it&#x27;s like a brand new razor</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li> If I get this new head for the razor</li>
            <li> I stayed with this one when I needed a new razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new electric shaver and soon found I could not find these cartridges anywhere except Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was buying new foil/cutter and just grabbed these too.</li>
            <li> Make the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li> I decided to pay the price for a new cartridge to see if it made a difference.</li>
            <li> my shaver feels new and refreshed</li>
            <li> The picture shows the new lemon scent.</li>
            <li> Liquid appeared new, so I used them, no problem, but I think this was a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> It keeps the razor feeling and working ike new.</li>
            <li> Good price for an item hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say about these, but they keep my shaver clean.  </li>
            <li> They dry up to quick sometimes.</li>
            <li> I simply put in the cartridge about once a week when I do a full clean and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> This thing does a nice job of cleaning my razor but the price is beyond ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Started using this around May 14th, it is now July 8th and the light on my Braun just went to the yellow low state.</li>
            <li> I need these cartridges for my electric razor dock, and amazon had the lowest prices I found (online or in stores) for these particular items, so I, naturally, purchased them, here.</li>
            <li> Having a better price, not needing to go to Target and cut through the crazy packaging makes this a better alternative.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m not told when the last one is put in the unit,so  ordering and getting them here so fast really helps.</li>
            <li> The chrome-colored head around my shaver head gets a greenish-yellow film built up on it, and on occasion the first couple of passes leave a similarly colored streak down my cheek (that easily washes off).</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff was a gimmick, but I really like how clean it gets the razor without any work or mess.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and mess</li>
            <li> The frustration free packaging is a real plus and cuts down on waste - I choose it whenever it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you want your shaver to last if full potential.</li>
            <li> Although a little pricey, they work very well and keep my razor clean.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less costly than the break down of either the 12 pack or 6 pack shown on Amazon, so I bought 3 packs of the 4 refills, and saved a fair amount.</li>
            <li> The price changes often and often even other drugstores online have the same price or slightly better.</li>
            <li> A simple washing of the razor head under hot water just does not do the job.  </li>
            <li> They last almost exactly one month</li>
            <li> I tried many other Braun shaver cleaning solutions the last one produced even rust on my shaver head.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the 4 pack and consistently ordering when you replace the last one in the shaver</li>
            <li> The packaging is small and appropriate for the size.</li>
            <li> First, they cost me money, second they use a lot of plastic.</li>
            <li> They are made by Braun and are exactly the same as the others.</li>
            <li> You can tell a pretty big difference of you</li>
            <li> These are OEM refills that are exactly the same as the ones sold for twice the price.  </li>
            <li> they are exactly the same...</li>
            <li> The razor station that I have tends to shoot extra alcohol from this the first time it is used.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, they fit my Brawn Series 7 self-cleaning charge base perfectly, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> Last yr our home burned and that was the first thing I replaced.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered, from Japan I think, but does the same job!</li>
            <li> I usually run the Braun under a water faucet to get most trimmings off, then pop into the cleaner to finish the process and get lubed.</li>
            <li> I love my Braun, but my local Target and WalMarts are starting to not resupply these at a very regular rate.</li>
            <li> This is my first (and only) choice for Braun refills!</li>
            <li> my series charger always tells me my damn cleaner is empty when the thing is still full.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much an alcohol base to clean your electric razor, which is nice.</li>
            <li> This is the only way to purchase the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills and save money at the same time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t feel like it is absolutely necessary to clean the razor daily.</li>
            <li> It evaporates faster, doesn&#x27;t clean as well and definitely NOT the same quality or product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t clean my razor everyday but probably should because I am not saving much when one considers the evaporation.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t see leaving the lid open 24/7 as the thing would evaporate and the clean cycle only takes about 5 or 6 minutes to run.</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean &amp; Renew cartridges have a shorter life span, from about 3 months to less than 2 months, not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to keep my razor clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> Other times just clean head in water.</li>
            <li> this product keeps my blades sharp and clean.</li>
            <li> You can use it like any other shaver and clean it with a brush.</li>
            <li> This way you know it is clean, but not overpowering due to the alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband gives this a 4.5 star because it has kept his shaver clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor sharp and clean.</li>
            <li> I shave every other day and clean my razor after every shave.</li>
            <li> not only that, all other razors I have used in the past (or when I don&#x27;t clean it for a while) just don&#x27;t feel as nice on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These make my 5+ year old razor like new.</li>
            <li> Makes my old razor work like it is new again.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my 3 year old razor working like a brand new one.</li>
            <li> A way to stretch the cartridges is to save the old cartridge after it says you need a new replacement.</li>
            <li> Used these for years along with the cleaner/charger base they fit; sure beats trying to hand clean a razor.</li>
            <li> Currently the 1st of the pack has lasted a couple of months with a cleaning every week and the indicator only just changed from full to halfway on the solution.</li>
            <li> It is the same tried and true product that I was expecting, only in a value added package.</li>
            <li> I have amassed a whole bunch of these cleaner cartridges but am pleased with the ongoing results, so hopefully I have a stock for the next few years!  </li>
            <li> I cant use it fast enough before a new shipment comes in.</li>
            <li> Have had a Braun for many years now and would typically buy the 2 pack boxes at the local store.  </li>
            <li> Does a simple job well and less expensively--what more could be asked?</li>
            <li> These each used to last a long time, and each time I&#x27;ve ordered them the life-cycle shrinks significantly ...</li>
            <li> Possibly by selling the liquid in a large container, so as the used liquid could be discarded and the container refilled.</li>
            <li> Add a little water if the error light won&#x27;t turn off.</li>
            <li> #34;the frustration free 4 count for little or nothing.</li>
            <li> Keeps shaver head clean sterile and long lasting.</li>
            <li> and i went to clean the bathroom and wipe down his razor and it</li>
            <li> Even though Braun still sells MANY electric razors using these cartridges, they&#x27;re hard to find in any stores.  </li>
            <li> other reviews, the cleaning fluid is easy to spill when removing the plastic seal cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice to buy them in bulk, especially since it&#x27;s hard to find them locally (for a reasonably price, too).</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have suggested I have found that placing the cap back on when your not using the cleaner does help it last longer, but I feel the MOST IMPORTANT step to making it last is to rinse all the hair out of razor and let it dry a bit before you use the cleaning dock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just surprised that it&#x27;s still made given how frequently things change &amp; newer models are developed.</li>
            <li> I was previously a Norelco shaver user and struggled to manually clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Much better than expected, lasts longer than expected</li>
            <li> it came in a clear liquid.</li>
            <li> Cleaning action is thorough and complete.</li>
            <li> Take the old one out.</li>
            <li> Probably direct import from China.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done to complete satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;Far</li>
            <li> For the price of this product, Braun has clearly designed a product that requires frequent repurchases once you start to like the product.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for this necessary supply.</li>
            <li> Could have refilled my old container.</li>
            <li> The 4 pack offers a cheaper unit price and convenient case to store them away.</li>
            <li> At least with this offering I get more of them for my money.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying these individually at a store.</li>
            <li> It also improves the smell of a scuzzy razor considerably.</li>
            <li> They are lasting much longer and cleaning just as well.</li>
            <li> product arrived early.  </li>
            <li> Bought the value pack and all 4 are the real deal, same labels as my originals.</li>
            <li> not so much the refill&#x27;s fault, but perhaps an overall product design.</li>
            <li> Although, the Frustration Free packaging is marginally more difficult to open than the two packs in the manufacturer packaging.</li>
            <li> I AM 83 YRS OLD AND GETTING TO THE STORE THAT CARRIES</li>
            <li> I think cleaning the razor in necessary, but these are really costly.  </li>
            <li> These are necessary for cleaning my razor and it is much cheaper getting them here than getting them at the store.</li>
            <li> They last much longer this way (when the solution can&#x27;t evaporate).</li>
            <li> Seems to help so far.</li>
            <li> I bought a box of these thinking they would have to be changed frequently.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper then I can find locally.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap Chinese knockoff that is not the same Braun formula and does not have the mesh sreen baring dirt to be cycled back during cleaning.</li>
            <li> So, far, work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Considerable savings over store bought refills.</li>
            <li> Direct replacement.</li>
            <li> It is early days.  </li>
            <li> much cheaper then picking up locally.</li>
            <li> The contents are listed as alchohol, and the heads seem to wear faster than the old method of manually cleaning and oiling the head.</li>
            <li> A real value compared to big box and specialty stores.</li>
            <li> I really like the Braun Cleaning system, but the fluid evaporates on</li>
            <li> Cleans razor head and ready for next use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can smell the alcohol in this product when you remove the seal, but refilling old cartridges does not work well.</li>
            <li> not just leave the open product in the cleaning system for much of it</li>
            <li> Purchasing these through Amazon is Much Cheaper than finding these locally.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this product was made in China......</li>
            <li> No wasted time or gas in the truck just click and its at your door in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> They are much cheaper than the ones at local stores.</li>
            <li> It does not extend the blade life of the razor as far as the owners manual says you can push it, but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need any food coloring for the blue color.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> So in that unit, I began using straight rubbing alcohol -- just enough of a splash to get through a cleaning cycle (or three).</li>
            <li> how much can you say about razor cleaner fluid?  </li>
            <li> There is a considerable saving by purchasing these in bulk.</li>
            <li> My oldest son used my old Braun shaver since I upgraded.  </li>
            <li> This whole replacement business is based on fluid evaporation.</li>
            <li> delivery was fast enough, and are  as advertised.</li>
            <li> I plan to try the refill that Amazon offers that has a lubricant but the shipping charges are stopping me.</li>
            <li> Considerably cheaper buying here than buying through Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li> I really like the Braun Series 7 shaver that I bought recently.  </li>
            <li> Needed this for my Braun shaver now 10 plus yrs old, in part, no doubt, as a result of using this.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need only two for a whole year?</li>
            <li> Cleans the razor completely..</li>
            <li> OEM, as far as I can tell, replacements for my Braun electric shaver cleaning system.</li>
            <li> If you can find at a cheaper price I would be surprised.</li>
            <li> Given that the fluid in these refills evaporate over time, even for long periods when the shaver isn&#x27;t used, I couldn&#x27;t accept that I was losing a full cartridge to maybe 5 cleanings.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy, fast-growing beard, and sensitive skin which leaves me few good options besides Braun.  </li>
            <li> Since it is the only cleaning fluid that I know of for the Braun Series 7 electric shaver, I guess it&#x27;s the right</li>
            <li> Not much you can say about shaver refills - they&#x27;re standard Braun Clean &amp; Renew cartridges, but this is a very inexpensive way to buy them, plus they come in a simple box and you don&#x27;t have to fight through any packaging.  </li>
            <li> I dry the shaver on a towel, making sure it&#x27;s as dry as possible in the time I have</li>
            <li> Using the clean and renew cartages make a noticeable different in the longevity of the cutting head, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I shave daily in the mornings and have quite a bit of stubble but only clean the razor with the fluid 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li> One pack will last you a year if you close it back up after use and only clean once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Another thing I see people saying is its not worth buying  because it evaporates to quick</li>
            <li> save on cartridges, I clean the shaver every day with the little brush.</li>
            <li> The cartridges typically come in cardboard box that&#x27;s fairly easy to open.</li>
            <li> The clean &amp; renew cartridges cleaned my shaver in the old model self-cleaner, but they suffered from heavy rates of evaporation.  </li>
            <li> I had been avoiding purchasing these cleaning units for some time due to their cost, but their ease of use makes the purchase well worth it.</li>
            <li> I had made my own version of the cleaner using an empty cartridge but with the low price of $4, it is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No mess and just throw away</li>
            <li> No mess....</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I still prefer my old Braun and was lucky enough to have bought extra foils prior to them being phased out.</li>
            <li> very smart clean and last long (almost 2 and half month now and still</li>
            <li> He has been using it for 6+ years (only getting a new blade maybe once or twice!).</li>
            <li> I use my razor everyday the cleared keeps my razor clean.</li>
            <li> Content evaporates fast if not closed properly.</li>
            <li> I used my first Braun for about ten years in conjunction with this system, and the only reason I stopped using it is because I couldn&#x27;t find replacement foils/cutters for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> big deal, not recommended unless you have the main cleaner unit.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; it became but generally think the refill (fluid) cartridge design leaves consumers paying too much too often.</li>
            <li> This will last forever... or a decent amount of time, but when it&#x27;s finished</li>
            <li> Pretty simple product that is the same as you would buy in a store.</li>
            <li> this particular item from Amazon has easy to open packaging and is sold at a significant discount from our local grocer and it gets expensive to change these as often as I need to otherwise.</li>
            <li> Have used these for ten years, including with my old and new Braun Shavers.</li>
            <li> Just save the cap when you open it a new one to use on the old one that it is replacing.</li>
            <li> I like my Braun razor but not having to pay a lot of money for these excessively packaged containers of what I suspect is alcohol/water with some light fragrance added.</li>
            <li> Economical and work as well as more expensive local retailer products</li>
            <li> I switched back to Braun recently, and found that these were much easier to replace than my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m not yet sure if the &amp;#34;Frustration Free&amp;#34; packaging really cuts down on the waste though, the corrugated cardboard seems like more material than the standard thin cardboard box the cartridges normally come in, and mine got mashed in shipping, but the cartridges arrived alright.</li>
            <li> Next time you dock/charge your razor, it&#x27;s cleaning like new.</li>
            <li> It totally cleans my Braun like new.</li>
            <li> The Braun system requires a new cartridge with its hygienic, sterilizing fluid  after about 30 cleanings.</li>
            <li> It operates new because of the daily maintenance provided by the solution in the cartridges,</li>
            <li> We live in a rural area with a 70 mile trip to the nearest shopping area.  </li>
            <li> How do you review a fluid used to clean and slightly lubricate an electric shaver?</li>
            <li> Does the same job as the individually packaged OEM cartridges at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li> The whole unit seems well designed, and I only run the cleaner when it requires total cleaning.</li>
            <li> This refill package seems to be the least expensive and when it is done on the auto ship makes perfect sense to me!</li>
            <li> This is now a major factor for me when looking at new potential razors.</li>
            <li> Look at the price for 4 of these units at under $5/ month and which always last me closer to 6 months than 4 coming to less than $3/ month, and understand your blades and foils lasting longer will pay for these even if you don&#x27;t value your time that highly to avoid daily light</li>
            <li> I go through one every two months or so,so the subscribe and save on this is about right, but every once in a while I have to stop it to cut down my stockpile of these things.  </li>
            <li> One trick is to save the cap and place it on between uses but this is a major annoyance to have to take the cap on and off.</li>
            <li> use \\&quot;Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot;, which comes out cheaper than getting it from major retails.</li>
            <li> I will go on line to all of the major department store website, then I will come here.  </li>
            <li> They come in a cardboard box and not much other packaging.</li>
            <li> These do the trick but one of the 4 was only half full.  </li>
            <li> The price is right but each refill lasts a month or less.</li>
            <li> Things cannot be simpler - open up the cleaning station, slide out the old one, open and slide in the new one.  </li>
            <li> Less cardboard waste than the old packaging, and a better price per cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> receiving a single star due to receiving a can of zippo premium butane fuel instead of the Braun clean and renew cartridge refills.</li>
            <li> The cartridges fit in the cleaner that comes with the razors and they do clean and lubricate the cutting surfaces.</li>
            <li> After a stroke several years ago, I&#x27;ve been grooming my husband and floundering with several older model Braun electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> Using the cleaning system with a razor full of hair only dilutes the cleaning solution and makes it not clean as well.</li>
            <li> little hint on making these last longer is when the light turns yellow</li>
            <li> and I only hit the clean button when it hits the third level down.  </li>
            <li> Works great and cost isn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li> I just wish these refills in general lasted longer and were cheaper.  </li>
            <li> This product is clear ad smells like it is just alcohol only.  </li>
            <li> The yellow light (not the green!)</li>
            <li> I recognize this is, clearly, Braun&#x27;s take on Gillette&#x27;s business model of recurring revenue, addicting you to the convenience of their cleaning solution for a low monthly price.  </li>
            <li> How much this expensive fluid adds to it I am not so sure.</li>
            <li> You open your Braun cleaning station, slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal as far as function</li>
            <li> I believe you&#x27;re really not saving much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far.</li>
            <li> So far used only 1 refill.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, the razor has lasted me five years of daily use.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this cleaner really.</li>
            <li> am old and only shave 3 to 4 times a week which reduces the need for the cleaning</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like the old commercial &amp;#34; Set it up and leave it&amp;#34; it does the job all by itselg.</li>
            <li> Auto ship and arrives as expected with reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Not only does it do a great job, but the charging/cleaning base is really handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having used Braun razors for 25 years I can confidently say however that the purchase is unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> This latest batch is even worse.</li>
            <li> Kind of silly to review these.</li>
            <li> The shave is better but not great.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be much easier to clean my new razor, just drop it in and press the button, half hour later it is cleaned, dried and lubricated for my next shave.</li>
            <li> But the convenience and few extra dollars is well worth having your razor work like new even after years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> buying several at once is much cheaper than buying singly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you find in the store for quite a bit less.  </li>
            <li> These things work really well, they just don&#x27;t last long enough.  </li>
            <li> They fit fine, are less expensive in a four-pack</li>
            <li> I purchased a four pack of these with my new razor because these are more expensive almost everywhere else that I have looked for them locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say that that works almost as well as these genuine Braun cartridges, minus the rubbing alcohol smell (supposedly solved by adding a few drops of essence of lemon -- not that I&#x27;ve tried it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the store the product has a lemon scent and is blue, where this one is clear and only smells like alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I recommend you pass on the refills unless you personally found a marked improvement in your shaving experience with the trial fluid included with the razor.</li>
            <li> I bought these through subscribe and save for several months until I ran out unexpectedly and bought one from a local store.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to run to my local big box store in the early morning hours.  </li>
            <li> I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I&#x27;m the only one, but so far I give it only 3 stars because of this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each cartridge last much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are apparently all the same</li>
            <li> agent that apparently is in the actual Braun refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do wish there was a better disposal method of the used ones instead of throwing the whole cartridge containing the dirty cleaning fluid into the trash.</li>
            <li> I understand the frustration of paying for a Braun razor (not the cheapest around) and then paying extra money for the replacement foil/cutters annually AND these fluid cartridges, but it seems to me that these cartridges do a good job of cleaning/lubricating the cutting head/foil and that helps to provide a longer use for the product and provide a nicer shave.</li>
            <li> I usually refill each one twice before putting in a factory fresh one again.</li>
            <li> At first, I had a few doubts, but I&#x27;ve never had a shaver like this.  </li>
            <li> Now that the price has gone down, it&#x27;s probably not worth the effort to use the Everclear, Lemon essential oil, light machine oil that I used before.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of cleaning &amp; oiling my old razor, so I got the Braun Series 5 Clean &amp; Renew system.  </li>
            <li> The product was the correct cleaning refill for the Braun 70s shaver and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans the electric shaver cassette extremely well!</li>
            <li> If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal, covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help.</li>
            <li> Not sure what &#x27;frustration free&#x27; really means.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing holding this back from 5 stars is the pressure you need to pop open the cap without the cartridge sliding out of your grip and the inevitable spray of a few alcohol droplets when you do.</li>
            <li> Small box, no leaks, convenient way to find just the right component.</li>
            <li> The previous cartridge lasted a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> ( less pricey and very convenient to have it sent to your front doormat)</li>
            <li> These steps really prolong the life of the individual cartridge and cut down on cost.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy them again, especially knowing that I would pay about five times as much for the same cartridges found in Walgreen&#x27;s and other, similar retailers.</li>
            <li> I do pop the blades off and quickly rinsed out the whiskers before putting in the cleaning base most time.</li>
            <li> After spending a large amount of money on the Braun 7-760 system and it stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> exact fit and where alot less expensive then buying the indevidualy</li>
            <li> Any time I&#x27;ve gone on a trip away from the cleaning base for even a few days, it&#x27;s an extreme joy to pop the unit in the cleaner and get a fresh shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning every other day may seem like a money-saving idea, but I have found that even if you don&#x27;t use it for weeks, the cleaning fluid still evaporates and you have to replace it almost as frequently, so I figure I might as well get the benefit of cleaning rather than</li>
            <li> I was using it on a daily basis; one day I go to take out the razor and use it, and that nice, clean, lemoney smell had be replaced by a reeeeeaally nasty one!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say other than this really does make a difference in the shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning every other day may seem like a money-saving idea, but I have found that even if you don&#x27;t use it for weeks, the cleaning fluid still evaporates and you have to replace it almost as frequently, so I figure I might as well get the benefit of cleaning rather than</li>
            <li> One big complaint though is it dries out very fast when not used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s the only game in town to clean the razor...</li>
            <li> Aside from my face and neck breaking out (can&#x27;t clean the inside enough) or poorly lubricating the shaver head(s)</li>
            <li> I guess it works, but despite having a Braun logo on the cartridges, all the other writing is in either Chinese, Korean, or some other oriental language, and the smell of the cleaning solution is much, much stronger than I can remember.  </li>
            <li> This is the exact same cleaning refills for the Braun razor cleaning base that are sold in 2 or 3 packs in stores for much more.</li>
            <li> Seems to go from green to red a little quickly, but not yet a deal-breaker.  </li>
            <li> Seems to last only so long.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, I can only get 2-3 cleanings out of them before the machine reads \\&quot;empty.\\&quot;  A single cartridge used to last several wks.     </li>
            <li> A cheaper deal was found not by buying the larger bulk single item but multiple of a smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> We live in Las Vegas (dry heat, dry conditions) and what I have found that made this product last long is to use it, TAKE IT OUT OF THE SHAVER after cleaning, REPLACE THE CAP it came with and store it in a dry place.</li>
            <li> Only problem is they don&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I have is that my shaver doesn&#x27;t completely dry following a cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> These four refills will last nearly a year and a half, I&#x27;d estimate.</li>
            <li> They fit right in my Braun cleaning base and last me about two months under daily use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t  seem to last as long as earlier&lt;</li>
            <li> if you been using Braun long enough, you just trust that company.</li>
            <li> That makes the cartridge last longer between replacements and saves me a couple of bucks in the long run.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mind the non-OEM packaging as long as the product inside is the same.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> AND IT LASTS LONG ENOUGH FOR ME FOR THE COST!</li>
            <li> I like it ,just dont last as long as it should</li>
            <li> This order will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The cardridges seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have dense beard growth, but I still have to shave once a day, so the cartridges last me a long time.</li>
            <li> cleans that nasty razor and leaves it nice and fresh for the next use.</li>
            <li> I add a little 70% isopropyl alcohol to just below the level they were at when new.</li>
            <li> You can definitely use plain alcohol for awhile, a month or two, but should buy a new cartrige after that.</li>
            <li> I tried to not pay the high price for these cartridges by using plain alcohol.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I was a little surprised was the labeling.</li>
            <li> What I expected from that cartridge was it made in ireland, whereas it was made in china, which is very diluted, and it is not original</li>
            <li> There are no major alternatives, but it works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Negatives: No Major problems.</li>
            <li> This product will help my razor last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The cartridge refills are easy to use, although I wish they could find a way for consumers to empty the dirty cleaner, wash out and refill the cartridge with new cleaner.</li>
            <li> I typically use the refill until it is clear that the solution is cloudy.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but you can easily refill them yourself.  </li>
            <li> This makes it last a heck of a lot longer and doesn&#x27;t dry up.  </li>
            <li> It simply inserts into the Braun battery recharging station which, in addition, makes sure the Braun cutting edges are always sharpened.  </li>
            <li> Of course you&#x27;ll want to wait for it to dry, because if you still have alcohol on your razor while you&#x27;re shaving it will definitely burn.</li>
            <li> 4-pack of cleaning cartridges should last me 6-9 months of regular cleaning (roughly every 10 days).  </li>
            <li> Product is over priced in general and use every other cleaning.</li>
            <li> Each day I simply take off the foil/blade mechanism and brush it out and tap it on the side of the sink to get loose anything and also brush out the inside of the razor itself.</li>
            <li> But i think in the future I will keep the used cartridges--clean them out and buy the bulk refill fluid that comes in different fragrances--and less $$$$</li>
            <li> One of my cartridges broke open during transit and the cleaning solution got over not only my the other cartridges but my carpet as well.</li>
            <li> I like how simple it is to clean this razor, but these refills are expensive.</li>
            <li> Hard to say much about it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the high cost.</li>
            <li> What I have been doing recently, when the fluid starts to get low, is replenishing the catridge with a little isopropyl alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews here and found that removing the cartridge after cleaning does in fact make them last longer, so I find that I am buying replacement refills less frequently.</li>
            <li> Kind of made the purchase a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Too bad we can&#x27;t get Obama and his kind to do as they promised.</li>
            <li> I was not feeling any disappointment with amazon, I was able to recieve the package on their promised date.</li>
            <li> It will extend the life of your Braun shaver and save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> and I think it has lasted as long as it has because I use this product all the time.</li>
            <li> No problems, long shaver head life.</li>
            <li> buying in bulk saves you in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I will order these again and again as long as the Braun  holds up..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying these as long as this shaver holds up.</li>
            <li> - No real variety for purchasing this item as it is manufacturer only, but watch you price per unit.</li>
            <li> It took him that long to go through the cleaning cartridge that came with the shaver (end of Jan).</li>
            <li> A LONG TIME AND</li>
            <li> Sometimes you buy two, dometimes four, but the various quantities can vary widely in unit cost.</li>
            <li> Used these a long time.</li>
            <li> Why force me to write a long review?</li>
            <li> I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so, and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it&#x27;s kept capped to prevent evaporation.</li>
            <li> Having switched from a long time Braun user to a Norelco Sensotouch 3D</li>
            <li> The off brand refilsalso have a strange odor..</li>
            <li> No leakers, but some minor variation in fill amounts between cartridges.  </li>
            <li> The net result is efficient packaging with minimal waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He still trims it if he let it get too long before he shaves, cause he doesn&#x27;t want to tear it up with long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only way to look acceptable without having to use the wet shaver every morning for him.</li>
            <li> but I have been buying it for my razor cleaning system for a long time just out of convenience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchasing the four pack at a time will probably benefit you over the long run.</li>
            <li> Rubbing Alcohol, 42 drops Lemon Essential Oil (one half teaspon) from Amazon and 5 drops of Blue Food Coloring (Optional).</li>
            <li> I was told that the cartridges only last less than 30 days...</li>
            <li> It evaporates quickly and seems complicated when an alternate procedure is also mentioned in the razor&#x27;s instructions.  </li>
            <li> a long, long, time and save you money that way!</li>
            <li> What I received was clear plain denaturated alcohol.</li>
            <li> Originally I was scary to use it because all description in hieroglyphs.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers noted to prevent the refills from evaporating put the lid back after you use it.</li>
            <li> It is made we the same quality of other packaging for it.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Now my little tiny hairs go in the blue water instead of on the floor.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Original product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the only way to stop this is to do what other have mentioned on here.....</li>
            <li> they last a long time (I shave almost daily and exchanged these every few months)</li>
            <li> Other razors should use the same.</li>
            <li> i will buy again once i will run out in very very long time</li>
            <li> When they run dry, I wash them out thoroughly and refill with 90% rubbing alcohol and use again.  </li>
            <li> Mine tend to dry out on me since I shaved every three days.</li>
            <li> I like a clean shaver, but this is an expensive and environmentally irresponsible way to accomplish the task.  </li>
            <li> The product keeps my Braun shaver clean and this offer allows my cleanings to not be as expensive.  </li>
            <li> nothing much to say - it does fit the Braun base and cleans as advertised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> My husband has the series 7 braun shaver and the clean refills are expensive.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can say is that the cleaning solution dissolves the silver paint covering on the end of the shaver near the head.</li>
            <li> and I had constant &#x27;catching&#x27; - argh - &#x27;hate that</li>
            <li> Save some money buying the four pack versus a single in a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer to just buy a single gallon bottle and refill the cartridge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient having them sent to me every 4 months instead of stacking up a year&#x27;s supply in a limited storage area.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to dispose of the old ones, though.</li>
            <li> I hate the idea of having to buy cleaning solution for my razor, but it really does help clean the blades.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that I have to plan to purchase these online going forward.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and went for a subscription.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> This product must have set in a warehouse for a very long time, each container was equally depleted (not full)</li>
            <li> typically use the cleaning cycle after each usage and each cleaning fluid lasts about 30 to 45</li>
            <li> However, cleaning solution occasionally lasts only 3-4 weeks, instead of  my usual 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars only because I think it&#x27;s slightly overpriced.</li>
            <li> The solution had the same fragrance as the previous store bought cartridge and appeared to perform as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One less thing to have to worry about and deal with in the future.</li>
            <li> Consider keeping the used containers as you can also buy refill fluids with different or no fragrance for even less.</li>
            <li> only need to run the cleaning cycle once or less per week</li>
            <li> My only issue is that they evaporate in less than a month.</li>
            <li> What a value, same stuff you buy in the store but for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and as described, I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive to replace though</li>
            <li> Only down side is not really knowing when it is time to change out.</li>
            <li> Expensive but keeps razor clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> They were new as described and fit into the base.</li>
            <li> They last a little over a month.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this has anything to do with my Braun shaver model, but it&#x27;s a little gross when you&#x27;re shaving and cleaning solution residue is smeared across your face...</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to get here, but that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm spoiled by prime</li>
            <li> I click my shaver in to the base and it makes it as clean as new</li>
            <li> Too bad razors didnt fit!</li>
            <li> If you do not use this and replace the heads frequently the shaver is not effective.</li>
            <li> These refills are difficult to get in quantity at local stores and are frequently very overpriced.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that I wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Historically I&#x27;d always run out when purchasing them individually and never liked the idea of stocking up until seeing the deal with this 4 count.  </li>
            <li> My Braun shaver must be at least 8 years old.  </li>
            <li> He usually runs the cleaning cycle after every use and shaves about five times a week, but these still last a really long time for</li>
            <li> Tricky German engineer capitalists (at least I think they&#x27;re German).</li>
            <li> Work just as expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> The product was as expected and delivered promptly</li>
            <li> Product as expected.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy for  me to get into the back of my car.  </li>
            <li> On mine, you know it&#x27;s time to change it when the blades are still wet after 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here, these are replacements for the shaver cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> It actually seems like a waste.</li>
            <li> When I 1st bought the Braun Shaver my 1st thought was why I spent $200.00 on a shaver.</li>
            <li> My Braun razor is money well spent.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when pulling the snap as this can sometimes cause spillage.  </li>
            <li> There is not much to say.</li>
            <li> Only take a few seconds to do this each time</li>
            <li> Everything came on time and as expected</li>
            <li> Not a very earth-friendly solution.</li>
            <li> No big waste.</li>
            <li> Just the way I expected.</li>
            <li> Must be careful not to tip the unit.</li>
            <li> The product is just as expected</li>
            <li> Items worked with exception that one of the cartridges arrived empty.</li>
            <li> Always perform as expected</li>
            <li> OEM replacement worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> The refills I received were official Braun products, and are doing the job as expected.</li>
            <li> These cartridges would last two or three cleanings or in some cases not even be recognized at all before the the red light on the base unit came on.  </li>
            <li> Not really anything else to it</li>
            <li> use them all thse time, must have bought about 40 the last few years</li>
            <li> I do suggest taking the pack out and capping it then only charging every few uses rather than every use.</li>
            <li> just as specified and expected.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected and on time, fits Series 7 cleaning station</li>
            <li> One was completely empty.  </li>
            <li> not much else to say</li>
            <li> The $$$$ I spent for this shaver</li>
            <li> The cartridges should be refillable, with minimal additional plastic.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> The refills should generally last for a few months.</li>
            <li> When I opened my package, it was set up as I expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> My husband is disabled and cannot use a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say, just a refill cartridge.</li>
            <li> Came as expected, packed well</li>
            <li> Works as well as can be expected, but I wish there was another way.</li>
            <li> Not much of a review, but what can you say.</li>
            <li> As expected, but always overpriced no matter where you get them...</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and as expected without any damage.  </li>
            <li> Saves time and miles formerly spent looking for refills.</li>
            <li> While this makes it safer the unintended side effect is that after you shave you may find licking your lips to be quite bitter.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected - 4 cleaning cartridges for my Braun.</li>
            <li> The product itself is not much to comment on.</li>
            <li> Using the cleaning function of the base station is an effective way to restore the efficacy of the shaver, but it comes at a price.  </li>
            <li> ordered eight of them, unfortunately items marked Flammable brand and not subject to postal delivery in Russia.</li>
            <li> Though the whole concept of buying disposable refills for your shaver is a little ridiculous, these get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Replacement cartridges, plain and simple</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, for many years all you needed was a little running water, a small brush to reach difficult areas in the cutter grooves, and you were done.</li>
            <li> The liquid was a very pale blue tint;  my previous purchases were 2 and 3-packs with the darker blue color.  </li>
            <li> This is a proprietary product for a closed system application, therefore it is extremely overpriced for what it is - 99% water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time I run the cleaning cycle on the razor, no matter how dirty it is, it comes out with the Clean and Renew cartridges looking brand</li>
            <li> Side by side it smells like a harsh chemical that I&#x27;m not sure why I ever put it near my face.  </li>
            <li> I can change my delivery to be a little earlier if I find that my timing is slightly off.  </li>
            <li> Braun must be watering these down because they last less and less all the time.</li>
            <li> A have to have accessory for the cleaning system - rather expensive by the single anywhere - reasonable here - as almost always in today&#x27;s market, the manufacturers get you on the disposables.</li>
            <li> hope Amazon starts selling these things directly since buying it from J&amp;R is not a good deal because of the shipping charges.</li>
            <li> The product shipped with the correct number of replacement cartridges, but two of them were completely empty!</li>
            <li> It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy.</li>
            <li> I usually go 6-8 refills on one cartridge and then move to the next.</li>
            <li> So I emptied the cartridge into my sink and noticed hair was with the liquid, which tells me they have sent me a used cartridge along with the other 3 refills.  </li>
            <li> I tried refilling my other with water and alcohol...</li>
            <li> Exactly as described but a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> have found no noticeable difference by cleaning my shaver every other use instead of every time.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say!</li>
            <li> What I discovered is that the drain hole back to the reservoir is quite small (to limit evaporation?)</li>
            <li> Other razors I&#x27;ve used had to be manually cleaned</li>
            <li> Lemon has sugar (and other impurities) in it, and alcohol doesn&#x27;t have lubricating agents and may strip the lubricating that the blades need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead, go to Walgreens or some other store that sells the shaver system, and buy it there.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s wrong with brushing the cassette and rinsing it in hot water?</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> and I believe it is largely due to this product</li>
            <li> Ordered one box with 4 refills and was classified by Borderlinx as prohibited item due to the alcohol content.</li>
            <li> This is a Chinese knock off, and not authentic Braun product-.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve our jaded replacement cartridges before and they were usually from my local RiteAid and it was 2 in a box of replacements for like $25</li>
            <li> Will probably not use cleaning &amp; charging step as often as recommended, this would be excessive use of cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li> I read a other reviews on this site</li>
            <li> I shave just about every other day</li>
            <li> I am travelling, I have no alternative other than tap water, as the solution is flammable and not allowed in airlines.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s due to the design of the shaver not the the cartridges, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had issues with mine drying up as some of the other reviewers</li>
            <li> I agree with other posts that these do not have the lemon oil as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I use once every other week.</li>
            <li> I did not like them because they were too sharp and have cut my skin.</li>
            <li> Or, just use it maybe every other day.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than other store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it several times within the past year.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am not aware of an alternative product to do the job of cleaning my razor.</li>
            <li> They seem to be the correct size but not sure that the fluid is what it should be?</li>
            <li> He would not have it any other way..</li>
            <li> zhe ge dong xi ting bu cuo, shen zhi shi bi xu ping if you have bought a 790c or other</li>
            <li> As a buyer I often rely on the reviews of other buyers when making my purchases.</li>
            <li> I have been hesitant about buying the cleaning refill solution, made by someone other than Braun, as I&#x27;ve read they leave some of the solution on the blade and foil.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints here.</li>
            <li> I shave every other day and use the cleaning function once a week.  </li>
            <li> If you have used the automatic cleaner for your Braun electric shaver you already know that the solution must periodically be replaced due to evaporation and use.</li>
            <li> I think the lubricant that is added makes all the difference by keeping the blades sharp.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really go wrong with an order when you know exactly what you are getting</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is any other type of refill you can get for your Braun razor cleaner/charger.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with that other imitation stuff.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive but worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> but seriously... make each one last a year and instead of leaving the little tub in the machine and continually open to the air...  </li>
            <li> Decent product, a little expensive, the alcohol liquid does evaporate so one has to replace these on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> but I think the current design would fail early.  </li>
            <li> For one thing they are too expensive, and don&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> I got my shaver less then a year ago and was lazy to buy a the liquid after the initial one ran out.</li>
            <li> Small enough to store and almost half the price if you bought them in the store.</li>
            <li> A little heavier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Previous electric shavers did not have a cleaning system other than a brush.</li>
            <li> and I now need to order the cleaner less frequently due to getting a &amp;#34;4 pack&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m trying to get in contact with the seller, which is hard since I&#x27;m not sending the cartridge back</li>
            <li> the sucker will last for months!  </li>
            <li> Too expensive - much easier to refill them myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed or something else, but now my razor is covered in a yellow green goo.  </li>
            <li> But the cover flaps are difficult to open and I generally splash some on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I expect this 4-pack to last at least a year.</li>
            <li> I find by using just once a week and keeping the cap on the unit in between uses, the cartridges last at least three months each...</li>
            <li> Work very well but expensive for what they do.</li>
            <li> I average one refill just about every 35 days.</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> There is a confusing array of price choices for various Brauns.</li>
            <li> I like that these are common within several Braun models.</li>
            <li> This seals it from the air which slowly evaporates the fluid.</li>
            <li> I hate putting more plastic in the landfill.</li>
            <li> They are what they are, and they have never let me down after owning a Braun shaver for three years.</li>
            <li> hands down...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the mundane stuff like razor cleaning refills, so nothing to jump up and down about, but they show up on time.  </li>
            <li> By cleaning and lubricating my Braun shaver with this solution, I have significantly reduced painful razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I could care less if it came in a paper sack, I am not putting it on display, just storing it until I need to use it.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the manufacturer is trying to save money by using less cleaner.  </li>
            <li> This means that I still pay less using these than I would if I had to continuously buy shaving cream and razor blades.</li>
            <li> They typically hold out for me for about 2-3 months typically.</li>
            <li> So I agree with the previous comment of keeping the lid on when not in use.  </li>
            <li> It also gives the razor a slight lemony alcohol scent, or is it an alcoholy lemon scent...?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over half a year</li>
            <li> just wish it would cost less.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Positive: the package was delivered on the day it was promised, even with all the black Friday frustration.</li>
            <li> I had no problem at all with the packaging since it was frustration free and loading it into the base worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I decided to stick with a Braun product and find it for less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Less cost.</li>
            <li> Nothing less.</li>
            <li> Price of this product less than at the stores.</li>
            <li> I gave half of this as a gift and kept the other half for me!</li>
            <li> Considering a bottle of cleaning alcohol is less than a dollar</li>
            <li> no us made runs out in half the time a US made one does</li>
            <li> Received this quickly so no issues there.</li>
            <li> I see no advantage of this versus the previous model which just required washing under running water.</li>
            <li> I used to save &amp; refill them but at this price why bother, it&#x27;s not worth the little I was saving or the mess involved.</li>
            <li> However, I tried refilling one of these with a generic astringent alcohol, and the results were not good.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like to mess with putting the cap on and off all the time.</li>
            <li> ,that is not true at all, if it does you will never notice it.</li>
            <li> Every few years, I break down and buy some of these.  </li>
            <li> The product comes tightly packed in a sturdy cardboard box.</li>
            <li> They were less expensive as well, and last just as long as the originals.</li>
            <li> But I purchased with my new Braun Series 7 and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Easy to assemble into the base.</li>
            <li> They are easy to insert into the Braun shaver base.</li>
            <li> They are installed easily in the razor&#x27;s base and work each day to maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of the razor</li>
            <li> Old cartridge was disgusting and full of hair that isn&#x27;t everywhere else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for at least three years without a single problem.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price; these arrived just as shown in the photo - in a brown box unwrapped and unsealed; it could be that these refills are refills, not original Braun-filled products.  </li>
            <li> Save a little money on packaging.  </li>
            <li> Just get some ethanol, glycerine and a little lemon scent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave as often as some though, so that could go up a little, perhaps, for some.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky to pop the lid.</li>
            <li> not really many other options than just refilling the thing with water</li>
            <li> The price could be a little lower though.</li>
            <li> However there is no way to use these without spilling a little liquid.</li>
            <li> You can pay$ 15.00 for 1 &amp; I received 4 for a little over $20.oo</li>
            <li> These are a component of a shaving system, any complaints I would have would come from the unit itself and not this little guy.  </li>
            <li> I do sometime spill a little when I change them</li>
            <li> had it been a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> is that the price appears to go up a little with each refill.</li>
            <li> Also the scent is weak compared to locally purchased Bran cartridge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not original quality of liquid.</li>
            <li> it is not original product and it does not contain lubricant</li>
            <li> The difference with this product is it comes in a plain cardboard packaging instead of retail packaging - and it costs less than the retail packaged product.  </li>
            <li> I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> You will see a yellow/orange color light on the base unit that lets you know when it needs to be changed.  </li>
            <li> Completely useless, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> heavy beard is treated with power and respect.</li>
            <li> There is too much waste with this system.</li>
            <li> and they fit my Razor base.</li>
            <li> If you have a Braun shaver you know what these are and they are not cheap.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few seconds but satisfies the cheapskate in me.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews on this product before I bought it.</li>
            <li> This product was not available in any store in my city.  </li>
            <li> Needed replacement cartridges and why not buy in bulk to save a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> It leaked all over and wasted 2/3 of the solution.  </li>
            <li> At that rate I only have to change them approximately every three months.  </li>
            <li> and it was gone in a few days.</li>
            <li> I once used a different electric razor and it didn&#x27;t cut well and cleaned poorly.</li>
            <li> Four stars because $20 for a bit of alcohol and cleaning solution mixed together is a bit farcical.</li>
            <li> Took a few pictures to show a comparison</li>
            <li> will evaporate and go to waste.  </li>
            <li> They do not need to be used everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t refill it with water unless you plan on cleaning it out every few days.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for my package and realized that it may take longer because I ordered it a few days before thanksgiving.</li>
            <li> Have bought them a few times now.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard and shave about 15 times a month.</li>
            <li> cant imagine it being any worse than it actually is!!</li>
            <li> Shake a few times.</li>
            <li> Works well as I have been using my home made solution for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;Charlie E</li>
            <li> The cost is not cheap when you consider the cost of the razor and the trouble ordering these cartridges.</li>
            <li> I have found you can reload these cartridges with 70 persent rubbing alcohol and a few drops of a scent for a fraction of the cost of ordering these.</li>
            <li> Look up ways to refill these things on utube, order a few and keep the plastic holder and refill them for almost nothing at home.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the cleaning function everyday, probably a couple times a week.  </li>
            <li> and I can be on time everyday for work.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of an electric razor, but hated buying the refills for my Braun.</li>
            <li> Shaver refills run out after a few cleanings.  </li>
            <li> Each refill lasts me about a month used once every few days.</li>
            <li> However, the ones at Amazoncost much less!  </li>
            <li> Necessary evil to keep my Braun shaver running clean ~&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> Comes in the plain cardboard box shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> four refills in a plain box.</li>
            <li> Its safer to just use water, clean the shaver with a brush, rinse the head/foil out, and tap it on the side of the sink to knock the crap out (dont knock the blade piece, the plastic part where it attachs to the shaver).</li>
            <li> ‚Äì I think it‚Äôs the cleaning solution lengthened the life of the unit, which is not easy on the pocket either.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> They are quite expensive, but what are you going to do when there is no other alternative?</li>
            <li> I wish the cleaning fluid was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, and it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it is noticeable.</li>
            <li> Maybe leaving the shaver in the cradle slow that down (like having a lid).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with these refills, but the cartridges themselves seemed to have changed about 6-12 mos ago.  </li>
            <li> if you have this model of the Braun razor so there are not many choices.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this part of the Braun razor daily process.  </li>
            <li> The 4-pack on Amazon is usually the cheapest that I find (when calculating the shipping).</li>
            <li> but it is so small that it sometimes gets plugged by stubble.  </li>
            <li> It give my shaver a bath the cleans and sterilizers, I get no more bumps on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will do that once per cartridge, no more than that.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I can say about this except that it works without any problems.</li>
            <li> The stuff is basically denatured alcohol and fragrance, so I&#x27;m not sure where the &amp;#34;lubricating&amp;#34; would come from.</li>
            <li> the refills can be quite expensive if bought separately in smaller packs</li>
            <li> As usual, as described and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.. Maybe this item had been on shelf for a while..</li>
            <li> Since the system is not working the extra cartridges are useless.</li>
            <li> No more comments about this</li>
            <li> Now compare that with expensive regular razor blades and shaving cream....  </li>
            <li> I usually have to spend eleven or twelve dollars for a two-pak..</li>
            <li> I have ordered others from Amazon and Ebay and they were made in Europe, I am not sure of the quality of the ones made in China.</li>
            <li> Only thing you need to be wary of is they&#x27;re alcohol based so they will evaporate over time.</li>
            <li> This usually supports it being genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course amazon had taped the opening so that the package would not open randomly.</li>
            <li> I bought my husband his razor for Christmas and we found we cannot get these in our small town.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have the wrong facial hair.</li>
            <li> On cartridge usually lasts about a month to six weeks.</li>
            <li> and I cannot find them in the store I usually go to.  </li>
            <li> Actually not sure about the price I paid because I didn&#x27;t compare to anything else.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using a Braun razor for the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these because of the price, beating any brick-and-mortar store two-pack (the way these are usually sold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how additional longevity could be achieved.  </li>
            <li> There is not much more that needs to be said.</li>
            <li> Buying in a four count pack is less expensive than other ways and help with the price.  </li>
            <li> Real expensive when you consider how much a bottle of astringent alcohol costs at a store.</li>
            <li> Over the long run it could get expensive regarding renew cartridges.</li>
            <li> No more cleaning my razor by hand, and no more razor burn!</li>
            <li> But they should be less expensive, and there should be a built in way to avoid evaporative loss of the expensive alcohol based fluid.  </li>
            <li> If you have a Braun razor buy these and save your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Hard to find  Renew cartridge and cleaner sets in a store.  </li>
            <li> I am upset with Braun for selling a product then making it costly and hard to find replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> I understand if the box is snug, since the cartridges are hard plastic, to not put padding.</li>
            <li> the common problem with the brauns...</li>
            <li> So what this is is an effort to inject a &amp;#34;razor blade&amp;#34; style of continual purchase requirement into the electric world, and suckers like me go for</li>
            <li> These are truly &amp;#34;frustration free&amp;#34;, or are at least for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using these cleaning catridges for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The easiest thing to do is, when the solution in the cartridge becomes dirty, shake it out and replace it with rubbing alcohol - at a cost of ten cents.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of cleaning solution for at least four months.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cleaner for at least 7 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found I can stretch each cartridge by refilling myself with recipes commonly found on the internet.  </li>
            <li> As the razor uses these cleaners on an on going basis, try to stock up on the refills so I always have at least one on hand.</li>
            <li> Kinda sucks that they don&#x27;t make a reusable/refillable option</li>
            <li> Only three stars for I do not received my purchanse, this product is dangerous mercadery and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much that the product is bad, it just seems almost unnecessary.</li>
            <li> and I do recommend ordering at least 4.</li>
            <li> which was very time-consuming and annoying.</li>
            <li> Guys if you have a thick beard that is prone ingrown hairs, this product may be your solution.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it as the heads would spin way too slowly</li>
            <li> My husband uses these but they are slow to resend.  </li>
            <li> Used them regularly, until the base unit (the clearner) died --which was due to</li>
            <li> I used to get nasty ingrown hairs that would get infected, this has helped significantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why that excites me!</li>
            <li> Yea, it costs money, but that (for me, at least) is a decadent indulgence without serious side effects.  </li>
            <li> Very shady.</li>
            <li> A 4 count is not only less expensive per unit, it makes remembering to buy them less annoying.</li>
            <li> as descvribed and less expensive</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive than some of the 3 packs.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but works</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but cheaper this way than in the 2-pack.</li>
            <li> A little expensive maintenance, but</li>
            <li> little expensive though.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side for refills</li>
            <li> I find them a little expensive though.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say except it works as intended although it seems a bit expensive for just a few ounces of alcohol?</li>
            <li> Walmart has a pack of 2 for a few cents shy of $12, then add the tax</li>
            <li> When the stuff gets dirty, I empty it, rinse the cartridge and then refill it.</li>
            <li> It fits in your Braun razor charger base and cleans all the loose little beard hair out of the razor.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to open the product and find the labeling in a language I cannot read.  </li>
            <li> Save a buck or two on the alcohol in the tub and spend it on alcohol that&#x27;s cold and in a frosty glass during half time.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s tough to get all the whiskers out when having to refill.  </li>
            <li> While others say this can last months, I found that after 2 months the solution is very dirty.  </li>
            <li> Hope this saves you guys  few bucks !!!</li>
            <li> Less expensive and no wallmart!</li>
            <li> and I always have a hard time paying for these refills at the store because they are so expensive.</li>
            <li> There is only one size cartridge that fits any Braun base.  </li>
            <li> Run the shaving head under tap water and ocassionally put a few drops of oil on the cutting foils.</li>
            <li> I tired some of the others product substitutes</li>
            <li> Expensive suckers</li>
            <li> well maybe it&#x27;s both, but the acne has severely decreased since using this.</li>
            <li> I got tired buying these cartridges one at a time.</li>
            <li> If you have Amazon Prime, this 4-pack of refill cartridges is the least expensive way to purchase this product, which simultaneously cleans and lubricates your razor.  </li>
            <li> After each cleaning of my electric razor I remove this cartridge from the charging base and put the cap back on it.  </li>
            <li> I guess I never experienced frustration using this product before, so</li>
            <li> As others have said, the name of the game is conservation.</li>
            <li> Why are you shipping this to me when I requested several times to canel this crap</li>
            <li> , not sure what I will use these crazy things for.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard &amp; cannot use a &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; razor for neck &amp; under jaw, as Ill get ingrown hair...</li>
            <li> not ideal at all.</li>
            <li> They are so expensive</li>
            <li> Although I think the refill cartridges are expensive, I believe they do help to aid in the longevity of the blades, not to mention sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks like I ordered the wrong cartridges</li>
            <li> That I Did Wrong</li>
            <li> ; routine is TOO complicated.</li>
            <li> Expensive but does the trick.  </li>
            <li> can be expensive the refill</li>
            <li> Are the expensive?</li>
            <li> Too expensive, which cost them one star.</li>
            <li> Also for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> These are usally so expensive, but I have been using them for my razor for 2 years and haven&#x27;t had to replace the blades on it.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> These guys are expensive in the retail stores.  </li>
            <li> Over time, the shaver took on an odor that was difficult to deal with.  </li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s designed to do but they are really expensive.  </li>
            <li> they are expensive but it is what it is.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
            <li> Necessary evil</li>
            <li> But they are quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I received the refills in time bjt have not been using the razor as my replacement head that I ordered from you was the wrong item.  </li>
            <li> Fake product.</li>
            <li> These shouldn&#x27;t be this expensive, but I get it and have basically accepted it.</li>
            <li> but IMO these do get expensive as the years pile up.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses the Braun shaver and we&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding replacement cartridges...</li>
            <li> These cartridges are expensive, but so are the razors.  </li>
            <li> Not a happy camper!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately a bitterant is added to the alcohol</li>
            <li> Wish you didn&#x27;t have to buy these, but expensive razor &#x3D; expensive cleaning supplies...</li>
            <li> Too bad that the Braun Razor does such a miserable job of shaving..</li>
            <li> /&gt;These help keep the razor cutting like a champion.  </li>
            <li> With that close shave I get a dirty shaver.</li>
            <li> If you see all this dirty stuf you see is time for change.</li>
            <li> it does all the dirty work for me.</li>
            <li> A grudging, but required purchase.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want to rub dirty things on your face.)</li>
            <li> This product does what it suppose to, but unfortunately it is very expensive given it&#x27;s make up.  </li>
            <li> A fancy way to sell you very expensive isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> These are very expensive and you can refill them yourself.</li>
            <li> Too bad for me</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about it.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the lube is an oil smell that isn&#x27;t bad, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> Braun is a bad product.</li>
            <li> It is too bad</li>
            <li> It arrives in a package, you pull the tabs off, use the tabs for the contained you&#x27;re replacing, and pop the bad boy in.  </li>
            <li> Basically, creating the alcohol liquid would entail having bad chemicals around...</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed in the shaver, which was very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed this was not correctly advertised.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get that:-(.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm in the OEM charger base</li>
            <li> done set the shaver on the base to start auto self</li>
            <li> I seriously hate it when my Sync runs out of cleaner.  </li>
            <li> The replacement cartridges will evaporate over time and should be replaced when the indicator in the base reflects the time to change.</li>
            <li> I have the Braun 5 series with a cleaner base, so these refills are my lifeblood.  </li>
            <li> so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday, once a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this item but hate writing reviews.</li>
            <li> After you push the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; button on the base unit, these inserts flush the razor with an alcohol based solution inside these cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I used to HATE cleaning my electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I hate having to buy all this plastic...</li>
            <li> hated running out and having to run to CVS and HOPING they had some&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holy crap batman!</li>
            <li> but when I pulled the cartridge out to replace it the thing was completely disgusting.</li>
            <li> Still to expensive !!!!</li>
            <li> Bad PR for Braun Products !!!</li>
            <li> Shaving was terrible.</li>
            <li> and the resevoir was absolutely disgusting!</li>
            <li> , they eliminate those nasty stubs in the sink.</li>
            <li> I just pop a cartridge into the base, put my razor in, push a button and my razor gets cleaned,lubricated &amp; charged for 17 cents a day, you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>

            <li> As promised. Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling cleaning fluid - seems to work well. Content evaporates fast if not closed properly.</li>
            <li> These each used to last a long time, and each time I&#x27;ve ordered them the life-cycle shrinks significantly ... starting to think this is by design to sell more product.</li>
            <li> The real deal for a great price. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Work just as expected.</li>
            <li> The product shipped with the correct number of replacement cartridges, but two of them were completely empty!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. I got it for the razor I gave my son and he has had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what was ordered and pricing is good</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a good buy!</li>
            <li> Good deal, no mess no fuss! Love the feel every time I shave now!</li>
            <li> The cleaning system works well, but is pretty loud.  The Braun razor is great.</li>
            <li> Brown box, four cartridges, all full. I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good price... but seriously... make each one last a year and instead of leaving the little tub in the machine and continually open to the air...  just pop it out after the cleaning cycle and snap the plastic lid back on it.  Its filled with alcohol which evaporates.  If you cap it... the sucker will last for months!  Save a buck or two on the alcohol in the tub and spend it on alcohol that&#x27;s cold and in a frosty glass during half time.  Always thinking men!</li>
            <li> Too expensive - much easier to refill them myself. The web explains how to do it - it is fairly easy and works great.</li>
            <li> I guess it works, but despite having a Braun logo on the cartridges, all the other writing is in either Chinese, Korean, or some other oriental language, and the smell of the cleaning solution is much, much stronger than I can remember.  But I guess it works and I should have known they weren&#x27;t authentic from the price.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a great deal! :)</li>
            <li> The best thing about the Braun electric shavers is the charging/cleaning device shipped with every new shaver.  And, of course, you need a supply of cartridge refills to be able to clean your razor fully and properly.  Even if you clean only once-a-week instead of daily, these cartridges will help your Braun look, feel, and even smell as fresh as the day you bought it!  You should always have a supply of new cartridges on hand!</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to change out the Clean and Renew Cartridge without having to go out each month and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price; these arrived just as shown in the photo - in a brown box unwrapped and unsealed; it could be that these refills are refills, not original Braun-filled products.  Is that a problem?  I don&#x27;t know.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Great!! I will buy them again!!</li>
            <li> Real expensive when you consider how much a bottle of astringent alcohol costs at a store. However, I tried refilling one of these with a generic astringent alcohol, and the results were not good. Therefore, I continue to purchase these refills from Braun. They are overpriced but are of great quality, hence the 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like spending the extra money, but the shaver has provided a close shave for more than two years. All I have done is buy a new shaving head once a year and replaced the cleaning cartridges as needed.</li>
            <li> Fully delivers on its advertised features.  Have no problem loading the refill into the cleaning station.  Cleaning action is thorough and complete.</li>
            <li> What can I say it is blue fits in like original this has no prevalence but need twenty word omg lol</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and quality product. Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Good product, good price</li>
            <li> Good buy. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This a great system for cleaning shaver, I wish the cleaner cartridges were recyclable though.</li>
            <li> This is the type of product you need to keep things functioning as they should. Don&#x27;t know if it prolonged the life of my shaver but it sure didn&#x27;t hurt. I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> Perfect condition! Exactly what I needed and ordered.</li>
            <li> Perfect order as usual.</li>
            <li> A must have replacement.  They are so expensive but you have to buy them.</li>
            <li> I had been avoiding purchasing these cleaning units for some time due to their cost, but their ease of use makes the purchase well worth it.</li>
            <li> These work well and are simple to replace.  My only complaint is the high cost.</li>
            <li> FIrst I&#x27;d found them in a 4 pack...saves hassle and money this way</li>
            <li> When I compare prices with stores like Walmart, etc, I&#x27;ve found the best price here.  I don&#x27;t think I would get a shaver that needs something like this again, but for now, I&#x27;ll keep ordering these.</li>
            <li> My old Synchro system uses these cartridges to clean and charge my 78** series Braun electric razor.  The fluid in these cartridges clean, oil and refresh my razor every time.  I definitely can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to get these refills.  I pulled out my husbands cartridge to change when I got the new refills and you wouldn&#x27;t believe the dirt.  I don&#x27;t believe that the razor cleans any more unless it gets changed.  You will see a yellow/orange color light on the base unit that lets you know when it needs to be changed.  Once I changed it, the light turned blue and all was well again.  I like this, I will highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised and for a great price.</li>
            <li> Very handy way to clean the Braun 790, and buying several at once is much cheaper than buying singly.</li>
            <li> The product cleans as it is supposed to.  So I can&#x27;t dock the product, as it is what it is, and Amazon subscribe and save gives a great price for it.  I just wish these refills in general lasted longer and were cheaper.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> This item is what I needed for my Series 7 Braun Shaver.  The Four Pack made this a great buy.  It was shipping very quickly and I had it in several days.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that you get at all the stores for about twice the price. If you search around on Amazon, you will find the price per unit generally drops more if you order in larger quantities. Just goes to show how much we pay for in packaging for the stores. I could care less if it came in a paper sack, I am not putting it on display, just storing it until I need to use it. The frustration free packaging is the way to go for price and storage. I will do this again.</li>
            <li> I bought these refills along with the foil and cutter replacement pack for my husband, in trying not to buy a brand new razor.  He wasn&#x27;t very good at maintaining his razor, so he was thrilled with the results.  After all of the packs and refills were in place, my husband said it was like his razor was brand new.  If he&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a Braun user, then you know these.  What you MAY not know is that you can get these on &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;.  Absolutely perfect timing from Amazon - about the time you&#x27;re using the last one, the new box shows up.  DEFINITELY the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn&#x27;t loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time.</li>
            <li> I bought the subscription when I bought my 790 series razor. It saves you about five dollars every four months and they&#x27;re automatically delivered to you. You can&#x27;t get much easier then that.</li>
            <li> Keep your Braun compatible shaver going and clean. Pleasant non offensive odor, feels fresh next use.&lt;br /&gt;Its worth the effort to replace when its time.&lt;br /&gt;Really can&#x27;t say I love it though, its as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> This is a great price on these cartridges. I buy them for my husband on Amazon, the price is the best around.  Dont stop offering them</li>
            <li> No problems. Everything as advertised.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to keep my razor clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and they have always met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I always buy my refills on Amazon.  Great price!</li>
            <li> Convenient shaver cleaner. Good quantity price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Lower cost than WalMart. Fast shipping. Many thanks.</li>
            <li> Just as ordered and works well.</li>
            <li> These are much cheaper than buying through Wal-Mart.  When they run dry, I wash them out thoroughly and refill with 90% rubbing alcohol and use again.  I usually go 6-8 refills on one cartridge and then move to the next.</li>
            <li> These work great and are affordable priced. Mine tend to dry out on me since I shaved every three days.</li>
            <li> Product fine, pricing good.</li>
            <li> Best value in the world!</li>
            <li> Came as advertised, works in my Braun cleaning system, decent price.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time - no issues</li>
            <li> The products can as described and well packaged</li>
            <li> My husband really likes his Braun shaver and the way this stuff keeps it clean.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Why there&#x27;s no expiration date on the box?</li>
            <li> Product what I needed and pleased to be able to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product if you get it at the right price. Fast shipping, Recommended.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time with my Braun razor system. keeps it nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps the shaver in great condition.</li>
            <li> does what it is suppose to do</li>
            <li> Needed replacement, but does the job</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, Excellent Price And Excellent Delivery.</li>
            <li> REFILLS, just like the&amp;#34; Free&amp;#34; Oil Lamps, and had to pay for the oil. In this case you pay for both the shaver and the cleaner.</li>
            <li> genuine Braun cleaner...at a great price compared to my local stores.......</li>
            <li> Even though I recognize this technology as a way for Braun to create a revenue stream, in this case it actually works - the cartridges do, I think, keep my Braun lasting a lot longer than I think they would otherwise.  I used my first Braun for about ten years in conjunction with this system, and the only reason I stopped using it is because I couldn&#x27;t find replacement foils/cutters for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of wish there were a way to refill these - throwing the whole thing away when it&#x27;s spent seems kind of wasteful to me - but overall it&#x27;s a product that I think gives your Braun longevity.  So I don&#x27;t mind what amounts to a subscription model with this...it works.</li>
            <li> They are OEM parts and work great, Amazon auto delivers these.  I&#x27;ve had three Braun shaving systems, and they all used these refills.</li>
            <li> Not much to say. Take the old one out. Use the plug from the new one to plug the old one just to make sure there is no spillage. Put the new one in and voila, clean razor. Solution works great. Use on on my 8595.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Keeps my Braun clean for a shave that leaves my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> They clean my shaver very well----just the ticket!!</li>
            <li> These are genuine refills of the same quality you get in stores.</li>
            <li> This stuff does a good job cleaning and lubricating the razor.  I clean/charge the razor once or twice a week.  First, I brush out the stubble with an old toothbrush.  After it is done, I replace the cap on the cartridge to reduce evaporation.  I can easily stretch one cartridge from one month to six this way.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> arrived quickly as promised...</li>
            <li> Good price for manufacturers&#x27; product</li>
            <li> Save a little money on packaging.  Everything else is the same as you would buy in the fancy box.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job. Originally I was scary to use it because all description in hieroglyphs. Probably direct import from China. But my Braun shaver seems to work fine with those cartridges.</li>
            <li> This is a very sanitary shaving system. I have used these for 6 years. I used to get nasty ingrown hairs that would get infected, this has helped significantly. If you have the same problem, try not to touch your face with your hands immediately after shaving, that with Braun shavers has made a big difference for me. Extend the life by recapping them and storing them outside your charger.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, I advise!</li>
            <li> Great, work as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job of cleaning razor. Product is over priced in general and use every other cleaning. Other times just clean head in water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with these refills, but the cartridges themselves seemed to have changed about 6-12 mos ago.  They&#x27;re now significantly smaller, seem to leak, and use metric (vs. imperial) units of measurement.  I think they&#x27;re so inexpensive because perhaps they aren&#x27;t meant for U.S. machines?    At any rate, I can only get 2-3 cleanings out of them before the machine reads \\&quot;empty.\\&quot;  A single cartridge used to last several wks.     Completely useless, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are easy to use and they keep my razor clean and smelling fresh; buying the cartridges this way reduces considerably the amount of packaging</li>
            <li> I have never had problems with the product. However I did have problems when ordering the last time. It was corrected, but should not have happened since this was done 4 months prior?</li>
            <li> just like what came with the shaver</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is designed to do</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t  seem to last as long as earlier&lt;br /&gt;units. They also seem more money.&lt;br /&gt;this is now becoming more expensive to keep buying.</li>
            <li> At this price I will keep my razor clean!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered a 4 pack. The first time was fine, that&#x27;s why I ordered 2 4pack. When I opened the first 4 pk box, I noticed one of the cartridge was about 25% filled and the color was very pal. So I emptied the cartridge into my sink and noticed hair was with the liquid, which tells me they have sent me a used cartridge along with the other 3 refills.  Now I&#x27;m trying to get in contact with the seller, which is hard since I&#x27;m not sending the cartridge back which is more of a pain then it&#x27;s worth. Word of advise, these are refills, you&#x27;re going to get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Replacements. they are just like the ones that came with your razor. works well. overpriced. 5 more words were required.</li>
            <li> Works well, Nice Price.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done to complete satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;Far superior to the old fashion running under water&lt;br /&gt;My third year using the product</li>
            <li> Original factory product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun electric shavers for many years, and I even had the first (8500 model I think) Braun with cleaning system using these cartridges. Although I think the refill cartridges are expensive, I believe they do help to aid in the longevity of the blades, not to mention sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using these as long as I own a Braun Shaver, hopefully the price will go down some day which would encourage me to use the cleaning system more frequently.</li>
            <li> Used them regularly, until the base unit (the clearner) died --which was due to it&#x27;s age.  Good product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great. I tried refilling my other with water and alcohol...this stuff has some lubrication in it as well so it makes the shaver perform at its best. Feels much better. Recommend.</li>
            <li> great buy  works well with my razor</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!!!</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but you can easily refill them yourself.  Just get some ethanol, glycerine and a little lemon scent and you&#x27;re done.  Add a little water if the error light won&#x27;t turn off.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the Braun electric razor better than any he has tried.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great product, really does make a difference to use it with the Braun razor.</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary, just as displayed and described on the sales page......&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I wanted and that&#x27;s all I got, hassle-free, on top of lower price than Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;What else could I ask for?  Nothing more, thanks.</li>
            <li> Leaves a Nice smell on the shaver .</li>
            <li> The product was as expected and delivered promptly</li>
            <li> Good purchase. Thanks</li>
            <li> I returned the razor so this is n/a</li>
            <li> My tenth one recently arrived.  They last about two years.  Easily amortized.</li>
            <li> Lives up to the Braun reputation - Easy to insert and it does its job and the price is right!</li>
            <li> keeps the shaver clean and operating efficiently</li>
            <li> Everything was very well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> All items are great!!!</li>
            <li> Needed for my shaver.  Good shaver, good cleaning solution for the shaver&#x27;s base..</li>
            <li> Cleans well- wish they&#x27;d last longer.</li>
            <li> I had made my own version of the cleaner using an empty cartridge but with the low price of $4, it is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save on cartridges, I clean the shaver every day with the little brush. I take the head off, then strike it on the inside of the sink (blades up) to remove most of the stubble. Then, using the brush, I clean the main shaver part. Best not to use the brush on the blade area. When the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; light comes on the first time, I ignore it. On the second time, I knock out the stubble, skip the brush and use the cleaning machine and recharge the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;As to the cleaning solution/cartridge system, it works fine. It is definitely an easy way to clean the shaver completely. Now that the price has gone down, it&#x27;s probably not worth the effort to use the Everclear, Lemon essential oil, light machine oil that I used before.</li>
            <li> I still do not know if this is the legit Braun brand or not (it says it is on the box), but it works great, and definitely smells like the original. It will extend the life of your Braun shaver and save you money in the long run. Good product.</li>
            <li> Multi-pack product with a great price</li>
            <li> These do the trick but one of the 4 was only half full.  For what they charge for these they should be full!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> Once you purchase the Braun Series 5 or 7 then you MUST use these Braun cleaner units. Never take on trips.</li>
            <li> Looks like I ordered the wrong cartridges</li>
            <li> I have tried off-brand versions of this cleaning liquid and it just isn&#x27;t the same.  I recommend finding the Braun cartridges for the best price you can and sticking with those.  It keeps your razor nice and clean and gives it a great scent.</li>
            <li> OEM replacement. Good price for an item hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> This purchase exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> Amazon.com is a great place to find this product for an easy shopping experience. The price changes often and often even other drugstores online have the same price or slightly better. The product is designed for select razor chargers. One big complaint though is it dries out very fast when not used on a regular basis. One trick is to save the cap and place it on between uses but this is a major annoyance to have to take the cap on and off. For the price of this product, Braun has clearly designed a product that requires frequent repurchases once you start to like the product.</li>
            <li> works well.  The problem is that the manufacturer is trying to save money by using less cleaner.  When I started the cleaning lasted  about four weeks (as the instruction manual stated).  For the last two orders each refill has lasted about three weeks.  This reminds me of food manufacturers who make extra profit by reducing the size of the food containers.</li>
            <li> Received just what I order.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleaning system that I have ever used.  Previous electric shavers did not have a cleaning system other than a brush. This system is superior.</li>
            <li> Product as expected.  Price is nice!</li>
            <li> needed for my shaver. helps keep clean</li>
            <li> What can I say it works like advertised.</li>
            <li> Just like original. Works great</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for this necessary supply.</li>
            <li> good system, makes shaver fresh for each use.</li>
            <li> My husband has the Braun Electric Razor #5 and we order these on a regular basis. Highly recommend both the electric razor and the refills. And, of course, you always great the best prices with Amazon.com!!</li>
            <li> This product really keeps your shaver giving that clean smooth shave as it did out of the box. I tried using water but it is not the same.</li>
            <li> Did an excellent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Purchased them as refills for my shaving machine after mine needed to be replaced. This solution cleans my shaving gismo  spanking clean.</li>
            <li> Gotta buy them on line, price is right.</li>
            <li> This I have on automatic order and it ships right on time.  I&#x27;ve owned this electric razor for several years and I think it has lasted as long as it has because I use this product all the time.</li>
            <li> My son loves the product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like buying these constantly</li>
            <li> I am giving this one star. I have used this fluid for about 4 years. My shaver recently broke... the common problem with the brauns...the trimmer broke. Anyways when I got it repared, this fluid was all up inside the parts of my shaver corroding it. The repair guy explained that this stuff can damage the shaver and cost you even more to repair it. Its safer to just use water, clean the shaver with a brush, rinse the head/foil out, and tap it on the side of the sink to knock the crap out (dont knock the blade piece, the plastic part where it attachs to the shaver).</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Cartridges arrived exactly as shown, in Braun non-retail packaging.  They are in fact OEM refills and work exactly as anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;No problems at all.  It&#x27;s a solid buy.</li>
            <li> I loved it I just wish the bleeding mask came together and I wish they were together and both of them worked</li>
            <li> Works well and is designed exactly for the razor I have.  Gives the shaver a clean, fresh smell. Fits nicely in the holder as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described but a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Good price, even though you have to buy 4.</li>
            <li> Works great. I don&#x27;t breakout anymore. I will never use another brand again. Braun is awesome. I love my machine.</li>
            <li> Works as a great replacement. Much better price point too.</li>
            <li> I love having a clean electric razor without any fuss or muss. Really like the fact that it works on my old razor (at the cabin) and new one (at home) as well.</li>
            <li> A necessity product, if you own one of these razors.  This is a good price and subscribe and save makes it even better.</li>
            <li> For others, a good evaluation</li>
            <li> Everything as promised, arrived on time, great deal...</li>
            <li> Send a friend,very nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun Series 7 shaver since it came out and it&#x27;s still working perfectly after years of service. I believe one reason is because it&#x27;s always clean and properly lubricated by using these Renew Cartridges. I imagine the liquid is composed of simple fluids that accomplish the cleaning and lubricating that could be refilled for a fraction of the cost if I knew the components. But the convenience and few extra dollars is well worth having your razor work like new even after years of daily use.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than retail. when it gets low I just add some rubbing alcohol. Things last forever. Works like a charm in the OEM charger base</li>
            <li> This a very good product which is very easy to use, just open unseal, place at the base of the shaver,&lt;br /&gt;when done set the shaver on the base to start auto self clean.&lt;br /&gt;It is great and easy.&lt;br /&gt;will recommend it to all of my family/friends.</li>
            <li> A good product that keeps my razor clean and working great. I would definitely recommend to anyone that owns a Braun electric razor.</li>
            <li> These work with both my Braun&#x27;s.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line, the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I&#x27;d get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost, but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not, get one with your next shaver...it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Essential to lubrication of the shaver head and its efficiency.</li>
            <li> I have been geting thjis product for years and the price is right</li>
            <li> if you been using Braun long enough, you just trust that company. i have a older shaver still works fine. got new one is better.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Basically the same cartridge that the unit came with, just the tags looked slightly different on the container. Still, works great and I plan on ordering more when the time comes!</li>
            <li> HUSBAND VERY PLEASED GREAT ITEM AND SELLER</li>
            <li> receiving a single star due to receiving a can of zippo premium butane fuel instead of the Braun clean and renew cartridge refills.</li>
            <li> Works like it should.  Using it with my Braun 760cc.  I&#x27;m amazed that one last me 5 months.  So purchasing 4 for 20 was no brainer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, when I opened the package all the cartridges are in Chinese seems okay, it is original product just Chinese writing.</li>
            <li> I know that some people try to refill these with alcohol because of the expense, but really, why bother when you can get a 4-pack at these prices? I get a bit over a month with each container, so a 4-pack lasts me about 5 months. This means that I still pay less using these than I would if I had to continuously buy shaving cream and razor blades. These are priced right and I don&#x27;t have to mess around trying to refill a container with my own formula</li>
            <li> How do you review a fluid used to clean and slightly lubricate an electric shaver? Since it is the only cleaning fluid that I know of for the Braun Series 7 electric shaver, I guess it&#x27;s the right stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, for many years all you needed was a little running water, a small brush to reach difficult areas in the cutter grooves, and you were done. No problems, long shaver head life. So what this is is an effort to inject a &amp;#34;razor blade&amp;#34; style of continual purchase requirement into the electric world, and suckers like me go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh.</li>
            <li> Cheapest way to get your hands on these cartridge refills.  Does a good job of keeping your shaver clean although running it under warm water does just about as good a job.</li>
            <li> Good buy. quality prodict</li>
            <li> Works great and great price</li>
            <li> Genuine product. Works as expected. Only down side is not really knowing when it is time to change out. That is where the benefit of getting multiple refills comes into play.</li>
            <li> these work super good</li>
            <li> No trip to the store, excellent!</li>
            <li> The best replacement cartridges for the world&#x27;s best shaver. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> works reasonably well</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Comes in the plain cardboard box shown in the picture. The box is sealed and is an original Braun product, just without having to pay for the fancy packaging. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described üòÄ</li>
            <li> Use the subscribe and save option, it&#x27;s the best price around for these cartridges.  I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for over a decade.  I&#x27;ve never once thought it wasn&#x27;t clean enough after running it through a cycle.</li>
            <li> I have been using these replacement cleaning cartridges for almost two years now and have never had any problems.  They work great and the 4 pack saves money.  I recommend these.  They look and install just like the higher priced versions you buy from the store.</li>
            <li> Refills. Good and working as advertized.</li>
            <li> Great price!!!!  for the amount of cartridges you get!!!</li>
            <li> Great shipping and price..</li>
            <li> Outstanding product recommendation by the manufacturer for keeping my shaver in good shape.  Shaver feels like new after using the cleaner.</li>
            <li> Best price I could find.</li>
            <li> Best way to buy these.</li>
            <li> Braun Series 7/790cc is the best I have ever had and the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;May as well keep it maintained properly and this product does it very well.&lt;br /&gt;My heavy beard is treated with power and respect.</li>
            <li> unbelievable deal, great product and super service one I ordered the refills they came so quickly</li>
            <li> Authentic Braun cartridge refill replacements work well with my Series 7 electric razor.  Never any quality issues and really easy to open.....will buy again.</li>
            <li> received timely. good packaging. as described. needed for the braun shaver. I should be good for a while!</li>
            <li> These cartridges are genuine Braun replacements, and come packaged in a sturdy shipping carton that compactly stores them until they are needed. These are a great value, and help keep the head clean and fresh. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is clear ad smells like it is just alcohol only.  In the store the product has a lemon scent and is blue, where this one is clear and only smells like alcohol.  It is not the same. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I choose this product, because it is the only product that can be used with the Braun shaver I purchased.  Purchasing four units at a time is economical and you always have a cartridge when need it or least expect it..  I would recommend everyone purchasing a Braun shaver that uses this type of cartridge use these cartridges as it extends the lift of the Braun Shaver and gives you the best possible shave.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do...clean my razor head.</li>
            <li> My husband is very perfectionistic and likes to do everything according to the book. He uses these and says they are great.</li>
            <li> These came in Braun cardboard packaging - and really saved me money. They are refill cartridges for the seven series shaver. Some tips for you to save on these in general:&lt;br /&gt;1. Save the plastic cap that covers the refill. After each use, remove the refill and recap it and store.&lt;br /&gt;2. Doing so will avoid evaporation - which is what accounts for most of the loss of the solution!&lt;br /&gt;3. in this way you can make your refills last significantly longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li> Just what I was searching for</li>
            <li> The packaging is just as frustration free as advertised.  The clean and renew cartridge fits my Braun razor cleaner very well.</li>
            <li> The 4-pack was a much better deal than I was able to find anywhere else locally.  I don&#x27;t use the cleaning system super often, but when I do it sure does make a difference.</li>
            <li> It works!!! What a surprise!!!!</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t had to use these yet but said they&#x27;re a great idea. He&#x27;s very happy with them. It&#x27;s easier to have these on hand instead of waiting when to order them when they need it.</li>
            <li> God product. Cleans very well</li>
            <li> great product. a must have.</li>
            <li> In a word.....Wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the razor and these refills do the trick. The price is right and I&#x27;ll buy these again. I avoid non-OEMs or generic refills.</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff was a gimmick, but I really like how clean it gets the razor without any work or mess.  I had not even planned on using the cleaning feature until I tried it.</li>
            <li> A standard replacement cartridge for my Braun..</li>
            <li> A very quiet and efficient humidifier.</li>
            <li> These have been leaving a gross, oily, yellow residue on the shaver recently.  I don&#x27;t know what the deal is.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered these refill cartridges from Amazon and both times the refills ran out after six or  seven cleanings.  Those refills are garbage.</li>
            <li> Easy and appropriate for the Braun system. Search the net for inexpensive DIY alternatives.</li>
            <li> it does what it is suppose to do without a problem or worry. keeps shaver in top condition.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind storing, this is an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> Very good, and smells good.</li>
            <li> it does what its supposed to do.  Good, good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
            <li> I like being able to buy these in bulk.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s just right. Packaging was sufficient.</li>
            <li> Sense I Was out Of My Renew Cartridge I Immediately Put This One In As Soon As It Arrived; Upon Doing So Placing The Cartridge Inside The Cartridge Chamber. I Put It In To Cleaning Mode And The Whole Cartridge Emptied Out, Meaning It Sucked Up All The Fluid In One Use; This Was The First Time This Has Ever Happened, To My Shaver I Thought It Was Something That I Did Wrong So I Cleaned The Whole Device Out And Put Another Cartridge In And Had The Same Results.</li>
            <li> It does the job well, it&#x27;s that simple.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted at a good price.</li>
            <li> Everything went perfectly well with my order.</li>
            <li> üëç excellent price. Great deal</li>
            <li> Love the Braun clean and renew system.  Can&#x27;t beat the price on the refills.</li>
            <li> Love &amp; need these. Great price.</li>
            <li> Cleans and luricates the shaver head just as Braun intended and performs efficiently for the intenced life of the cartridge.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Is the original Braun replacements but much cheaper than I can find where I live.</li>
            <li> Great for my husband. Super price.</li>
            <li> The color was different‚Äîclear not blue. The smell was much more like regular rubbing alcohol. The labels only had chinese writing on them. Very shady. Probably was ripped off.</li>
            <li> Works well no complaints</li>
            <li> I like these.  Some people say they don&#x27;t do any good, but I think they lubricate the cutter and make for a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Good price and yes, you need it.</li>
            <li> What can you say these clean and renew cartridges usually go for more money in stores so you get the better deal online. No complaints there.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my husband and he loves it.  It&#x27;s so easy to keep his Braun shaver clean; you just plug it in and it does the job for you.</li>
            <li> work well and very fast delivery</li>
            <li> The shave is the best I have found. How much this expensive fluid adds to it I am not so sure.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the Bruan.  Helps keep the heads lubricated.  Don&#x27;t bother with that other imitation stuff.  You&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s tough to get all the whiskers out when having to refill.  Gross!  Just replace the whole unit.  Don&#x27;t be so darned cheap.</li>
            <li> Price was right. They work as designed. However, I would like to see the cartridges recyclable and/or refillable. There is too much waste with this system.</li>
            <li> Fits my unit perfectly and has been running as desired. This is a good cheap price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and lubricates.  It does what it was designed to do</li>
            <li> excellent purchase.  Best Price.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> These are truly &amp;#34;frustration free&amp;#34;, or are at least for me. They typically hold out for me for about 2-3 months typically. I don&#x27;t shave as often as some though, so that could go up a little, perhaps, for some. It does a great job, and makes cleaning the shaver super easy.</li>
            <li> I have an 8000 series Braun shaver that uses these. This works and keeps things nice and clean. It does add to the cost of the system quite a bit though.</li>
            <li> refill works as designed - easy to change - last the scheduled length of time - over all good product</li>
            <li> Cheapest way to get these.  There are ways to refill them, but this is much easier.</li>
            <li> Worked and fit perfectly. packaged very well too. i believe it was a japanese braun packaging, but works fine for my 3 series braun shaver.</li>
            <li> work great, good value, simple effective package.</li>
            <li> It made my razor shave like new .</li>
            <li> The replacement cartridges work as well as the original cartridge received at purchasing my razor.&lt;br /&gt;It helps to keep my razor clean and in good working order and cost a lot less that if purchased in the store.</li>
            <li> The cartridges do just what they are designed to do as long as the Clean &amp; Renew Stand works.  I have my second one and it doesn&#x27;t work so the cartridges are now surplus.  I would recommend you buy the Stand locally so when it acts up, you can waltz back to the store and return it.</li>
            <li> These refills do exactly what they are supposed to do, as you can read in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;I have found no noticeable difference by cleaning my shaver every other use instead of every time. I have owned it for almost a year now. This is a good way to get twice the life out of the refills. They also seem to last longer than the 30 uses stated.&lt;br /&gt;Also, these things are very easy to spill when installing. Be careful!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&#x27;d recommend stocking up on them if you like the shaver because with products like these, you never know when the manufacturer will stop production thus rendering the shaver obsolete.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say? It&#x27;s a refill. It fits. It works.</li>
            <li> This cleaner refill is the only one offered for the Braun shavers.  The options are whether you want 2, 3 or more refills at one time.  They last about 2 months each (I used them once a week) because they are alcohol-based and evaporation takes a toll on the fluid.  The cartridges fit in the cleaner that comes with the razors and they do clean and lubricate the cutting surfaces.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and replace.  Seems to last only so long.  Requires replacing a lot more often than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I&#x27;m just used to manually removing the hairs instead of some fancy auto cleaning system.  I tried to do that but it wasn&#x27;t coming apart for me so its a requirement with this electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of hair builds up in the bottom and because really dirt once used up.  So it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> buying in bulk saves you in the long run.  I bought three of these for the price of one at the big box stores. They are genuine Braun! Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaver clean and well lubricated, just make sure you have it dry out for at least 12 hours or else your face will smell weird.</li>
            <li> This cleaning fluid makes your shaver clean and smells good. It also lubricates the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use the cleaning cycle after each usage and each cleaning fluid lasts about 30 to 45 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviews, the cleaning fluid is easy to spill when removing the plastic seal cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use \\&quot;Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot;, which comes out cheaper than getting it from major retails.</li>
            <li> They work fine...wish I could say the same for the electric razor.  I start with the Braun and finish with a Norelco....</li>
            <li> I have started ordering the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills through Amazon since it is easier and cheaper than buying at most drugstores. This package comes with 4 of the cartridge refills so you want have to worry about running low.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> Just alcohol.  Could have refilled my old container.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit.  Great price and they work flawlessly.  Far cheaper than even Wal-Mart, not to mention the Prime Shipping makes it easy to get fast.</li>
            <li> Keeps razor clean and fresh, Used for 15 years+</li>
            <li> One of these lasts me 6 months; I only clean when battery is low...15 years &amp; counting.</li>
            <li> These are an absolute must if you have this model of the Braun razor so there are not many choices. This package was the best deal for the money.</li>
            <li> The refill cartridges are a direct replacement and have worked flawlessly with my series 5 unit.  The 4 pack offers a cheaper unit price and convenient case to store them away.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Can&#x27;t complain and it is so nice to have them show up at my door. I do wonder how good of a clean my razor gets at the end of one of these canisters but there really isn&#x27;t an alternative.</li>
            <li> I refill these but it&#x27;s nice to start fresh once in a while.</li>
            <li> What can you say.  It works.</li>
            <li> The product does mostly what it ways.  It cleans, sanitizes, and leave the razor with a nice smell.  Having used Braun razors for 25 years I can confidently say however that the purchase is unnecessary.  If I clean the stubble out with some compressed air (not to high PSI), it&#x27;s good to go.  I recommend you pass on the refills unless you personally found a marked improvement in your shaving experience with the trial fluid included with the razor.</li>
            <li> Great price and value.</li>
            <li> Good product and shipping</li>
            <li> What I like best about these is that they are made in Ireland!! How often do you see imports from that beautiful country?&lt;br /&gt;They work great with my Series 5 and keep the razor as good as new.</li>
            <li> cartridges do not fully empty, there is a fair residual volume</li>
            <li> Ordered as gift and they were thrilled with quality, price and shipping!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this part of the Braun razor daily process.  But it seems to keep the razor clean and efficient.  Coming from a sales background I thought it was just a nifty profitable sales add on.  Well it is that but the function is OK.</li>
            <li> You know what you are getting.</li>
            <li> I love the Braun 360 Electric Razor, so being able to order the refill cleaners at an affordable price is key! Not too much to comment on this product, it does the job. The 4-pack on Amazon is usually the cheapest that I find (when calculating the shipping).</li>
            <li> Less expensive and no wallmart!</li>
            <li> These Braun cleaning solution packs work great with my shaver.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Essential for the Braun Electric Razor...</li>
            <li> Excellent as expected</li>
            <li> Good deal. They want 12$ for a 2 pack in stores</li>
            <li> Great Value will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Was able to load up for my Braun self-cleaning razor.  Cheap price and now I won&#x27;t have to worry for when my cartridges run out.</li>
            <li> This fluid keeps my razor clean and running well.  It does a great job of cleaning debris and oils off the cutter head.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my Braun shaver.  It&#x27;s as advertised.  I like the frustration package Amazon.com shipped mine in.  Like other reviewers noted to prevent the refills from evaporating put the lid back after you use it.</li>
            <li> Refills arrived as scheduled at a good price and they work as advertized.  I plan to continue the service in the future.</li>
            <li> Have used this system for years!  Most efficient and keeps head clean and lasts longer.  Would recommend to anyone with a Braun razor!</li>
            <li> These cartridges are apparently all the same so I buy them as cheap as I can.  This seems to be it.</li>
            <li> Great product, really works well. I have bought these for many years</li>
            <li> A little heavier than I expected.  A bit heavy for  me to get into the back of my car.  But is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Easy to insert in his shaver, cleans efficiently and each cartridges lasts 5 months (once a week cleaning). We live in Las Vegas (dry heat, dry conditions) and what I have found that made this product last long is to use it, TAKE IT OUT OF THE SHAVER after cleaning, REPLACE THE CAP it came with and store it in a dry place. It prevents the cleaning solution from evaporating :)</li>
            <li> This is a package of four refill cartridges that fit the cleaning system for my Braun System 5, model 590 electric razor.  They are identical to the cartridges I normally buy in my drug store but this package of four cost only slightly more than a two-pack of the cartridges I&#x27;ve been buying there.  Performance is identical and I&#x27;m very happy with the lower cost.</li>
            <li> If you keep the top tabs for this, you can seal it back up between running cleaning cycles and get much much more use out of it. I typically use the refill until it is clear that the solution is cloudy. If I can&#x27;t smell the freshness right away when I unseal it again then I don&#x27;t continue to use it. It keeps my shaver clean so I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> I always felt like I was wasting money each month buying boxes of refills. At least with this offering I get more of them for my money. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a better deal than this one.</li>
            <li> It is needed for my shaver. Leaves a nice lemony smell. If you do your shopping right, sometimes you can buy two at a time in bulk, for cheaper than the bundle Amazon sets the price on.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite things about the Braun series 7. Those drain quite fast if you don&#x27;t close the lid on the top, so DO NOT THROW IT AWAY! If you close the lid often, this should last you around a month or so, since the alcohol doesn&#x27;t evaporate!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  Cleans and lubricates the shaver.  Along with new foils and blades, the shaver is like new.</li>
            <li> Just what it said it was.  Got it on time and everything.  Thanks so much.  God bless you all so much.</li>
            <li> as descvribed and less expensive</li>
            <li> This shaving system is AWESOME. It replaced my regular razor with the Braun shaver this refill goes to. I definitely recommend cleaning it after every use (with the push of a button). This is (as far as I know) the only way to clean the shaver, even so, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Its kind of funny reviewing this as hey, it fits my braun shaver and keeps it clean. As a whole the two work great and keep my razor clean with minimal effort on my part. For Amazon I dig the frustration free packing and the schedule deliveries.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about work Well in cleaning the razor</li>
            <li> Thanks. Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for three refills for the Braun--easy to use and takes up very little space on a shelf. I love Braun products anyway, so I&#x27;m not surprised at all to find the cost so affordable.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaving products on the market</li>
            <li> Works very well with the shaving system and leaves a clean fresh smell when it&#x27;s done.  It is a little tricky to pop the lid.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and the seller</li>
            <li> Hey, they&#x27;re just refills.....and they fit my Razor base. What else can you say?</li>
            <li> Best value for Braun shaver cleaning system. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is the proper replacement. Not much else to say!</li>
            <li> Thought these were for my electric razor based on information from the website, but once I received them I have no idea what they&#x27;re for. Threw them out.</li>
            <li> When I first began using these cartridges with my Braun Shaver, each lasted about two months, used about every four days tor cleaning, before evaporation of the solution led to a red light that  indicated the need for a new cartridge. . About a year ago, this changed so that each cartridge was only good for just over a month. This latest batch is even worse. The yellow light (not the green!) already goes on when the new cartridge is installed..  This indicates either a sneaky way to increase the cost, or carelessness in production that produces the same effect.  One can extend the life by adding water, but this dilutes the cleaning solutions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed or something else, but now my razor is covered in a yellow green goo.  Overall, it still works well, but I find myself cleaning the outside of the razor before I use it after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Good, the only one to buy for your braun!!</li>
            <li> Great price and exact replacement for the shaver</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying these individually at a store. Liquid content appears to be the same based on smell and cleaning effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SELF CLEANING FEATURE TO MY BRAUN ELECTRIC RAZOR AND WITH THESE REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGES IT JUST MAKES IT THAT MUCH EASIER.</li>
            <li> Good price for the OEM refills from Braun.</li>
            <li> The process to order cleaners was very simple and the price was right. I liked that I could order several. It was easy to insert a new cleaner.</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome. Walmart used to stock these but don&#x27;t anymore it doesn&#x27;t matter though as these are a better price and come right to the house. Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price!</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Love to be able to buy these in bulk without all the extra packaging and a better price.</li>
            <li> These clean my husband&#x27;s Braun Series 5 Razor with a clean and renew base very nicely. The razor gets so much cleaner then when he uses a brush alone.</li>
            <li> Good price good product. No issues.</li>
            <li> Save a lot by buying in bulk!</li>
            <li> In the picture the containers look blue like the original renewal containers that come with the shaver. These refills are lighter in color almost as if the solution was diluted. They seem to work fine. The box they come in has the Braun logo.</li>
            <li> works fine.  better price than Wally World.</li>
            <li> Good product, no problems with them, packed well.</li>
            <li> Great price and love the packaging!</li>
            <li> Great product and am completely satisfied. No issues whatsoever. Will recommend to anyone interested in this product. Will do business again with.</li>
            <li> Hubbie happy with new shaver and accessories.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is good, but not easy, but he has sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;So the machine works very well so far</li>
            <li> What can I say?  The clean the razor.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> 4 pack is easy to stock up on.  They dry up to quick sometimes.</li>
            <li> I love my electric razor. I use to have many in grown hairs and irritation because of regular razors. this product keeps my blades sharp and clean. this is a must have for a series 7 and a great price</li>
            <li> These are Braun refill cartridges that come in a brown box.  Nothing fancy but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for in this product.  I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for about 12 years now and like the overall quality and performance of them.  I have always liked the self cleaning system and this is part of that system.  The cheaper I can buy them, the better i like it.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t very cheap.  Like I read on other reviews, it&#x27;s best to keep the &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; and take the solution out and cap it when not in use.  This should add some life to each cartridge and save you some pennies.</li>
            <li> The Braun clean and renew cartridge made a big difference on my shaver. It not only cleans the shaver but also refreshes it.</li>
            <li> I think to not use these would shorten the life of the razor.  It also improves the smell of a scuzzy razor considerably.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I needed and cheaper than Walmart(without shipping)</li>
            <li> Best price anywhere!!</li>
            <li> This is a great buy for the price. Cost more in the local store for fewer numbers. will buy again when needed</li>
            <li> These refills slip in with no problem and the price was great.  It is also great to have a refill handy instead of letting the shaver get dirty while getting one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a great job cleaning lubricates as well.  Worth purchasing. Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> PERFECT. JUST LIKE YOU FIND AT TARGET  ONLY CHEAPER AND DELIVERED.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> SAME AS SERIES 3&amp; 5. I LIKE THE FACT THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE PHYSICAL PART OF THE REMEW CARTRIDGE.</li>
            <li> What is there to say? The stuff works great, and the price can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;ve read where others are using the empty containers to make their own cleaning product. I do a full clean every other day, and one container lasts me over 2 months. At this rate, it&#x27;s so inexpensive to buy in bulk it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of trying to make your own.</li>
            <li> Replacements came without a scratch and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It&#x27;s nice to shave and go without having to manually clean every time. I do pop the blades off and quickly rinsed out the whiskers before putting in the cleaning base most time. It only takes a few seconds and keeps the cleaning solution much clearer until it&#x27;s time to be changes. On mine, you know it&#x27;s time to change it when the blades are still wet after 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Four replacement cartridges.  Not much to say here, these are replacements for the shaver cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> Great price!  Love my Braun shaver, and the clean and renew cartridges!</li>
            <li> These are Braun branded items and at a great price. I am very satisfied with them and will order again.</li>
            <li> I seriously hate it when my Sync runs out of cleaner.  The cleaner does a great job of cleaning out all the gunk that collects in the razor.  A simple washing of the razor head under hot water just does not do the job.  Yes, it is a bit pricey, but I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. Good value for the money. I would recommend getting this product this way rather than at a retail establishment.</li>
            <li> You open your Braun cleaning station, slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor, it&#x27;s cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China, filled with alcohol, coloring, and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?</li>
            <li> Nicely packed in a group of 4 in a small box that will be good for storage. Works great.  Just like the original one.</li>
            <li> Love my 9585 although the chrome coated body is peeling near the head where exposed to cleaing solution.after many years of use. I used to clean weekly but switched to daily to help control acne, it worked.  However, cleaning solution occasionally lasts only 3-4 weeks, instead of  my usual 2 months.  What I discovered is that the drain hole back to the reservoir is quite small (to limit evaporation?) but it is so small that it sometimes gets plugged by stubble.  Once the hole is plugged the solution gets pumped up to the head cleaing trough but can&#x27;t drain back so it evaporates very quickly because of the larger exposed surface area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I clean out the drain hole every week or two with a cotton swab or toothpick.  I also wipe out the crust in the trough with a tissue because it may dislodge and plug the hole.  Good solution life since..</li>
            <li> Very nice! nothing to disapprove.</li>
            <li> Great price very fast felivery</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Great price. What more could you want from product like this? I will order these again and again as long as the Braun  holds up..</li>
            <li> If you have a Braun shaver you know what these are and they are not cheap.  Buying through Amazon give me a great price, the ability to buy in quantity, and saves me from having to drive around to shop..something I do not enjoy!</li>
            <li> Small box, no leaks, convenient way to find just the right component. If you have a series 5 Braun, this is an excellent way to keep it humming.</li>
            <li> it is perfect for a year supply. once I ran out a new order came in, It really keeps my razor clean</li>
            <li> I think the Braun shaver is great. The cleaning system is super convenient. These refills are supposed to last about a month but I got about 4 months out of mine. I just leave the the shaver in the cradle when I am not using it and run the clear when the light says too. Others have posted that they lose the clueing solution to evaporation but I have not had that problem. Maybe leaving the shaver in the cradle slow that down (like having a lid).</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the great value this purchase represents. The cartridges are just as described and work great. They were also much cheaper than purchasing them at a retail store. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> a real bargain by buying 4 at a time</li>
            <li> fast service would buy again</li>
            <li> The clean &amp; renew cartridges cleaned my shaver in the old model self-cleaner, but they suffered from heavy rates of evaporation.  With the purchase of a new model self-cleaner, the evaporation problem has, well, evaporated.  They are lasting much longer and cleaning just as well.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Much better price than buying them individually at a local store.  Quality seems to be just the same so I like it!</li>
            <li> I really like having things I can&#x27;t find around town on Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save option.  It&#x27;s the mundane stuff like razor cleaning refills, so nothing to jump up and down about, but they show up on time.  I can change my delivery to be a little earlier if I find that my timing is slightly off.  It&#x27;s really nice to get an email &amp;#34;It&#x27;s on its way&amp;#34; right when I&#x27;m about to run out.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great deal on the refills. Love that I can schedule it and not have to worry about keeping up on stock.</li>
            <li> Great value and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Refills fit my device and clean the shaver as expected.</li>
            <li> The best value anywhere!! Original  products....</li>
            <li> what should I say, it works fine ...thanks</li>
            <li> This was a good buy with a fair price.  Shipping was excellent.  No issues, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Does the job  I am going to get more</li>
            <li> It give my shaver a bath the cleans and sterilizers, I get no more bumps on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> I have been using these cleaning catridges for at least 10 years.  They get the job done and the next time I use my razor, the shave is always better.  What I have been doing recently, when the fluid starts to get low, is replenishing the catridge with a little isopropyl alcohol.  That makes the cartridge last longer between replacements and saves me a couple of bucks in the long run.  I will do that once per cartridge, no more than that.</li>
            <li> The cartridges arrived in a cardboard shipping box which was easy to open.  They exactly match the existing ones and so everything looked in perfect order. The product arrived and worked exactly as advertised.  What more would you want?</li>
            <li> Same stuff that you get in the stores but about a third of the price.  Best way to keep your electric from turning into a cesspool of bacteria and grossness that could cause infection.  Keeps the blades from corroding as quickly which means longer life.</li>
            <li> This is the same you will get in the store. Only a better price and you don&#x27;t have to deal with going to the store. Win win</li>
            <li> If you have a Braun shaver that takes this cleaning cartridge you really don&#x27;t have a choice. I believe they are the only source for these. They last almost exactly one month and they do clean the shaver effectively. A bit pricey for what they are but I knew what I was in for when I bought the shaver so I&#x27;m not complaining. The only negative I can say is that the cleaning solution dissolves the silver paint covering on the end of the shaver near the head. Not a big deal as far as function but it doesn&#x27;t look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying these as long as this shaver holds up. It is still probably the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
            <li> I love the auto-clean on my new braun.  It&#x27;s way easy and convenient and surprisingly efficient.  Because it&#x27;s alcohol based cleaner and will evaporate I remove the cartridge and recap it usually daily, and my cartridge of 2 months is still mostly full.  It takes a few seconds but satisfies the cheapskate in me.</li>
            <li> I tried many other Braun shaver cleaning solutions the last one produced even rust on my shaver head. When you want the Braun shaver to work for year to come (7) then use only this Cartridges.</li>
            <li> Actually, I need it to use my Braun electric razor.</li>
            <li> great price, delivered quickly</li>
            <li> Ingenious cleaning system that leaves a fresh lemon scent on the shaver.  It also lubricates the shaving head.  No fuss/no muss.</li>
            <li> The big difference about buying the refills at Amazon is that I save a lot of money.  So if you have a Braun clean and rinse cartridge shaver you&#x27;d be very smart to purchase them in the four count box from Amazon!</li>
            <li> these do a great job at keeping your razor clean, but they are kind of expensive. I&#x27;ve read many places you can just use alcohol instead and refill them.</li>
            <li> Most places around me do not carry these. This is the cheapest and easiest way for me to get what I need.</li>
            <li> Keeps my Braun fresh every day.  Have also found Amazon the best place to purchase these for the price, with the subscription it is very easy and I don&#x27;t have to remember to reorder.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I needed these for the Braun shaver I recently bought.  Works well and keeps the shaver clean.  I can see all kinds of hair bits in the bottom of the container when I&#x27;ve taken a used one out.  Just wish the shaving system would cap these so they don&#x27;t evaporate so fast.</li>
            <li> When I 1st bought the Braun Shaver my 1st thought was why I spent $200.00 on a shaver. Though it was a great investment thinking of all the cost of the disposable razors, shaving cream, cuts, etc. I went through. With the docking station sterilizing the shaver every time I know it&#x27;s perfectly clean. Each person cleans their shaver depending on how much they care of cleanliness of their shaver. It&#x27;s a very simple process interchanging the Refill cartridges. Though a warning to people wanting to Travel with docking station, keep the tab you pop off the top so you can open the docking station and enclose the refill cartridge removing it from the docking station. Otherwise it leaks all over the place when you tip the Docking Station making everything that it leaked on smell like aftershave.</li>
            <li> There seems to be an issue with them as they leak.</li>
            <li> - No real variety for purchasing this item as it is manufacturer only, but watch you price per unit. A cheaper deal was found not by buying the larger bulk single item but multiple of a smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> The replacement cartridges will evaporate over time and should be replaced when the indicator in the base reflects the time to change. The solution is alcohol based and will evaporate but is a must for the razors performance and hygiene.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was what it said it was, what more can you ask for lol plus thats like 4 months worth of refills</li>
            <li> Once again you have fulfilled a need for my husband.  He is very pleased to have a source for this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; woks as expected.</li>
            <li> Sweet deal on this razor cleaner.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the ones I pay double for at Ralphs...</li>
            <li> Good price and value.</li>
            <li> They are required for the Braun shaver.  I didn&#x27;t realize this when I purchased the shaver for my husband as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quick to change and no mess. Other razors I&#x27;ve used had to be manually cleaned which was very time-consuming and annoying. I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same cleaning refills for the Braun razor cleaning base that are sold in 2 or 3 packs in stores for much more. There is only one size cartridge that fits any Braun base.  I used to save &amp; refill them but at this price why bother, it&#x27;s not worth the little I was saving or the mess involved.</li>
            <li> I think these are a necessary part of the Braun shaving razor.  You need to keep the cutting blades clean for a good shave</li>
            <li> Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills, Frustration Free 4 Count normal quality.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered eight of them, unfortunately items marked Flammable brand and not subject to postal delivery in Russia.</li>
            <li> Excellent way to buy a consumable product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Good price, smells good, lubricates the shaver head and i can feel the difference in shaving when it is washed only with water and when it is washed with the Braun liquid.</li>
            <li> These things work really well, they just don&#x27;t last long enough.  Makes for a smoother, faster shave.  I just use the cleaning function sparingly.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving system. $$ but worth it, you will be happy with this. I love it.&lt;br /&gt; Word</li>
            <li> Love the packaging and really love how it keeps my razor clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li> Nice to buy them in bulk, especially since it&#x27;s hard to find them locally (for a reasonably price, too).</li>
            <li> I purchased the razor and this refills for my husband as a gift. He is so happy with the product. I was happy with the seller for they did what they said in everyway.</li>
            <li> Keeps the shaver clean and parts lubricated.  Fresh smell.  Wish they made a refill though to reduce producing so much trash and lower the cost.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t HAVE to use the cleaning function of the Braun. You can use it like any other shaver and clean it with a brush. But if you don&#x27;t mind paying ~$60/year on these refills, then the cleaning system works great. I hope eventually someone decides to make generic versions of the refills or sells the fluid only so we can refill them (like they do with inkjet printer cartridges). I would NOT take the advice of the guy who recommended using alcohol and lemon juice as a refilling liquid. Lemon has sugar (and other impurities) in it, and alcohol doesn&#x27;t have lubricating agents and may strip the lubricating that the blades need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning every other day may seem like a money-saving idea, but I have found that even if you don&#x27;t use it for weeks, the cleaning fluid still evaporates and you have to replace it almost as frequently, so I figure I might as well get the benefit of cleaning rather than let the stuff just evaporate away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Amazon starts selling these things directly since buying it from J&amp;R is not a good deal because of the shipping charges. Instead, go to Walgreens or some other store that sells the shaver system, and buy it there. BestBuy.com sells it for the same price with free shipping. J&amp;R&#x27;s prices are regular street prices (not 50% off).</li>
            <li> These were cheaper ordering them then buying them in the store! works great!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I can say about this except that it works without any problems. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Easy to install, cleans the razor well, but fairly pricey. Shipping was fast and the cartridges (before use) store easily and safely.</li>
            <li> Item seems to work OK and I use it about once or twice a week. Over the long run it could get expensive regarding renew cartridges.</li>
            <li> Best price. Excellent package</li>
            <li> These work great in my husbands shaver cleaner. Keeps his shaver head clean, you can actually see all it cleans off when you remove the old refill</li>
            <li> Sweet deal! I don&#x27;t have to be cheap in rinsing this with water and trying to stretch the refill.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this solution for his razor.  We hadn&#x27;t bought a refill for a while and we were thinking he needed a new razor.  Once he cleaned the razor in this solution, it was like new again.  We will definetely make this purchase again!</li>
            <li> Not much else to say about these, but they keep my shaver clean.  Don&#x27;t see any alternative to these so I keep buying.</li>
            <li> If you use a self cleaning Braun Shaver this is the most economical way to purchase the cartridges. They always come on time and well packed.</li>
            <li> The cartridges work perfectly and having four gives me a reserve supply - I never remember to reorder until one runs dry.  But the cover flaps are difficult to open and I generally splash some on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the job that the cartridges do.</li>
            <li> It evaporates quickly and seems complicated when an alternate procedure is also mentioned in the razor&#x27;s instructions.  Run the shaving head under tap water and ocassionally put a few drops of oil on the cutting foils.</li>
            <li> Love the shaver these are used for (Google Best Electric Shaver - you&#x27;ll see this Braun at the top of every list).  Need one of these guys every 10 days or so after the daily cleaning of the razor.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is easy to use and effective, it just doesn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;ll still continue to use them though.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, the right fit and function. I have purchased several times from amazon and have always been pleased</li>
            <li> These cartridges do a great job of keeping my Braun Series 5 shaver clean. They last a little over a month.</li>
            <li> Excellent item for the price, I like using my electric razor, and keeping it clean it extremely important for a good shave.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh smell and clean feel the Braun refills provide. I wish they would not evaporate so fast. I have noticed that when I return the razor to the cleaner each time, it lasts longer than if I leave the razor out.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of keeping Braun razor clean. I would recommend this product to supplement manual cleaning of razor.</li>
            <li> These are a great way to keep your razor clean. Price of purchasing 4 at a time is better than 2 at a time at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I had some reservations about the cleaning cartridge when I bought my Braun Series 7. What&#x27;s wrong with brushing the cassette and rinsing it in hot water? I&#x27;ve found that the cleaning cartridge is a superior solution. It cleans, lubricates and even adds a fresh lime smell to the cassette. I clean my razor just once a week and that seems to be enough, so the 4-pack lasts almost two years.</li>
            <li> Product works great. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Just like what comes with the razor. I simply put in the cartridge about once a week when I do a full clean and they last a long time. Each day I simply take off the foil/blade mechanism and brush it out and tap it on the side of the sink to get loose anything and also brush out the inside of the razor itself. It is a routine that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an 8 pack and when they are gone, I&#x27;ll try the trick of using 70% rubbing alcohol and some lemon essential oil and see if that works. The stuff is basically denatured alcohol and fragrance, so I&#x27;m not sure where the &amp;#34;lubricating&amp;#34; would come from.</li>
            <li> it works fine. no problems here</li>
            <li> Always a better deal in quantity, never any issues.  My Braun razor is money well spent.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I do recommend.</li>
            <li> I find that Clean &amp; Renew keeps my Braun System 7 shaver in top form.  The cartridges do all that I expect them to do, so I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> The stuff works but the whole &amp;#34;Braun Shaver&amp;#34; routine is TOO complicated. If you do not use this and replace the heads frequently the shaver is not effective. Better off with a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I run my shaver through a cleaning cycle ~ once a week and put the cover right back on it when it&#x27;s done. This pack will probably last me almost a year.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews on this product before I bought it. I read about how people didn&#x27;t like paying the price and work arounds and all sorts of things. I got the Braun 7 as a gift for Christmas; when I saw I needed to fork over $20 for cartridges to replace it every 8 weeks, I can&#x27;t complain. I&#x27;m a hygienic person and I shave every day (except Sunday, give the face a rest), but when I pulled the cartridge out to replace it the thing was completely disgusting. It&#x27;s worth it and I doubt I&#x27;ll change my tune.</li>
            <li> The best shave ever - I have loved the Braun shaver since my wife got it for me three years ago.</li>
            <li> These refills are difficult to get in quantity at local stores and are frequently very overpriced.  I was able to get a substantial supply here at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Great price...great product.</li>
            <li> Got here and a good amount of time and at a great price that&#x27;s well worth it!! Shop here all the time</li>
            <li> They are what they are, and they have never let me down after owning a Braun shaver for three years.</li>
            <li> Great value for these cleaner solutions as they would cost about 25-30% more when bought individually or the 2 paks at stores. Don&#x27;t mind the non-OEM packaging as long as the product inside is the same.</li>
            <li> Husband is Very happy with this product. Works as expected and was easy to purchase. I can not think of anything else to say.</li>
            <li> These refills fit my cleaner perfectly. Be careful when pulling the snap as this can sometimes cause spillage.  Disposal is extremely easy.</li>
            <li> Necessary because of the product design. No choice.</li>
            <li> Just a refill - so satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;is based on price and service.&lt;br /&gt;This is 4-star - maybe even 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT source because i use&lt;br /&gt;and older model shaver.</li>
            <li> I keep adding rubbing alcohol to mine to extend the life because it evaporates so quickly.  I replace these pretty much quarterly.</li>
            <li> The liquid cleaner in these cartridges keep the Braun shaver in great shape.  My husband has had shaver for several years now and can attribute longevity to Braun Clean.</li>
            <li> My husband finally got around to using these. He purchased them when he bought his shaver approx. in October 2013. It took him that long to go through the cleaning cartridge that came with the shaver (end of Jan). He is satisfied with the product and it does what it is intended for.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent value, very convenient.</li>
            <li> No complaints. The price was really good, and I am very content with this purchase. I would recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE AND CONVENIENT</li>
            <li> Keeps the razor clean....a necessity!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for a good price, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I like my Braun razor but not having to pay a lot of money for these excessively packaged containers of what I suspect is alcohol/water with some light fragrance added. Save some money buying the four pack versus a single in a store.</li>
            <li> Great price for the cartridge refills. Keeping my Braun clean!</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that I wish it would last longer. Other than that, it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. Keeps the razor clean, fresh and helps give a wonderful clean shave every time. Easy to use and Amazon has the best price on this that we have found.</li>
            <li> inexpensive and works great!</li>
            <li> This is probably about the 6th or 8th time I&#x27;ve purchased this set of 4 refills.  I think that says enough.</li>
            <li> As advertised. No surprises. Gave it 3 stars only because I think it&#x27;s slightly overpriced.</li>
            <li> product arrived early.  was exactly what was need and save a lot of money than if I have bought it in the store to the tune of about 25%.</li>
            <li> These keep my Braun shaver nice and clean</li>
            <li> I love this 4 pack of cartridge refill packs and how it comes in a frustration free packaging. These things work great and keep my razor clean and lubricated. Well worth the buy.</li>
            <li> My Braun cartridge was low so I ordered this refills.  Braun refill works great.  Highly recommend if you have a Series 7 shaver.</li>
            <li> These are a deal and super convenient when placed on instant reorder. They are the factory refills not a knock off.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it supposed to</li>
            <li> I use these regularly through subscribe and save. They fit the system perfectly, which keeps my razor clean. Affordably priced, more so than local retail options.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and price is good.</li>
            <li> Buy in bulk, it&#x27;s always cheaper and you never have that &amp;#34;oh no&amp;#34; feeling when you need to replace the cleaner.  I have had my Braun for several years but regularly cleaning the head has kept it nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Great product, perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li> Product is just as the picture depicts.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...no issues!!!</li>
            <li> Great buy on these. Will buy again. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big Braun fan who has several different Braun products.  These clean and renew cartridges make it easy to maintain your shavers.  They last about a month and then need to be replaced, so I subscribed to the Amazon subscription service and get these shipped to me 3 times a year, which gives you a price break on them.  They are made for the Braun Clean &amp; Charge device which comes with several Braun shaver models and work as advertised.</li>
            <li> THE BEST PRICE ON AMAZON- CAN&#x27;T BE BEAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE MY SHAVER SO I RELY ON THESE UNITS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LASTS A LONG TIME AND FOR THE PRICE, THAT MAKES ME HAPPY!</li>
            <li> The Best Way To But Is E-Bay.</li>
            <li> Wish braun used a different cleaning method.  It does work well though.</li>
            <li> Works with my shaver.  Best price I could find for a whole year&#x27;s supply.  I will buy this again next year.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff, just like you would buy at well-known stores for a greater price. Works great. My razor stays lubricated and spotless.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the prompt service and quality products when they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
            <li> Keeps your Braun like new.</li>
            <li> However, the ones at Amazoncost much less!  If you have a Braun razor buy these and save your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> The convenience of not having to search for these cleaning refills coupled with a very competitive price make for a slam dunk when you consider it delivered to your door.</li>
            <li> if you have a nice razor these are a must to keep it in near perfect condition, great price also !</li>
            <li> Gotta buy them and a review doesn&#x27;t change that. They work better than whatever you are using instead.</li>
            <li> It met our expectations and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Works well.  Still on the first one.  Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills, Frustration Free 4 Count.  Not bad.</li>
            <li> I love these cartridges to use with the braun self cleaning razors. this particular item from Amazon has easy to open packaging and is sold at a significant discount from our local grocer and it gets expensive to change these as often as I need to otherwise. I would recommend the 4 pack and consistently ordering when you replace the last one in the shaver so you have a new one ready when it runs out. quality product that i have used for years and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed. Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Since I get new refills (auto-ship) every few months, I clean my Braun shaver fairly often.  Does a great job.</li>
            <li> Why spend more if you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same cartridge that came with the razor - no frills packaging.  I tried using just alcohol, but the filter at the bottom that strains your hair does clog, and is never the same after you try to clean it.  This is the best bang for the buck that I have found thus far.</li>
            <li> This is a proprietary product for a closed system application, therefore it is extremely overpriced for what it is - 99% water.</li>
            <li> as advertised. they clean well.</li>
            <li> Fit just like the original one, I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between them. I realized how nice the self cleaning system is on the Braun shavers when i looked at the bottom of my old empty cartridge and it was full of hair.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product.  Very satisfied.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> They have always done their job in cleaning my razor and extending its life.  Excellent and a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> This product provides a very easy solution to keeping the electric razor clean and working in an excellent manner.</li>
            <li> Great deal on getting these in a 4-pack, cheapest place to get them.</li>
            <li> Does a good job keeping my razor clean.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my electric shaver from braun, for almost 8 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Really works for cleaning and smoothing</li>
            <li> Expensive but does the trick.  Best to order this on the reoccurring basis for better savings.  4 pack should last you six months.</li>
            <li> Best price in town will keep ordering it</li>
            <li> The cartridges work well for my shaver and was able to get at a great price.  The previous cartridge lasted a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> gotta have these if you have the razor!</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaver clean, and it&#x27;s nice to order in bulk. The box is easy to open, and they are the real deal</li>
            <li> great product, works fine. I&#x27;ve had my razor for some time with no problems and I believe it is largely due to this product</li>
            <li> This is the only way to purchase the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills and save money at the same time. Check it out!</li>
            <li> Purchasing a 4 count of these Braun cleaning cartridges saved a significant amount of money. They&#x27;re genuine Braun, so I&#x27;m confident that they will keep my razor working well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun self-clean shaver for years. These cartridges last a month (each) and with Subscribe &amp; Save I don&#x27;t even have to remember to order them.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and fresh and keeps the razor clean.  Easy to install.  Fits and works as good as the original.</li>
            <li> Norelco rejects this fluid, I bought 4 pack as a substitute but couldn&#x27;t get it to work, probably the alcohol.</li>
            <li> Excellent refill in a four pack that makes reordering a twice-a-year affair. I really should just use the subscription function and be done with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you need when you have to be clean shaven everyday. Helps keep your razor clean and functioning properly.</li>
            <li> Good bargain, exactley as described. Would by again if needed to. Too bad razors didnt fit! Too bad for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just now replacing the original cleaning cartridge that came with the razor.  The cartridges I received are exactly the same as the as the original, however when you order be sure to scroll down and look closely at the $$ price/quantity/supplier differences and do the math.  They are listed several different times in different packaging and quantities and I noted prices varying as much a $4 per cartridge.  Don&#x27;t be &amp;#34;click happy&amp;#34; on the first one you see.</li>
            <li> I was so worried that one refill would cost like $20.00 that I would manually clean the shaver myself.  Then I decided to see if Amazon.com had any specials deals on refills.  To my surprise, they had &amp;#34;the frustration free 4 count for little or nothing. Amazon.com is always my last resort if I want something badly enough.  I will go on line to all of the major department store website, then I will come here.  Amazon will always beat their prices.  This was a great pick up for me.</li>
            <li> Very good deal for these package, it beats everywhere pricing for this item. It is made we the same quality of other packaging for it.</li>
            <li> Bought the value pack and all 4 are the real deal, same labels as my originals. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to be able to get this product in bulk to help reduce the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is made by a Braun approved source in Ireland you be sure&lt;br /&gt;it won&#x27;t harm your razor.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that Braun now has a four-pack of cartridge refills.  Much more convenient than the two- or three-pack.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say. I got what I requested, and in time. My Braun razor will feel happy, I think ;)</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed for my new Braun Series 7 Razor.  I like the fact that you can get these in just about any size you need depending on how often you use and clean your razor and can set it up on regular shipments and save 5%.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Braun shaving system that required these refills.  It is the easiest, highest quality, shaving system I have ever owned.  The refills simply slide in and out when finished.  The shaver stays nice and clean and life couldn&#x27;t be less stress free with a shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;Hutch</li>
            <li> Great deal and great packaging. After each use, I make sure to seal up the cartridge and keep it separate from the cleaning unit. This avoids the evaporation problem and they last longer. Only take a few seconds to do this each time and I only use the cleaning unit about every 10 shaves anyways.</li>
            <li> No nonsense packaging gives a great price.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years. It does work and cleans my Braun razor so that it is like new.</li>
            <li> dose the job,cleans grate</li>
            <li> It just works. Keeps razor clean, sterile, and fresh. Have not had any facial irritation since switching to this system.</li>
            <li> Delivered as described</li>
            <li> These are cheaper here than at best buy I&#x27;ll tell you that.  I like getting them in sets of four. One cartridge last me about a month of daily shaving.  That&#x27;s cheap. So satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> they work great thanks</li>
            <li> great cleaner, fresh smelling and easy to use. I like the container and ease of use. Cleans my braun very well.</li>
            <li> this is a great price if you own this shaver. the refills can be quite expensive if bought separately in smaller packs</li>
            <li> Pack of 4 is an excellent buy, compared to a single unit.  This product was not available in any store in my city.  Therefore I was very happy to find a bargain like this!</li>
            <li> They clean my razor very well.  I just have too many of them now, haha</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell it provides to the razor, seems to keep the razor in new like condition!  But i think in the future I will keep the used cartridges--clean them out and buy the bulk refill fluid that comes in different fragrances--and less $$$$</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be the price and it&#x27;s nice to have a clean shaver.</li>
            <li> this braun razor is the best ever and the refills will last me 3 years to help keep the razor in tip top shape..before i bought the razor i always used blades to get a close shave BUT NOW this new razor does it all thank you</li>
            <li> it seems oily because it leaves some yellowish oil smear every time I run it through a cycle.  not so much the refill&#x27;s fault, but perhaps an overall product design.</li>
            <li> If you have a Braun shaver that needs this cleaner, this is a great price. You won&#x27;t run out with the backups.</li>
            <li> Needed replacement cartridges and why not buy in bulk to save a few bucks.  They work just fine, cant tell if they are OEM or not, but everything is great with them....</li>
            <li> I do not believe in these surveys.  If I continue to use it I must like it.  If not, I guess I wouldn&#x27;t be using it.</li>
            <li> Trying using your razor for a week without cleaning it. Then try cleaning it every day. You&#x27;ll see a huge difference in the closeness of the shave and almost zero skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Excellent Razor. Works as advertised. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product I&#x27;ve bought many times at retail stores such as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, but at a much better price, nevermind the convenience of having it show up at my front door 2 days after hitting &#x27;Submit&#x27; on the order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely clean my shaver more frequently and order these again as needed.</li>
            <li> Marriage saver...keeps the counter clean</li>
            <li> Everything came on time and as expected</li>
            <li> This product keeps may shaver working like new. Cleans and lubricates my shaver head after each shave and I can get a clean close shave even in warm weather when you are sweated some. I recommend this product for a shave like a new blade every time.</li>
            <li> I received the four cleaning/renewal kits as described. They were new as described and fit into the base. Razor cleaned</li>
            <li> I love the 4 pack! My boyfriend hasn&#x27;t used them yet, but he&#x27;s always scrambling to order one once the light comes on his Braun telling him that he needs to change the cartridge. I&#x27;m glad we won&#x27;t have to worry about ordering them for a while.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - clean and sanitize my Braun razor.  One refill seems to last 2 months.  And that&#x27;s shaving about 6 days a week.  I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but it does.</li>
            <li> I only like it.  How can you love cleaning fluid for your electric razor.  I always get my best shave after going through the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> These cartridges do a nice job of freshening up my razor.  I really liked getting a multi-pack from Amazon in the Frustration Free packaging.  Although, the Frustration Free packaging is marginally more difficult to open than the two packs in the manufacturer packaging.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to make my own cleaning solution but found this 4 pack priced below what 3 would cost me locally.</li>
            <li> This thing does a nice job of cleaning my razor but the price is beyond ridiculous.  It&#x27;s nothing more than alcolhol with a little lubricant and cheap perfume.  I&#x27;ve used isopropyl alcohol with identical results for a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> I have been using the auto renew for this product. Although it comes in an Amazon pack, it is the same manufacturer product as in the factory package. Can&#x27;t complain about the renewal price, very competitive.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my Braun razor in top working performance.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t skimp on keeping your razor clean. It really preserves the function.</li>
            <li> Considering these units are not refillable, the price seems to be OK and they do seem to last for 30 days if used on the razor on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t feel like it is absolutely necessary to clean the razor daily. Since the razor also recharges when it&#x27;s cleaning, might be a good idea to let the razor drain the battery first before charging it repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, each cartridge can probably last you for a couple months if you cover the cleaning holes with it&#x27;s supplied caps to prevent the alcohol from evaporating.</li>
            <li> glad to get just in time I was out. these keep the razor like new and it is nice to shave after cleaning.</li>
            <li> My husband has used Braun shavers for years.  This cleaning solution keeps the razor in great shape and really keeps it clean.  And, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have received my Braun Series 7 shaver just a month ago and I thought it&#x27;s time to get the refill. Ordered one box with 4 refills and was classified by Borderlinx as prohibited item due to the alcohol content. Contacted Amazon and they were nice enough to offer full refund.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU FOR THE VALUE PACK. I AM 83 YRS OLD AND GETTING TO THE STORE THAT CARRIES THESE IS A PROBLEM. TOLD MY SON ABOUT THE SERVICE AND HE IS GOING TO BE ORDERING ALSO PLUS SHAVING HEADS PARTS. DO YOUSELL THE CHARGING STAND ALONE.. MINE IS ACTING UP SOME TIMES.</li>
            <li> We have two razors that use these in the house so a four pack is not too much. Good price. Fast shipping. Gotta love that.</li>
            <li> Disappointed this was not correctly advertised.  This is a Chinese knock off, and not authentic Braun product-.</li>
            <li> Great value! These cartridges can be very expensive and this plain-boxed set is the best bang for you buck.</li>
            <li> Works just fine good price</li>
            <li> well what can i say this does whatr it is supposed to do that is clean your shaver and it smells great can be expensive the refill</li>
            <li> I struggle to run out on supplies, and have yet had an issue. I cant use it fast enough before a new shipment comes in.</li>
            <li> got to love this razor.  I have a heavy beard and it really gives me a good shave.  The cleaners are a great deal via Amazon</li>
            <li> I bought a 790cc for my husband; he loves it. Meanwhile, the machine does need more refills after it runs.</li>
            <li> What can I say...it works.</li>
            <li> Handy packaging. Not a very earth-friendly solution. One would think these should be drained and recycled, but the package recommends disposal.</li>
            <li> Bought with my shaver</li>
            <li> Good product at a really good value.</li>
            <li> This keeps my 700 Series Braun shaver clean as a pin.  I would recommend using this for maintaining anyone&#x27;s Series 700 Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> I buy this product with the &#x27;Subscribe &amp; Save&#x27; Amazon feature.  It beats going to the store and having someone unlock a case where this product is stored.  And, I save money too.</li>
            <li> I think cleaning the razor in necessary, but these are really costly.  I&#x27;ve tried to make my own solution, but it&#x27;s hard to clean out the plastic container.</li>
            <li> Keeps my Braun shaver in top shape.</li>
            <li> very smart clean and last long (almost 2 and half month now and still full)&lt;br /&gt;I like the lemon smell.</li>
            <li> Nice way to clean the shaver with cleaner&lt;br /&gt;This is much better than doing by brush without a cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Love my Braun shaver. Do I love these? Of course. Are the expensive? Of course. But totally worth it. I hope this item never goes out of stock.</li>
            <li> These are necessary for cleaning my razor and it is much cheaper getting them here than getting them at the store.</li>
            <li> Easy to use cartridges for the Braun charge and clean.  Keeps the shaver running well.  Ordering 4 at once gives you refills when needed.</li>
            <li> Great product, and good value. Husband&#x27;s thrilled. A+++</li>
            <li> Sometimes you buy two, dometimes four, but the various quantities can vary widely in unit cost. I do think US$5 each is high, but it is often the lowest price here.</li>
            <li> Great Price for the refills you recieve .&lt;br /&gt;The refills fit perfect and have plenty of spares for future replacement .</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and as described, I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive to replace though, I suggest buyers not to throw away the cover of the containers, then once  you are done cleaning your shaver you can remove it from the machine and put the cover back in, this will increase the durability of the cartridges, you don&#x27;t need to keep it inside the shaver once you are done cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m finished with these cartridges in gonna start straight edge shaving. Gotta get off the system, gonna strive to be self reliant and continually dump money into these companies. Yes, its convenient and I&#x27;ll use when I&#x27;m crunched for time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these. The packaging is small and appropriate for the size. No big waste. The price was right.</li>
            <li> If you live in a low humidity area evaporation is a problem, but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> Just the way I expected.</li>
            <li> Works just like the ones you buy in the store. Much better value.</li>
            <li> Repeat order.  As usual, as described and delivered on time. Caught a great sale this time.</li>
            <li> Product was received undamaged, all cartridges were sealed and completely full.  The cartridges installed without incident and functioned properly.  The solution had the same fragrance as the previous store bought cartridge and appeared to perform as well.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve our jaded replacement cartridges before and they were usually from my local RiteAid and it was 2 in a box of replacements for like $25 so this was totally worth the money and I got more cartridges!</li>
            <li> I have the Braun 5 series with a cleaner base, so these refills are my lifeblood.  I go through one every two months or so,so the subscribe and save on this is about right, but every once in a while I have to stop it to cut down my stockpile of these things.  I mean realistically, these things are just moulded plastic and alcohol, and I can buy a whole lot more industrial alcohol than this for a lot cheaper, but the convenience of being able to pop one in when the light goes off is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These help keep the razor cutting like a champion.  Really do a nice job; however, for the price, it&#x27;s the cost of doing business.</li>
            <li> Well packaged, great price!</li>
            <li> I really like my Braun and the close shave it gets. With that close shave I get a dirty shaver. I click my shaver in to the base and it makes it as clean as new and it works great. I just don&#x27;t like that I have to keep buying these things. First, they cost me money, second they use a lot of plastic. Then what do I do with them? Throw them in the trash and upset Gaia? What would Captain Planet think?</li>
            <li> Excellent product nice packaging had to have it for my husband&#x27;s razor and I think the price was very good I like Amazon because of this.</li>
            <li> I use these for my Braun shaver and am very satisfied with their performance.  I highly recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> I faithfully clean my Braun 7000 with this and it continues to work as new.  Don&#x27;t pass it up with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Saved some money buying four.  The price was right, and these were the exact model for my Braun 7 system.</li>
            <li> A good product for my razor.  It keeps it in perfect working order.  Worth the expense as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> How do you sell razor blades to people with electric shavers?  Sell them a &amp;#34;self-cleaning system with consumable cleaning solution cartridges.&amp;#34;  Well, as much as I dislike (being on the receiving end of) the business model, the newer shavers are very good, and the cleaning station does a great job of refreshing the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 4-pack of cleaning cartridges should last me 6-9 months of regular cleaning (roughly every 10 days).  Well packaged, quickly shipped, best price.</li>
            <li> Good product that really does the job for a great razor.  A little expensive but worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Great value. Husband loves it. Must be careful not to tip the unit. So easy to use.</li>
            <li> Item shipped promptly, and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> As always high quality purchase.</li>
            <li> They work well in cleaning my series 7 electric razor. Only problem is they don&#x27;t seem to last very long. Although I knew that before buying the razor.</li>
            <li> Always a great product and the price is great.  Nothing bad to say about it.  Keeps my razor clean operating well.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday, once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer, it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year.</li>
            <li> Have had a Braun for many years now and would typically buy the 2 pack boxes at the local store.  Found these on-line and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Having a bunch of extras is perfect for that time when your cleaner light turns red and you need that thing cleaned for tomorrow...</li>
            <li> There are always some residual hair on shaver. Using with 790cc</li>
            <li> I bought this for a replacement cleaning cartridge. There are no problems, it just does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> As described.  Better price than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> great product. works great.</li>
            <li> Headline says it all. Best way too restock your Braun supplies. Best deal on line for product you must have for your Braun electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My local supermarkets stock these also but Amazon often has a great price on these refills and so they get my business. Love how easy to use these things are.</li>
            <li> I like my Braun clean, this is a fair deal.</li>
            <li> Same as used w/previous model. Will probably not use cleaning &amp; charging step as often as recommended, this would be excessive use of cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th Braun razor... These keep it perfect. Easy to install in your cleaner and much better than just brushing the head with a brush.</li>
            <li> These last quite a while and do a good job keeping the shaver lubricated and clean, best price I&#x27;ve seen anywhere also.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal - much cheaper than the 2-packs sold in stores. I read on here one user&#x27;s note about taking these out of the cleaning unit (and putting the caps on them) after each cleaning and that was GREAT advice! They last much longer this way (when the solution can&#x27;t evaporate). I would also recommend taking the foil off and rinsing the blade and foil with water in the sink first. This way most of the hairs are cleaned out in the sink, and these cartridges don&#x27;t collect much of anything (just use them for the cleaning/sanitizing). I bought this 4-pack almost 2 months ago and I&#x27;m still using the 1st cartridge (which is still FULL and looks clean). I expect this 4-pack to last at least a year.</li>
            <li> People whine about cleaning cartridges for Braun razors but they really enhance the shave and are pretty cheap when you consider that you only buy one blade cassette a year.  Buying a six pack is way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Found what I needed. Ordered it.  Am satisfied with what I ordered as it was as &amp;#34;advertised.&amp;#34;  Will purchase again when this is needed.</li>
            <li> A couple Christmases ago I was giving the shaver that using this product and as for the shaver I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve never had better result in my life. When I started looking around for replacement product to do with the liquid I found the best deals on Amazon.com. I read a other reviews on this site never think that there are ways you could make your own version of the product but time and effort you put into doing it I believe you&#x27;re really not saving much. As for this product I do not necessarily use this product daily depends on how much against you think I will clean this may be once a week or halfway through the week. Since it&#x27;s very easy to install this product into the shaver device that cleans eyes well save the top and keep covering the tops of liquid did not operate which makes extend the life of this product.</li>
            <li> Great value, timely shipments</li>
            <li> These cartridge refills will last you a good long time. No issues at all to report. Husband says they are great!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor, and the cleaning feature. I wish they had bigger packs available so we didn&#x27;t have to buy as often, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Best deal I could find on those.&lt;br /&gt;They come in a non-descriptive box, saving the cost of the original Braun boxes.&lt;br /&gt;They work as intended.</li>
            <li> Good price for refills that are much more money in the stores.  I highly recommend them for someone that has the Braun Shavers.</li>
            <li> This Braun cleaner is a must have for the Braun shaver, and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price ay Amazon. I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The Braun Refills work as promised and are required for the Braun Clean &amp;Renew system.  Don&#x27;t really have a choice but to use them.</li>
            <li> bought these and was surprised to see they were made to sell overseas for a much lower price. They are made by Braun and are exactly the same as the others. Should have bought more.</li>
            <li> My Braun Series 7 790cc shaver seems to glide on my skin better following a cleaning with this product. If you leave the cartridge in the cleaning/charging gizmo, it will evaporate. I remove the cartridge following every cleaning, and replace the cap that originally came with it. I used a side cutter to remove some of the extra plastic, leaving just the 2 caps connected and the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; on the big cap. It is an easy way to extend the life of the cartridge.</li>
            <li> These refills are a necessary expense for full use of the Braun shaver, and they work great to keep it in operating condition.</li>
            <li> nice to have a clean razor. this stuff is great. cleans that nasty razor and leaves it nice and fresh for the next use.</li>
            <li> I use this product to clean my Braun series 5 razor. It works fine and is a good product. Braun is a good razor and have used it for years</li>
            <li> This renew product works great with my Braun razor.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good service good product</li>
            <li> The price and the quality was perfect</li>
            <li> So easy to use.  Nothing to dislike!</li>
            <li> Just the right size for me, keeping an extra on hand always so as to never be caught without then that yellow warning light tells me I&#x27;ll need a replacement in a couple days.  And cheaper than local stores.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard &amp; cannot use a &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; razor for neck &amp; under jaw, as Ill get ingrown hair... This does the trick, after 3 weeks its been perfect... I had an older model, high end, bit not close in the nature of the shave. This is a fine piece of kit.</li>
            <li> Started using this around May 14th, it is now July 8th and the light on my Braun just went to the yellow low state. Although it lasted that long, I don&#x27;t shave everyday so I would say it lasted a good month if compared to continuous use.</li>
            <li> Great price for OEM refills.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my hubby needed and cheaper then the store!</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place to purchase Braun Cartridge Refills. Historically I&#x27;d always run out when purchasing them individually and never liked the idea of stocking up until seeing the deal with this 4 count.  This is my go-to source for refills.</li>
            <li> The fit the razor well and work perfectly.  I find by using just once a week and keeping the cap on the unit in between uses, the cartridges last at least three months each...</li>
            <li> Watch!  Had a debit card compromised after a recent purchase.</li>
            <li> Better than not using it. Could be cheaper. Nice clean smell though. You can tell a pretty big difference of you don&#x27;t use it for a while, as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> you need this stuff to clean the shaver. not really many other options than just refilling the thing with water but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that.</li>
            <li> Update: August 27, 2015.  I continue to be more than satisfied with this product.  I highly recommend it!   I tired some of the others product substitutes but they just done compare in my opinion.  I like this because it does the job of cleaning my Braun well, it does not leave a residual smell and I feel my shaver works better, no best after it is cleaned with this product over all others I have tried.  So, I would say don&#x27;t scrimp on the cost, go for the best with this product and you will never be unhappy.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a clean razor each time.</li>
            <li> This cleaning process is something new for me, but I like it.  If feels so clean.  I recommend it to anyone who can afford it.</li>
            <li> Keeps the shaver clean.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Braun must be watering these down because they last less and less all the time.</li>
            <li> Best buy around works well</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> Product does a good job.</li>
            <li> I have tried the low priced replacement cleaner and they didn&#x27;t leave my shaver looking a clean as the Braun&#x27;s cleaner does. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats the manufacturer&#x27;s authentic replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to order this in bulk - this is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use replacement.</li>
            <li> I wish these pod last longer.</li>
            <li> First of three must have had a defect.  It leaked all over and wasted 2/3 of the solution.  Second one seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> Not sure what &#x27;frustration free&#x27; really means.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing holding this back from 5 stars is the pressure you need to pop open the cap without the cartridge sliding out of your grip and the inevitable spray of a few alcohol droplets when you do.</li>
            <li> good buy for the braun shaver cleaner</li>
            <li> Great seller highly recommended</li>
            <li> great! as described, good deal.</li>
            <li> So easy to shop for this and it fits my shaver exactly. I should be able to buy again in a few months.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable. The cleaning solution does a great job of cleaning the heads and screen for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> My Sweetheart ordered the Braun shaver and now his face is always clean shaven!  Absolutely wonderful!  I saw this product and said, &amp;#34;oh yes, make it easy to clean his new Braun shaver and he will continue to be very desirable to smooch on&amp;#34;!  He always looks GOOD!</li>
            <li> OEM refills for Braun Cleaner / Charger.  They do a good job of keeping my razor clean, I usually clean it once a week.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and convenience using Subscribe &amp; Save.  Highly recommended!  Lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a cheap replacement.  It&#x27;s the real Braun cartridge replacements.  They come packed in a sturdy box.  Very good.</li>
            <li> It has cleansed and lubricated both my Braun (significantly older model) shavers.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Expensive suckers anywhere you get them.  So I agree with the previous comment of keeping the lid on when not in use.  Seems to help so far.</li>
            <li> GOOD ÔºåI LIKE It VERY MUCHÔºÅIT HAD GIVEN Me A LOT OF FUN,I&#x27;LL RECOMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS!NICE NICE GREAT</li>
            <li> works great in our ¬∞CoolTec CT4cc stand.</li>
            <li> This bundle is great, I only have to repurchase every 6 months.  This is a better deal than anywhere else online or in store.</li>
            <li> The online ad with it, implied that the cleaner was included, which was not, so be aware, not sure what I will use these crazy things for. They smell like they are filled with isopropol alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;No big deal, not recommended unless you have the main cleaner unit.</li>
            <li> I love the braun machine, already have the shaver and this refill work great are simple I¬¥ll recommend you .</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. These was an OEM part and performed as expected with no change in fragrance or volume as the original item.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Subscribe and save is the way to.&lt;br /&gt;Also, received a new shaving head for my Braun shaved. Save time and effort to order on line via subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Nice to get 4 of these at a good price point.  As others state, wish they didn&#x27;t evaporate so rapidly, but they do a good job cleaning so....</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say except it works as intended although it seems a bit expensive for just a few ounces of alcohol?</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a clean razor each time you shave.  I wish the cleaning fluid was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Kind of silly to review these. They fit the cleaner properly. Too expensive, which cost them one star.</li>
            <li> The do what they are supposed to do.  They are required by the Braun razor he currently using for shaving.</li>
            <li> This refill cartridge works as intended.  It fits in your Braun razor charger base and cleans all the loose little beard hair out of the razor.  It also gives the razor a slight lemony alcohol scent, or is it an alcoholy lemon scent...?</li>
            <li> if these were even a dollar more each I wouldn&#x27;t touch them, but at this price they&#x27;re a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get acne with my electric and thought it was my facial hygiene... NOPE! well maybe it&#x27;s both, but the acne has severely decreased since using this.</li>
            <li> I bought a box of these thinking they would have to be changed frequently.  I shave just about every other day and I only hit the clean button when it hits the third level down.  At that rate I only have to change them approximately every three months.  So, yes, I like the system and don&#x27;t mind purchasing the refills as I believe it works well.</li>
            <li> nice hassle free packaging</li>
            <li> Good price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like to use this cleaning &amp; renewing solution from Braun for my shaver. It leaves the shaver with the &#x27;new&#x27; feel each morning when I use it. I have a series 7 shaver. My only rant, and its not about this product, is that the charging light doesn&#x27;t go out on the shaver, a bright blue LED, which is distracting at night.</li>
            <li> I got tired buying these cartridges one at a time. This way you get 4 of them at a great price.</li>
            <li> I got the first generation Syncro shaver cleaning systems when they first came out. I am glad the refill cartridges are the same for the second generation systems. The second generation systems are intelligent enough to automatically decide how intense a cleanning session your shaver needs. I think this also helps conserve the amount of cleaning fluid is used. Another way to make it last longer is not to clean your shaver after every use, but rather just once or twice a week. In between cleanings, or before extended absences, I pull out the refill cartridge and seal it to keep the fluid from evaporating while it is just sitting there. So make sure to save the cap so that you can reseal the cartridge!</li>
            <li> What can be said about such a product? It meets the need, is the best price i could find and comes well packed.</li>
            <li> No complaints from me and this product. It does as good job cleaning my razor and the four pack I had purchased resembles great value over buying it locally in the store.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying the four pack. Great price for a very good product. Works great and is just like the original</li>
            <li> great until I heard about  Klean-Strip GSL26 Denatured Alcohol, 1-Gallon</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Braun razor and this is the best price I have found for the cleaning cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was prompt and product is a good one.</li>
            <li> Great product so far haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and cleans great. Also for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Even though Braun still sells MANY electric razors using these cartridges, they&#x27;re hard to find in any stores.  Years ago I could find them in Walmart but no longer.  You replace one a month, so an Amazon subscription, at a good price, makes a lot of sense.</li>
            <li> Useful. a must to have.</li>
            <li> The only way to keep the razor working right! Protect your pricey investment and keep your beard away by allowing clean blades to do the job properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over half a year and it&#x27;s the best electric razor system that I have ever used.  It sure saves a lot of time in the morning, too.</li>
            <li> No problem with the refills.  Much cheaper then I can find locally.</li>
            <li> The product is just as expected</li>
            <li> Very Nice as usual.  I am a repeat buyer!</li>
            <li> Great product at a cheaper unit price.</li>
            <li> Took a little loner than I thought it would to get to me however arrived in new packaging and works great!</li>
            <li> Good way to keep shaver clean with little effort.</li>
            <li> Items worked with exception that one of the cartridges arrived empty.</li>
            <li> cheap and works as good as a new one, great service.</li>
            <li> Great deal and quality. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Replacement cartridges, plain and simple</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and quickly provided</li>
            <li> just as I needed for my refill</li>
            <li> Always a great buy, and due to the price I always have lots of them in hand and am not afraid to throw one out when it gets dirty, which I believe helps and saves my expensive and excellent Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Works and smells just like gillette braun original cartridges.</li>
            <li> Great price. Very well packaged. Delivered on time. exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Good to have these packaged in multiples of 4 or more.  A very good product, and easy to use.  The price could be a little lower though.</li>
            <li> Easy open packaging. Much easier to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> Great addition to the purchase of the Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Great way to buy this product just comes when you need it so it is always there when you need it!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap and economical -- the labels are different from the original ones I had purchased, but they look authentic, and do the job just as well as those.</li>
            <li> Easy-to-use and keeps my series 7 Braun in tip top condition. Take good care of my series 7. Help save on your investment</li>
            <li> This is a cheap Chinese knockoff that is not the same Braun formula and does not have the mesh sreen baring dirt to be cycled back during cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... just wish it would cost less.  4-pack seems the best deal around.</li>
            <li> 4 refills.  Good price. Quick delivery with PRIME.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product and the cheapest on the internet.</li>
            <li> The product is a genuine Braun product.  The difference with this product is it comes in a plain cardboard packaging instead of retail packaging - and it costs less than the retail packaged product.  The &#x27;generic&#x27; cardboard packaging is actually a lot sturdier than the retail packaging.  Overall - an easy choice.</li>
            <li> I think the solution in renewable cartridge, manufactured by Braun (in Ireland) increases the life of the shaver, especially the life of shaving unit by cleaning it to the manufacturer‚Äôs requirements.  I owned the unit for about 3 years, or longer, and I haven‚Äôt changed the replaceable unit, even though I own a spare unit.  It is shaving fine and I didn‚Äôt have to change ‚Äì I think it‚Äôs the cleaning solution lengthened the life of the unit, which is not easy on the pocket either.&lt;br /&gt;When I am travelling, I have no alternative other than tap water, as the solution is flammable and not allowed in airlines.  Braun also recommends using tap water for washing, but I doubt it is good to do this daily.&lt;br /&gt;I have a standing order for Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills, Frustration-Free 4 Count with Amazon.com, and I like the service as it is flexible ‚Äì I can postpone or advance the date of delivery with the Frustration-Free deal.  It saves money too.&lt;br /&gt;Although the cleaning fluid cleanse the shaver well and seems to be increasing the lifespan of the cutter, the fluid has eaten into exterior paint/coating causing damage to outward appearance ‚Äì see the image.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of the 4 counts because it was the best deal. They seem to work just fine. The only thing I see that is not the same as the ones I get local is they are not in a braun box and the lable is not the same other wise they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> The Braun cartridge refills keep my shaver clean and lubricated, without me having to do a thing. Just shave and then put your shaver in the Braun cleaning device and let the cleaner do the rest. The cartridges do get a bit pricey though, so I would suggest shopping around for the best price.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  I likethe shaver and the solution makes cleaning easy.  Keeping the shaver clean was always a problem before.</li>
            <li> This fluid allows a braun self cleaning razor to stay both clean and lubricated so your shave is great until the blade goes dull.</li>
            <li> Standard, stock cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li> 4 count gave the best price break by far.  Now I&#x27;m looking for find a deal on the heads and trimmers.</li>
            <li> Each cartridge lasts me about 35 days or so. They keep my razor nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s the only game in town to clean the razor...</li>
            <li> Always perform as expected</li>
            <li> this is a good product albeit somewhat pricy but it works great. If you own a Braun shaver, use this and your shaver will perform longer and better</li>
            <li> Bulk packaging saves money. This is just as you buy in the retail stores without the retail packaging. I would recommend buying here.</li>
            <li> Great product does a great job at leaving and at such a bargain price</li>
            <li> No problem here. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> So, far, work as advertised. Considerable savings over store bought refills.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t last that long and I don&#x27;t shave often. I feel that they should last about a month and they do with me shaving once a week!  a lot lost to evaporation but that&#x27;s due to the design of the shaver not the the cartridges, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  Now my little tiny hairs go in the blue water instead of on the floor.  Everyone should have this product.</li>
            <li> I like that these keep my shaver very clean and ready to go for the next shave.  However, these are a bit pricey.  One refill lasts about a month for me.</li>
            <li> It was very convenient.</li>
            <li> Clean razor fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fare price in Braun packaging.</li>
            <li> Economical and work as well as more expensive local retailer products</li>
            <li> Cleans the shaver nicely and dries before the next day.  To save some money I reuse each one several times by rinsing them out and filling them with an aftermarket cleaner.</li>
            <li> Does the job at the lowest price point versus 3 or 12 or 16 packs.</li>
            <li> Nothing to say. Gets the job done</li>
            <li> As expected, great price, will probably order again.</li>
            <li> Each one lasts about a month or so - this is a pretty good deal.  The price is a lot lower than walgreens was charging (before they stopped carrying it).  It keeps the razor clean and smells like lemon.  This product eliminates all of the extra retail packaging too.</li>
            <li> I have had my Syncro Shaver System for about a year now and love it. Like all the rest these refills are a bit pricey. I stretch them by not cleaning eveyday and I refill ea cartridge 2x before replaceing. I have found that the green rubbing alcohol works great! It contains oils and a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because of cost and Braun&#x27;s locking out aftermarket suppliers (jeeze do they think they are HP!)</li>
            <li> I make the cleaner last longer by removing and re-capping it. I only clean when I charge the battery, about once every 1 - 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Only electric shaver that I have been able to stay with. Cleaning system is awesome !</li>
            <li> i like it when it all comes together</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well stocked for months to come with this fluid for this fine razor.</li>
            <li> Great value! Huge savings over store prices</li>
            <li> i does lasts about a month so this 3 pack goes a year easy..  you do all the math and this with a braun 790 razon is cheaper and better over the wrong run than any disposable razor...  hands down...  these are a great deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;better shave, great clean razor every time, awesome product line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 15+ years. It&#x27;s alcohol &amp; water &amp; a bit of blue dye. I&#x27;m just surprised that it&#x27;s still made given how frequently things change &amp; newer models are developed. These 4 containers will easily last me 6-10 months. A good value for the dollar,</li>
            <li> Great Value and Quick Delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased a pack of refills several years ago. Did so again just recently. These are just as good and arrived in good condition and in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> The new Braun 790 gives a better shave but removing the head to shake out clippings as easy as older designs so using the clean cycle is a must. There are a lot of reviews on extending the life of the cartridge.  I use the clean cycle about every 4-5 uses. In between I remove the cartridge and replace the cap.  This keeps the alcohol from evaporating. While others say this can last months, I found that after 2 months the solution is very dirty.  Could get longer use if I popped the head off after each shave to tap out clippings but I think the current design would fail early.  At two months the price is ok and best value with amazon prime</li>
            <li> This is exactly what was wanted. It does the job it is supposed to. It was easy enougb to order and arrived in a quick and efficient manor.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you find in the store for quite a bit less.  All braun owners know that you need to replace this close to once a month so to have regular shipments is critical and for the price. . you cannot beat this deal!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful to be able to purchase 4 packs versus the normal 2 pack.  Very handy to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I chose a five star rating because I get these cartridges at a great price, with four in a box.  I don&#x27;t have to pay for containers that have advertising on them like I do when I buy a box of three in the store.  With Amazon Prime I get free shipping so I do save money and they last me four months instead of three before having to re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved the prices on these items and they fit and worked great. i will diffently order them again when needed.</li>
            <li> Very efficient cleaning system. Has a bit of a lemon scent, but not overbearing. Easy to install and keeps razor clean.</li>
            <li> The product was the correct cleaning refill for the Braun 70s shaver and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans the electric shaver cassette extremely well!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pricey but what options do you really have? my razor always seems clean and it smells fresh, so boom.</li>
            <li> Item as stated and shipped promptly!</li>
            <li> Good price for replacement refills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a number of people complain that Braun is just trying to make a cash grab in selling these cleaning cartridges, but to be honest...I have always found theses to be anything but that. For the money you pay up front for a nice Braun razor, having it clean &amp; nice smelling seems more than worth the price, for a coupe of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The cartridge refills last longer (for me) than you might think.&lt;br /&gt;2) A regular razer, not cleaned like this (or just with water) just doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as nice...&lt;br /&gt;3) ...not only that, all other razors I have used in the past (or when I don&#x27;t clean it for a while) just don&#x27;t feel as nice on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not everyone may find them to be worth the expense the way I have, the only thing I can say is to consider giving them a try -- I have literally been using them for years with my razor, and will be very happily doing so for years to come. :)</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted..thank you!</li>
            <li> Product as described; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> great value and appreciate the additional savings from subscribe and save</li>
            <li> I love my razor and the cleaner, keeps my blades clean of hair and keeps my shaves nice and smooth,</li>
            <li> I need these cartridges for my electric razor dock, and amazon had the lowest prices I found (online or in stores) for these particular items, so I, naturally, purchased them, here. The prices at amazon were only cheaper than other online retailers by a miniscule amount, but that&#x27;s good enough for me. Buying four at a time is good for me, as I figure that is a year&#x27;s supply at the rate I use them up.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item many times and have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and work well</li>
            <li> Been using these for years. Some people say you can make your own refills, but this works so well and is worth every penny. It totally cleans my Braun like new.</li>
            <li> It works great. Without the fancy packaging, the cost benefit goes to you</li>
            <li> Works fine, just as advertised. A little expensive but works</li>
            <li> I use my Braun razor in the shower and it&#x27;s nice to know that with this product, my razor is getting a thorough cleaning afterwards.</li>
            <li> Still to expensive !!!!</li>
            <li> Love, love this system. Yes it costs money to refill, but it cleans it a lot better than a water rinse....feels brand new!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far. It seems to be cleaning fine though. The smell of the lube is an oil smell that isn&#x27;t bad, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cologne. You don&#x27;t smell it from the cleaning stand, but only when shaving the upper lip.</li>
            <li> Compared to the price of cutter / screen, this is not a bad deal. I did see how some guys make their own, but I don&#x27;t clean everyday and if you cover the top except to use it, it will last a LONG time. I knocked one star off for value but in the bulk pack its not a bad deal delivered.</li>
            <li> Great replacements for my braun shaver. Easy to use and setup. No mess and just throw away right after it has reached the low indicator. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> OEM replacement worked as expected.  Quality was as good as the original.  With these it pays to purchase in qty.</li>
            <li> These refills fit the Braun cleaning system and do an excellent job of cleaning my razor.  They install easily and can be put in the recycle bin when empty.</li>
            <li> Nice product,keeps the razor clean, sharp and ready to go.  I also like the fact that the cartridges last a while, you don&#x27;t have to constantly change them.</li>
            <li> Refills received in great condition at a great price.  Ordered this item before for my 2 electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roseann B.</li>
            <li> Every time I install a new one, it overflows &amp; almost 1/3 of the liquid gushes out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun shavers for decades and this method of cleaning is pretty good.  Amazon used to send more cartridges in each order, but I&#x27;ve been too busy to do a cost per unit.  Having a better price, not needing to go to Target and cut through the crazy packaging makes this a better alternative.</li>
            <li> The refills I received were official Braun products, and are doing the job as expected. The frustration free packaging probably wasn&#x27;t necessary... The cartridges typically come in cardboard box that&#x27;s fairly easy to open.</li>
            <li> Great companion to the 7 series shaver.  Keeps my shaver clean and lubricated, plus it smells very nice.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted at about 1/2 the price of brick and mortar stores and as a plus I didn&#x27;t have to drive around looking to find them which has at times been a challenge.</li>
            <li> Great way to keep my razor in top condition. Highly recommended if you want your shaver to last if full potential.</li>
            <li> Not so sure about the frustration free part as the solution doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as advertised.  But overall it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The original cartridges contain a scented blue alcohol-based solution. What I received was clear plain denaturated alcohol. Japanese characters on the labels. I suspect these were counterfeited items and asked Amazon to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;In any case, Amazon customer service is spectacular. I chatted with them a minute, explained to them the problem, they did not make any sort of issues and processed a new shipment at no cost to me. That&#x27;s what a call customer service.</li>
            <li> Was surprised these 4 cartridges were NOT delivered in the original factory packaging.  Now concerned they may not be NEW.  Could see how they could be used and just refilled.  I hope not considering the description provided and the amount paid.</li>
            <li> Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge refills were a good buy and arrived as described.</li>
            <li> If you have a Braun Clean &amp; Renew style of razor, you&#x27;ve save money buying this product. he is factory original, not some cheap refurbished knock off.  Subscribe through Amazon Prime so you can get refills delivered every six months.  It&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
            <li> All functions work fine, my fault thinking the digits would be easier to see since I am a bit&lt;br /&gt;visually impaired. All in all a good watch for the money.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time with the shaver&#x27;s supplied cleaner, and they work great keeping my shaver clean and ready to use.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to clean Braun Series 7-790 Pulsonic Shaver System.  but I just use it and I can not give more comment.</li>
            <li> Easy to change cartridges when needed</li>
            <li> used before many times</li>
            <li> The whole \\&quot;Clean &amp; Renew\\&quot; process is the biggest scam I have ever fallen for.  These cartridges would last two or three cleanings or in some cases not even be recognized at all before the the red light on the base unit came on.  Threw the whole thing in the recycle bin and bought a Norelco</li>
            <li> Keeping the heads clean and sanitized was one of the reasons to buy a Braun razor.  This cleaning solution will, over time,  eat the silver finish off of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Getting these refills automatically with the subscription service just makes it so easy and there is a discount too.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are needed to adequately clean your Braun Syncro unit.  With daily use, they only last about 30 days per cartridge before the level gets too low and the charging/cleaner unit will require you to change it.  At my local Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond, these run around $12.99 for 2, so you will save about $5 by buying it on Amazon.  Best price I&#x27;ve been able to find anywhere.</li>
            <li> Not use, do not know how effective</li>
            <li> This is the best deal to buy 4. It&#x27;s less expensive than some of the 3 packs.</li>
            <li> They work and clean as you&#x27;d expect. They were less expensive as well, and last just as long as the originals. I haven&#x27;t had issues with mine drying up as some of the other reviewers had. Maybe its the way certain Braun models are made? Mine actually lasted for many months. Infact, I bought this box in November 2013, and now in October 2014, I still have 2 more refill replacements to go. I actually do leave mine inside the machine and never take them out after use to replace the cap on,</li>
            <li> I agree with other posts that these do not have the lemon oil as advertised.  The problem with that?  Well, first off the lemon oil helps lubricate the blades so that they are comfortable on your face &amp; help them last longer.  Second, without the oil, it is pretty much just alcohol &amp; it evaporates in a week or two.  So what little money you save you lose on replacing the cartridge more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe these are factory seconds that they are boxing up &amp; selling at a cheaper price to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and work well cleaning the razor</li>
            <li> Its a lot cheaper than buying locally and the subscription saves even more! I would recommend the subscription as a cost saver for any product</li>
            <li> Good product, it keeps my electric shaver clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> These work well to clean a Braun shaver. I like the fresh smell. It makes the shaver seem brand new. However there is no way to use these without spilling a little liquid. Also over time there is a buildup of something on the outside of the shaver foil.</li>
            <li> It gives you what it says</li>
            <li> Original cartridges for your Braun shaver at an unbeatable price! Not really anything else to it but that</li>
            <li> Good product, shipped fast, in frustration-free packaging. A little expensive, but cheaper this way than in the 2-pack. Overall, I took away a star for the fact that it&#x27;s an overpriced product, but it starts on Braun&#x27;s end.</li>
            <li> They do what they need to do. They work</li>
            <li> These are usally so expensive, but I have been using them for my razor for 2 years and haven&#x27;t had to replace the blades on it.  Keeping the blades away from water really helps.</li>
            <li> These are totally worthwhile to keep from having infections from ingrown hairs.  It keeps the razor clean and sanitized after every use.</li>
            <li> Gives me the clean shave I want.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of the Braun electric tooth brushes, on my fourth model. I like the automatic cleaning feature that these cartridges are utilized for; the shavers are cleaned very well.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my razor as good as any other braun cleaner</li>
            <li> What I always use for my buy for my Braun cleaning system.  Works great and convenient.</li>
            <li> Best price on this consumable product.</li>
            <li> Expensive and they don&#x27;t clean many times. I use once every other week. Smell is OK.</li>
            <li> Packaging looks the same as what you can get at the store for retail prices but some how the actual contents &amp;#34;the blue liquid&amp;#34; inside the plastic cartridge does not last or clean as good as what you can get at a store. Not sure why.. Maybe this item had been on shelf for a while.. This is why I rated this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are great and really inexpensive!  I read other reviews here and found that removing the cartridge after cleaning does in fact make them last longer, so I find that I am buying replacement refills less frequently.</li>
            <li> I was considering refilling my cartridge, but at this price it saves me the time and hassle of experimentation.</li>
            <li> Replacement refills for my Braun cleaning system. They are genuine factory items.</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave and cleans up well. This is the first electric shaver I have ever used that has given me a shave almost as close as a straight shave, without irritation. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> No issues with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy, compared to buying in the store.  I have not used this since I ran out after I first got the razor.  I think it has helped mine become more efficient and cleaner.  This is definitely the best pricing I could find on the net.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to make sure your shaver cutter last longer.  the price is much better that what I could find in our town.</li>
            <li> Just like store bought only easier.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy when you consider what you would pay for 2 at a Big Box store! I saved over 35%</li>
            <li> Cheapest per cartridge option. Lasts 6+ months for me because I alternate with a DE safety razor but clean the Braun after every use.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than anywhere.</li>
            <li> Product is authentic and at a price lower than local stores.  Nice way to save a little bit of money (and a trip to a store).</li>
            <li> Standard product, good price.</li>
            <li> I needed the cartridges for my Braun unit but did not like the high prices at the store Amazon came through with the best prices...</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor clean and running nice.  These guys are easily worth the money to not have to clean the razor on my own every day.  Plus they do a better job than I do... ;o)</li>
            <li> Frustration free is correct. Charge and clean simultaneously option is sufficient. Cleaning once a week is a snap and keeps everything running smooth.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Ships very fast.  No problems.</li>
            <li> These are integral to the Braun system. There easy to use. Pop their tops and put them in the cleaner and your good to go.</li>
            <li> I tried a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; substitute and came back to these. Getting what works great is worth paying a bit more for.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money you spend for this product when you have the choice to renew it every couple of months.</li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t much better than bed bath &amp; beyond</li>
            <li> Have ordered multiple times.  Always arrived as promised.  Great to have the backup from the multipak format.  Only downside is the amount of material for the product casing.  Searching for a reliable refillable device.</li>
            <li> These seem identical to, and work every bit as well as, the ones in the 2 and 3 packs with retail packaging.</li>
            <li> Son has had the shaver for this cartridge  for quite a number of years.  These cartridge refills work fine in it and are easy to take out and replace.  I do wish there was a better disposal method of the used ones instead of throwing the whole cartridge containing the dirty cleaning fluid into the trash.</li>
            <li> After spending a large amount of money on the Braun 7-760 system and it stopped working after a few months. Since the system is not working the extra cartridges are useless. Braun is a bad product. Avoid this system, it does not maintain it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
            <li> use them all thse time, must have bought about 40 the last few years</li>
            <li> Have used these for years, buying two at a time at local store.  A 4 count is not only less expensive per unit, it makes remembering to buy them less annoying.</li>
            <li> If you have a Braun electric shaver you should be cleaning the shaver on a regular basis using this product.  If you have Amazon Prime, this 4-pack of refill cartridges is the least expensive way to purchase this product, which simultaneously cleans and lubricates your razor.  The product comes tightly packed in a sturdy cardboard box.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! For the fast shipping!!! MY Son - in - law was very happy with his gift! ;-)</li>
            <li> I hate the idea of having to buy cleaning solution for my razor, but it really does help clean the blades.  The 4-count seemed to have the best price per unit, so I went with that.  It&#x27;s cleaning solution.  It works to keep my razor clean.  The frustration free box they came in is great.  It&#x27;s the perfect size box to store them in and is able to reclose itself.  I only clean my razor once a week, so I keep the cartridge sealed when not in use.  I found this helped get more life out of the cartridge since you don&#x27;t lose as much alcohol to evaporation.  I once left it in the sun and it was gone in a few days.</li>
            <li> These are the same ones I have to pay about $12 for at Wal-Mart.  If you use these a lot like I do, it&#x27;s the best value.</li>
            <li> Works great and a lot cheaper than in the store!</li>
            <li> Expensive but keeps razor clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> The product I wanted, delivered promptly</li>
            <li> Nice to have a spare in stock, rather than trying to find a store with one on hand.  Keeps the shaver running clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Direct replacement. Love the scent!</li>
            <li> I keep an Braun in my glovebox for really busy days - and love it. The battery has a great charge life and the shave is close, smooth and quick. I&#x27;ve tried using my own blend of &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; but these cartridges really do a superb job of keeping the shaver fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> quick ship and great price.</li>
            <li> Been buying these for 3 years for my Braun shaver.  Always happy with them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the standard refills. Good price, convenient.</li>
            <li> These keep my razor clean and oiled.  I do cheat, and refill them a couple times with cheap isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) from the drugstore before replacing them.</li>
            <li> I you have a Braun razor, this is necessary to get a tip-top shave.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t like having to buy stuff for my shaver on a regular basis, I knew about it when I bought the Braun. I do love my Braun shaver and this cleaner definitely keeps it clean, lubricated and smelling fresh. A package of four lasts me about six months, so that&#x27;s not a bad cost.</li>
            <li> The only way to but these refills. Very economical.</li>
            <li> They work great for my husband&#x27;s shaver.  So nice to be able to have them home delivered!</li>
            <li> They do as well  as the regular Braun ones</li>
            <li> Have used these many times before. Item as described. Rapid delivery</li>
            <li> It really cleans good!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect to keep my shaver clean</li>
            <li> These cartridges did exactly what they promised to do. My husband&#x27;s electric razor performed and looked as though it was brand new. I would definitely buy them again, especially knowing that I would pay about five times as much for the same cartridges found in Walgreen&#x27;s and other, similar retailers.</li>
            <li> The best price on this I could find and delivered free!</li>
            <li> Very easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> These are OEM refills that are exactly the same as the ones sold for twice the price.  If you are happy with the Braun cleaning system this is a way to save on replacement cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li> They do what they&#x27;re suppose to...</li>
            <li> Great for your Braun Clean and Renew Shaver.  A must have if you have this shaver. Great that it comes in a four pack</li>
            <li> I got my shaver less then a year ago and was lazy to buy a the liquid after the initial one ran out. Found this deal and now I remember why I like this shaver. This is the real deal and very affordable</li>
            <li> I tried using my own alcohol solution to refill these because I was too cheap to pay the price for them at the store.  The only thing my method didn&#x27;t cover was the &amp;#34;lubricating&amp;#34; agent that apparently is in the actual Braun refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a placebo, but after going back to the branded refills, my razor does seem to cut much better after being washed.  Placebo or not, with Amazon pricing and subscribe and save, it&#x27;s worth paying for.</li>
            <li> If you have any inkling you might not like the shaver .... because they won&#x27;t let you return it&lt;br /&gt;Funny that it is save enough to mail to us but not save to mail back to them !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Bad PR for Braun Products !!!</li>
            <li> I love these cartridges, I never have to clean my razor, these do it for me all by themselves.  Great!</li>
            <li> Got these refills for my shaver. They may be a bit pricey due to some peoples outlook on it, however I see them as well priced and buy them in a 4 pack which easily lasts a years time. I do suggest taking the pack out and capping it then only charging every few uses rather than every use. This will make it last longer and fight evaporation.</li>
            <li> I use the Braun shaver and use this daily! This was by far the best value anywhere on these refills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great service!</li>
            <li> Excellent as expected!</li>
            <li> just as specified and expected. delivery was &amp;#34;amazon prime efficient&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great price! So much better than Walmart even</li>
            <li> Great Pricing, came exactly as explained in plain packaging rather than shelf packaging. These are new cartridges not something that has been tampered with. Thank you!</li>
            <li> same but without the lemony perfume scent that you get with the retail units&lt;br /&gt;now i know they added the scent to hide the alcohol smell</li>
            <li> Product was as explained, will buy again</li>
            <li> These will last for awhile.</li>
            <li> works well with the shaver, got about 30-34 cleanings with one cartridge and smells good to.</li>
            <li> A really good deal of you subscribe, which gives you the added benefit of not having to go hunting for them when you realize you have none left.  The price is even better than Sam&#x27;s Club</li>
            <li> These guys are expensive in the retail stores.  Buying them in bulk in frustration free packaging from Amazon just makes economical sense!  PS...After each cleaning of my electric razor I remove this cartridge from the charging base and put the cap back on it.  This makes it last a heck of a lot longer and doesn&#x27;t dry up.  I can make it almost a whole year with that method utilizing these four.</li>
            <li> Best price anywhere!!!</li>
            <li> Walmart has a pack of 2 for a few cents shy of $12, then add the tax and you&#x27;re up to $13. So you save about $6 by getting them from Amazon.  After shaving, I run the hot water with my Braun on and get the shavings out the best I can. I dry the shaver on a towel, making sure it&#x27;s as dry as possible in the time I have and I insert the shaver into the receiver.  I change out the cartridge every 30 days. I replace my head every 12 months.  This has been a good system. So, I use one cartridge a month and they come in a pack of 4. I&#x27;ve been buying them from Amazon for 4 years.</li>
            <li> Great deal to stock up.</li>
            <li> This product works great in my Braun Clean &amp; renew machine.</li>
            <li> These work well and are easily installed.  Not sure how to dispose of the old ones, though.</li>
            <li> Best price around. Arrived fast!</li>
            <li> Great product. Best price we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Have used these for ten years, including with my old and new Braun Shavers.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. The empties can be rinsed clean and refilled from a bulk container of your favorite razor cleaning solution (don&#x27;t throw away cartridge lid; you&#x27;ll  want it if you refill the cartridges or to prevent evaporation of the solution if your cleaning station will not be in use for a time). These alcohol based cleaning solutions are superior to any water based solutions and you will feel like you are shaving with a new razor every morning.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to keep my razor so fresh and so clean clean.</li>
            <li> Keeps shaver smelling clean</li>
            <li> I bought these for the last time.  The price is getting out of sight.  The easiest thing to do is, when the solution in the cartridge becomes dirty, shake it out and replace it with rubbing alcohol - at a cost of ten cents.</li>
            <li> Keeps shaver head clean sterile and long lasting. Used these for years.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver and I like the idea of it cleaning it&#x27;s self</li>
            <li> good deal and fast service</li>
            <li> Works just like they are supposed too.</li>
            <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
            <li> Just as I needed for my Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> You get just what you are buying. Product works great. Also great price.</li>
            <li> I subscribe to this item and get a great price. It does a fine job of cleaning the razor after each use and seems to make the blade last a little longer and is definitely a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged. Work well, last about six weeks.</li>
            <li> Necessary evil to keep my Braun shaver running clean ~&lt;br /&gt;These work as designed to aid in performance and longevity of the screen &amp; blade but they are a bit expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little hint on making these last longer is when the light turns yellow I add a little 70% isopropyl alcohol to just below the level they were at when new. I also add a drop or two of lemon essential oil. This will extend the life of these substantially.&lt;br /&gt;For best results don&#x27;t wait until they are in the red light condition.</li>
            <li> Great purchase very satisfied</li>
            <li> These are great.  If they are not origional Braun, I can&#x27;t tell the difference.  I suggest you take the tank out of you cleaner between cleanings to prolong the life of the cleaning fluid.  The liquid evaporates.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new Braun shaver with cleaning system.  The cleaning system was a factor in my purchase decision and I am pleased with its performance so far.  It is early days.  What I am enjoying is being able to have the system clean the shaver and provide me with a fresh smelling unit whenever I use the cleaner.  I was previously a Norelco shaver user and struggled to manually clean the shaver.  Over time, the shaver took on an odor that was difficult to deal with.  I am very pleased with the Braun shaving system.</li>
            <li> I once used a different electric razor and it didn&#x27;t cut well and cleaned poorly. I really like this system. It&#x27;s easy to use and gets to all the right spots.&lt;br /&gt;With respect.&lt;br /&gt;Rick</li>
            <li> Great  just what I expected</li>
            <li> Just what you expect.  Always arrive in good shape.</li>
            <li> You need these to keep your Braun shaver running at its best. I run mine through when it is either needing a normal or intensive cleaning. One last around three months</li>
            <li> I bought this packet so I do not have to worry to buy them in order to be able to clean my razor. luckily my razor tells me when to change them.</li>
            <li> Purchasing these Cleaning Cartridge Refills is a good thing to do every if you only run the clean every so often!  It really does work by cleaning and sanitizing your razor. It also keeps the Braun Series 5 running better longer.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have been using it for many years and I love the product. The product gives a great shave. I have used similar products. I did not like them because they were too sharp and have cut my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price on these cartridges is much better than I have found anywhere else.  The cartridges work perfectly in conjunction with the Clean and Renew system to keep my shaver clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased the Braun shaver system about 2 months ago. This is about the 6th Braun shaver I&#x27;ve owned in the last 25 years, and they&#x27;ve always been great shavers. But this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a \\&quot;system\\&quot; that self-cleans the razor. And after using it the first time, I can say it is WORTH IT! The cleaning solution leaves a nice clean \\&quot;Lemoney\\&quot; scent on the razor, and it&#x27;s a nice way to start a morning after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d give as a suggestion is:  Don&#x27;t go more than about 2 weeks to a month before changing out the cleaning solution! Or, just use it maybe every other day. I was using it on a daily basis; one day I go to take out the razor and use it, and that nice, clean, lemoney smell had be replaced by a reeeeeaally nasty one! My fault, I&#x27;d gone for almost 1 1/2 months before changing the solution....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great cleaning system!</li>
            <li> Product received as ordered. much cheaper then picking up locally. I like this item but hate writing reviews. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the clean fresh scent.  I got my shaved about 6 years ago and still works as good as day one.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of capturing the dirt and keeping the razor clean. I recommend to use it as required.</li>
            <li> Every few years, I break down and buy some of these.  I have 2 homes and 2 Braun units that use them.  In between, the denatured alcohol in them evaporates (in Colorado, EVERYTHING evaporates quickly), so I simply fill them back up.  When the stuff gets dirty, I empty it, rinse the cartridge and then refill it.</li>
            <li> 4 cleaner set! It is cheaper than other store.&lt;br /&gt;If u use Braun shaver, u will need the cleaner every month...</li>
            <li> It gets the razor clean and you cannot beat the price.  You can pay$ 15.00 for 1 &amp; I received 4 for a little over $20.oo</li>
            <li> Good packing and my shaver is back with fragrance..</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning and lubricating my razor which aorks as well as the day I first used it.</li>
            <li> The refills are very convenient.  I especially appreciate it since I am the one that changes the refills.&lt;br /&gt;  Mrs. S</li>
            <li> By purchasing this quantity, I don&#x27;t have to place frequent reorders and the cartridges keep the shaver clean.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> Only started using one of them, but they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> I hope and trust that Amazon will continue its fine work well into the future.</li>
            <li> packaged very well.  good product.</li>
            <li> great price and we never run out.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say other than this really does make a difference in the shaving experience.  I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; the razor for about a week and found it wasn&#x27;t doing the job nor was it very comfortable.  Cleaning it was like having a new shaver!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a knockoff brand, but Braun is listed right on the cartridge. Also, very economically packed.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of cleaning my Braun shaver. The 4 pack refill is a great value. It&#x27;s like shaving with a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Never a problem ordering Braun products !</li>
            <li> Keeps your razor in top form.  Saving time is reduced and your face doesn&#x27;t take a beating.</li>
            <li> Retail, I have paid as much as $16 for one refill cartridge for my Braun razor. Saw these offered and decided to give a try. I see no difference in quality or condition of my razor and blades after cleaning. For $17 I received 4 cartridges! Almost 4 for the price of 1! They were boxed securely and were in great shape when received. This was a no-brainer and I recommend wholeheartedly!</li>
            <li> I like how simple it is to clean this razor, but these refills are expensive. I don&#x27;t see a need to clean it everyday, but even if you don&#x27;t use it, the cleaning solution evaporates quickly, so I take the cartridge out between cleanings and replace the cap. By cleaning once every week or so, the cleaning cartridge lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> Great price, quick service and very easy to complete.  One less thing to have to worry about and deal with in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful system. I never have to clean the razor. It is nice to just put it in its charger and it is clean and fresh the next time you use it.</li>
            <li> It is a shaver cleaner cartridge, it does what it does for a proprietary shaver that is not inexpensive in itself.&lt;br /&gt;Does it do what it is supposed to. Yes.</li>
            <li> Love the Braun system, and the subscription for cleaning solution so I don&#x27;t have to remember to go out and buy it.</li>
            <li> Best deal I found for non generic product. Real Braun stuff here.</li>
            <li> Great price and great service on the OEM refills for my Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Though the whole concept of buying disposable refills for your shaver is a little ridiculous, these get the job done.  There&#x27;s definitely some merit to the whole concept though - after all you&#x27;re dragging metal across your face and causing abrasions, exactly the kind of situation where you&#x27;d very much want the surfaces involved to be sterilized, or at the very least cleaned with alcohol.  Four stars because $20 for a bit of alcohol and cleaning solution mixed together is a bit farcical.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected and on time, fits Series 7 cleaning station</li>
            <li> Three of the four cartridges were fine.  One was completely empty.  Kind of made the purchase a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Work great and what a savings!!!!!</li>
            <li> As described, good value</li>
            <li> Have not had a chance to use.  But I purchased with my new Braun Series 7 and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of cleaning solution for at least four months.  Will purchase fro this seller again.</li>
            <li> works great just like when new</li>
            <li> works like it supposed to</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Original product</li>
            <li> these were the same items I was using.</li>
            <li> Used these a long time. They get the razor clean everytime.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price, &#x27;nuff said :)</li>
            <li> works well--good price compared to local stores</li>
            <li> These are the same clean and renew cartridges as the one that came with my Braun shaver.  I have not been able to find these at a lower price.</li>
            <li> buying these refills in quantity saves both money per unit and shipping costs&lt;br /&gt;only problem is storing the extra units</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but the price is too high. I clean and charge my shaver once a week. To keep my shaver clean in between shaving I manually clean it with the supplied brush. I keep the lid to close the cartridge after every use from evaporation. Call me frugal.</li>
            <li> Just got them yesterday, don&#x27;t know what they are but all I know my husband wanted all this set for his Braun shaver. The price was great, since we can&#x27;t find that in our local walmart. I guess when he runs out he&#x27;ll be wanting more. Thank you. You made his day.</li>
            <li> tried to save money cleaning the shaver with alcohol and water. Shaving was terrible. Eventually had to buy new shave cartridge and decided skimping on the clean &amp; renew cartridges a mistake.</li>
            <li> What is there really to say?  It is not inexpensive, but it works.  There are no major alternatives, but it works.  I clean my razor after each and every use, and I enjoy having a really clean and smooth-running razor.  Yea, it costs money, but that (for me, at least) is a decadent indulgence without serious side effects.  I will not discuss other indulgences in this review.  :-)</li>
            <li> Superb additional product which enhances the shaver! An extending the sale item which saves time from future purchase! Highly recomended for any purchasing the Braun Pulsonic</li>
            <li> I run the cleaning cycle every couple of days and it really makes a difference in the smoothness of my shave, the lemon fragrance stay with me as well!!</li>
            <li> Love these things. Use it after each time I shave. When I pull the razor out of the cleaning station it always smells nine and clean and the foil block looks brand new. These are a must if you use the Braun razors.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Easy to use. Easy to assemble into the base. I have used it several times within the past year.</li>
            <li> They keep the razor clean, but are not without flaws. For one thing they are too expensive, and don&#x27;t last long enough. For another, they are alchohol, and will remove the finish from any wood furniture they happen to spill on. For another, while the system is advertised as cleaning and lubricating the shaver head, I don&#x27;t see any evidence of lubricating. The contents are listed as alchohol, and the heads seem to wear faster than the old method of manually cleaning and oiling the head. The trade-off is convenience; and the shaver itself is a good one. I am currently using my third one.</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM AND THE BEST PRICE! IT DOES A GREAT JOB OF CLEANING THE SHAVER AND IT LASTS LONG ENOUGH FOR ME FOR THE COST! i WILL USE THIS UNTIL THE SHAVE R STOPS WORKING!</li>
            <li> These are necessary for the Braun cleaning system. This was the best price I have seen for a 4 pack.</li>
            <li> Enougth fit for the extraordinary Braun Series 7 990 CC&lt;br /&gt;No more comments about this. No more comments about this</li>
            <li> Love the razor. does a great job I have not seen any clean &amp; renew from anyone else out there so I have to use what I can get. they do a great job.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say?  These are the Braun refills.  The price is good by purchasing a box of 4 rather than one at a time.</li>
            <li> works as described. good product. works well. great for Braun Series 7 - 790 cc, Pulsonic Shaver System. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleaner &amp; no longer have to BRUSH out the wiskers. Last BIG BOX PURCHASE of these, was from Ireland.</li>
            <li> Works great, good value, will order again&lt;br /&gt;Works great, good value, will order again&lt;br /&gt;Works great, good value, will order again</li>
            <li> I hav ebeen a Braun user for years and I have always used this product/cartridge for the cleaning station for my shaver. bulk and the discount, was a plus.</li>
            <li> shipped quick and priced right.  This is the way to go when purchasing these refiles as they can be pricey.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about the product, its what the clean and renew system requires. The price for the 4 pack is about what the stores are charching for the 2 pack.</li>
            <li> I have found that the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cart Shaver Refills Frustration Free 4 Pack helps my new Braun razor give me the best shave I have ever experienced. A smooth shave and no facial irritation. Thanks</li>
            <li> These inserts last for about 3 to 4 months each.  I bought them when I bought the razor.  After you push the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; button on the base unit, these inserts flush the razor with an alcohol based solution inside these cartridges.  Very neat and efficient, and best of all, your razor is sanitized and smells pleasantly like lemon!</li>
            <li> I love this cleaning system, it works well and seems to be reliable. Subscribing on the refills makes the price even better.</li>
            <li> A real value compared to big box and specialty stores.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and it came. pretty much says it all. I love me some Amazon! If you have a Braun Activator and need this product, I&#x27;d say, \\&quot;buy this\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Product worked satisfactorily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE:  If the red light on the Clean &amp; Renew unit comes on too soon, clean the unit as recommended at the Braun website \\&quot;Troubleshooting.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this 5 stars because it works great. I&#x27;m like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I&#x27;ve added water and rubbing alochol, but it just doesn&#x27;t feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don&#x27;t pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean, smooth and fresh shave, get this and change timely.</li>
            <li> they are the same as the two pack in stores for 12...if u can save money do it...they are exactly the same...</li>
            <li> Good product, cleans my electric shaver and makes it small good.</li>
            <li> 4 pack refills. the product works. not much else to say</li>
            <li> Super easy to install!</li>
            <li> perfect refills for Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> ***Head ups***  This product is nothing like the original manufacturers.  I bought these through subscribe and save for several months until I ran out unexpectedly and bought one from a local store.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  The one from here smelled ok on it&#x27;s own.  Side by side it smells like a harsh chemical that I&#x27;m not sure why I ever put it near my face.  It evaporates faster, doesn&#x27;t clean as well and definitely NOT the same quality or product that you get be getting from the local store.  Took a few pictures to show a comparison and I will post them when I find them again, but the labels and markings are different, as well.</li>
            <li> product as described, Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great prices and works like store bought.</li>
            <li> It seems like a scam that the razor requires these proprietary solutions. I clean the razor weekly and each cartridge lasts a couple of months.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted for a fair price.</li>
            <li> Great price.. delivered when I need them!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and it is great! During those years I used &amp;#34;home made&amp;#34; cleaners and they did not work well. The $$$$ I spent for this shaver it deserves the best care. The best care for me is the &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34; cleaner!</li>
            <li> Braun makes reliable products.</li>
            <li> Same product you can buy at the store.  Assuming you can find the refill at a store anymore.</li>
            <li> Good buy great product..</li>
            <li> Good product and works well!</li>
            <li> I really like the Braun Cleaning system, but the fluid evaporates on it&#x27;s own too quickly. I&#x27;ve found that the only way to stop this is to do what other have mentioned on here..... to actually pull the cartridge out of the charger/cleaner and put the cap back on the fluid until the next time you use it. Makes the fluid last way, way, longer. That&#x27;s why I give it 4 stars. 5 stars for the purchase. No problems.</li>
            <li> Best price for product.</li>
            <li> great&lt;br /&gt;16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 more words required</li>
            <li> I bought enough of these to last me a year&lt;br /&gt;I hated running out and having to run to CVS and HOPING they had some&lt;br /&gt;Usually they didnt</li>
            <li> Great for keeping your razor clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to review.  It is a box of four refills.  They weren&#x27;t leaking so I guess that&#x27;s about all there is to say.</li>
            <li> Item as expected and a fair price</li>
            <li> Not cleaning my machine at all !&lt;br /&gt;i tried to save money and ending up wasting money. I will just buy original from retail stores instead.</li>
            <li> The product is great.  No mess....no fuss. It slips into the cleaner and bibbidy, bobbidy, boo....you are cleaning your shaver.</li>
            <li> Good cleaning solution. They are quite expensive, but what are you going to do when there is no other alternative? The only problem that I have is that my shaver doesn&#x27;t completely dry following a cleaning cycle. I don&#x27;t know if this has anything to do with my Braun shaver model, but it&#x27;s a little gross when you&#x27;re shaving and cleaning solution residue is smeared across your face...</li>
            <li> Perfect to stock up on for my razor.  They give you a good supply and it works in the models listed.  Small enough to store and almost half the price if you bought them in the store.</li>
            <li> I like a clean shaver, but this is an expensive and environmentally irresponsible way to accomplish the task.  The cartridges should be refillable, with minimal additional plastic.</li>
            <li> Good delivery, as described</li>
            <li> I love my shaver but the cleaner is a problem with replacements.  This refill order solves that problem and improves my shaving experience</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s designed to do but they are really expensive.  Word of advice for others, when you&#x27;re done cleaning your shaver, remove the cleaning solution and reseal it with the cap; this will stop the alcohol from evaporating and will significantly lengthen the time each cartridge lasts.</li>
            <li> While I am not sure if using this product makes your shave better, it does make your razor smell good.</li>
            <li> Works great and fair price.  Cleans razor head and ready for next use. Wish it would last longer than it does but for the price it beats buying at retail store.</li>
            <li> Good bargain. I&#x27;ll order them again.</li>
            <li> I recommend using these cartridges with the cleaning solution to clean your Braun shaver. They keep the blades and head of the shaver to glide across your face. I find the best deals on Amazon and especially if you are a prime member with free delivery.</li>
            <li> Works as promised on my Braun shaving kit.  Does a great job of cleaning and it is easy to insert into the kit and also, to remove the old, empty cartridge.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as expected and words great.  I believe that these were originally made for European sales, but none-the-less, work as exact replacements for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> wonderful product. Works well. Leaves the cleaning to someone else. Self clean. I highly recommend this product. It actually works</li>
            <li> Nice way to buy refills and the price was nice too</li>
            <li> Best value and cheaper than Walmart if you have Prime.</li>
            <li> I guess I never experienced frustration using this product before, so I can&#x27;t speak to how &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; it became but generally think the refill (fluid) cartridge design leaves consumers paying too much too often. Granted, paying for disposable razor blades is more costly but I rated 4 instead of 5 stars because of price. If these were cheaper I believe more people would use and replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can smell the alcohol in this product when you remove the seal, but refilling old cartridges does not work well. Aside from my face and neck breaking out (can&#x27;t clean the inside enough) or poorly lubricating the shaver head(s), it just never worked like it should until I again used this OEM solution.</li>
            <li> Decent product, a little expensive, the alcohol liquid does evaporate so one has to replace these on a regular basis. But a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and clean your Braun razor regularly, you know how quickly you run out of cleaning solution. These packs are no frustration and easy to pop a new one in. Great price buying in bulk too. Give them a try.</li>
            <li> Been using this system for years and it works great.  This was a nice find, much cheaper to buy them this way.</li>
            <li> Just what you&#x27;re looking for if you need to refill your Braun cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Here is my recommendation on how to maximize the cleaning fluid for each cartridge:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Clean your electric razor every 2 uses.  This way you aren&#x27;t running the head of the razor under water (this causes rusting, and makes the razor more inefficient and dull, unless you are willing to use lubricant to combat this problem).&lt;br /&gt;2) After cleaning the razor with this product, put the plastic cap back on the product (this prevents evaporation of the alcohol fluid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not just leave the open product in the cleaning system for much of it will evaporate and go to waste.  I purchased a 4 pack several months back (over 7 months ago), and I still have a cartridge left.  The product is great at cleaning your razor and disinfecting it, while able to preserve the original quality of shaving.</li>
            <li> Perfect and great price - like the box to store the unused containers.</li>
            <li> Make shaving very confortable, keeps razor clean and the cutter assembly stays sharper and last longer.</li>
            <li> They work great exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li> No problem as long as we clean the razor every day.  Needs replacing every month or 6 weeks max.  A little expensive maintenance, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good price.</li>
            <li> I go through these refills monthly.  I decided to stock up so I don&#x27;t have to run to my local big box store in the early morning hours.  The product keeps my Braun shaver clean and this offer allows my cleanings to not be as expensive.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> These do what they need to do.  The razor station that I have tends to shoot extra alcohol from this the first time it is used.</li>
            <li> It still seems like someone could invent a shaver that cuts a beard close without having to scrape it off.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shave as often what I do is after it is done cleaning I take the cartridge out of the station and put the caps back on. The fluid then does not evaporate! Money savings!</li>
            <li> Best value when bought as a 4 pack&lt;br /&gt;Is the exact solution sold by Braun, so it works exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Easier than making own solution, and roughly the same price when bought in the 4 pack</li>
            <li> they are expensive but it is what it is. If you want to save money take it out after each clean and put the lid back on so it dont evaporate.</li>
            <li> What a great shaving system.  All I have to do is plop the shaver into the receptacle and voila--magically clean!</li>
            <li> Helpful to purchase a four pack of the Braun Clean &amp; Renw Cart Shaver refills, as I don&#x27;t have to worry about refills for awhile.</li>
            <li> nothing much to say - it does fit the Braun base and cleans as advertised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a four because I am not going to say &amp;#34;I Love it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it cheaper for me to  buy this way i can get 4 instead of 2 and and save gas too</li>
            <li> The refills fit my shaver clean system and work great!  The value is also a great deal since these sell for quite a bit more at other stores.</li>
            <li> Needed this but ok finally bought it.&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive though.&lt;br /&gt;Must have when you have trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoying it when i got a bulk in 4</li>
            <li> The alcohol based cleaning system works really well. I suggest buying the 4 and even 6 or 8 packs for the best value.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use cleaning solution. It contains alcohol and you don&#x27;t have to worry about its installation, discard or amount used each time. There are indicators on the Braun cleaner itself telling you when it&#x27;s low. Change once a month.</li>
            <li> Purchasing these through Amazon is Much Cheaper than finding these locally. The only down side is that I have to plan to purchase these online going forward.</li>
            <li> 200.00 for a top of the line, made in Germany shaver then people whine about a solution that lubricates and sterilizes in one automatic shot....  For about 5.00 a pop.  Now compare that with expensive regular razor blades and shaving cream....  FFS stop whining and just use the shaver and accessories like its intended. 5.00 every month or two and a shaver head replacement between 18 and 24 months. (A whopping 30.00). Jeez.</li>
            <li> Sure, one could mix up some mineral oil, alcohol, and water and it&#x27;d probably work, but this is convenient and it works so well with the Braun cleaner that I&#x27;m sold on it. I use the periodic shipment from Amazon to save money and make sure I always have some on hand. If you like a clean razor, this is a good product to use.</li>
            <li> What is there to not like.  Good price and clean lubricated razer.  It would not let me just tell my opinion without adding more words</li>
            <li> It is good as you think. It makes my shaver clean and good scent. The price of this pack is reasonable compare with offline shops.</li>
            <li> This is a refill for my shaver. Everything was as expected. Decent price and shipped quickly, it was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Same great product at the best price I have found. I usually have to spend eleven or twelve dollars for a two-pak..</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and the price was terrific!</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do.  These are a component of a shaving system, any complaints I would have would come from the unit itself and not this little guy.  If you have a shaver that these will fit, then these are what you need.  Buying in bulk saves time and money...that doesn&#x27;t require a five star rating to know...</li>
            <li> Works, but I&#x27;m old fashioned, so self cleaning still works good.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Came quickly and works perfectly. It helps keep my shaver clean and working efficiently. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I do not like receiving 4 refills every three months as I only use one a month and this will cause me to build an excess supply..</li>
            <li> Came on time and it was what i needed.  It is a basic product.  Why force me to write a long review?</li>
            <li> Arrived just when I needed it most. Makes using my Braun even more enjoyable and easier than ever. Great item!</li>
            <li> cheap and exactly what i want. i will buy again once i will run out in very very long time</li>
            <li> I used to HATE cleaning my electric razors.  I have a heavy, fast-growing beard, and sensitive skin which leaves me few good options besides Braun.  I tried the Panasonic wet razors, but they weren&#x27;t up to my beard and were pretty much a pain to clean, too, especially if you used the creams they hawk with them.  But now, with Braun&#x27;s clean and renew refills, you just pop the razor back into the stand, wait for the light to signal whether you should do a light or intense cleaning, press the button recommended, and walk away.  I find that I clean my razor more regularly, that the blades and foils last longer, and because of this, that I get a close, more comfortable shave, even when I&#x27;m tackling a long weekend&#x27;s growth following a bout of sloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I recognize this is, clearly, Braun&#x27;s take on Gillette&#x27;s business model of recurring revenue, addicting you to the convenience of their cleaning solution for a low monthly price.  But hey!  Look at the price for 4 of these units at under $5/ month and which always last me closer to 6 months than 4 coming to less than $3/ month, and understand your blades and foils lasting longer will pay for these even if you don&#x27;t value your time that highly to avoid daily light cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how many of us TRULY disinfected our razors in alcohol *ever* or deep-cleaned and lubricated them to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations before this anyway?  I know *I* didn&#x27;t before. But now I do with simply the touch of a button!  Now do yourself a favor and order these guys and let Amazon save you some money and headache by selling you a subscription so you don&#x27;t ever run out.  You, your face, and especially your Braun razor *deserve* this!</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT! CANT BEAT THE PRICE AND CONVENIENCE OF A SUBSCRIPTION. SMELLS GREAT TOO. WILL DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE SHIPMENTS.</li>
            <li> This item was packaged great! This was a great product! Thanks for the care that you put into this package!</li>
            <li> Work very well but expensive for what they do. Alcohol based and evaporate somewhat quickly. Can be refilled with caution.</li>
            <li> These refills go for 3 to 4 times the amount in stores. I bought 4 because at the price here, I got almost 2 1/2 refills free. I saw them in a drug store for $12 or$13 each. I would buy the 4 pack because it is the best deal. For some reason 4 cost $20.14 and 8 cost $69.95!</li>
            <li> It has done its job over and over again. Never a problem. I have used this cleaner for at least 7 years.</li>
            <li> its good packaging and  also very fast ship&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use the one witch come with the braun 790cc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> Use them once a week or so and each time pull them out of the machine and put the cap back on and  they will last a long, long, time and save you money that way!</li>
            <li> These refills are a good value and keep my shaver clean and lubricated. They are relatively easy to install and discard. Just save the cap when you open it a new one to use on the old one that it is replacing.</li>
            <li> The products adequately clean my Braun shaver.  I would recommend this to anybody.  They do not need to be used everyday.  A person can clean their shaver 2 - 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Great value. Tastes nothing like Windex, though this does specifically warn against ingesting.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the refills yet, but the one in use right now is great.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised !</li>
            <li> Works beautifully to help clean my shaver.</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor and blade clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I felt that the price was right for my Braun refill cleaning solution</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works as expected.  I understand the frustration of paying for a Braun razor (not the cheapest around) and then paying extra money for the replacement foil/cutters annually AND these fluid cartridges, but it seems to me that these cartridges do a good job of cleaning/lubricating the cutting head/foil and that helps to provide a longer use for the product and provide a nicer shave.</li>
            <li> Use every day and love it!</li>
            <li> They work very well for my razor</li>
            <li> Something didn&#x27;t seem quite right about these cartridges.  They appeared to be some type of export product as the labels were not the same as what you would find when purchased from a store.  There was no problem with fit and the function seemed fine, but it seemed a bit off.</li>
            <li> great product keeps shaver in tip top shjape</li>
            <li> great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Well....I will Not mention the Dept Store here where I &amp;#34;Almost&amp;#34; purchased this Item, but thank goodness I did Not follow thru on the Purchase !  In a Nutshell....for &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; in a Store it was going to run me $5-$6 Bucks.....here on Amazon I got a 4 Pack and I saved just about $5 Bucks ! Yeah it&#x27;s 4...but sooner or later I was going to need this Item, so why Not save $5 Bucks.Better in my Pocket than theirs what I always say !  So....If you are in need of this Cartridge.....shell out the extra $Bucks$ now and put the $5 in your Pocket !  Totally Reco this buy....!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these often as they tend to go out quickly. I saw that I could buy in bulk, which was a better deal. Seems like a good quality product and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> I have used these cartridges for years, and they have always lasted over 4 weeks of daily use.  Although the product was standard and worked fine, all four must have been seconds, because each cartridge only lasted 2.5-3 weeks.  Beware.</li>
            <li> Works great on my Braun razor and Amazon has the best price, hands down, imho! These don&#x27;t have the lemon scent but I don&#x27;t need that.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say; the product does what it is supposed to: cleanly, effeciently, but at a somewhatslow pace.</li>
            <li> what can I say this is the cheapest way to get these if you use the Braun clean and renew shaver.  Cheap and no shipping and fast shipping.  Been buying them for two years now with no issues.</li>
            <li> These cartridge are exactly what is required for the shaver. They fit and work just like they are suposed to. I do sometime spill a little when I change them but that is the only problem.</li>
            <li> I use the C&amp;R cartridge in my 790c razor.  Easilly the best razor there is, then add in the C&amp;R and it only gets better.</li>
            <li> Product is as described.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price that arrived promptly. Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> The four pack seems the right balance between cost and quantity discount.</li>
            <li> nice having a clean razor for every use</li>
            <li> It gets the job done! My husbands razor has never been cleaner. He was refilling the resevoir with water and i went to clean the bathroom and wipe down his razor and it and the resevoir was absolutely disgusting! Don&#x27;t refill it with water unless you plan on cleaning it out every few days. So i purchased these refills and now the razor stays nice and clean, if you own this razor system you should use it as it was intended.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this system with his Braun shaver</li>
            <li> My hypothesis: Clean razor when the amber light is on and you will go through these pretty fast but the cutter and foil should last longer.</li>
            <li> I bought these to keep a supply on hand. They are identical to what I used to buy locally. Work the same, etc. just more convenient to have on hand and not have to wait for local store to restock.</li>
            <li> Nice and as advertized</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered.  they are what I wanted</li>
            <li> good turn around on the order</li>
            <li> This is a great product with out the fancy package. Buy with confidence. This is a commercial box.</li>
            <li> These make my 5+ year old razor like new. Using the clean and renew cartages make a noticeable different in the longevity of the cutting head, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am not aware of an alternative product to do the job of cleaning my razor.</li>
            <li> Indispensable for keeping your Braun razor performing at its peak.</li>
            <li> Cartridge refills arrived within two days after placing my order!  Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Great deal...very satisfied.</li>
            <li> They are good but we have trouble with the Braun System.  This is the second or third one I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> Product great and as advertised</li>
            <li> Makes my old razor work like it is new again.  Hard to find  Renew cartridge and cleaner sets in a store.  Actually I have not seen them in  commercial store.</li>
            <li> Just the right number of refills if you need to buy them online.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second order. Delivered on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Good product, shipped on time and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> While coming with Japanese(?) characters on the sticky labels, they appeared to be genuine Braun products and have worked flawlessly with my 7-series shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Consistently high quality, and shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the cleaners. He just has to put his Braun razor in the holder and walk away, the next day the razor is clean and ready to use.  I like them too, they eliminate those nasty stubs in the sink.</li>
            <li> Price was right, shipment was fast and well packaged.  Everything was packaged in the air cushion package material to keep safe.</li>
            <li> Good price for a quality product.</li>
            <li> This product works as described and helps keep the foil and cutter clean so you get longer use before need to replace them.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money, along with great cleaning and continuous conditioning for the shaver head.</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaver working well.</li>
            <li> Pricey but they work perfectly with the shaver I have.  No complaints as they are easy to swap out and last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this product was made in China......I have ordered others from Amazon and Ebay and they were made in Europe, I am not sure of the quality of the ones made in China.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and an excellent price. Gotta love Braun :)</li>
            <li> I got my pkg before the schedule date and it works perfectly thank you Amazon for existing!</li>
            <li> Lasts just under three months if you&#x27;re judicious and reseal the item after each use. If not, the alcohol will evaporate very quickly</li>
            <li> the cleaning solution works good. For the price and not having to look for it at the store is releaving. Everytime I went to purchase more of the cleaning product at the stores they never had it or they were sold out. Last time I purchased this was at CVS it was $10.00 for two. I found this to be the answer to my problem of having to slook for more and to save a lot in the long run. No wasted time or gas in the truck just click and its at your door in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Good cleaning and frustration free package.</li>
            <li> Genuine Braun refill.  Packaging is super easy to open.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Great price. Works as advertised, and has the official Braun logo and everything on it so you know its legit.</li>
            <li> Replacement cartridges....yea they&#x27;re the same ones that you would buy in the store. Only thing you need to be wary of is they&#x27;re alcohol based so they will evaporate over time.</li>
            <li> The product is packed inside a brown box, as pictured. The box states the product was made in Ireland. Four cartridges arrived without any damage and they worked perfectly with my Braun 7 series mechanical shaver unit. My shaver comes out clean and smells fresh with every use. I clean my shaver after every use--I mostly run an ecco or normal cleaning--and one cartridge lasts me about 1 month when I use it 4 times a week. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love buying these in bulk as I seen to go through them quickly and am always forgetting to buy news ones when the old ones are spent.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly in the shaver; they work well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Packaging is nice and easy to open.  Convienient that it comes in a 4-pack.</li>
            <li> I like it ,just dont last as long as it should</li>
            <li> The products work fine. It great getting the smooth shave that I&#x27;ve come to expect from this shaving system. I will buy from this seller and expect total satisfaction as I have this time.</li>
            <li> The product is the original Braun and it is is good.  Received within the date promised and in a very good condition.  I bought it for my  Braun 3 series and works well with it.  The four stars is only for the price of the Braun product.</li>
            <li> A great product.  I have used for years.  Always cleans my Braun Razor in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps it clean, Fresh and working great!</li>
            <li> The Braun refills provide a cleaning solution that makes sure your Braun shaver is thoroughly clean EACH time it is used.  It simply inserts into the Braun battery recharging station which, in addition, makes sure the Braun cutting edges are always sharpened.  Your 90th shave is as good as the the very first shave.  The Germans have done it again!</li>
            <li> My husband uses the shaver that needs this refill.  I subscribed to the refill program and it works great because he usually forgets he needs the refills until they are all gone!</li>
            <li> I have always shopped for the best price on Clean &amp; Renew for my Braun Razor. The price and convenience make this a no brainer. Add subscription service to make things even easier.</li>
            <li> Third time ordering this bundle, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> If you have to lean your shaver you need this stuff and I have not found it any cheaper any where I&#x27;ve looked.</li>
            <li> Run Down:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive: the package was delivered on the day it was promised, even with all the black Friday frustration. Package came in a frustration free box which was easy to open and sealed with no way of accidentally opening. The product is good, fresh, and new. My Braun Shaver did not have a problem recognizing it is a refill and worked instantly. The refills should generally last for a few months. Some people have claimed 4 refills have lasted a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: No Major problems. This is a real Braun product. Labeling has geunine Braun label, but some sort of Japanese writing too. No manual or description booklet. This usually supports it being genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short: I liked the packaging, Braun was able to give me 4 refills that matched my machine shaver well and started to clean it fast. Will buy from them again and happy. So far used only 1 refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 4 package braun clean and renew refills. I was waiting for my package and realized that it may take longer because I ordered it a few days before thanksgiving. I was not feeling any disappointment with amazon, I was able to recieve the package on their promised date.When I first received the package, I was impressed how easily it could be opened. Of course amazon had taped the opening so that the package would not open randomly. I&#x27;m glad they did. When I opened my package, it was set up as I expected. The only thing that I was a little surprised was the labeling. I believe I received an genuine product. The label had some part written in I believe Japanese.  The label still clearly stated in english Braun clean and refills so it didn&#x27;t matter too much with me. Right as soon as I used it, my machine did not have any problems detecting this product and started cleaning my shaver. At the moment, I don&#x27;t really think there&#x27;s too many problems that I can notice. If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this product, I&#x27;m sure that you&#x27;ll enjoy it. If you&#x27;re really picky about if it&#x27;s genuine, I believe you shouldn&#x27;t worry about it. Although I did pick the frustration free packaging, I was looking for some sort of manual or description and did not find any. One way to figure out if it&#x27;s genuine is if the package has some sort of instructions or display.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun cartridges for years with no complaints. The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is. Less cardboard waste than the old packaging, and a better price per cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the cartridges last longer, re-use the plastic tab that covers the openings to keep the cartridge sealed when not in use. I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so, and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it&#x27;s kept capped to prevent evaporation.</li>
            <li> This is smart buy to keep your Braun shaver like new.  The 4-pack gives you ample cleaning cartridges to last several months.</li>
            <li> Having switched from a long time Braun user to a Norelco Sensotouch 3D I still have my 790cc Braun. When P&amp;G bought out Braun they discontinued the foil and cutter block with a generic that pales in comparison to Braun Optifoil. I switched to the Norelco and the cleaning system system is a marvel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I still prefer my old Braun and was lucky enough to have bought extra foils prior to them being phased out. The Braun clean and renew system is still in my opinion the best there is. The solution strips the blades and foil of all gunk, oils and whiskers - it&#x27;s like a brand new razor every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal on a 4 pack of refills. Plus if you have a Prime membership you get Free two day shippin to boot. The frustration free packaging is a real plus and cuts down on waste - I choose it whenever it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> It is what it is...the cleaner comes in a cardboard box w/o any plastic packaging.  It&#x27;s simple, cheap, and cleans the razor well.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought the cartridge refill. It&#x27;s so easy to use and indeed frustration free. The solution helps prolonged the blade and the package make it so easy to replace and leave no mess. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Keeps the razor clean. Very easy to use the product.  Braun provides a very excellent shave. I use after every shave.</li>
            <li> Braun cleaning cartridges work great and as well as the ones that came with my shaver. They are much cheaper than the ones at local stores.</li>
            <li> did exactly what it was suppose to.</li>
            <li> Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills&lt;br /&gt;I buy this use for Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System.&lt;br /&gt;clean and easy to use</li>
            <li> What is there to say about these? They fit right in my Braun cleaning base and last me about two months under daily use.</li>
            <li> Though one can do it yourself with some Rubbing Alcohol, and scent/lubricant packs, the price is fair enough.  I took a look at the 4 pack and it&#x27;s less costly than the break down of either the 12 pack or 6 pack shown on Amazon, so I bought 3 packs of the 4 refills, and saved a fair amount.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, they fit my Brawn Series 7 self-cleaning charge base perfectly, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> The shipping was amazingly fast and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;Not much to say about product; same stuff you can buy pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li> Something doesn&#x27;t fit right it liks when working.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal.</li>
            <li> Keeps my 3 year old razor working like a brand new one. It also smells very fresh with a touch of lemon. Helps to make your daily shave experience better.</li>
            <li> Great price for a needed product.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of cleaning &amp; oiling my old razor, so I got the Braun Series 5 Clean &amp; Renew system.  I just pop a cartridge into the base, put my razor in, push a button and my razor gets cleaned,lubricated &amp; charged for 17 cents a day, you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I use my Braun shaver cleaner about once a week and I always have a hard time paying for these refills at the store because they are so expensive. I found these online at a better price (for purchasing 4 at a time) so I think I will keep getting them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> As good as anywhere else! This stuff works.</li>
            <li> What can be said about a shaver refill? No moving parts, simple construction, easy to install. Have been buying them for years and they are just the same as all those years ago, except they got more expensive.</li>
            <li> If you like to keep your Braun clean, this is essential. The price for the 4-pack is exceptional and the packaging is much easier to use and recycle.</li>
            <li> These cleaning cartridges work great! They are easy to insert into the Braun shaver base. Then, when you clean your Braun shaver periodically, the solution in the cartridge leaves your shaver feeling and smelling pleasantly clean with just a hint of alcohol and lemon. This way you know it is clean, but not overpowering due to the alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has also packaged these in an easy-to-open box so that 1) it accommodates one extra cleaning cartridge and 2) so that the box is super easy to open. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it comes in bundles, can&#x27;t find them in stores. It&#x27;s economical. Will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> They have a nice scent and and make the head clean and smelling fresh. I clean the head after every shave to keep shaver operating like new.Kudos to Braun for comming up with this Idea.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a great price compared to my local warehouse club.  I found I use 1 cartridge a month so the extra discount with the auto shipping is the way to go.  I used Remington for years but the clean and renew shaver has been the best.</li>
            <li> Good price but Chinese written on product making me wonder if these aren&#x27;t cheap knockoffs from China.  They seem to be the correct size but not sure that the fluid is what it should be?</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep my braun shaver clean as you would expect. Works fine and you pretty much have to use it if you want to keep your shaver lubricated. This is a good price.</li>
            <li> Easy to order keeps my shaver clean and sharp. Price is better than going to the store. Came in two days.</li>
            <li> My husband claim this solution and the shaver together is a good combination for a great shaving experience..He would not have it any other way..</li>
            <li> Not much you can say about shaver refills - they&#x27;re standard Braun Clean &amp; Renew cartridges, but this is a very inexpensive way to buy them, plus they come in a simple box and you don&#x27;t have to fight through any packaging.  Overall a good deal.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun for many years. It works great. Just need to replace the foil ever couple years or so.</li>
            <li> I love purchasing these little packets to keep my Braun Contour shaver clean and maintenance-free. I replace the refill packet every two months or so.</li>
            <li> Great product at good price. Comes 4 cartridges to a box. I&#x27;m sure its cheaper than what you would pay in a store so I&#x27;m a happy customer with this purchase.</li>

            <li> no issues here!  Great price and I always have at hand when needed.   As a buyer I often rely on the reviews of other buyers when making my purchases. So I always try to give my honest, unbiased opinion.  If this review was helpful to you please press YES in the link below.</li>
            <li> have not had to use yet but is just like the one that came with the new shaver braun series 7-790cc which works great so far</li>
            <li> Great price.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love that they sell these in bulk</li>
            <li> Great product! Thanks</li>
            <li> Good price and original Braun.</li>
            <li> These cartridges last a long time and do an excellent job of keeping the razor clean. Yes, there are some alternatives out there. However this is one case where the original supplies are better than the rest. This order will last a long time. A great deal overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip of the Day: Want to make the cartridge last longer? Use the mini-cleaning brush every day to keep the head and blades clean after use. Use the cleaning system once a week to do a deep cleaning while charging the battery. Keep the product sealed when not in use to prevent evaporation.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> these work perfect for my Braun shaver and I like the packaging. Have bought them a few times now.</li>
            <li> Prompt service, as advertised</li>
            <li> Good product. Great price</li>
            <li> Work as advertised. I guess you have to buy these if you have the Braun razor. I love the Braun razor by the way, great for people with sensitive skin like me, worth every penny. Love the easy out packaging. I have mine on Amazon Subscription, so I never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also re: only cleaning once a week as some have suggested. It doesn&#x27;t work for me, I find I get a much better shave when I clean more regularly. These things are cheap enough, its worth it to me to clean it every time. I also don&#x27;t like to mess with putting the cap on and off all the time.</li>
            <li> Best value, comes in a convenient box and this is the original replacement. Works great</li>
            <li> Gives it that fresh smell already. I&#x27;m glad I replaced my old one.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> exact fit and where alot less expensive then buying the indevidualy</li>
            <li> Seems to be the real stuff at a good price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great.</li>
            <li> llego en perfecto estado y rapido, quisiera saber si puedo resibir ofertas del vendedor directamente para comprar mas rapido, en estos dias seguire conprando sus productos.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a 4 pack. As advertised packaging was hassel free. If you are ordering this you already know exactly what you are getting in tems of the product. Is genuine Braun rather than a knockoff brand.</li>
            <li> When the geniuses designed this product they didn&#x27;t think of people who travel. I can&#x27;t be lugging the shaver &amp; cleaner and this liquid around the world. Great if you stay in one place but if you travel buy a spray so you can clean &amp; lubricate the shaver. If you don&#x27;t and just use water to clean it, the shaver cassette blades deteriorate very fast.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Braun shaver and these refill cleaner cartridges are great.  He&#x27;s really pleased with the way they clean and keep his shaver clean.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT,easy to use,does the job,my shaver &amp; I love it !( less pricey and very convenient to have it sent to your front doormat)</li>
            <li> This was a great deal as these are unnecessarily expensive in stores. OEM. Keeps my Braun clean and well oiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t run my razor through its cleaning cycle after every use, I go about 3 uses, then rinse with water before the cleaning cycle. This saves even more on cost without sacrificing the life.</li>
            <li> You need this refill Cartridge to keep your Braun shaver going and keep it clean for you. I will recommend anyone to try.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I would say if you are looking at this review buy it now</li>
            <li> If you still have a Braun Electric Shaving Cleaner then these cartridges are the same. They are competitively priced and often cheaper then the stores I go to. Plus they ship them right to your home. Who wouldn&#x27;t like that? Good luck !</li>
            <li> I ordered these before, and they work great, and I will also continue to order these whenever I need them. These seem to have more solution in them than the ones I used to get. So I think they&#x27;re a really good deal.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I got with my Braun when I bought it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Hubby says it is the best cleaning solution he has had yet.</li>
            <li> This is defiantly is the way to go for refill cleaning cartridges. Why pay retail?</li>
            <li> These are just as they claim to be.</li>
            <li> Works like it is supposed  too.</li>
            <li> This is a really good value!  I pay more for a 2 pack locally.</li>
            <li> Do a great job of cleaning my Braun razor.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The price was right and was easier then going to the store to buy two at a time. Cleaner works as it should. What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> love using these for my Braun shaver ever since i got it! clean smelling and a good way to start your morning!</li>
            <li> A convenient way to lubricate, clean, and refresh my Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard and shave about 15 times a month. I clean the shaver after every shave, and I seem to get about two months out of this product before the lights on the cleaner tell me it&#x27;s time for a new one. The cleaning system seems to work as advertised. I subtract one star because it could be cheaper and more environmentally friendly. I&#x27;d prefer to just buy a single gallon bottle and refill the cartridge. I don&#x27;t quite like handing over five bucks for a fancy plastic cup filled with alcohol water, but I guess that&#x27;s the price of convenience.</li>
            <li> cheaper if you order the multipacks.</li>
            <li> These cartridge refills are easy to load, and their use results in an extremely clean razor. After cleaning the razor seems to give much better shaves.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price this reminds me I better shave haha</li>
            <li> I have the Braun shaving system and regularly need these cleaning cartridges.  Finding them can be tricky at times, but ordering through amazon is easy and price is competitive.</li>
            <li> This product does what it suppose to, but unfortunately it is very expensive given it&#x27;s make up.  I probably would not buy a razor which requires this cleaning method in the future</li>
            <li> Used these for years along with the cleaner/charger base they fit; sure beats trying to hand clean a razor. RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> The 4 pack is a great deal.  It is too bad my series charger always tells me my damn cleaner is empty when the thing is still full.  Braun kinda pisses me off with that one.</li>
            <li> Except for the packaging, these look and perform just like the ones you would buy in the store -- only cheaper.  I suppose you can find cheaper ways to clean your Braun razor, but these are ultra convenient. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Need to use these to keep the razor clean. The stuff evaporates even if you don&#x27;t clean that often so you might well.  Order in bulk and it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
            <li> Good Product by pricey.  It would be great if these were just refillable.  I hate having to buy all this plastic...</li>
            <li> Although expensive this cleaner does a great job. It does not extend the blade life of the razor as far as the owners manual says you can push it, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual says change blades once every 18 months, I change it about once a year. I have had no issues of cutting my face or getting any kind of infections, just that the blade doesn&#x27;t hold up. Not the cleaner&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> The time I saved searching for cartridge refills is worth every penny. All the information I need is there. I will re-order when I need more with no problems. Great product.</li>
            <li> This review is tougher than the system. The cost is not an issue when looking at the benefit health and safety is considered.</li>
            <li> Rare in today&#x27;s marketplace, this product actually performs as advertised and has extended the life and performance of my Braun shaver.  I recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> I switched back to Braun recently, and found that these were much easier to replace than my old Panasonic.  The braun shaver is also a lot easier to use.  I had no problem at all with the packaging since it was frustration free and loading it into the base worked as expected.</li>
            <li> This solution works great at cleaning the razor, and we love the convenience of being able to buy them in bulk online so that we never run out and don&#x27;t have to go chasing them down at a store.</li>
            <li> The best product for our shaver cleaner, it cleans and helps your razor shave better and keeps it good as new.</li>
            <li> As you would expect from the OEM it works good with the cleaner. A little on the expensive side for refills</li>
            <li> Works as expected. This is a continual purchase. Glad I have prime so I don&#x27;t have to wait for delivery when I run out</li>
            <li> A very pleasant scent and it works quite well at cleaning my Braun razor. So far, the razor has lasted me five years of daily use. Quite impressive. The only thing I will mention is that this is composed primarily of alcohol and it does evaporate.  I don&#x27;t clean my razor everyday but probably should because I am not saving much when one considers the evaporation.</li>
            <li> The item is just like the store bought item the only difference is the packaging.  This one comes in a 4 pack inside a regular brown corrugated box.  I have been hesitant about buying the cleaning refill solution, made by someone other than Braun, as I&#x27;ve read they leave some of the solution on the blade and foil.  I decided to stick with a Braun product and find it for less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It was cheaper than Wall mart and it does its job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;It worth 5 star for sure.</li>
            <li> We are really glad I thought to look on Amazon for these. I bought my husband his razor for Christmas and we found we cannot get these in our small town. When I did find one I spend what I paid for 4 for just 1. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Too bad that the Braun Razor does such a miserable job of shaving..but this is a necessity without it the shave would be much word..cant imagine it being any worse than it actually is!!</li>
            <li> Great concept, though a little pricey. Necessary evil if you have a Braun razor using the clean and renew system.</li>
            <li> Refits for Braun shaver.  Quick delivery and they smell well.  Each container lasts me a month.  If you clean shaver each day you may be to extend it up to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I needed these refills for my Braun shaver.  Product works fine but I am disappointed in the shaver, which was very expensive.  Maybe I have the wrong facial hair.</li>
            <li> I like using these with the series 7 system and this is the best pricing you can find, hope it will be available longer.</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I wound up in the hospital with cellulitis of my face.  I had a temperature of 105 degrees and was delireous.  The cause was more than likely my electric razor.  Since rinsing my razor every day and faithfully using the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridges, I have not had a recurrence.</li>
            <li> Cleaning every other day may seem like a money-saving idea, but I have found that even if you don&#x27;t use it for weeks, the cleaning fluid still evaporates and you have to replace it almost as frequently, so I figure I might as well get the benefit of cleaning rather than let the stuff just evaporate away.</li>
            <li> The product appears to be as advertised.</li>
            <li> Smells goods and does the job cleaning your shaver.  But they are quite expensive.  What I do to prolong the use of each cartridge is remove it from the unit after cleaning and put the cap lock back on it.  This seals it from the air which slowly evaporates the fluid.</li>
            <li> I have used the Braun razor and its refill cartridges for several years.  They are installed easily in the razor&#x27;s base and work each day to maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of the razor</li>
            <li> These fluid filled cartridges go with the Braun shaving system, which can automatically recharge and clean the razor after each shave. Just push a button to start. The Braun system requires a new cartridge with its hygienic, sterilizing fluid  after about 30 cleanings. I estimate that this automatic, recharging and cleaning system reduces the time devoted to the morning shaving ritual by 3 to 5 minutes. For me,these time savers are well worth the extra expense of purchasing the boxed, 4-cartridge refill set.  .</li>
            <li> The perfect way to clean a razor.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the purchase of the Braun Clean &amp; Renew refill cartridges and would definitely recommend them!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these cleaners.  I had some older razors that didn&#x27;t have the built in cleaning like the Braun does and there is a huge difference to their performance over even a short period of time.  The 4 pack I got was at a good price and I will definitely get more when they run out.  Currently the 1st of the pack has lasted a couple of months with a cleaning every week and the indicator only just changed from full to halfway on the solution.</li>
            <li> These cartridge refills are an exact replacement for my Braun shaver and they work perfectly.  I have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how much I got for such a cheap price! This will last forever... or a decent amount of time, but when it&#x27;s finished I will be back here to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received the refills in time bjt have not been using the razor as my replacement head that I ordered from you was the wrong item.  If I get this new head for the razor I my start using it again.</li>
            <li> This cleaning solution refill does the job just fine. The only issue I have is the odor is a little more &amp;#34;bleach-ish&amp;#34; for lack of a better term, than the solution that I bought from the store. I&#x27;m not sure why, and it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it is noticeable. Other than that, no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is.  I&#x27;ve found I can stretch each cartridge by refilling myself with recipes commonly found on the internet.  I usually refill each one twice before putting in a factory fresh one again.</li>
            <li> just one of those everyday things that Amazon makes so much easier to keep up with. Works great, comes on a regular basis so I remember to take good care of the razor</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning the razor and keeping the blades sharp.  Keeps the razor in tip top shape. Try it.</li>
            <li> Some time ago a reveiwer wrote make your own Braun cleaning solution. One 500 ml 70% Rubbing Alcohol, 42 drops Lemon Essential Oil (one half teaspon) from Amazon and 5 drops of Blue Food Coloring (Optional). Use original container. Thoroughly clean container with hot water. Drain through smaller hole since there is a strainer in the larger hole. Shake a few times. Fill the cartridge 3/4 of the way. Then repeat the process.You really don&#x27;t need any food coloring for the blue color. Very low cost compared to the Braun price. Keep the cap on when not in use to prevent evaporation of the alcohol. Works well as I have been using my home made solution for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;Charlie E</li>
            <li> I also was a gift to grandson out of state so I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Fake product. I compared with original braun clean and renewal, they weren&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> Second order of these.. Hubby loves how they keep the blades clean so he gets a close shave every time.  Plus it save you time from having to clean the blades your self.</li>
            <li> As advertised works great</li>
            <li> As described they fit and work well</li>
            <li> I saved a lot of money and time when I purchased this product. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is one great product and even better value.  These are not seconds but in the case cleaning cartridges. The real deal.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and went for a subscription.&lt;br /&gt;It can sometimes take a while to get these since there are shipping restrictions.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These refills save you money over the brick &amp; mortar stores, and the fact that it&#x27;s a 4-pack makes it real convenient too.</li>
            <li> Does a great job refreshening and cleaning your razor.  Extends the life of your razor. Worth the price  you don&#x27;t have to clean as often as Braun days to get good result.</li>
            <li> My husband is disabled and cannot use a regular razor. This works well and he can even use. He has Parkinson&#x27;s and this is ideal. My son bought his first one. Last yr our home burned and that was the first thing I replaced.</li>
            <li> This staff clean everything after using 2 months time for change wow If you see all this dirty stuf you see is time for change. Work perfect.</li>
            <li> Great price on a necessary accessories for the Braun shaving system.</li>
            <li> BETTER PRICE THAN MOST PLACES. WORKS FINE</li>
            <li> Each refill is lasting more than 2 months. Very handy</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  Work great for the Braun system.</li>
            <li> I am loving using this product and enjoying the great price!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet,original was excellent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as I expected-I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Husband loves them!!!</li>
            <li> It is my second order, love it.</li>
            <li> The running costs on this shaver are a little high but the cleaner seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm - leaving my shaver clean and smelling fresh. I believe this package of cleaner for the shaver  is the best deal you will find anywhere. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works as expected - Glad to be able to still buy them because no place locally carries this product.</li>
            <li> These refills are great. My son uses his shaver daily and these keep things nice and clean for long term performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times to clean my shaver.</li>
            <li> Does a simple job well and less expensively--what more could be asked?</li>
            <li> These shouldn&#x27;t be this expensive, but I get it and have basically accepted it. I&#x27;ve also come to the realization that there&#x27;s no advantage to buying these cartridges in bulk, especially considering Amazon&#x27;s free shipping. In fact, it&#x27;s often pricier to buy the higher count packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that I maintain two Braun shavers at two different locations. One is sort of a back up unit that only gets infrequent use. Given that the fluid in these refills evaporate over time, even for long periods when the shaver isn&#x27;t used, I couldn&#x27;t accept that I was losing a full cartridge to maybe 5 cleanings. So in that unit, I began using straight rubbing alcohol -- just enough of a splash to get through a cleaning cycle (or three). I&#x27;ve got to say that that works almost as well as these genuine Braun cartridges, minus the rubbing alcohol smell (supposedly solved by adding a few drops of essence of lemon -- not that I&#x27;ve tried it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that this solution leaves a residue. The chrome-colored head around my shaver head gets a greenish-yellow film built up on it, and on occasion the first couple of passes leave a similarly colored streak down my cheek (that easily washes off). The shaver still needs ag good wiping down and brushing out every so often.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, reasonable price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good, but i not understand your function</li>
            <li> I pleased that Braun hasn&#x27;t changed the style of their cleaner cartridges as I still had 1 left over from my old Series 3. Way to go. If it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it. LOL</li>
            <li> Not much to say, just a refill cartridge. Nice to have a supply on hand when you run out.</li>
            <li> Have been using Braun Clean &amp; renew cartridges refills for years.&lt;br /&gt;Does seem that the solution runs out quickly. Someone should check.</li>
            <li> Keeps my Braun shaver clean and fresh</li>
            <li> The necessary cartridge if you want to keep your Braun Shaver working well. Works as described. Cleans and sanitizes your Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and you cannot go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This particular cleaner is a must for keeping your Braun shaver working well. The first one slipped in to the cleaning system just as described and started working as advertised. Great to have products working well and as described.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these over the years form my Braun 7 series shaver. I will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product and the price I was able to purchase these.  I was able to get these much cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li> Using the cleaning function of the base station is an effective way to restore the efficacy of the shaver, but it comes at a price.  I shave every other day and use the cleaning function once a week.  These cartridges last me about 6 months.  I haven&#x27;t really experienced the evaporation issues others are reporting.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Excellent, prompt service.</li>
            <li> I like Braun cleaning system.  I got my shaver about 2 month ago.  Just finished my first cartridge and installed the new one.  Things cannot be simpler - open up the cleaning station, slide out the old one, open and slide in the new one.  I like the fact that the Braun system is alcohol based - makes the shaver smell nice when clean.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the shaver, so we get these refills. Work great.</li>
            <li> I use my razor everyday the cleared keeps my razor clean. This order was offered at a good price.</li>
            <li> As described. Great price.</li>
            <li> My hubby is happy with this - perfect replacement cartridges at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Well, I do.. just wish they lasted longer and cost less.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it&#x27;s a smart product, by all means.. Now go buy it!</li>
            <li> I needed them for the new Braun 7 series 799cc electric shaver, I think that they are very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> works great. pull it out after every use and only use it once a week and it will last several months. daily clean with a brush</li>
            <li> This was a gift that my son requested for Christmas. He was very pleased with it. Delivery was quick. The product was just as he wished.</li>
            <li> Affordable way to buy the cleaning cartridges for my Braun 7 Series shaver. I have used this product for two years now. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I only charge and use this cleaner once a week or maybe 2 times and each lasts me about 3 months. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun cleaning system since it came out, and it&#x27;s never failed.  Any time I&#x27;ve gone on a trip away from the cleaning base for even a few days, it&#x27;s an extreme joy to pop the unit in the cleaner and get a fresh shave.  I can&#x27;t imagine using an electric shaver without this cleaning feature (unless it&#x27;s wet/dry).  Now only if Braun could make their cutter blocks good again...</li>
            <li> Quality product and fast delivery!  Glad to see these sold in bulk and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Works great but a bit pricey. I will continue to purchase this product when needed because I can tell that my shaver works better after it is cleaned.</li>
            <li> Came as expected, packed well</li>
            <li> I have used a form of this for years. This product works fine to clean the razor after use. I don&#x27;t know if there are better cleaning systems, so  I stayed with this one when I needed a new razor.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original, and does not last as long. But the price is right, so I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works Great - Buying more!  Never realized how helpful and important such a cleaning tool could be.  The added expense is well worth it.  Thanks beloved wife for telling to buy this shaving system.</li>
            <li> I finally found this at a better price than I could have at the local wal mart. I do try to stretch it out with one or two doses of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Went from using a safety razor all of my 72 years to the Braun and it works even better.  Amazingly, the cleaning apparatus works!</li>
            <li> this cleans your shaver very nicely does the job well I recommend it great value for the price of 4 pack</li>
            <li> The Renew Shaver cleaners are easy to use,  smells  clean and fresh. The shaver continues to work like new with a comfortable shave without irritation of the skin.Th e cleaning process is  short.</li>
            <li> Straight from the factory in a plain container, exactly what I needed and at a great price.  What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I discovered my electric razor. I think these refills smell great. Hopefully someone will come out with a variety of &#x27;scents&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun shaver for a gazillion years now and I clean and charge it once a week.  I have always used the Braun brand cleaner refills.  I like the system but IMO these do get expensive as the years pile up.  Sort of like printers.  I am going to try to make my own brew in the near future to see if I get the same results.  If not, I will continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> What can you say about something like this? It is the proper part for the job. They fit well, and work as designed.</li>
            <li> What I expected from that cartridge was it made in ireland, whereas it was made in china, which is very diluted, and it is not original</li>
            <li> These are not the lemon scented ones I am used to getting for Braun.  These are some generic kind, but still cleans well.</li>
            <li> Does the same job as the individually packaged OEM cartridges at a much lower price.  Why not save money while accomplishing your daily tasks?</li>
            <li> Great purchase, quick shipping. Works excellent and enable great shaving every morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good , gets your shaver cleaned. Does the job right , specially if more than one is  using her same shaver</li>
            <li> The Braun refills slip right into the razor cleaning device just like they&#x27;re supposed to do. On cartridge usually lasts about a month to six weeks. They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do with no muss or fuss.</li>
            <li> These work great (as one would expect, since they are the Braun OEM cartridges).  Having a subscription is a nice way to save a little money on them.</li>
            <li> Great product for keeping the shaver clean! It&#x27;s easy to use and i do recommend using it. I&#x27;m glad its easy to buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Buy your refills from here. Same product. Less cost. I am pretty sure these are just filled with rubbing alcohol but I love my braun too much to experiment.</li>
            <li> Works well but pricey.  Each cartridge only last about 3 to 4 weeks before I have to change.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised, will buy from again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it does an excellent job of cleaning my cordless shaver. I would definitely recommend this product to keep your shaver clean.</li>
            <li> exactly what you need to clean the shaver.  Cheaper than buying it individually.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new electric shaver and soon found I could not find these cartridges anywhere except Amazon. I ordered a box and they worked perfectly. The cost is not cheap when you consider the cost of the razor and the trouble ordering these cartridges. I have found you can reload these cartridges with 70 persent rubbing alcohol and a few drops of a scent for a fraction of the cost of ordering these. I am upset with Braun for selling a product then making it costly and hard to find replacement cartridges. Look up ways to refill these things on utube, order a few and keep the plastic holder and refill them for almost nothing at home.</li>
            <li> how much can you say about razor cleaner fluid?  These do the job and leave the razor with a very pleasant citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I use this system for my braun razor every day. It&#x27;s convenient having them sent to me every 4 months instead of stacking up a year&#x27;s supply in a limited storage area.</li>
            <li> The cardridges seem to last a long time. Some reviews said they evaporate quickly, but i have not had any problems with it. The cartridges seem to keep the razor clean and have a slight lemon smell that i enjoy</li>
            <li> This is a simple way to keep a supply if these on hand; they arrived right here at my home.</li>
            <li> My husband is the one that likes this. I buy ahead and he never runs out! I bought 4 this last time and they were packaged great.</li>
            <li> This cost of 4 refills is little more than the price of a 2 pack at Wal-Mart. Well worth it. As others have said, the name of the game is conservation. I shave daily in the mornings and have quite a bit of stubble but only clean the razor with the fluid 1-2 times per week. Once it has gone through the cycle, I take the cartridge out and replace the cap and keep it in a drawer. These steps really prolong the life of the individual cartridge and cut down on cost.</li>
            <li> This item is an OEM product and is designed to swap out the fluids in your Clean &amp; Renew unit.  It arrives in a package, you pull the tabs off, use the tabs for the contained you&#x27;re replacing, and pop the bad boy in.  Nothing more. Nothing less.</li>
            <li> As the razor uses these cleaners on an on going basis, try to stock up on the refills so I always have at least one on hand.</li>
            <li> These are the same as the ones I bought with my razor and they are fine.  I have purchased them before and will purchase them again....thanks.</li>
            <li> Have been using these now for a few years and my electric shaver is always clean and smelling fresh. I wish they had an easier to way to swap it out without getting the chemical on my hand.</li>
            <li> A have to have accessory for the cleaning system - rather expensive by the single anywhere - reasonable here - as almost always in today&#x27;s market, the manufacturers get you on the disposables.</li>
            <li> Good price for the 4 count pack.  Cleans my shaver and leave it smelling lemony fresh.  I don&#x27;t use the cleaning function everyday, probably a couple times a week.  I will clean off the blade and foil first with an old toothbrush and then put it in the holder to go through a cleaning cycle.  This way the cartridge will last two to three months.</li>
            <li> The product is satisfactory &amp; arrived within the proposed time frame.</li>
            <li> It&amp;#34;s so good to have these so quickly.We get the 4pack.and it&#x27;s really a time and money saver.Sometimes I&#x27;m not told when the last one is put in the unit,so  ordering and getting them here so fast really helps.</li>
            <li> I always find these at a good price on Amazon. This box of 4 will last me about a year. Leaves my razor fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problems.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.  Anyone that uses the Braun system that cleans the razor should consider this product.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product! No more cleaning my razor by hand, and no more razor burn! I&#x27;m so glad my wife bought the Braun razor with the self cleaning station for me last year for Fathers Day. I&#x27;ve never had it so good :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have dense beard growth, but I still have to shave once a day, so the cartridges last me a long time. I&#x27;ve used two since Fathers Day, for what&#x27;s that&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Works as well as can be expected, but I wish there was another way.</li>
            <li> Cleans, renews and maintains your Braun like new! DON&#x27;T try knockoff refill solutions, they will cause problems and are nowhere near the quality of this genuine Braun cleaner.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than wally world and greens. Best purchase for my shaver and will not have to worry about finding it in a store.</li>
            <li> I can not importated to mexico any way I mtry to send it, so product can not be used for me</li>
            <li> I love the Braun 790 shaver and this cleaning cartridge makes life simple.  Just pull off the top and slide it in the docking station and it really works as advertised.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Braun shaving system.</li>
            <li> I bought my first group from Braun. This one was not even 1/3rd the price and they work just as well as the originals. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> good product. works very well.</li>
            <li> If you select the timely Monthly Subscribe &amp; Save.  You will save dollars off from what you would pay at the stores. This is a great product to clean your Braun shaver.  Yes, I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Arrived safely.  Seems to go from green to red a little quickly, but not yet a deal-breaker.  I like the subscription feature, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good for me and I can be on time everyday for work.I will never wash my shaver again</li>
            <li> I like these multi packs and I cannot find them in the store I usually go to.  This saves me that extra trip every month to get this item so I can keep my shaver clean.  The product works very well and leaves my shaver clean and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> The system as a whole works really well to extend the life of the screen and blade. The cleaning solution works better than water and lasts a surprisingly long time. The self-cleaning feature on the Braun razors isn&#x27;t a scam just to sell more products. It provides a significant benefit that I feel is worthwhile.</li>
            <li> This Item was Listed with a Braun shaver that does not utilize this product!  I purchased this for my husband for Christmas and now am stuck with them since they are not returnable due to the fact that they are hazardous materials.  I am very displeased!!!</li>
            <li> This replacement shaver cleaner pack works just like the original. It collects fits into the shaver cleaner assembly well. It is easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Great value. This is the same product I have been buying at Walmart for years at twice the price. Buy with confidence</li>
            <li> It was sent to me rapidly and was as represented.  There is a considerable saving by purchasing these in bulk.</li>
            <li> I have used these for my shaver ever since I bought the razor 5 years ago and they save me a lot of time in cleaning the razor!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as pictured on the box. Hard to say much about it. Its fine. Price is good</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this item comes in bulk, saves me some $$$&lt;br /&gt;Keeps hubby&#x27;s shaver clean, so I don&#x27;t have to clean it!</li>
            <li> A good product, you have a good discount when purchased this box of 4 units, arrived on time and well packed</li>
            <li> Actually not sure about the price I paid because I didn&#x27;t compare to anything else. I was buying new foil/cutter and just grabbed these too. Not much of a review, but what can you say. They work fine.</li>
            <li> My oldest son used my old Braun shaver since I upgraded.  He loves it and this cleaning system allows for all the blades to be cleaned and ready to go again and again.  Note my son only shaves once a week, he is only 15....</li>
            <li> Items were exactly as described, arrived quickly and were priced very competitively. And these eight words are to make 20.</li>
            <li> If you use Braun shaver 7 series. Then you must need it.&lt;br /&gt;Large pack saves a lot. After cleaning, the shaver smells nice. :-)</li>
            <li> Just like the 2 packs, but packed more &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;.  Will buy again until I try to refill them with denatured alcohol.</li>
            <li> I do not find that this shaver gives me a close shave. I have already switched to a Panosic shaver from Amazon that you clean by rinsing it with water. The shave is better but not great.</li>
            <li> my husband has been using this product since&lt;br /&gt;he got his braun shaver and it keeps it sounding&lt;br /&gt;and running smoothly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i had when i bought the product. Works great and cleans my razor just right. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the off brand product. They leave a residue on your shaver. Only trust the Braun labeled refills The off brand refilsalso have a strange odor..</li>
            <li> First of all I love my Braun shaver and its cleaning system.Also I love the cleaning fluid it uses.This cleaning fluid is great because it cleans,sterlizes and makes the razor smell great.Another thing I see people saying is its not worth buying  because it evaporates to quick,that is not true at all, if it does you will never notice it.Ive had one cartridge for 4 months and still using it.that said the BRAUN cleaning cartridge is well worth getting.</li>
            <li> I bought the four pack and at this price its a great deal.  They clean my razor and lubricate just as intended. Every shave is a good &#x27;n close shave!  I average one refill just about every 35 days.</li>
            <li> This is the realBraun brand cartridges. If you use that type, you need them :-)&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I skip on cleaning the shaver because I run out of this, I end up with irritated skin after shaving. So this germ-killing product (water, alcohol, some lubricant for the blades, and lemon smell mostly) really works and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Solution: prime shipping ;-)</li>
            <li> Guys if you have a thick beard that is prone ingrown hairs, this product may be your solution. By cleaning and lubricating my Braun shaver with this solution, I have significantly reduced painful razor bumps. While the shave isn&#x27;t as close as premium blades, the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two tips: 1) I  recommend cleaning the hair particles out of the shaver manually so as to get the most out of the solution. Occasionally, I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Prevent evaporation -- consistently leaving the saver in the stand will help preserve the volatile solution more effectively.  If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal, covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as described and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> A way to stretch the cartridges is to save the old cartridge after it says you need a new replacement. When the next cartridge needs replacing, take the saved cartridge and top off the fill basin with the old fluid. This whole replacement business is based on fluid evaporation. Just make sure to close the saved cartridges real well to avoid excessive evaporation. Hope this saves you guys  few bucks !!!</li>
            <li> Have used this site twice for refills on my Braun.  Fast, reliable, and the cheapest anywhere...packaged for wholesale - no frills - buy 4 at a time - ship in mini case.</li>
            <li> My husband gives this a 4.5 star because it has kept his shaver clean and sharp. It works the way it is supposed to. He uses it once a week and probably would use it more had it been a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> My husband has the series 7 braun shaver and the clean refills are expensive. I found a 4 pack on amazon and it was as cheap as 2 in the store. They shipped them fast and we received them within 3-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> We have these shipped regularly.  My husband has been using a Braun razor for the past 15 years.  He loves them and the self contained cleaning/charging unit makes the razor last longer.</li>
            <li> Great choice in product and the multiple packs.</li>
            <li> I have used this product ever since it became mandatory with the use of a Braun 7.  Now the price of the cleaner has increased and the useful life has diminished by 25% to 50%.  Inflation by any definition!</li>
            <li> Howdy!,&lt;br /&gt;  I love the convenience of an electric razor, but hated buying the refills for my Braun. I would always forget to buy them when I needed them and my local Target and Wal-mart are more expensive. Love this deal. The best part is that Amazon automatically reminds me that I need some more and ships it without me doing anything. Love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price. 10 percent cheaper than I&#x27;ve seen it elsewhere. Plus with subscribe and save I don&#x27;t worry about running out</li>
            <li> This refill is packaged well and is easy to install.  It continues the cleaning and lubing ability of the original insert.</li>
            <li> These are cheaper to get em from Amazon! Thanks</li>
            <li> Very good, but about one in four arrives with considerably less fluid than it should have. No evidence of leakage</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this cleaner really. It smells great and cleans my razor.The problem I really have is that it evaporates fast . But its because of the cleaner not the solution..</li>
            <li> Love having this on Subscription - otherwise I would forget to re-order these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons to mention (glad the shipping boxes are now much smaller!  More ECO.)&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> A fancy way to sell you very expensive isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> four refills in a plain box. strangely enough the lack of individual cardboard boxes for each refill does not seem to affect the overall performance of the product.</li>
            <li> After a stroke several years ago, I&#x27;ve been grooming my husband and floundering with several older model Braun electric shavers.  The System 7 cleaning system works well for me as I often forgot to clean and oil the shavers regularly.</li>
            <li> works as advertised, made by Braun and packed well, great value... hard to beat this purchase. would buy this again</li>
            <li> Sure, you can run your shaver head under the faucet to clean out the whiskers.  The alcohol in these cartridges also disinfect your shaver foil and blades.  That&#x27;s important since you are shaving so close with the Braun you are bound to get unnoticeable micro cuts that might harbor harmful bacteria.  The auto clean function works surprisingly well also.  I tested it by not shaving for three days and then shaved and stuck it on auto clean.  After the cycle was done, I pulled the head and inspected.  Spotless!  That is very impressive.  The Braun engineers deserve kudos for their innovations and making the world&#x27;s best shaver.</li>
            <li> Yep. Second refill just fine.</li>
            <li> Both my teenage son and my husband each own the Braun shaver so keeping these in stock is paramount.  I appreciate finding this in large bulk and for a decent price.  It takes a little longer to get here, but that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm spoiled by prime and this doesn‚Äôt come that way because it‚Äôs a &amp;#34;chemical liquid.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great price for a good product. Cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Great price on these replacement cartridges.  I have been looking for a deal like this forever.</li>
            <li> Do not have the more expensive store bought item next to it for a side by side compare. It does the job as advertised. Will probably purchase it again. Consider keeping the used containers as you can also buy refill fluids with different or no fragrance for even less. Enjoy shaving with a clean razor.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent, but rather expensive. Can purchase large container of the same cleaner without buying complete set, just clean well and refill</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered, from Japan I think, but does the same job!</li>
            <li> Love the shaver and these are the best cleaning system out there</li>
            <li> My husband uses the Braun shaver and we&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding replacement cartridges... Soooo glad to have found them here! They arrived very quickly - which was great because he needed to change the cartridge a while before we found this!</li>
            <li> Best value I&#x27;ve seen for these - work great with my Braun Series 7 - 790cc Pulsonic</li>
            <li> looks, feels and smells like the real mccoy</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> Much better than expected, lasts longer than expected</li>
            <li> A great buy. I&#x27;ve seen local stores selling them for twice the price (when you can find them). Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great price.  No leakers, but some minor variation in fill amounts between cartridges.  Recap between uses to cut evaporation losses.</li>
            <li> I like having a fresh razor for every shave and this system does that.  these are genuine factory cartridges and at a price delivered to my door much cheaper than I can get locally.</li>
            <li> Real good deal on this product.  Arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> I have using a model 7 Braun shaver for about 7 years. The clean and renew system keeps your shaver very clean. I use the oil on the screen about every 3rd or 4th shave. Seems to be more comfortable after oiling.</li>
            <li> This is satisfactory in every way.  I have no reservations recommending this to others as I am a very satisfied customer.  And a convenient way to purchase!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product!  I love the convience it affords me in the fact that it allows me to clean, charge and lubricate my shaver all in one step!  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!  It also leaves my shaver lemony fresh too!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product. Works as described.&lt;br /&gt;What else could I say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am following the advice I read here.I take the cartridge out and seal with the original lid after every use. This way it does not evaporate as much. It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun and forget which one.  When I decided I was going to keep it and checked pricing.  They seemed very competitive.</li>
            <li> My Braun Razor is about 12 years old now, and I&#x27;m just really happy they&#x27;re still providing these and haven&#x27;t change their basic auto-cleaner design every few years  just to get you to have to buy new ones. BRAVO Braun, and BRAVO Amazon for continuing to carry these!    Chuck  Want a Truly FREE Way to Start Making Money Online?  [...]</li>
            <li> Price of this product less than at the stores. Ilike the system. The razor is easy to clean and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills, Frustration Free 4 Count  on an Amazon 6 month subscription.  They are the same Barun cleaning cartridges that I have bought for years but at a better price than I can get in a local store.  The 6 month subscription period works out perfectly and the refill happens automatically.  The frustration free packaging is an easily opened cardboard box just big enough to hold 4 cartridges yet strong enough to hold the bulky cartridges.  The net result is efficient packaging with minimal waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have to report is that the price appears to go up a little with each refill.</li>
            <li> My husband has a Braun shaver and the cleaning system requires this cartridges.  I got them quickly, on time, and exactly what I ordered.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> i love Braun Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills and fit as expected.very good.i love it so much.i love braun&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Basically, if it fits your shaver it works.  They are probably all the same maker so just search for the best price.  I wish they were refillable but they really aren&#x27;t.  Basically, creating the alcohol liquid would entail having bad chemicals around...it isn&#x27;t just rubbing alcohol.  Also, you&#x27;d have to clean the gunk out of the package.</li>
            <li> Delivered as stated.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because of the price, beating any brick-and-mortar store two-pack (the way these are usually sold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can give is that these are NOT lemon-scented unlike the regular 2-packs sold in stores. They do smell clean in a standard alcohol-sort-of-way, but if you really want the lemon scent and don&#x27;t mind paying extra for it, these aren&#x27;t the ones you want to buy.</li>
            <li> My Braun shaver must be at least 8 years old.  It operates new because of the daily maintenance provided by the solution in the cartridges,</li>
            <li> Best prices for refills</li>
            <li> Great price and fast response....Thanks!</li>
            <li> So far I am on my first cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned by having to constantly replace the cleaning cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;I am old and only shave 3 to 4 times a week which reduces the need for the cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;I only need to run the cleaning cycle once or less per week so I am still on my first cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied !</li>
            <li> Love my Braun electric razor. This refill package seems to be the least expensive and when it is done on the auto ship makes perfect sense to me!</li>
            <li> My husband uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li> He loves this razor. He still trims it if he let it get too long before he shaves, cause he doesn&#x27;t want to tear it up with long hair. But he absolutely loves it and feels so smooth and sexy afterwards. Great product. Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get these as I was almost out!</li>
            <li> Great product. Delivered on time. I find them a little expensive though.</li>
            <li> delivery was fast enough, and are  as advertised.</li>
            <li> I thought these clean &amp; renew cartridges were just a scam to generate a revenue stream from their customers. While this is certainly true, the cleaning solution does a really good job of cleaning the device. I clean my shaver once a week, thus allowing the cartridges to last many months.</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to.  no issues exchanging them in the unit. they last a long time (I shave almost daily and exchanged these every few months)</li>
            <li> These are the OEM refills.  The multi pack is really useful in keeping up with the demand of the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Good price good product</li>
            <li> What more can you say. Does what it should, and keeps my Braun happy!</li>
            <li> If you have used the automatic cleaner for your Braun electric shaver you already know that the solution must periodically be replaced due to evaporation and use. This is a great process and such an easy way to clean and maintain your electric shaver. Furthermore, the daily cleaning makes for a smooth shave every morning.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my razor clean and go through these quite often. They leave the razor so fresh and so clean.</li>
            <li> As expected, but always overpriced no matter where you get them...</li>
            <li> Four for about the price of two in the store.  A great value in anyone&#x27;s book!  If your shaver requires these, this is your deal.</li>
            <li> This product keep my braun clean and ready to go!  Easy to use and mess free! So go ahead and try it!</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as described and a great price too. Shipped quickly and in good shape. I will get this every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review on just the price of the product.  The price is much better than any I&#x27;ve found in stores.  At the time of purchase, the 4 pack is the best deal.</li>
            <li> Keeps my Braun shaver clean, fresh and working great.  Have a Subscribe &amp; Save on this item so it saves me some money.</li>
            <li> Very nice lemon oil scent. Clean my Braun shaver (series 7), and keeps it running smooth. Braun blades and cartridges cannot be cleaned solely with water like Panasonic or Norelco as the Braun will rust. I usually run the Braun under a water faucet to get most trimmings off, then pop into the cleaner to finish the process and get lubed. The Braun Clean cartridges contain lubricants that keep blades from rusting.</li>
            <li> Fast response, good product, just like it is supposed to be.  What else needs to be said about this product.</li>
            <li> a standard insert - works perfect every time - delivered as promised - i could not be happier - perfect.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here. Its what is needed for the Braun shaver to clean itself. That being said, i recommend just subscribing through Amazon to get this. Not only is it cheaper, but convinient, as a pack comes just as I&#x27;m running out.</li>
            <li> Great product and reasonable price.  Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Braun shaver and these refills clean the shaver spotless. It&#x27;s the only way to look acceptable without having to use the wet shaver every morning for him.</li>
            <li> If you want to maximize your Braun shaves abilities, then these cartridges are a must and at a great price too!</li>
            <li> Makes a great clean up job and very easy to insert.</li>
            <li> My husband like this because it keeps reminding him to clean his razor on a regular basis.  I get the every 3 month plan and automaticaly sends this to him.</li>
            <li> Good price.  This razor uses these cartridges to clean the machine with.</li>
            <li> Standard product. Outstanding price per unit.</li>
            <li> Cleaned my shaver just as described. Great price. Too bad we can&#x27;t get Obama and his kind to do as they promised.</li>
            <li> If you own one of the Braun electric shavers that use this clean refill you can feel the difference of how clean and nice smell on the shaver after cleaning. Lasts about a month depending on frequency of use and dirt (face hair and grease) cleaned off the  shaver</li>
            <li> Makes my Braun sing like Elvis.</li>
            <li> Very,very convenient. Good product. I don&#x27;t have anymore to say. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you</li>
            <li> Item was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect shape!  It was exactly what it should be at a great price...thanks</li>
            <li> Great price for a necessary accessory to the Baun Razor.</li>
            <li> I gave half of this as a gift and kept the other half for me! win win! Works great and cost isn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li> Great value for the five Braun razors used by my husband and sons.  These cartridges are expensive, but so are the razors.  This is a great value play for anyone with a lot of teenagers who use the higher end razors.</li>
            <li> This product has been around for years, and works with the Braun auto-clean razors. They leave the razor clean, fresh smelling, and ready to use. I do wish they would last longer and that there were some way to recycle them.</li>
            <li> Make the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li> We live in a rural area with a 70 mile trip to the nearest shopping area.  At Christmas time when we shopped for the shaver, everything was out of stock locally.  It is very helpful to order what we need and have it delivered as opposed to driving seventy miles and coming home empty-handed.</li>
            <li> I tried to not pay the high price for these cartridges by using plain alcohol. I refilled my last cartridge with straight alcohol and used it many times with no problems. But then I noticed my shaves were no longer very close. I decided to pay the price for a new cartridge to see if it made a difference. I may be just kidding myself but I think my shaves are now closer with the real thing. I think the lubricant that is added makes all the difference by keeping the blades sharp. I plan to try the refill that Amazon offers that has a lubricant but the shipping charges are stopping me. You can definitely use plain alcohol for awhile, a month or two, but should buy a new cartrige after that.</li>
            <li> Take some alcohol , mix it with a bit of lubricant and lemon smell and what do you get? That right, the Clean and Renew refills. By and large works and keeps the razor clean and smelling good between shaves.</li>
            <li> Good and pretty and nice with price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth to buy and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and buy it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this.</li>
            <li> Great product , works as described</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for at least three years without a single problem.  They work as I expect them to.</li>
            <li> Works great to have a clean fresh scented shaver each time I use it.  Will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> GREAT SAVINGS ON THE 4 PACK</li>
            <li> Cleans well, they just seem to evaporate quickly..  Could be normal...  1 refill last about 30 days...</li>
            <li> Best electric shave ever. This system cleans and preps my shaver for next time. No disassembly, just drop it in and go.</li>
            <li> My husband uses the Braun electric razor and it is amazing how well these cartridges clean it.</li>
            <li> These refills cost a ton of money if you buy them from your local store. This 4-count pack will save you both time and the hassle of going to the brick-and-mortar store. If you have a Braun electric razor that takes these cartridges, do yourself a favor and order them from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance is as expected: excellent.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Works great and cleans my Braun cordless shaver really well.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more before running out of this cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Shaver refills run out after a few cleanings.  I have to refill reservoir with water in order to prolong the life of the cartridge.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007SNGSFS Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cart Shaver Refills Frustration Free 4 Pack]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These refill packs are really convenient and easy to use but they sure are pricey. One cartridge probably last 2 to 3 weeks depending on how often you activate the clean cycle. It evaporates so it \\&quot;runs out\\&quot; even if you don&#x27;t use it. Considering a bottle of cleaning alcohol is less than a dollar these are quite the luxury. Other than the price these are work great and saves you time.</li>
            <li> Not much to say  because I have used these shaver refills for many years and I&#x27;m sure these are as good as all past ones. I buy Braun for two reasons, because they are the best shavers and this shaver cleaner system is also the best</li>
            <li> The product is as described and saves me money. It arrived on time and the packages are really easy to opne</li>
            <li> Cheapest price I could find anywhere on the internet. Came in the Braun Packaging and everything. I thought it may be some knock off product but it wasn&#x27;t. Considerably cheaper buying here than buying through Wal-Mart or Target. Work great and exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This cleansing material works well with the Braun shaving system but the cost is a killer. It goes to prove that the old Gillette theory still works--sell the shaver at a reasonable cost but make the profits with replacement blades--in this case with an alcohol cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Braun designed a useful shaver stand that also cleans the shaver.  It is nice to be able to buy the cleaning solution at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> These refills are worth the price to keep the shaver clean and fresh. I have two Braun shavers that use these cartridges (8000 and 7000 series), and I&#x27;m glad the same refills work for both.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this when he ordered his second Braun shaver, the Series 7-790cc. He says it easy-to-use and does a good job keeping the shaver in good shape (important since it does double duty, he shares the shaver with our teenaged son). Recommended.</li>
            <li> Receive the item within a week.  Came in brown box with Braun logo.  Cartridge not in English.  For 1/4 store prices  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Save a lot of money and get this bulk package.  Great buy at almost half the cost of purchasing individually.</li>
            <li> Like my Braun and I guess there will always be some &amp;#34;costs&amp;#34; to shaving.  Haven&#x27;t really shopped for price, just assumed Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> A valuable component of the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;ve owned quite a few. The cartridge refills are easy to use, although I wish they could find a way for consumers to empty the dirty cleaner, wash out and refill the cartridge with new cleaner. I hate putting more plastic in the landfill. Otherwise, this is a very convenient item that does the job of cleaning and prolonging the life of your Braun razor&#x27;s blades and screen.</li>
            <li> Braun product is just fine.  A double order was inadvertently made and I tried to cancel while&lt;br /&gt;speaking to an Amazon cust. svc. rep.  The additional product was shipped to me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon notified me by email that I needed to return the product.  But the print return mail app&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t work.  Now I am paying for 2 or 3 yrs worth of shaver cleaner.  Not a happy camper!!</li>
            <li> This product must have set in a warehouse for a very long time, each container was equally depleted (not full) the same amount. I guess this was from evaporation.</li>
            <li> I have had the Braun shaver that uses these refills for several years.  I like it because I always feel like my shaver is clean. The cartridges are easy to change and disposal is easy.</li>
            <li> Same as what Target carries and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> fits well and does its job as a refill. Cleans my braun razor well and leaves it smelling lemony fresh.</li>
            <li> These are cheap and good option for regularly cleaning the shaver. The quality doesn&#x27;t look the same as the original one that I received with the shaver, but still good enough for regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> regular user  very good</li>
            <li> Cleans the shaver and good smell. Great Value!</li>
            <li> Just great...love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need to keep my razor clean.</li>
            <li> Great price. Genuine Braun.</li>
            <li> Great product for the excellent Braun shaver product line.</li>
            <li> Great to have a 4 pack so not ordering all the time.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  OEM product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t Beat this Deal. If You want the best Deal; Buy the 4 pack. It&#x27;s the Best Deal; Even when Buying an 8 or 12 Pack; Buy the 4 Pack; Multiple Times; as I Did. You&#x27;ll Save the Most Money that way &amp; Your Braun Electric Shaver will be the Cleanest; Ever.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> good value, works well</li>
            <li> WE love the cleaning system and we have these extra for when we need to change.</li>
            <li> Very good packaging.  No waster.  Rest....if you have Braun shaver, this is a good value.</li>
            <li> Series 7 refill product works as described, and the price was excellent compared to what you would pay &amp;#34;in-store.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> works great. my shaver feels new and refreshed</li>
            <li> These are very expensive and you can refill them yourself. The liquid is essentially denatured alcohol, readily available in hardware stores. Braun will not divulge what liquid is being used, and cautions against refilling them. Braun&#x27;s razors are top-notch,but you can bypass the refill cartridges. I have used denatured alcohol for several years; it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Convenient way to order this product necessary for using this system.</li>
            <li> Great product. On-time delivery. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Best razor system I&#x27;v ever seen!!</li>
            <li> A must have if you own those new Braun electric shaver - it&#x27;s like the old commercial &amp;#34; Set it up and leave it&amp;#34; it does the job all by itselg. Great product P $ G.  Why are you shipping this to me when I requested several times to canel this crap</li>
            <li> The Braun razor which contained the cleaning package was given to me a couple of years ago.  Since then, I have been using it regularly and have found that it cleans and lubricates my shaver better than anything else I have ever used.  Each cartridge is supposed to last about a month, but I have found that its life expectancy is about twice that.  The only criticism is that it is bulky and non-transportable.  Since I travel a lot, I can only clean my razer when I am home, which means weeks and sometimes months go by without being able to take advantage of it.</li>
            <li> The Braun Clean and Renew system is a boon. My electric shaver feels significantly sharper when I&#x27;m using the &amp;#34;clean and renew&amp;#34; system. Also, the shaver is one of the best rated, I believe, partly due to this liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a power user of the shaver then it will last about 30 shaves, per the description. However, if you use your shaver once every couple of days, you will likely run out of this solution too early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip I have to extend the life of the cartridges, is to pull out the cartridge and close it between uses for the first couple of months. After that I let it just stay in the machine. I can pull 4 months or about 32 shaves out of it easily.</li>
            <li> This product could use more longevity, but the results are excellent.  I&#x27;m not sure how additional longevity could be achieved.  Possibly by selling the liquid in a large container, so as the used liquid could be discarded and the container refilled.</li>
            <li> These refills are easy to use: follow Braun&#x27;s instructions and the old one pops out and voila the new one is in quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used these refills for years with my Braun electric razor.  The 4 pack is much cheaper than the 2 pack that I have found in stores.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for quite some time now. I like the idea of alcohol cleaning my shaver. I sometimes change the quantity package I purchase based on the best deal going. I notice a difference after cleaning. Other razors should use the same. This is now a major factor for me when looking at new potential razors.</li>
            <li> This fluid always makes my shaver feel clean and ready to do its job.  I love this stuff to keep my shaver on point.</li>
            <li> Good deal for 4 refills :)</li>
            <li> great price for product.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipment,</li>
            <li> No frills packaging.  Exactly what I needed.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but I would not run it after every shave, everytime you charge would be sufficient to clean it</li>
            <li> These cart shaver refills for the Braun Series 7 shaver are an integral part of the comprehensive shaving system.  The shaver is acknowledged as the best in the world, and the system refills are a must.</li>
            <li> My husband has had his Braun razor for about three years, and I have been ordering these cartridges for him that entire time.  He usually runs the cleaning cycle after every use and shaves about five times a week, but these still last a really long time for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new frustration-free packaging is also nice and helps cuts down on waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, these are pricey, but they do an excellent job of keeping his shaver clean and fuzz-free.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and perfect item!</li>
            <li> This a genuine Braun product</li>
            <li> I really like the Braun Series 7 shaver that I bought recently.  The self-cleaning system really keeps the shaver working well.  The Clean &amp; Renew packs are easy to replace.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of not having to manually clean my new shaver. it does all the dirty work for me.</li>
            <li> This Braun Series 7 electric razor system is the easiest to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Great buy and packing makes it very easy to store.  Recommend to everyone who uses these type of cartridges. Super buy!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver. The three pack was a great deal on the shaver. We received it in just a day or two. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at the best price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Braun electric shavers for over 5 years. I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean &amp; Renew cartridges have a shorter life span, from about 3 months to less than 2 months, not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point. I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I&#x27;m the only one, but so far I give it only 3 stars because of this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Frustrarion Free Pack is great, it greatly reduces the amount of useless cardboard and excess material. Good job there!</li>
            <li> Product is cheap and is genuine Braun, a most to buy in bulk. Does a in depth cleaning to keep your shaver sanitized</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be much easier to clean my new razor, just drop it in and press the button, half hour later it is cleaned, dried and lubricated for my next shave. Truly an awesome idea.</li>
            <li> This is a must for my husband Braun electric shaver. It fits into a special slot in the shaver holder and will clean the shaver when needed and does a good job cleaning the razer. It is very easy to remove and install a clean refill. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works as it supposed to.  I was from the shaver manufacture so what can I say.  I have no problems with the product or with the order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same braun 8100 series for over 6 years. These cleaner refills and the self cleaning station have kept it going strong.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but there is an amount left which is still a sufficient amount left when I get the &amp;#34;Out&amp;#34; notice.</li>
            <li> Decent price with free shipping</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  The 4 pack is suffices for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Needed this for my Braun shaver now 10 plus yrs old, in part, no doubt, as a result of using this. Auto ship and arrives as expected with reasonable price.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Love everything about the system!  It&#x27;s great to always shave with a clean shaver.  At first, I had a few doubts, but I&#x27;ve never had a shaver like this.  After my older model braun died, I purchased a Norelco with 3 spinning heads.  Didn&#x27;t care for it as the heads would spin way too slowly and I had constant &#x27;catching&#x27; - argh - &#x27;hate that when that happens!  This shaver&#x27;s got guts!  It goes and goes!  I&#x27;d recommend this shaving system to anyone who wants a great shave everyday!</li>
            <li> Works great for my shaver, fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these but they are slow to resend.  I had to buy some locally..</li>
            <li> This product is very overpriced.  The best and least expensive thing to clean your razor with is... tap water.  Once every3-4 uses lubricate it with 3 in 1 oil and you can remove the clunky cleaning unit from your bathroom counter also.  This stuff is like buying overpriced ink cartridges for your printer.</li>
            <li> Smells nice when it starts to run low I add alcohol to it getting more life from each cartridge</li>
            <li> They may look different than the cartridge I got with my Braun razor but I haven&#x27;t noticed any decrease in quality. Keeps my razor clean and running great and for lots cheaper than the cartridges I&#x27;ve seen at the store. Each one lasts about five months, sometimes longer, although I don&#x27;t use them as much as Braun suggests I should.  For me one long/deep clean a week, and the quick clean when I feel it&#x27;s needed keeps the razor working fine. Like other reviews have suggested I have found that placing the cap back on when your not using the cleaner does help it last longer, but I feel the MOST IMPORTANT step to making it last is to rinse all the hair out of razor and let it dry a bit before you use the cleaning dock. Using the cleaning system with a razor full of hair only dilutes the cleaning solution and makes it not clean as well.</li>
            <li> One pack will last you a year if you close it back up after use and only clean once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see leaving the lid open 24/7 as the thing would evaporate and the clean cycle only takes about 5 or 6 minutes to run.</li>
            <li> We have been buying and over paying for this Braun Clean &amp; Renew from Target and Walmart for about 10 years now.  It isn&#x27;t a huge savings buying off of Amazon but it still saves money over buying it retail and much easier since it comes to the house.  We will buy it from Amazon from now on and continue to love our Braun razor and cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first electric shaver the Braun Series 7 799-6c and needed spare cartridges.  Not knowing how the shaver would be.. I am glad I made this purchase. I have not shaved in 40 years!!! What a close shave!!!! Decided between Panasonic and Braun.. and I am glad I made the correct purchase! Amazon has the best prices on this and now I have over a year of stock. I was told that the cartridges only last less than 30 days... well I am getting close and it is not even close! The light lemon smell and the clean shave each time makes this worth every penny and they are worth it!</li>
            <li> The BRAUN Clean and Renew Shaver Refills are extremely handy and easy to use.  No mixing or jugling  to change the cleaning of my BRAUN shaver.  Only wish there would be a way to reuse the containers by filling from a larger container, this way saving on the evironment and land fills.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price that these things are going for! I bought 8 of these for the price that 3 sell for in stores!</li>
            <li> These do a great job of cleaning my razor.</li>
            <li> You really do have to have these if you have Braun Electric Razor with cleaning station,  Doubt you will find a better price.  Each cartridge last much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Enough Said!  I love the shaver and these refills are fabulous!  I will be purchasing these again when they are needed</li>
            <li> Cartridges are a handy way to clean razor.</li>
            <li> No hassle containers of cleaning liguid&lt;br /&gt;Alternative is go to Lowes Dept Store&lt;br /&gt;buy gallon of same thing and can&lt;br /&gt;put flower scent oil in it like lavendar oil</li>
            <li> This is the longest I&#x27;ve gone without having to replace a razor and part of the reason is the cleaning.  And the frustration free packaging is great.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Purchased a 4 pack just after getting the razor for Xmas. Product works great. Just finally changed out after 2 months. Old cartridge was disgusting and full of hair that isn&#x27;t everywhere else so I would say it is a success.</li>
            <li> Works just like you would expect.</li>
            <li> Not a bad value for this quantity. Beats having to run out to a store to find these especially in larger than a two pack.</li>
            <li> This is an original product and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper per unit buying the 4 pack on Amazon than the individual unit cost, even at Wal-Mart.  Kinda sucks that they don&#x27;t make a reusable/refillable option - it&#x27;s just SD40 Alcohol and fragrance but you can&#x27;t open up the cartridges to clean them out.  Tricky German engineer capitalists (at least I think they&#x27;re German).</li>
            <li> I have amassed a whole bunch of these cleaner cartridges but am pleased with the ongoing results, so hopefully I have a stock for the next few years!  Good shaver, good system, thank you for offering!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you own a Braun shaver, which give a great shave, you need this cleaner fluid. The prices here are better than I&#x27;ve found anywhere else so I keep coming back.</li>
            <li> Great price.  3rd time we have purchased these.</li>
            <li> Great value and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> Balk at the concept of paying for these refills all the time, but the bottom line is that this is a really good system to care for a quality electronic. I don&#x27;t mind buying these at all, I know that my shaver will be clean and tip top every time I use it, and with no effort. I enjoy throwing the spent ones away and seeing all the junk in them that I know is not in my shaver.</li>
            <li> My original cartridge had run out and I had not been able to use my razor (Its NHL playoff season anyway so its not a big deal) But these cartridges are great and four for a good price!</li>
            <li> Basic 4 pack comes packaged just as you see and lasts quite a while. One trick I learned is that if you clean the razor every one  or two uses with the brush that is provided these cartridges will last up to twice as long as they would if you don&#x27;t clean it. While I know it is an inconvenience to clean the razor often it does stretch out these refills.</li>
            <li> Cleans the shaver and smells pretty good. My only issue is that they evaporate in less than a month. I would suggest using the plastic caps that come with it and use those when not using the cleaner.</li>
            <li> This product works great with my 790cc shaver.  The price for these refills is a really good deal.  Recommend for yourself or for a gift for someone that has a Braun razor.</li>
            <li> Perfect product and great cost the amount you get. Will be purchasing again when I run out of what I have now.</li>
            <li> What am I going to do with all this cleaner? I clearly purchased too many. Good product!</li>
            <li> Just fine cleaner.  Keeps my razor sharp and clean.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!  The labels are in Japanese!  I&#x27;m not sure why that excites me!</li>
            <li> Very good product, lasts so long! Maybe I need only two for a whole year?</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and is the best price I&#x27;ve seen. I&#x27;ve used these razor cleaners for several years and have been happy with the way they clean my Braun razor.</li>
            <li> Worked in my Braun 7526 clean and charge stand. packaging was easy to open and light. a good price for 4 cartridges, better than I can find in a store. subscription service should help me keep these stocked so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> They are doing a great job of cleaning my shaver</li>
            <li> no us made runs out in half the time a US made one does</li>
            <li> Just like what came with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Work great, smell good :D</li>
            <li> Keeps it clean and sanitized. Definitely something to invest in.</li>
            <li> The picture shows the new lemon scent. Didn&#x27;t get that:-(. Please correct</li>
            <li> Good value compared to other sources</li>
            <li> Great purchase and received it in a few day.</li>
            <li> Only three stars for I do not received my purchanse, this product is dangerous mercadery and the airline do not transport to Colombia.</li>
            <li> Works great, but rather costly.</li>
            <li> Received this quickly so no issues there. The cartridges have Chinese or Japanise writing on them but the box says Made in Ireland. Solution is lighter than the box Braun cartridges I would buy locally so I will have to see if there is a difference. Also the scent is weak compared to locally purchased Bran cartridge. I will update later if I notice any significant changes. Used the Shaver for the first time and cleaning cycle seems OK.</li>
            <li> A very surprising deal after ordering a Braun 3 pack and being upgraded to the Amazon 4 count packaging. It is the same tried and true product that I was expecting, only in a value added package.</li>
            <li> Had my razor since December and just ran out of the cleaning cartridge so ordered these as replacement.  Love my razor but don&#x27;t shave every day.  These will last me a couple of years probably and the price was good for 4.</li>
            <li> Cleans the razor completely..</li>
            <li> First time have decided to get replacement containers... frankly they are pointless, you can clean your shaver with water, this is just a gimmick to keep it smell fresh</li>
            <li> Cheaper than local stores, and it does the job for my Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> In feel so productive reordering my electric razor maintenance solution timely. Well engineered once u get the trick of it. Lasts a decent amount of time. Don&#x27;t slack on hygiene!  And take care of that nice razor you&#x27;ve treated yourself to.  Time for me to re-order!</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  Just met my need.</li>
            <li> There is a confusing array of price choices for various Brauns. However, this cheaper one is still exactly appropriate for the newer Series 7.</li>
            <li> I got this for my braun 3 clean and renew and its worth spending . it is value for money/</li>
            <li> If you have one of these Braun shavers and use the cleaning cartridges, this is a best buy</li>
            <li> this is one of the best shavers that I have ever used i would highly recommend this to and one</li>
            <li> It was shipped when it said it would be and you can&#x27;t really go wrong with an order when you know exactly what you are getting</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and as expected without any damage.  Nice cheap price and now I&#x27;m set for over 4 months.</li>
            <li> What else can I say. Its cleaning solution for the Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Does what it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best price I have seen! the 4 pack is the best value. I bought 2 4 packs and got free shipping!! You cant beat that.</li>
            <li> What a value, same stuff you buy in the store but for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> You know how the brawn cleaning system is good.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone using this understands this liquid is needed for you.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> works as advertised. pricey.</li>
            <li> So easy to replace cartridge.  Cleans razor automatically and leaves a fresh fragrance.  Like knowing I have extra cartridges when I need them.</li>
            <li> OEM product, works just like it should</li>
            <li> Works and is OEM product with reduced price per volume ordered. Beats the 2 pack at Freddy Meyers department store</li>
            <li> great price and shipping</li>
            <li> Get a much better price buying these off Amazon than at the local stores. They work great and getting a few at a time means I will always have one when needed. I could clean the shaver myself, but its worth it to me to keep buying these at a good price and let the cleaner do it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! The cartridges are necessary for a great cleaning, and we were happy with the price, product, &amp; delivery, Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!! The cartridges are necessary for a great cleaning, and we were happy with the price, product, &amp; delivery, Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!!

The cartridges are necessary for a great cleaning, and we were happy with the price, product, &amp; delivery, Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I have had the razor for 4 years and I now need to order the cleaner less frequently due to getting a &amp;#34;4 pack&amp;#34;. Use keeps the razor clean and lubricated. It is well sealed and easy to insert cartridge into cleaner stand.</li>
            <li> The price is right but each refill lasts a month or less. It really does the job cleaning and lubricating the razor though and it makes the razor smell clean</li>
            <li> Especially at this price. I love my Braun, but my local Target and WalMarts are starting to not resupply these at a very regular rate. So often they are out of stock or have just quit carrying these in stores.</li>
            <li> Not something I&#x27;m ever going to love, these things are a necessary purchase to keep your Braun shaver clean. This was the best price I found on Amazon (or anywhere else) and these things work just fine. A grudging, but required purchase.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve always purchased these cartridges in packages of 2 or more, this way you get the most for your money.  They keep the Braun razors in tip top shape. Very happy with this transaction, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> seems to work well.  I put it in and it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not original quality of liquid.</li>
            <li> I PRICED ONE REFILL AT WALMART&lt;br /&gt;I BOUGHT THE 4 PACK FOR THE SAME PRICE AS I WOULD HAVE FOR 2 REFILLS THERE AND WALMART WAS THE CHEAPEST OF ANY STORE.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT BUY AND I GOT FREE SHIPPING&lt;br /&gt;I GET A BETTER SHAVE AFTER CHARGING AND CLEANING TOO.</li>
            <li> Although a little pricey, they work very well and keep my razor clean.  Buying in a four count pack is less expensive than other ways and help with the price.  Easy to use and work as ordered.  Thanks, Braun!</li>
            <li> Being able to purchase these on a subscription plan eliminates the need to have to remember to order replacements when needed.  The product is the same as came with my razor and the convenience of subscriptions on Amazon is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> This product is very good and very useful in other to protect the shaver. It must be used very often and the price is right</li>
            <li> Con: do not need so many in one pack.&lt;br /&gt;Pro. Works awesome in cleaning the head of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do. No complaints. There is not much more that needs to be said.</li>
            <li> This is the way to get it. (Clean shaver after every use for best result... you don&#x27;t want to rub dirty things on your face.)</li>
            <li> They do the job and the smell is pleasant (an ethyl, as in beverage, alcohol sort of thing!), though powder (no doubt from my shaving stick) builds up in the opening over time.  But they should be less expensive, and there should be a built in way to avoid evaporative loss of the expensive alcohol based fluid.  I cover mine with plastic when not in use (and unplug the unit, since a certain amount of heat is generated while it is plugged in).  That should be built in.</li>
            <li> I purchased a four pack of these with my new razor because these are more expensive almost everywhere else that I have looked for them locally.</li>
            <li> I got these when I bought my Braun series 7 electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I see no advantage of this versus the previous model which just required washing under running water. This just adds  expense!!</li>
            <li> Good value for the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller and product.  This is factory-made original Braun parts and they work great!  Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to open the product and find the labeling in a language I cannot read.  I would like to know what is in it.  Made me wonder if it was a legit product, or a knock-off.</li>
            <li> Great bargain. Fast service. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love them, they clean well and smells refreshing.</li>
            <li> I loved and the price is bery good for a package of four. Excellent deal!</li>
            <li> good product , great price..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun Series 7 for about 5 years now and I love it. Not only does it do a great job, but the charging/cleaning base is really handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I run the cleaning cycle on the razor, no matter how dirty it is, it comes out with the Clean and Renew cartridges looking brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish these were cheaper, but that&#x27;s just the cost of the Braun system. The refills are cheaper on Amazon than at Wal-Mart, so I&#x27;m happy to keep buying them... and when/if my Braun Series 7 quits working, I&#x27;ll be buying another.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years, always okay!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product...!!!</li>
            <li> Was a great deal.  4 cartridges were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Good price and works good.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it is supposed to be!!</li>
            <li> One of my cartridges broke open during transit and the cleaning solution got over not only my the other cartridges but my carpet as well. There is virtually no padding. I understand if the box is snug, since the cartridges are hard plastic, to not put padding. But when the box is too big and the cartridges can slide back and forth you definitely need some sort of buffer. However apart from the packaging mishaps, this is probably the best deal on cartridges you can find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product. I just hope they keep comin&#x27; and not dropped for any reason. Well you want for more words -- I guess that takes care of that.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say about these. I don&#x27;t think there is any other type of refill you can get for your Braun razor cleaner/charger. I have never had an issue with these. They come in a cardboard box and not much other packaging. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it shipped fast and the price makes it a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll purchase it again from this company.</li>
            <li> it is not original product and it does not contain lubricant</li>
            <li> Overpriced for what it is but I have been buying it for my razor cleaning system for a long time just out of convenience.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure it is the same type cleaning fluid my barber uses for his combs and razor heads but difficult to tell since they don&#x27;t tell you what is in in. I like it anyway !</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 of these, and the 1st one installed very easily. The whole unit seems well designed, and I only run the cleaner when it requires total cleaning.</li>
            <li> Nice lemon scent and last for about 6 weeks or so.  Great price as subscribe and save also.</li>
            <li> Product works as I expected, and the price for four of these is way better than you can get in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> OEM, as far as I can tell, replacements for my Braun electric shaver cleaning system. I do what&lt;br /&gt;many people do on here and remove it from the cleaning station and re-cap to extend the life of&lt;br /&gt;the product. These four refills will last nearly a year and a half, I&#x27;d estimate.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver - and love that I have been able to get product and replacement parts over years that I have owned it.  Sometimes it has been a hassle to find the parts, including the cleaning cartridges, in local stores.  It has been very handy to be able to order directly through Amazon.  Saves time and miles formerly spent looking for refills.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years for my son&#x27;s razor.  Keeps the razor blades super clean and free from bacteria.</li>
            <li> If I did not like the product, I would have purchased another brand shaver.</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly, packaged efficiently, and fits perfectly on the Braun cleaning and recharging unit. This is my first (and only) choice for Braun refills!</li>
            <li> Wish I could refill it myself</li>
            <li> What can I say?! It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Which it was a bit cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I get these products on prime auto send. Keeps the razor clean and smelling good.</li>
            <li> They work perfect as well as the ones that with, but without the cost.</li>
            <li> This is awesome that i can get 4 at a time - Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Order was received in a package written in Chinese.  The labels on the cartridges were also in Chinese.  The liquid was a very pale blue tint;  my previous purchases were 2 and 3-packs with the darker blue color.  Liquid appeared new, so I used them, no problem, but I think this was a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> What a great price for the real deal !</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Outstanding cleaning and lubricating agent - thank you!</li>
            <li> An excellent price and smooth delivery.  Will continue to order these cartridge refills.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much that the product is bad, it just seems almost unnecessary. It&#x27;s pretty much an alcohol base to clean your electric razor, which is nice. Of course you&#x27;ll want to wait for it to dry, because if you still have alcohol on your razor while you&#x27;re shaving it will definitely burn. So you&#x27;ll have to wait until the razor is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product itself is good, but it&#x27;s more of a hassle to buy more when you run out. Purchasing the four pack at a time will probably benefit you over the long run.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by the razor and its cleaning system. He has been using it for 6+ years (only getting a new blade maybe once or twice!). The cleaning system cut down on his breakouts and has really made a huge difference in his complexion.</li>
            <li> Great value on this 4-pack</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works great as always.</li>
            <li> Really makes electric shaver use easy with the cartridge refills.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The Same As I Had Bought At The Store But At A Better price.</li>
            <li> These work like a champ in my Braun and the multipack saves me time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two models of the Braun shaver that use these cartridges, and I think they work pretty great. Buying them in bulk this way is also definitely the way to go, as they can get a bit pricey, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve gotten a better shave from an electric, and if these help keep my razor in tip-top shape then all the better. I&#x27;d consider a generic option if there was one, to see if there was a difference, but until I find one, I&#x27;m pretty happy with these - I don&#x27;t clean the razor after EVERY use and they last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW: I&#x27;m not yet sure if the &amp;#34;Frustration Free&amp;#34; packaging really cuts down on the waste though, the corrugated cardboard seems like more material than the standard thin cardboard box the cartridges normally come in, and mine got mashed in shipping, but the cartridges arrived alright.</li>
            <li> The box of 4 beTs the box of 3 at the drugstore!  It&#x27;s a great product to clean my husbands razor.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> These work well. Have two different series of Braun razors they fit in. Will buy more and regularly</li>
            <li> Great product!  Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to buy the four pack!</li>
            <li> The cost of owning the Braun shaver that uses these &#x27;self-cleaning&#x27; refills is substantial. IMHO, this &#x27;system&#x27; is over-rated.</li>
            <li> Beats running to the store and waiting to have them &#x27;unlocked&#x27; from the razor/perfume case....price is right!</li>
            <li> They do their intended purpose.</li>
            <li> These keep the shaver head nice and clean.  They work great.  Unfortunately a bitterant is added to the alcohol so no one will try to drink it.  While this makes it safer the unintended side effect is that after you shave you may find licking your lips to be quite bitter.  Also I think they are probably overpriced for what they are but I always buy mine here at Amazon as I find this is the best price around.</li>
            <li> work as imagined. great value.</li>
            <li> great deal, keeps my razor fresh, clean and well oiled. If you can find at a cheaper price I would be surprised.</li>
            <li> I always but this product on Amazon as it has the best price for this product.,</li>
            <li> I shave every other day and clean my razor after every shave. One refill last me two months. $2.50 a month&lt;br /&gt;to keep my razor clean, bacteria free, lubricated and lemon fresh.. This product does a top notch job....inexpensively. I highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend you use this solution.</li>
            <li> The right amount, for the right money!</li>
            <li> This is the product I purchased through the last five years. Simply nothing to complain.</li>
            <li> OEM PRODUCT PACKED RIGHT</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected - 4 cleaning cartridges for my Braun.</li>
            <li> they are not ksting for 30 days with once a day use</li>
            <li> The price is right and I do recommend ordering at least 4. You can feel the difference when shaving.</li>
            <li> Good price, good quantity.  The packing is definitely frustration free.  It is very easy to remove the contents.</li>
            <li> Product delivered as advertised. Good price and fast delivery. Ordered alongside replacement foil and blade for the Braun Series 5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Syncro shaver system for quite some time, and have always used the Clean &amp; Renew refills to keep my shaver clean, lubricated, and ready to go for the next shave.  Cleaning with these isn&#x27;t a necessity, but it does take away the chore of having to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of these, in my opinion, is worth the price for a smooth shave every time without any fuss of having to take the shaver apart to clean it, or having to remember to make sure to lubricate the blades as frequently - plus the lemon scent is a nice added bonus!</li>
            <li> I have this product as a subscription item. I like the convenience of the subscription service. The product itself is not much to comment on. Its a Braun product that should fit into a Braun cradle. I&#x27;ve had several shipments of the product already and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with the cartridge fitting into the cradle.</li>
            <li> I like that Amazon is selling items with frustration-free packaging. The cardboard is obviously recyclable or reusable, and very easy to open. Also, this cartridge works for pretty much all Braun shavers (read the description for compatibility). I saved a few bucks off on this 4-pack as opposed to going to my local department store, and for the savings as well as the superior packaging choice, I am happy. Will be buying this kit whenever my Braun needs a cleaner refill.</li>
            <li> That is really good product</li>
            <li> Said it all in the title.  Pretty simple product that is the same as you would buy in a store.</li>
            <li> Great product exactly as advertised. Have always used Braun shavers and parts and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Good price was incentive, and free shipping at Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best replacement blade systems I have ever used, so hopefully they don&#x27;t get discontinued.... Thanx Braun</li>
            <li> good price for good product</li>
            <li> splashes out of cartridge holder when first put in</li>
            <li> Works well and I got this for my husband&#x27;s Braun, his all-time favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy way to keep your razor in good shape. I have been using it since it came out.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve found on these refill cartridges. They work great with my Braun razor. Each cartridge last about a month. The fluid does a good job cleaning the razor.</li>
            <li> Blades feel great every time they are cleaned. Worth the cost. Fast shipping. Nice smell. Also warms the blades right before you shave!</li>
            <li> Fast Amazon shipping. I have been using a Braun shaver for many years and just replaced the one that I have had for years. I like that these are common within several Braun models.</li>
            <li> please be advised that these refill run out after 3-5 cycles from the braun cleaner. not ideal at all. use sparingly!</li>
            <li> This product works great and the purchase price with quick service is outstanding. Would definitely recommend without question to others</li>
            <li> The product is the original provided by Braun, it contains 4 refills, rather than the two found in a store, the price is right, and it is delivered to your door.  What could be better?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these refills in my Braun razon for about 6 months now and I can honestly say that I believe they are what keep my razor working so smoothly.  I do replace them on the first of every month and recommend the suscribe and save feature here.  Overall, these are a simple, clean and cost effective way of keeping my razor&#x27;s head in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonable price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and it works just fine. I appreciate getting 4 refills at one time, it saves me reordering too oftern.</li>
            <li> I like the razor and I love knowing this cleaning solution keeps it sanitized!  For me this was one of the important factors for puchasing the product.</li>
            <li> it came in a clear liquid. not blue as advertised.</li>
            <li> These are a lot more expensive in the stores, so it is a great purchase.  Wish you didn&#x27;t have to buy these, but expensive razor &#x3D; expensive cleaning supplies...</li>
            <li> Great cleaner for your Braun shaver. Each refill lasts me about a month used once every few days.</li>
            <li> I bought pack of 4. First of all original that made in IRELAND much more better that this. It&#x27;s Ok but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Got just what I wanted at a good price. Came packed well and in reasonable time.</li>
            <li> These are great.,  Buy them with auto ship and save $$$.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than  buying in store. Good quality.</li>
            <li> the braun clean and renew refill really work, my braun shaver works like a charm, I get a close shave and no irritation on my face</li>
            <li> The ONLY product I use to clean my BRAUN Series 7 shaver.  This leaves the shaving head smelling clean and fresh for days after cleaning.  Keep the tight fitting cap instead of discarding it when the product is opened.  I&#x27;ve learned to remove the product from the Clean &amp; Renew System as soon as cleaning cycle is complete, recap it and save the product from evaporating.  By doing this, I have extended the use of one refill to more then double the life span of leaving the refill in the Clean &amp; Renew System.</li>
            <li> They fit fine, are less expensive in a four-pack [even better when you subscribe], and do a fine job cleaning Braun shavers. Packaging is painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say?</li>
            <li> These refills have been reliable since the day I started using that model of shaver and haven&#x27;t looked back since.</li>
            <li> Works well with my pulsonic shaving system.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help clean my electric shaver. I really like it because it is easy to remove the old cartridge and insert the new one.</li>
            <li> What can I say about these, they do the job.  Just look for the best multi-pack price when shopping for them.</li>
            <li> Just as the product description says..It keeps the razor feeling and working ike new.Very good product and easy to purchase.</li>
            <li> good cleaning solution</li>
            <li> My husband has been using The Braun shave for atleast 20+ yrs.  These cleaner cartridges are great.  You just hit the setting and approx. 1 hour later it&#x27;s nice an clean again.</li>
            <li> The genuine article at the right price point. I searched high and low for this item which is critical to keeping my razor in top shape. When I was able to find them at the drug store they wanted an arm and a leg for this couple ounces of nice smelling rubbing alcohol in the funky plastic tank. Problem solved, thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love my Braun razer and these cartridges help maintain it&#x27;s cleanliness allowing the razer to perform at its best every shave.</li>
            <li> Using this product for some time. Works great for me. Sanitizes and cleans well. Wish it lasted longer per unit.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy on line.</li>
            <li> Cleans and renews just like the label. Makes Shaver last longer also so definitely need to keep up with it.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves his shaver and this cleaning option.  Cartridges last a reasonable amount of time with daily use and are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I needed refills for my shaving system and this multi-pack is a great value. The Braun shaver is really nice too.</li>
            <li> I am supposed to write something about Braun Clean and renew cartridges. What can I say about  Braun products that hasn&#x27;t already been said? These cartridges are representative of all of the Braun products that I have owned. Great, they work.</li>
            <li> Item received in good condition --product is used daily .</li>
