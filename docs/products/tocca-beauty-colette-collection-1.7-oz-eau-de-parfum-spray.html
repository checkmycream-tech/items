            <li>This is my favorite perfume EVER.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>It is light and is truly the scent of a woman!</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>Fast service &amp; love love love this perfume.</li>
            <li>A light fruity/floral fragrance with sandlewood.</li>
            <li>I prefer a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Light, but lingers.  </li>
            <li>The sandalwood is pretty prominent, but the fragrance is also spicy and a bit floral.</li>
            <li>originally saw this fragrance at Anthropologie.</li>
            <li>The purchase was still worth it though!</li>
            <li>What I love the most about this scent is that it dries to a soft powdery scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>Its scent is so original...very sophisticated, mysterious, and sexy.</li>
            <li>Also, I have never had a fragrance disappear as quickly as this one did.</li>
            <li>Mild scent.</li>
            <li>Very feminine without being too strong.</li>
            <li>Not too old, though - good for a 20-30 year old, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>I love the complex notes, its not too sweet, warm, or musky.</li>
            <li>This is my first array into a more mature scent that is still young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a shame as I repeat the smell is soft, clean &amp; powdery just how I like it!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Colette,\\&quot; which is named for and inspired by the famous French writer and libertine, is unlike any perfume I have ever smelled before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my personal favorite of Tocca&#x27;s girls.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Make your partner feed you grapes and read some poetry by your favorite female writer.</li>
            <li>the place I first wore it).</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle.  </li>
            <li>Scent was very addicting!</li>
            <li>The only drawback is I wish it had more staying power.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was smart enough to spray the tester bottle on my skin first, and thank goodness</li>
            <li>And Cleopatra is much sweeter smelling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways.</li>
            <li>For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat Tocca for quality and style.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to know what I have on, so I tell them.</li>
            <li>Wish I could find it in stores, my first bottle was bought at a small boutique, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it since except on line at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I used to be a \\&quot;shalimar\\&quot; girl but Collette by Tocca is my new scent.</li>
            <li>My new signature fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Literally five minutes after I sprayed it on my wrist, the smell was completely gone.</li>
            <li>But beyond that, it&#x27;s a very classy, European sort of scent.</li>
            <li>My last favorite was Devine by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li>typically wear really fruity or citrus-y scents.</li>

            <li> I received a sample of this perfume, and now I have to go out and buy the full-size bottle (even though perfume is the LAST thing I need!). I absolutely love this fragrance. \\&quot;Colette,\\&quot; which is named for and inspired by the famous French writer and libertine, is unlike any perfume I have ever smelled before. Its scent is so original...very sophisticated, mysterious, and sexy. The sandalwood is pretty prominent, but the fragrance is also spicy and a bit floral. I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am switching my original five-star status to a mediocre two stars. I was so enamored with this sample fragrance that I went to Sephora today to buy a full-sized bottle. Fortunately, I was smart enough to spray the tester bottle on my skin first, and thank goodness I did. The fragrance I smelled in the store smelled NOTHING like the perfume sample I received in the mail. Also, I have never had a fragrance disappear as quickly as this one did. Literally five minutes after I sprayed it on my wrist, the smell was completely gone. I am so glad I didn&#x27;t buy it! The sample scent was great...I wish I could just buy a bunch of those instead!</li>
            <li> I used to be a \\&quot;shalimar\\&quot; girl but Collette by Tocca is my new scent. Everyone asks me what it is, the most wonderful perfume. I have allergies and many perfumes affect my allergies, but not this one. A light fruity/floral fragrance with sandlewood.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I love the complex notes, its not too sweet, warm, or musky. Overall it is the perfect blend of scents.</li>
            <li> I bought this without ever smelling it.  I love the fragrance and the bottle.  I will defiantly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Very feminine without being too strong.</li>
            <li> Smells so great! Just doesnt last long. I can tell because I don&#x27;t get a lot of compliments (ha!). But I know the fragrance smells good because I can get a whiff of it every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically wear really fruity or citrus-y scents. This is my first array into a more mature scent that is still young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally saw this fragrance at Anthropologie. I talked to the sales lady and she also mentioned the fragrances didnt last that long. And this particular scent was not their best Tocca selling smell. I just, for the life of me, can&#x27;t remember which one she suggested. I think it was the Florence one ... (edit: Cleopatra! Not Florence. Florence is a little \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; to me. And Cleopatra is much sweeter smelling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways. The purchase was still worth it though! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume I have ever worn. I prefer a light fragrance. This fragrance lasts quite a while but is not so obtrusive that it starts bothering the wearer after a while.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance.  Light, but lingers.  Wish I could find it in stores, my first bottle was bought at a small boutique, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it since except on line at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  So warm yet light.</li>
            <li> Just to add to other reviews....when I wear this scent, it is undetectable by me after awhile, but I get compliments all day about it.  When this happens it usually means the scent works well with your chemistry.  Everyone loves it on me.  It&#x27;s my personal favorite of Tocca&#x27;s girls.  Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This is my \\&quot;laying around naked and feeling fancy fragrance.\\&quot; Make your partner feed you grapes and read some poetry by your favorite female writer. It will make you feel like a queen.</li>
            <li> Mild scent. Wish it would be stronger.</li>
            <li> This is a birthday present for our daughter.  A requested present.  Knowing our daughter, this perfume is a good one.</li>
            <li> Love this scent... Always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in our area.  BUT, Amazon has it.  This perfume is amazing on my wife.  Wherever we go, people ask what perfume are you wearing?  We tell them and where to get it.  They also make a body cream if the same fragrance and my wife says it works to sooth her hands.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance .................Love it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it reminds me of being in Paris (the place I first wore it). But beyond that, it&#x27;s a very classy, European sort of scent. Not too old, though - good for a 20-30 year old, I&#x27;d say. For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat Tocca for quality and style.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume EVER.  It&#x27;s so light and fresh smelling.  I LOVE IT. It Reminds me of summer</li>
            <li> My new signature fragrance.  What I love the most about this scent is that it dries to a soft powdery scent.  Some say that they can&#x27;t smell it after applying it but that&#x27;s okay becasue others can smell it on you.  I&#x27;ve recieved a ton of compliments since wearing this.  Will definetly be coming back to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> Fast service &amp; love love love this perfume. My very favorite perfume. I get lots of complements when I wear this perfume. Everyone wants to know what I have on, so I tell them.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.  Nicely packaged.  Pretty bottle.  I bit overpriced.  Bought as a xmas gift.  I would recommend as well as the other Tocca fragrances.  Sephora Stores have as well but Amazon price was a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I smelled sample in store, I will buy it as soon as I can! Scent was very addicting! My last favorite was Devine by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite fragrance. I wear it year round. It is light and is truly the scent of a woman! The only drawback is I wish it had more staying power.</li>
            <li> The packaging and bottle is without a doubt beautiful &amp; I absolutely love the smell of this perfume .... UNFORTUNATELY after just 30 minutes you can&#x27;t smell it anymore. You would need to carry this bottle around and reapply the entire day to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;What a shame as I repeat the smell is soft, clean &amp; powdery just how I like it!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance !!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I found that if I spray it on my clothes, it lasts days and days!</li>
