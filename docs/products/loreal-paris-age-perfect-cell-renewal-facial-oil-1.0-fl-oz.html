    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product!!!</li>
            <li>And great price!!</li>
            <li>and this works perfectly for my face.</li>
            <li>wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this is best for &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; faces?  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!!</li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so good, and the scent is heavenly!</li>
            <li>I had sampled Lancôme&#x27;s oil and it worked beautifully on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Not so beautifully, though, to justify the $80+ price tag.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been really happy with every product in this skin care line.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have no idea how it would fair on another skin type.</li>
            <li>, though, I can’t say that I’ve noticed that it’s had any kind of great impact on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t want to put anything on my face that doesn&#x27;t smell good to me , so  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly light/dry for an oil...</li>
            <li>will also say, as others have, that the scent of this is fairly off-putting.</li>
            <li>It does fade to a more pleasant, somewhat earthy odor, after some time, but I have a great collection of niche fragrances</li>
            <li>Have been using it for a week and love it!</li>
            <li>The oils absorbs nicely into the skin and spreads well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped even out my skin tone and diminish redness, and it has a really nice citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I really liked the smell until I read the reviews here and realized</li>
            <li>Even in my own serum, I mask the stronger smelling ingredients with rose otto, neroili, jasmine, sandalwood and frankincense oils and the like.</li>
            <li>I guess that this is the real test of how impressed I am with it!</li>
            <li>and I did put some on my husband to see if he liked it</li>
            <li>Wonderful light oil to renew cells, that refreshes skin, and seems to get absorbed immediately into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this oil &amp; when it showed up I loved the look &amp; feel of the bottle it comes in</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of a very light incense</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been able to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give me a more youthful appearance by any stretch of the imagination.  </li>
            <li>I regularly use the age perfect glow oil and love everything about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but it lingers.</li>
            <li>It smells overwhelmingly of cloves, with an undertone of citronella.</li>
            <li>I really do love the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of oils and love them</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&amp;#34;  I am so glad that I bought it for about $9, otherwise, I would be furious.  </li>
            <li>love the way my complexion looks.</li>
            <li>The ones I was able to research seem to be regarded generally as safe.</li>
            <li>Age Perfect is not something she will wish to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>a man, the scent was a bit &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; - although not flowery or overly precious.</li>
            <li>And this is comparing this oil to a lifetime of moisturizer use, including brands much more costly than this one (L&#x27;Occitane).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Since rosehip and jojoba are both fairly pricey oils, I would assume that most of what you are putting on your skin is the first three ingredients.</li>
            <li>It provides great moisture, my skin felt &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; and firmer after about 3 weeks, and with a bit of something on top to balance a little shine, it&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li>Applying it to her face was satisfying and easy, and there is no oily or greasy</li>
            <li>This did not make my throat or face feel good, and I really can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>it can easily be found on Amazon and at Target.)</li>
            <li>she said when she apply it her ayes burns, I also when I used it notice that also, it smells strongly like &amp;#34;Ginger&amp;#34; which I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it is *strong*</li>
            <li>but there is a really strong herbal smell.  </li>
            <li>but so strong that I couldn&#x27;t imagine putting it on my face</li>
            <li>It might work well, but the odor was so strong &amp; it literally turned my stomach &amp; made me feel quite nauseous when it was just on my hand.</li>
            <li>I recognize that my experience is subjective and that it may be fine for the skin of others, but it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be going back to the great smelling &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was a great deal and because L&#x27;Oreal owns Lancôme cosmetics and their products are very similar.  </li>
            <li>The scent is problematic for me, primarily because of the citronelle (think mosquito candles).</li>
            <li>Wonderfully light, doesnt leave a greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t recommend this because of the bizarre fragrance.</li>
            <li>However, this is a gentle soothing oil that would do good for more normal skin types.</li>
            <li>Originally, we ordered this on a whim, why not try it out?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>(Organic rosehip, argan, tamanu, pomegranate seed oils and aromatherapy grade essential oils are pricey but worth it for the results I have experienced.)</li>
            <li>L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is lightweight and perfect for my oily, yet extremely sensitive, skin.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is very nice; I&#x27;d love to find a source for the heavy glass dropper bottle.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this and would most certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>At this point, I’ve been using it daily for probably three weeks, and although I’m not exactly super impressed with it right now, I will keep using it in the hopes that I start to see better, more noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>This may work just as well but minus the great scent.</li>
            <li>Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Oil is a combination of light oils for your facial skin.</li>
            <li>After almost 4 weeks my bottle is still 4/5ths full.  </li>
            <li>Just wanted to add that to be fair as what it could do to different people.</li>
            <li>It is pleasant but for someone with sensitive skin, it can be a bit much.</li>
            <li>This is a very light oil that soaks in immediately and leave the skin feeling much more moisturized than regular lotion.</li>
            <li>and I didn’t want to give up on it too quickly, so I amended my usage of it.  </li>
            <li>But it fades quickly and is lighter than citronella.</li>
            <li>The box also declares it suitable for sensitive skin, again I agree, it didn&#x27;t give me any burning or redness issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a light, pleasant, slightly citrusy/floral fragrance to it.  </li>
            <li>probably wouldn&#x27;t use this year-round, but for winters - especially here in New England - it&#x27;s a great addition to my routine.</li>
            <li>People with dry skin may want something heavier, but L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Very light weight oil to make your skin baby soft</li>
            <li>Very light that absorbs very easily, even into my slightly oily skin.  </li>
            <li>We got this on a free trial, however she is currently saying we will have to buy more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li>What bothered me most about this product was the scent - it reminded me considerably of lemon pledge.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and it does look better.</li>
            <li>Adding an additional step to keep my 50 year old complexion looking healthy.</li>
            <li>However, I wear foundation rarely.  </li>
            <li>I put the oil on, it (literally) gets absorbed in seconds.</li>
            <li>Perhaps after some more time has passed, I’ll be as pleased with it as some of the other reviewers are, but right now, it’s not something</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say it won&#x27;t for other skin types (I am also fair skinned - Irish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I agree, it did soak right in without leaving any oily feeling residue.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes even when applied closely to them and leaves behind a very light, pleasant, smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I think just using regular olive oil would moisturize  better and be more natural.</li>
            <li>I was interested to try this product because I have been making my own rosehip seed oil-based facial serum for many years and can attest to the benefits of my own concoction, at least.</li>
            <li>I find, now that I’m forty, my skin could use a little extra help to look its best.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so soft and so smooth.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If they made an unscented version, I would be willing to try it again at a higher concentration.</li>
            <li>I first began using this oil, I followed the directions to the letter.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and I use Neutrogena face wipes first to remove any dirt beforehand.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin and some allergies, so maybe this is just not right for me but may be good for others.</li>
            <li>This is alightweight, easily absorbed oil that would be good for those who have dry, mature skin that can benefit from a little boost, and don&#x27;t mind a somewhat strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing effect of this product was fairly light and it made my skin feel softer and smoother for a short time.  </li>
            <li>I didnt see so much diffrent.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Mornings after washing or showering I apply 2 to 5 drops of oil on my skin and allow it to absorb before using a light facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>I am giving this skin care product a real workout.</li>
            <li>While it goes on smooth and it could be added to your regular routine products, I noticed that it seemed to increase my hyper pigmentation a bit.</li>
            <li>What I love the most is the scent - a surprisingly complex and natural scent.</li>
            <li>The essential oils used are good for skincare and are interspersed with other ingredients like corn oil and capryloyl salicylic acid (which probably helps keep acne at bay).</li>
            <li>but this was not natural though many of the ingredients in the oil appear to be of natural origin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a very light oil: it doesn’t leave behind any kind of greasiness whatsoever; in fact, shortly after it’s applied, one could almost forget it’s there…</li>
            <li>I like to layer this by applying it first right when I get out of the shower or wash my face while it is still a bit damp and then apply my regular moisturizer after about 15 minutes of letting the oil soak in.  </li>
            <li>The high notes of lemon and citronella combine with the other oil scents make this product smell more like furniture polish than a face product.</li>
            <li>The scent has a life of its own: you don&#x27;t smell it as much in the bottle, when you apply it the warmth of your skin intensifies it for a little while, then it seems to fade away completely.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t test it over time to see if there is a long range benefit as it just does not agree with me and frankly also seems too watery and cheap to warrant the price point of 20 bucks.</li>
            <li>Well, my wife loves it -- she surprised her herself with how much she loves it!  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t care less; but now that I&#x27;m home, and feeling much better</li>
            <li>Before I get into the main pros and cons of this product, I have to mention the fragrance…..</li>
            <li>The amazon label obscured most of the last ingredients and removed the ink when I peeled it back to read.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a week&#x27;s use, I haven&#x27;t notice any significant changes to my skin for better or worse.</li>
            <li>It is light, absorbs easily, and you only need a few drops.  </li>
            <li>The smell is herbaceous and floral, with (somehow) more than a little whiff of Lemon Pledge added into the mix.  </li>
            <li>It was also light enough that it wasn&#x27;t an issue, and after a few days it just smelled light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The package says it&#x27;s suitable for oily skin, but I&#x27;m not sure why one would need it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak to the \\&quot;cell renewal\\&quot; marketing angle, but as a moisturizer this is now her new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally use an oil from another brand and decided to test this one to compare since this one is significantly cheaper than the other one I use.</li>
            <li>It has a light dry feel that is characteristic of the esters listed first.</li>
            <li>Once at that price point I would rather pay double and get a higher quality serum.</li>
            <li>(And a much better price than other face oils with similar ingredients and claims.)</li>
            <li>She has also used many other higher-end moisturizers, French and Korean, which have worked well too.  </li>
            <li>I super dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like watered down oil rather than a thicker, richer oil based serum that you can nicely smooth evenly over your face.</li>
            <li>At 5 drops, it leaves a relatively non-greasy feeling (but glasses still slip down the nose)and does a good job of relieving dry skin \\&quot;tension\\&quot;  around the face.  </li>
            <li>I have no particular sensitivity to fragrance, but this has such a strong furniture polish-icky herb scent as to be unbearable.  </li>
            <li>I use it under moisturizer, and if I do use foundation I only use it selectively on certain spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin care system rotates from Aveda to one I received through Vine and thus far...</li>
            <li>She has just used it once so far.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, you may want to try something else.</li>
            <li>All of those who are sensitive to fragrance will want to steer clear of this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant to give this a try because I do have exceedingly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely order this again, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is such a product, perhaps to work real miracles</li>
            <li>any help is appreciated, especially when it&#x27;s a pleasure to apply!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, it is enough to cover her whole face and front of her neck and lasts ~9 hours.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using oils on my skin because of how dry and sensitive it&#x27;s been for awhile, but this is the first one that I can put make-up over without it being too greasy.</li>
            <li>There are other products that cost about the same as this (regular price) but work so much better.</li>
            <li>Just put a few drops in your hand (careful, it drips), and the lightweight oil absorbs right away when you use the full palms of your hands.  </li>
            <li>Those -- along with a higher proportion of oils like rosehip, argan, tamanu over the coconut oils esters, would make this serum much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I am 60 and looks like I am just starting to look older, so</li>
            <li>skin did seem a little smoother but with my dry skin I prefer a more aggressively moisturizing serum.</li>
            <li>On a 70+ year old woman it accomplishes little other than making her skin feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I dab a few drops around key areas around my face and next, then smooth with my palms .</li>
            <li>I will not be trying this item in the future and cannot recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>for the effects of the oil, some of the other reviewers have noted that this has really benefitted them.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li>Those who are not typically bothered by such things may still want to approach this with caution because it’s definitely an aroma that will hit you over the head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain how, exactly; it&#x27;s not just something I enjoyed the lingering smell of all day.</li>
            <li>It just sits on top of my skin, has done nothing to change the look or texture of my skin (and I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle) and it stinks to high heaven.  </li>
            <li>My skin certainly doesn&#x27;t feel as tight.  </li>
            <li>Makeup glides on, and all the dry flaking patches near my hairline are gone.  </li>
            <li>I do not consider myself someone with sensitive skin, but this oil tended to irritate by dry face (made dryer by winter, of course).</li>
            <li>I’m always slightly reluctant to try new facial care products because harsh ones tend to irritate my skin, but L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is gentle enough for even my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But alas, it has not turned back the hands of time and removed fine lines.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really do love the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of oils and love them</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll give it a try.&amp;#34;  I am so glad that I bought it for about $9, otherwise, I would be furious.  </li>
            <li> love the way my complexion looks.</li>
            <li> The ones I was able to research seem to be regarded generally as safe.</li>
            <li> Age Perfect is not something she will wish to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> a man, the scent was a bit &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; - although not flowery or overly precious.</li>
            <li> And this is comparing this oil to a lifetime of moisturizer use, including brands much more costly than this one (L&#x27;Occitane).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Since rosehip and jojoba are both fairly pricey oils, I would assume that most of what you are putting on your skin is the first three ingredients.</li>
            <li> It provides great moisture, my skin felt &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; and firmer after about 3 weeks, and with a bit of something on top to balance a little shine, it&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li> Applying it to her face was satisfying and easy, and there is no oily or greasy</li>
            <li> This did not make my throat or face feel good, and I really can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> it can easily be found on Amazon and at Target.)</li>
            <li> she said when she apply it her ayes burns, I also when I used it notice that also, it smells strongly like &amp;#34;Ginger&amp;#34; which I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it is *strong*</li>
            <li> but there is a really strong herbal smell.  </li>
            <li> but so strong that I couldn&#x27;t imagine putting it on my face</li>
            <li> It might work well, but the odor was so strong &amp; it literally turned my stomach &amp; made me feel quite nauseous when it was just on my hand.</li>
            <li> I recognize that my experience is subjective and that it may be fine for the skin of others, but it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be going back to the great smelling &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was a great deal and because L&#x27;Oreal owns Lancôme cosmetics and their products are very similar.  </li>
            <li> The scent is problematic for me, primarily because of the citronelle (think mosquito candles).</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light, doesnt leave a greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend this because of the bizarre fragrance.</li>
            <li> However, this is a gentle soothing oil that would do good for more normal skin types.</li>
            <li> Originally, we ordered this on a whim, why not try it out?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> (Organic rosehip, argan, tamanu, pomegranate seed oils and aromatherapy grade essential oils are pricey but worth it for the results I have experienced.)</li>
            <li> L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is lightweight and perfect for my oily, yet extremely sensitive, skin.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is very nice; I&#x27;d love to find a source for the heavy glass dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this and would most certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> At this point, I’ve been using it daily for probably three weeks, and although I’m not exactly super impressed with it right now, I will keep using it in the hopes that I start to see better, more noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> This may work just as well but minus the great scent.</li>
            <li> Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Oil is a combination of light oils for your facial skin.</li>
            <li> After almost 4 weeks my bottle is still 4/5ths full.  </li>
            <li> Just wanted to add that to be fair as what it could do to different people.</li>
            <li> It is pleasant but for someone with sensitive skin, it can be a bit much.</li>
            <li> This is a very light oil that soaks in immediately and leave the skin feeling much more moisturized than regular lotion.</li>
            <li> and I didn’t want to give up on it too quickly, so I amended my usage of it.  </li>
            <li> But it fades quickly and is lighter than citronella.</li>
            <li> The box also declares it suitable for sensitive skin, again I agree, it didn&#x27;t give me any burning or redness issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has a light, pleasant, slightly citrusy/floral fragrance to it.  </li>
            <li> probably wouldn&#x27;t use this year-round, but for winters - especially here in New England - it&#x27;s a great addition to my routine.</li>
            <li> People with dry skin may want something heavier, but L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Very light weight oil to make your skin baby soft</li>
            <li> Very light that absorbs very easily, even into my slightly oily skin.  </li>
            <li> We got this on a free trial, however she is currently saying we will have to buy more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> What bothered me most about this product was the scent - it reminded me considerably of lemon pledge.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and it does look better.</li>
            <li> Adding an additional step to keep my 50 year old complexion looking healthy.</li>
            <li> However, I wear foundation rarely.  </li>
            <li> I put the oil on, it (literally) gets absorbed in seconds.</li>
            <li> Perhaps after some more time has passed, I’ll be as pleased with it as some of the other reviewers are, but right now, it’s not something</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say it won&#x27;t for other skin types (I am also fair skinned - Irish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I agree, it did soak right in without leaving any oily feeling residue.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes even when applied closely to them and leaves behind a very light, pleasant, smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, I think just using regular olive oil would moisturize  better and be more natural.</li>
            <li> I was interested to try this product because I have been making my own rosehip seed oil-based facial serum for many years and can attest to the benefits of my own concoction, at least.</li>
            <li> I find, now that I’m forty, my skin could use a little extra help to look its best.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so soft and so smooth.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> If they made an unscented version, I would be willing to try it again at a higher concentration.</li>
            <li> I first began using this oil, I followed the directions to the letter.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and I use Neutrogena face wipes first to remove any dirt beforehand.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin and some allergies, so maybe this is just not right for me but may be good for others.</li>
            <li> This is alightweight, easily absorbed oil that would be good for those who have dry, mature skin that can benefit from a little boost, and don&#x27;t mind a somewhat strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effect of this product was fairly light and it made my skin feel softer and smoother for a short time.  </li>
            <li> I didnt see so much diffrent.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Mornings after washing or showering I apply 2 to 5 drops of oil on my skin and allow it to absorb before using a light facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> I am giving this skin care product a real workout.</li>
            <li> While it goes on smooth and it could be added to your regular routine products, I noticed that it seemed to increase my hyper pigmentation a bit.</li>
            <li> What I love the most is the scent - a surprisingly complex and natural scent.</li>
            <li> The essential oils used are good for skincare and are interspersed with other ingredients like corn oil and capryloyl salicylic acid (which probably helps keep acne at bay).</li>
            <li> but this was not natural though many of the ingredients in the oil appear to be of natural origin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very light oil: it doesn’t leave behind any kind of greasiness whatsoever; in fact, shortly after it’s applied, one could almost forget it’s there…</li>
            <li> I like to layer this by applying it first right when I get out of the shower or wash my face while it is still a bit damp and then apply my regular moisturizer after about 15 minutes of letting the oil soak in.  </li>
            <li> The high notes of lemon and citronella combine with the other oil scents make this product smell more like furniture polish than a face product.</li>
            <li> The scent has a life of its own: you don&#x27;t smell it as much in the bottle, when you apply it the warmth of your skin intensifies it for a little while, then it seems to fade away completely.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t test it over time to see if there is a long range benefit as it just does not agree with me and frankly also seems too watery and cheap to warrant the price point of 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> Well, my wife loves it -- she surprised her herself with how much she loves it!  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t care less; but now that I&#x27;m home, and feeling much better</li>
            <li> Before I get into the main pros and cons of this product, I have to mention the fragrance…..</li>
            <li> The amazon label obscured most of the last ingredients and removed the ink when I peeled it back to read.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week&#x27;s use, I haven&#x27;t notice any significant changes to my skin for better or worse.</li>
            <li> It is light, absorbs easily, and you only need a few drops.  </li>
            <li> The smell is herbaceous and floral, with (somehow) more than a little whiff of Lemon Pledge added into the mix.  </li>
            <li> It was also light enough that it wasn&#x27;t an issue, and after a few days it just smelled light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The package says it&#x27;s suitable for oily skin, but I&#x27;m not sure why one would need it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to the \\&quot;cell renewal\\&quot; marketing angle, but as a moisturizer this is now her new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use an oil from another brand and decided to test this one to compare since this one is significantly cheaper than the other one I use.</li>
            <li> It has a light dry feel that is characteristic of the esters listed first.</li>
            <li> Once at that price point I would rather pay double and get a higher quality serum.</li>
            <li> (And a much better price than other face oils with similar ingredients and claims.)</li>
            <li> She has also used many other higher-end moisturizers, French and Korean, which have worked well too.  </li>
            <li> I super dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like watered down oil rather than a thicker, richer oil based serum that you can nicely smooth evenly over your face.</li>
            <li> At 5 drops, it leaves a relatively non-greasy feeling (but glasses still slip down the nose)and does a good job of relieving dry skin \\&quot;tension\\&quot;  around the face.  </li>
            <li> I have no particular sensitivity to fragrance, but this has such a strong furniture polish-icky herb scent as to be unbearable.  </li>
            <li> I use it under moisturizer, and if I do use foundation I only use it selectively on certain spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin care system rotates from Aveda to one I received through Vine and thus far...</li>
            <li> She has just used it once so far.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you may want to try something else.</li>
            <li> All of those who are sensitive to fragrance will want to steer clear of this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant to give this a try because I do have exceedingly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely order this again, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is such a product, perhaps to work real miracles</li>
            <li> any help is appreciated, especially when it&#x27;s a pleasure to apply!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> , it is enough to cover her whole face and front of her neck and lasts ~9 hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using oils on my skin because of how dry and sensitive it&#x27;s been for awhile, but this is the first one that I can put make-up over without it being too greasy.</li>
            <li> There are other products that cost about the same as this (regular price) but work so much better.</li>
            <li> Just put a few drops in your hand (careful, it drips), and the lightweight oil absorbs right away when you use the full palms of your hands.  </li>
            <li> Those -- along with a higher proportion of oils like rosehip, argan, tamanu over the coconut oils esters, would make this serum much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I am 60 and looks like I am just starting to look older, so</li>
            <li> skin did seem a little smoother but with my dry skin I prefer a more aggressively moisturizing serum.</li>
            <li> On a 70+ year old woman it accomplishes little other than making her skin feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I dab a few drops around key areas around my face and next, then smooth with my palms .</li>
            <li> I will not be trying this item in the future and cannot recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> for the effects of the oil, some of the other reviewers have noted that this has really benefitted them.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li> Those who are not typically bothered by such things may still want to approach this with caution because it’s definitely an aroma that will hit you over the head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain how, exactly; it&#x27;s not just something I enjoyed the lingering smell of all day.</li>
            <li> It just sits on top of my skin, has done nothing to change the look or texture of my skin (and I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle) and it stinks to high heaven.  </li>
            <li> My skin certainly doesn&#x27;t feel as tight.  </li>
            <li> Makeup glides on, and all the dry flaking patches near my hairline are gone.  </li>
            <li> I do not consider myself someone with sensitive skin, but this oil tended to irritate by dry face (made dryer by winter, of course).</li>
            <li> I’m always slightly reluctant to try new facial care products because harsh ones tend to irritate my skin, but L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is gentle enough for even my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But alas, it has not turned back the hands of time and removed fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Diluting the product with those other oils has lessened the breakouts considerably, and it also manages to disguise that cloying scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a major make-up queen</li>
            <li> Needless to say I panicked, so my recommendation is that if you have a good beauty routine and delicate skin sort of be cautious when adding this oil.</li>
            <li> This is a thin oil that absorbs fairly well, but leaves a softness behind.</li>
            <li> I found that I can’t use it twice a day, nor can I apply it by itself to my face, so I mix several drops with a few other oils that seem to not negatively impact my skin – namely tamanu, hazelnut, and jojoba.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves L&#x27;Oreal products and though she feels as if she needs to wait a month of using it to make a firm review, she likes it so far.  </li>
            <li> It lingers, too, for a long while.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that the first three ingredients are chemically based, but at least they are generally recognized as safe.</li>
            <li> yes, it says that on the packaging, but who could believe that an oil isn&#x27;t, well, &amp;#34;oily.&amp;#34;  Yes, it does leave a bit of shine behind if you use it on your t-zone and don&#x27;t put anything on top (powder, mattifying lotion, etc.), but it&#x27;s not an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; results claimed on the L&#x27;Oreal product are not there, and for the cost of the skin care there are many less expensive alternatives.  </li>
            <li> My daughter tried it on dry skin on her arms but said she didn&#x27;t think she couldn&#x27;t handle putting the scent on her face either.</li>
            <li> -- many of my friends are getting some very expensive laser treatment that removes the outer layer of skin or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fourth and fifth ingredients are rosehip oil and jojoba oil, followed by essential oils, and then a few other ingredients and chemicals.</li>
            <li> After a few days, though, I started noticing a few breakouts – nothing major, but enough to get my attention.  </li>
            <li> in all, for me, the few benefits don’t outweigh either the very strong, largely unpleasant scent, or the fact that applying it undiluted to my face results in breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I do care that my skin feels so dry and tight and strangely</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways, so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning I notice a softness that wasn&#x27;t there before and that none of the other products I had tried gave me (Clinique, Elizabeth Arden, etc.), but I still have a way to</li>
            <li> go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a hard-to-describe scent that is neither appealing nor annoying.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy - use sparingly.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid putting oil on my already somewhat oily skin would have disastrous results, but L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is lightweight enough that just a few drops absorbed into my skin leaving it feeling hydrated without any greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> However, I did not care for the fragrance which is heavily herbal (to me it smelled like thyme) and consequently I would not it purchase again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.  </li>
            <li> Not great on dry skin at all.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my mom, but she tried it several time and sadly she didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Wait at least 10 minutes before you apply any foundation since it will take a bit longer for your moisturizer to soak in.  </li>
            <li> While in the hospital, my face was the least of my worries</li>
            <li> This was disappointing, but I can&#x27;t condone using a product that makes my face red.</li>
            <li> It has an extremely faint slightly astringent floral scent, but I have to almost stick the bottle in my nose to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is because my skin is in such bad shape or if it&#x27;s fast-absorbing for everyone.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it isn&#x27;t overly expensive and the bottle is rather generous.  </li>
            <li> but this one is useless.  </li>
            <li> Not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was in the hospital for 16 days feeling awful and totally abandoned my skin care routine</li>
            <li> Geez, it stinks.  </li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal serum does not specify that the oils used are organic or cold pressed.</li>
            <li> Also, it created a stinging sensation on my face that I found unpleasant and my response was to immediately wash it off.</li>
            <li> I also hate the texture</li>
            <li> It reminds me of some sort of insect repellent.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!!! And great price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan. After cleansing my face, I opened the bottle and applied about 5 drops to my face and my immediate reaction was to cough as it made me choke from the scent. Also, it created a stinging sensation on my face that I found unpleasant and my response was to immediately wash it off. I also hate the texture, it&#x27;s like watered down oil rather than a thicker, richer oil based serum that you can nicely smooth evenly over your face. I do have sensitive skin and some allergies, so maybe this is just not right for me but may be good for others. I can&#x27;t test it over time to see if there is a long range benefit as it just does not agree with me and frankly also seems too watery and cheap to warrant the price point of 20 bucks. Once at that price point I would rather pay double and get a higher quality serum. In fact, I think just using regular olive oil would moisturize  better and be more natural. This did not make my throat or face feel good, and I really can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave an oily residue on the skin and did not burn my eyes unlike another face oil I tried. However, I did not care for the fragrance which is heavily herbal (to me it smelled like thyme) and consequently I would not it purchase again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves L&#x27;Oreal products and though she feels as if she needs to wait a month of using it to make a firm review, she likes it so far.  She uses it on her neck.  She likes the fact it melts into the skin and leaves no greasy feel.  She likes the scent.  She&#x27;s been using it a week and claims she can see a difference in the texture and tone of her skin.  We got this on a free trial, however she is currently saying we will have to buy more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Oil is a combination of light oils for your facial skin. My skin absorbs it well without feeling like it&#x27;s laden with oil. I dab a few drops around key areas around my face and next, then smooth with my palms . (The instructions state to avoid using around the eye area.) The oils absorbs nicely into the skin and spreads well. I then follow up with a day time or night time lotion, then makeup after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that will immediately take notice by anyone is the scent. The high notes of lemon and citronella combine with the other oil scents make this product smell more like furniture polish than a face product. It lingers, too, for a long while. There are times I can ignore it, others I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week&#x27;s use, I haven&#x27;t notice any significant changes to my skin for better or worse. I will update at a later time if I do.</li>
            <li> Very light that absorbs very easily, even into my slightly oily skin.  The smell reminds me of a very light incense so I&#x27;ve been able to get used to it.  My skin care system rotates from Aveda to one I received through Vine and thus far...no clashing.  I&#x27;m not a major make-up queen so I don&#x27;t have anything extra to cause oils.  I like the fact that it isn&#x27;t overly expensive and the bottle is rather generous.  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I loved it! It makes my face feel so soft and so smooth. Although I have been using it a short time, I can tell a difference in the lines beside my eyes. I&#x27;m going to keep using and see what else this stuff can do!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife to try out. She has just used it once so far. No issues with the product then. We will have to wait and see a bit before reporting back on how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price of about $20 for one fluid ounce seems to be in line with similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Just what I wanted without looking all over for it. Thanks! Julie</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effect of this product was fairly light and it made my skin feel softer and smoother for a short time.  It didn&#x27;t give me a more youthful appearance by any stretch of the imagination.  Perhaps I need a stronger oil though that would probably cause me to break out.  What bothered me most about this product was the scent - it reminded me considerably of lemon pledge.  I like lemon type scents but this was not natural though many of the ingredients in the oil appear to be of natural origin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the fragrance, I would probably not purchase this in the future.  If they made an unscented version, I would be willing to try it again at a higher concentration.</li>
            <li> Maybe, I hope, my wrinkles are &amp;#34;slowly&amp;#34; fading somewhat. Using this just about every morning and night. Makes my skin so soft and it does look better.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my mom, but she tried it several time and sadly she didn&#x27;t like it. she said when she apply it her ayes burns, I also when I used it notice that also, it smells strongly like &amp;#34;Ginger&amp;#34; which I don&#x27;t like it. I use it for like tow weeks I didnt see so much diffrent.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you may want to try something else. After using for only two days this product had my face breaking out. I will not be trying this item in the future and cannot recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin. I have no idea how it would fair on another skin type.</li>
            <li> Before I get into the main pros and cons of this product, I have to mention the fragrance…..which is, actually, one of the biggest cons.  The smell is herbaceous and floral, with (somehow) more than a little whiff of Lemon Pledge added into the mix.  Additionally, it is *strong* and it stays with you.  All of those who are sensitive to fragrance will want to steer clear of this product.  Those who are not typically bothered by such things may still want to approach this with caution because it’s definitely an aroma that will hit you over the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to give this a try because I do have exceedingly sensitive skin.  However, I’ve recently begun incorporating various facial oils into my skincare routine and I’d had some luck with that, so I decided to take a chance on this product.  It is a very light oil: it doesn’t leave behind any kind of greasiness whatsoever; in fact, shortly after it’s applied, one could almost forget it’s there….except for the fragrance, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first began using this oil, I followed the directions to the letter.  After a few days, though, I started noticing a few breakouts – nothing major, but enough to get my attention.  I wanted to give the product a chance to work and I didn’t want to give up on it too quickly, so I amended my usage of it.  I found that I can’t use it twice a day, nor can I apply it by itself to my face, so I mix several drops with a few other oils that seem to not negatively impact my skin – namely tamanu, hazelnut, and jojoba.  Diluting the product with those other oils has lessened the breakouts considerably, and it also manages to disguise that cloying scent somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the effects of the oil, some of the other reviewers have noted that this has really benefitted them. I have noticed that it leaves my skin a bit softer and I think it’s lessened some of the redness in my complexion.  Other than that, though, I can’t say that I’ve noticed that it’s had any kind of great impact on my skin.  It could be that this is a product that some people have to use for an extended period of time in order to see a lot of the benefits.  At this point, I’ve been using it daily for probably three weeks, and although I’m not exactly super impressed with it right now, I will keep using it in the hopes that I start to see better, more noticeable results.  (If that happens, I’ll update this review to reflect that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for me, the few benefits don’t outweigh either the very strong, largely unpleasant scent, or the fact that applying it undiluted to my face results in breakouts.  Perhaps after some more time has passed, I’ll be as pleased with it as some of the other reviewers are, but right now, it’s not something I’d encourage people to go out of their way to purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  It is a little greasy - use sparingly.  Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  I would recommend this and would most certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Changes the texture of my skin after a while of usage. Will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I regularly use the age perfect glow oil and love everything about it. What I love the most is the scent - a surprisingly complex and natural scent. This may work just as well but minus the great scent. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it lingers. It smells overwhelmingly of cloves, with an undertone of citronella. I just don&#x27;t want to put anything on my face that doesn&#x27;t smell good to me , so  I cant speak to the efficacy. I&#x27;ll be going back to the great smelling &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris skin care was tested on oily/normal skin, according to the box. The directions say to dab four to five drops in the morning and night under your moisturizer. It claims to be non greasy and I agree, it did soak right in without leaving any oily feeling residue. The box also declares it suitable for sensitive skin, again I agree, it didn&#x27;t give me any burning or redness issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Oreal has a blend of oils including Argan seed, chamomile, citronella, clove, lavender, lemongrass, oregano, rosemary, lemon balm and evening primrose. It has an extremely faint slightly astringent floral scent, but I have to almost stick the bottle in my nose to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin did seem a little smoother but with my dry skin I prefer a more aggressively moisturizing serum. However, this is a gentle soothing oil that would do good for more normal skin types.</li>
            <li> I super dry and sensitive skin and I have been looking for an argon based oil since trying it at a cosmetic counter. This is a very light oil that soaks in immediately and leave the skin feeling much more moisturized than regular lotion. I like to layer this by applying it first right when I get out of the shower or wash my face while it is still a bit damp and then apply my regular moisturizer after about 15 minutes of letting the oil soak in.  Wait at least 10 minutes before you apply any foundation since it will take a bit longer for your moisturizer to soak in.  I would have given this 5 stars but there is a really strong herbal smell.  It is pleasant but for someone with sensitive skin, it can be a bit much. I really do love the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I&#x27;ve been using oils on my skin because of how dry and sensitive it&#x27;s been for awhile, but this is the first one that I can put make-up over without it being too greasy. I have very sensitive, dry skin and this works perfectly for my face. It&#x27;s helped even out my skin tone and diminish redness, and it has a really nice citrus smell. I would definitely order this again, and highly recommend it! I&#x27;ve also been really happy with every product in this skin care line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several weeks now, twice a day.  I use it under my regular moisturizer.  It is light, absorbs easily, and you only need a few drops.  After almost 4 weeks my bottle is still 4/5ths full.  And it definitely has made my skin softer and smoother.  My skin certainly doesn&#x27;t feel as tight.  I really like it.  But alas, it has not turned back the hands of time and removed fine lines.  I don&#x27;t know if there is such a product, perhaps to work real miracles one has to go to a dermatologist for treatment -- many of my friends are getting some very expensive laser treatment that removes the outer layer of skin or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really liked the smell until I read the reviews here and realized yes, it does have a citronella related scent.  But it fades quickly and is lighter than citronella.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of oils and love them but this one is useless.  I purchased this because it was a great deal and because L&#x27;Oreal owns Lancôme cosmetics and their products are very similar.  I had sampled Lancôme&#x27;s oil and it worked beautifully on my skin.  Not so beautifully, though, to justify the $80+ price tag.  So when I saw this I thought, &amp;#34;hm, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&amp;#34;  I am so glad that I bought it for about $9, otherwise, I would be furious.  It just sits on top of my skin, has done nothing to change the look or texture of my skin (and I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle) and it stinks to high heaven.  Geez, it stinks.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.  There are other products that cost about the same as this (regular price) but work so much better.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a week and love it! It&#x27;s super light and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer.  A little bit goes a long ways, so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Not great on dry skin at all.</li>
            <li> To protect my skin against dehydration. Adding an additional step to keep my 50 year old complexion looking healthy. Using this twice a day, morning and evening. I wash my face, and before I use a day lotion or night cream I use this (have been using for over a month now), then apply lotion or cream. I never had oily skin even as a teenager. The oil has not caused me to break out but I can&#x27;t say it won&#x27;t for other skin types (I am also fair skinned - Irish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mornings after washing or showering I apply 2 to 5 drops of oil on my skin and allow it to absorb before using a light facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening after removing makeup, I place 4 or 5 drops in my palm, rub my hands together and spread the oil on my forehead, cheeks and neck, then apply night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my complexion looks.</li>
            <li> I was interested to try this product because I have been making my own rosehip seed oil-based facial serum for many years and can attest to the benefits of my own concoction, at least. (Organic rosehip, argan, tamanu, pomegranate seed oils and aromatherapy grade essential oils are pricey but worth it for the results I have experienced.) The L&#x27;Oreal serum does not specify that the oils used are organic or cold pressed. The packaging is very nice; I&#x27;d love to find a source for the heavy glass dropper bottle. I was disappointed to see that the first three ingredients are chemically based, but at least they are generally recognized as safe. They include Caprylic Capric Triglycerides, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, and Isononyl Isononoate. The fourth and fifth ingredients are rosehip oil and jojoba oil, followed by essential oils, and then a few other ingredients and chemicals. The amazon label obscured most of the last ingredients and removed the ink when I peeled it back to read. The ones I was able to research seem to be regarded generally as safe. Since rosehip and jojoba are both fairly pricey oils, I would assume that most of what you are putting on your skin is the first three ingredients. It has a light dry feel that is characteristic of the esters listed first. The essential oils used are good for skincare and are interspersed with other ingredients like corn oil and capryloyl salicylic acid (which probably helps keep acne at bay). The scent is problematic for me, primarily because of the citronelle (think mosquito candles). It does fade to a more pleasant, somewhat earthy odor, after some time, but I have a great collection of niche fragrances and I prefer to scent myself. Even in my own serum, I mask the stronger smelling ingredients with rose otto, neroili, jasmine, sandalwood and frankincense oils and the like. Those -- along with a higher proportion of oils like rosehip, argan, tamanu over the coconut oils esters, would make this serum much more expensive. This is alightweight, easily absorbed oil that would be good for those who have dry, mature skin that can benefit from a little boost, and don&#x27;t mind a somewhat strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light, doesnt leave a greasy feeling at all. Absorbs instantly, almost leaving a powdery finish, but hydrated.  Makeup glides on, and all the dry flaking patches near my hairline are gone.  This is a must-have for winter months.  My skin has never looked so good, and the scent is heavenly!</li>
            <li> Wonderful light oil to renew cells, that refreshes skin, and seems to get absorbed immediately into the skin.  It. smells. wonderful!  Like incense.  I do put moisturizer with SPF on over it, and no pimples!  Oh, and I use Neutrogena face wipes first to remove any dirt beforehand.  I have a microdermabrasion machine, but I find I do not need it.  However, I wear foundation rarely.  I am 60 and looks like I am just starting to look older, so any help is appreciated, especially when it&#x27;s a pleasure to apply!  I&#x27;m adding to this review, since I have used the product every day now.  I have sensitive skin.  I am not having any issues with this product.  I have been using this brand for years.  Not too expensive.  Just put a few drops in your hand (careful, it drips), and the lightweight oil absorbs right away when you use the full palms of your hands.  This is not like baby oil; it simply doesn&#x27;t get greasy when you put it on.  Highly recommended!  I am 60, and  I use it under moisturizer, and if I do use foundation I only use it selectively on certain spots on my face.  My face is never greasy with this.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is best for &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; faces?  On a 70+ year old woman it accomplishes little other than making her skin feel smooth and soft.  There is no noticeable difference in her skin coloration, nor in her skin&#x27;s appearance in any way.  Applying it to her face was satisfying and easy, and there is no oily or greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; results claimed on the L&#x27;Oreal product are not there, and for the cost of the skin care there are many less expensive alternatives.  There is no way we can tell by simply looking if the skin is &amp;#34;hydrated and nourished&amp;#34; instantly as advertised, but we can definitely say&lt;br /&gt;the skin does not look &amp;#34;clearer and brighter&amp;#34; in an instant as claimed.  Nor, does it meet the test claims that after 1 day the skin will be firmer and&lt;br /&gt;softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Skin Care Age Perfect is not something she will wish to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly light/dry for an oil... yes, it says that on the packaging, but who could believe that an oil isn&#x27;t, well, &amp;#34;oily.&amp;#34;  Yes, it does leave a bit of shine behind if you use it on your t-zone and don&#x27;t put anything on top (powder, mattifying lotion, etc.), but it&#x27;s not an oil slick.  It provides great moisture, my skin felt &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; and firmer after about 3 weeks, and with a bit of something on top to balance a little shine, it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a man, the scent was a bit &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; - although not flowery or overly precious. It was also light enough that it wasn&#x27;t an issue, and after a few days it just smelled light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this year-round, but for winters - especially here in New England - it&#x27;s a great addition to my routine. (And a much better price than other face oils with similar ingredients and claims.)</li>
            <li> I am giving this skin care product a real workout. I was in the hospital for 16 days feeling awful and totally abandoned my skin care routine (a luxury you cannot afford at my age). While in the hospital, my face was the least of my worries and I couldn&#x27;t care less; but now that I&#x27;m home, and feeling much better I do care that my skin feels so dry and tight and strangely textured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put the oil on, it (literally) gets absorbed in seconds. I don&#x27;t know if that is because my skin is in such bad shape or if it&#x27;s fast-absorbing for everyone. When I wake up in the morning I notice a softness that wasn&#x27;t there before and that none of the other products I had tried gave me (Clinique, Elizabeth Arden, etc.), but I still have a way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a hard-to-describe scent that is neither appealing nor annoying. The scent has a life of its own: you don&#x27;t smell it as much in the bottle, when you apply it the warmth of your skin intensifies it for a little while, then it seems to fade away completely. As an asthmatic, I prefer unscented products, but this one is working so well I&#x27;m using it anyway. I guess that this is the real test of how impressed I am with it!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this product. I do not consider myself someone with sensitive skin, but this oil tended to irritate by dry face (made dryer by winter, of course). This was disappointing, but I can&#x27;t condone using a product that makes my face red. I recognize that my experience is subjective and that it may be fine for the skin of others, but it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also say, as others have, that the scent of this is fairly off-putting. It&#x27;s hard to explain how, exactly; it&#x27;s not just something I enjoyed the lingering smell of all day.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this oil &amp; when it showed up I loved the look &amp; feel of the bottle it comes in then I opened it up &amp; put a test drop on my hand &amp; the scent just about knocked me over!&lt;br /&gt;I washed &amp; washed &amp; it took 2 days to fully get the smell to leave my hand.&lt;br /&gt;This has a herby scent, possibly from the oils but so strong that I couldn&#x27;t imagine putting it on my face (which is what I bought it for).&lt;br /&gt;One of my daughters thought she might be anle to handle the scent so I sent it home with her instead of trying to get a refund (I prefer not to return items if I can find them a home) but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you asked me my opinion. It might work well, but the odor was so strong &amp; it literally turned my stomach &amp; made me feel quite nauseous when it was just on my hand. My daughter tried it on dry skin on her arms but said she didn&#x27;t think she couldn&#x27;t handle putting the scent on her face either.</li>
            <li> Very light weight oil to make your skin baby soft</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet but I do like the way it feels and I do like the smell too!</li>
            <li> I find, now that I’m forty, my skin could use a little extra help to look its best.  L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is lightweight and perfect for my oily, yet extremely sensitive, skin.  After using it for only a couple of days, my skin already feels softer and appears firmer.  I was afraid putting oil on my already somewhat oily skin would have disastrous results, but L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is lightweight enough that just a few drops absorbed into my skin leaving it feeling hydrated without any greasy residue.  I’m always slightly reluctant to try new facial care products because harsh ones tend to irritate my skin, but L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is gentle enough for even my sensitive skin.  It also has a light, pleasant, slightly citrusy/floral fragrance to it.  People with dry skin may want something heavier, but L’Oreal Cell Renewal Facial Oil is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Originally, we ordered this on a whim, why not try it out?  My wife didn&#x27;t even know if she&#x27;d like it or not.  But she does use moisturizer every day.  Well, my wife loves it -- she surprised her herself with how much she loves it!  And this is comparing this oil to a lifetime of moisturizer use, including brands much more costly than this one (L&#x27;Occitane).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just 5 drops, it is enough to cover her whole face and front of her neck and lasts ~9 hours.  At 5 drops, it leaves a relatively non-greasy feeling (but glasses still slip down the nose)and does a good job of relieving dry skin \\&quot;tension\\&quot;  around the face.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes even when applied closely to them and leaves behind a very light, pleasant, smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, she was just trialing the L&#x27;Occitane Divine moisturizer, which she didn&#x27;t like.  She has also used many other higher-end moisturizers, French and Korean, which have worked well too.  Can&#x27;t speak to the \\&quot;cell renewal\\&quot; marketing angle, but as a moisturizer this is now her new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And it can easily be found on Amazon and at Target.)</li>
            <li> Before I can write anything else about this product, I have to say that this is the worst-smelling skin care item I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I have no particular sensitivity to fragrance, but this has such a strong furniture polish-icky herb scent as to be unbearable.  I can&#x27;t believe anyone would wear this, unless they want to be shunned by society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to its properties. This is a thin oil that absorbs fairly well, but leaves a softness behind. The package says it&#x27;s suitable for oily skin, but I&#x27;m not sure why one would need it. I would not recommend it for acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a moisturizer. It is used as a step between cleansing and moisturizing, as an aid in skin renewal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this because of the bizarre fragrance.</li>
            <li> I normally use an oil from another brand and decided to test this one to compare since this one is significantly cheaper than the other one I use. For one, I don&#x27;t like the smell of this oil at all. It reminds me of some sort of insect repellent. While it goes on smooth and it could be added to your regular routine products, I noticed that it seemed to increase my hyper pigmentation a bit. Needless to say I panicked, so my recommendation is that if you have a good beauty routine and delicate skin sort of be cautious when adding this oil. This is just my experience and I did put some on my husband to see if he liked it, he didn&#x27;t seem to react to it or mind the smell at all. Just wanted to add that to be fair as what it could do to different people.</li>
