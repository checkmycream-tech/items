            <li>I like the product it helps the skin feel delightful.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so incredible after microdermabrasion it is unreal!</li>
            <li>Its a great product!</li>
            <li>I was very happy!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS MACHINE!!!!</li>
            <li>I am so happy!</li>
            <li>Still, can&#x27;t argue with beautiful skin!  </li>
            <li>Great!  </li>
            <li>It feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Your skin deserves the VERY best!</li>
            <li>The brush part works great and the cream that comes with this is very good.</li>
            <li>I decided to replace it with the closest I could find, Dermanew appeared to be the best value for what I knew could be effective if the tool was as advertised, so I purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be working great</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>LOL    </li>
            <li>The shape of the sponge, which is tear drop shaped, is great for getting the area around your nose and your temples.</li>
            <li>I would have been happy with these results after 2 weeks, but with 3 days, I was ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting to have great results from this product, but it didn&#x27;t quite measure up.</li>
            <li>I bought this because a lady who blogs who is really great said this was great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;DermaNew is really a great way to take care of your skin.</li>
            <li>amazing !</li>
            <li>The mircodermabraison works fairly well.</li>
            <li>It feels so good</li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted, but I feel robbed.</li>
            <li>Good product for your face</li>
            <li>You know, I have to say it has worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so clean and flawless.!!</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this Dermanew product</li>
            <li>Love this system, been using this product for years and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>The cleansing is also phenomenal!    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t rub into skin (I think this is why many people have issues with this system)!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Great product....sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Now I will say the microdermal abrasion cream is very good and worth the money</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing after every use</li>
            <li>I give myself a treatment before bed three times a week and follow with a wrinkle cream and a nice moisterizer</li>
            <li>It is a really nice addition to my skin care</li>
            <li>Nice device, works well.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift, and really liked it for the 12 months that the creme and applicator sponges lasted.</li>
            <li>Had the product worked, I might have liked it.  </li>
            <li>really enjoy this, and I feel good about the purchase.</li>
            <li>This is also great because I noticed a difference in my skin after the first use.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel super clean and sloughs off all that dullness to reveal awesome new bright skin.</li>
            <li>I will probably use it more than 2 times a week</li>
            <li>but this thing does much more than just decrease wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I wasnt even able to do both feet</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this after seeing many recommendations on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I have seen a \\&quot;better than expected\\&quot; improvement in the softness of my skin.</li>
            <li>You can feel more of the cream working, since there is no water to dilute it.</li>
            <li>I also have started taking a lot more care of my skin and investing into my routine.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>(She hoped for a better alternative product to</li>
            <li>If you do choose to buy this do not use it more then onece a week.</li>
            <li>I literally just stare in the mirror at how much better my skin is looking.  </li>
            <li>love it and am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>My favorite at home dermabrasion system.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>On top of that to buy the pads again it will cost you another $15 that disintegrate after 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li>Mostly on the side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>By the way I tried to call them so many times and they keep telling me that the must lost it or</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought</li>
            <li>used the Dermanew kit with the provided lotion on the lower part of my face where I have more blackheads.</li>
            <li>Purchased one like this from Sephora for my daughter was a lot more found this one for under 60.00</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that after a couple uses it looks much better as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this item on the recommendation of a YouTube Beauty Guru and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of exfoliating and it&#x27;s easy and fun to use.  </li>
            <li>When I received this product I was so excited!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the DermaNew dermabrasion kit for about 3 weeks now and it is a pretty good product.. and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Does a great job cleaning my pores and keeping my skin looking and feeling young.</li>
            <li>Great tool for buffing off old skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and love that it has a timer and less time required for the scrub.</li>
            <li>Prior this system I used the original Neutrogena at home microdermabrasion tool/system, which I liked, it improved my skin greatly and I used 3 times a week for 3 years.</li>
            <li>The tool in my opinion is of better quality than my original Neutrogena tool.</li>
            <li>My tear-drop has no signs of wear and tear, and I make sure to clean it every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>this is amazing item, my skin feels so good, i have purchased one before, i like that this has two sides that fits different heads.</li>
            <li>in the end my face feels clean and soft and looks great.</li>
            <li>The brush is a great added feature, it is soft and did not irritate also nice to know if I run out of cr&amp;egrave;me, I&#x27;m not without a way to remove old skin cells and promote healthy skin renewal, which I believe is what skin dermabrasion treatments are for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in my twenties and not looking for fine line remedies just yet....</li>
            <li>Mine are still perfectly fine and usable after all this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe some fine lines have diminished.  </li>
            <li>n fine wrinkles</li>
            <li>The stand is not the best it could stand a little improvement.</li>
            <li>After going 6 months without it, my face showed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Unless you were blessed with perfect, clear, luminous skin, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not seeing a marked improvement in the texture, clarity and luminosity of their skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was happy to see that it was very similar to the cr&amp;egrave;me use.</li>
            <li>There are cheap drugstore brand products, but none that do quite what this system does.</li>
            <li>Lightly move in circular motions.</li>
            <li>The actual microderm abrasian formula works great.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and feels refreshed after using this product.</li>
            <li>The face pads are cheaply made and they wear away within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>So it is a rip off scam for a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>The jury&#x27;s still out, but I&#x27;m giving the thumbs up just by virtue of how wonderful my skin feels after just a few minutes usage.</li>
            <li>The cheap product broke about a couple months after I bought it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been free of pimples in about 6 months.</li>
            <li>I thought the brushes/sponges rotated in a circular motion or did something fabulous.</li>
            <li>Some as many as 18 pages worth.</li>
            <li>My skin felt amazing and noticeably different after the first use; use your own favorite product together with the machine and &#x27;feel&#x27; results.</li>
            <li>No, it is not cosmetic surgery, but it is a significant improvement versus soap and water.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like being \\&quot;hooked\\&quot; on products, but this tool improved my skin after the first use and even more with continued use.</li>
            <li>and I have to admit that I prefer it significantly over the dermanew.  </li>
            <li>and it arrived early very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>The tool used properly as directions state, will effectively spread this amount evenly when massaging LIGHTLY over the areas of the face.</li>
            <li>The more you do it the better, not daily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t buy it at the normal price.</li>
            <li>and I think, with proper use, this system will work for most people!</li>
            <li>After using this last night, I can honestly say that my skin glowed and felt very smooth and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin tone (more evenness in color) and it has definitely minimized my pores.</li>
            <li>The DermaNew facial system is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love the brush and the results so far.</li>
            <li>The DermaNew System is WELL worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny</li>
            <li>my skin has never, never, never looked this clear and smooth in my life!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I use it every 2-3 days and love the results so far.  </li>
            <li>DermaNew got the grit just right.  </li>
            <li>so far I love this product, I had no problems setting it up and using it the first time.  </li>
            <li>arms lol where I had some dry skin, and now they are baby soft.</li>
            <li>First off the cream doesn&#x27;t even smell quite as good as the ones I own which was a total waste of money</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to adequately express how delighted I am with this little machine!  </li>
            <li>My first facial brush; Love at first sight!</li>
            <li>I use it when I have a big event, because my makeup goes on MUCH more smoothly than it normally would.   </li>
            <li>I have to say that my skin is definitely smoother, more glowing and radiant, and my problem spots (my hairline and right underneath my jaw bone) have started clearing up.</li>
            <li>and it doesnt even move very much -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle scrub for something that makes your skin so radiant.</li>
            <li>Even with a very light touch the scrubber can leave the skin red and stinging after use.</li>
            <li>My makeup is going on flawlessly now - I&#x27;m actually using less of it and not applying so much concealer to cover acne.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electronic microderm brush I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay the $60 to try this.</li>
            <li>I started using Proactiv again, things cleared up, but not as well as the first time.</li>
            <li>The first 5 nights every night</li>
            <li>Thanks kandee Johnson for suggesting this product!.</li>
            <li>To the absolute contrary!  </li>
            <li>I would check out a drug store version first before ordering this.</li>
            <li>I know exactly when to stop.  </li>
            <li>so it costs more to buy the replacement pieces than it did to purchase the entire kit in the first place.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think I&#x27;ve heard better things about ClairSonic and wish I&#x27;d tried that instead.</li>
            <li>The asked me to send it first</li>
            <li>I bought this for my own use and it did not really work as well has I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I could tell the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>and they said send us the old one we will send you a new one free of charge!</li>
            <li>The DermaNew wand is so EASY to use, it&#x27;s completely waterproof, and the replacement accessories and cleanser is very affordable (if you&#x27;re smart).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product and would encourage anyone curious about it to give a try - if you don&#x27;t like it, just send it back.  </li>
            <li>Wow, she was right!</li>
            <li>I usually love using it when taking a bath - just to sit there and relax while I run it all over myself, giving me a nice little facial.</li>
            <li>So now I am just using the large body sponge on my face.</li>
            <li>The grain that actually removes the dead skin on your face is very fine and does not tear ot pull like many exfoiliators do.</li>
            <li>Reduced my acne scars fine lines and bags almost instantly</li>
            <li>and I had very high expectations for it based on all the hype about this product (TV, YOUTUBE CHANNELS, FRIENDS)</li>
            <li>(Thanks Amazon).</li>
            <li>You haven&#x27;t really cleansed your face until you&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li>I bought the 80 dolalr version that had the whole body parts.</li>
            <li>It is THAT gentle</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how that happens.</li>
            <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t expect TOO much.</li>
            <li>However, the vibrating brush helps to really get that grit working.      </li>
            <li>And when I put my moisturizer on, I feel like it&#x27;s really moisturizing my skin now</li>
            <li>When you press the power button, a red light comes on, indicating that it will automatically shut off in two minutes.</li>
            <li>you use the sensitive-skin scrub that comes with, it really does work wonders.  </li>
            <li>It was completely ready for use the minute I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It been over a year now and spots are still very visible.</li>
            <li>I can tell this is really working because my clogged pores are getting cleaned out.  </li>
            <li>The scrub that comes with the wand is the real star of the show...</li>
            <li>Got this product as I had heard so much about it got my order in</li>
            <li>maybe it really works for someone but for me it did not even work for one star...</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very generous with it - you don&#x27;t need to be -</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and some of the acne scars have gone away.  </li>
            <li>live in the hot humid south</li>
            <li>I am usually very careful with what I do on my face because my skin is very sensitive and I tend to break out very easily from things.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a deep clean, save up and invest in Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Click on see all my reviews next to each positive review.... 50% or more of these people have reviewed MULTIPLE items.</li>
            <li>the only con is that you have to wash the brush and sponge with their special cleanser.</li>
            <li>There are much more expensive products and much cheaper products, but I love this system.  </li>
            <li>It seems like a spinning head would be more ideal, as the vibration is very slight, almost useless.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love this little mini spa at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and it really helps fight my adult acne.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and find this is not irritating.  </li>
            <li>My face is soft and so much cleaner</li>
            <li>I expected better results from this product, I cannot see much difference in my skin after I use the facial system</li>
            <li>The dermabrasion cr&amp;egrave;me works well and is not causing my medium toned normal  skin to break out.</li>
            <li>It was dry, more wrinkles started to define themselves, and lack of firmness and color of my skin was simply undesirable compared to what it had been.</li>
            <li>I am going to send this product back right away.</li>
            <li>The pores have absolutely gotten smaller (and if you have oily skin, you know how we are plagued with large pores that can be seen a block away).  </li>
            <li>As a reference, I am 38, have fair sensitive sking, with small lines and wrinkles and occasional break outs.</li>
            <li>It was accidently thrown away and I did not want the \\&quot;new model\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I contacted Derma New and the amazon seller</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this product and was nervous because I am prone to breakouts from new products.</li>
            <li>I feel like a new woman...</li>
            <li>After you rinse the crystals in the formula off of your face with water you can use the brush end to do a quick sweep of your face to remove any particles that were left behind, which is a bit handy.</li>
            <li>have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was highly dissapointed it didn&#x27;t do much of anything except irratate my skin, cause even more break outs and cause me to spend even more money to get rid of the damage and the sponge on the knob of the dermanew began to get really dirty even after washing it with regular soap and water (as it says to do).</li>
            <li>have not had clear skin in months!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, but the motor has decreased significantly.</li>
            <li>I bought this item last week, due to many youtube reviews and Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>Having a stand doesn&#x27;t seem like a big plus, but really it is!  </li>
            <li>You actually get a really good deal for the prices: the tool itself with a low and high setting, a brush head, a tear-dropped shaped sponge head (to reach harder areas of your face), a larger tear-dropped shaped sponge head (for body scrubbing!), the sensitive skin microdermabrasion scrub, double a batteries, and a stand</li>
            <li>Never had I used anything that cleaned my face more profoundly and then... it died on me less than a month later.</li>
            <li>My skin is completely clear of any bumps and the size of the pores on my nose</li>
            <li>I am on my 4th use and my skin is 100% clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>It was so soft.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and still gets adult acne around my cycle.</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old</li>
            <li>And my skin was so sensitive that it was feeling quite agitated after using the Dermanew.</li>
            <li>So if you have ultra sensitive skin or rosacea don&#x27;t even try this product.</li>
            <li>Eventually I had to get some of the blackheads professionally cut out because they would not come out - my skin encased them.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the brush side as much as the sponges, and I like the smaller sponge just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product does make your skin feel much softer after use without having to pay for a facial.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The little information pamphlet also gives you directions on how to deep clean and on microdermabrasion, which I thought was really</li>
            <li>It has two settings; low and high, so either you can do a deep cleanse or intense microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li>(I read somewhere that the skin on your hands was very much like the skin on the face - so if it works on the face so well, I should see similar results on my hands) and now even my hands are looking younger and smoother.  </li>
            <li>I find the two minute timer is ample time enough to exfoliate my entire face, and I love the little brush to help get it off during the cleaning phase.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have not been able to control my black heads or bumps and unusually erupt around my chin daily with few clear days.</li>
            <li>It has improved my complexion and helped me fight off those fine lines and dull spots.</li>
            <li>I am 18 years old, and when I bought this item I used it for about 3-4 weeks trying to get rid of acne as (the real dermanew website) claims to do as well, as other benefits when using the dermanew</li>
            <li>I do not normally break out, and it has made me break out a bit more than usual, but I think it&#x27;s because all this gunk is getting cleaned</li>
            <li>Be gentle and the applicators will last a long time and stay sanitary.    </li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for anyone who has fragile or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a timer that goes off after 2 minutes or so, and you should really run it at least that long to get the full benefits.</li>
            <li>This was worth every single dime I spent on it.  </li>
            <li>This item is a cheap piece of plastic that barely vibrates- seriously how does vibrating while rubbing microdermal abrasion cream on your face do anything?</li>
            <li>(I have to wet my face a bit and wet the applicator sponge as well first</li>
            <li>Before deciding on this particular product vs. other higher-end and lower-end products, I researched lots of different products.    </li>
            <li>I have active breakouts, but my skin is improving steadily with my daily skincare regimen and this system is built into that.</li>
            <li>The scrub is so gritty, it&#x27;s even finer than sand, and when you work it onto your dry face you can definitely feel your old skin getting \\&quot;sanded\\</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The brush part works great and the cream that comes with this is very good.</li>
            <li> I decided to replace it with the closest I could find, Dermanew appeared to be the best value for what I knew could be effective if the tool was as advertised, so I purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be working great</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> LOL    </li>
            <li> The shape of the sponge, which is tear drop shaped, is great for getting the area around your nose and your temples.</li>
            <li> I would have been happy with these results after 2 weeks, but with 3 days, I was ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great for in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting to have great results from this product, but it didn&#x27;t quite measure up.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a lady who blogs who is really great said this was great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DermaNew is really a great way to take care of your skin.</li>
            <li> amazing !</li>
            <li> The mircodermabraison works fairly well.</li>
            <li> It feels so good</li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted, but I feel robbed.</li>
            <li> Good product for your face</li>
            <li> You know, I have to say it has worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so clean and flawless.!!</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this Dermanew product</li>
            <li> Love this system, been using this product for years and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> The cleansing is also phenomenal!    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rub into skin (I think this is why many people have issues with this system)!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Great product....sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Now I will say the microdermal abrasion cream is very good and worth the money</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing after every use</li>
            <li> I give myself a treatment before bed three times a week and follow with a wrinkle cream and a nice moisterizer</li>
            <li> It is a really nice addition to my skin care</li>
            <li> Nice device, works well.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift, and really liked it for the 12 months that the creme and applicator sponges lasted.</li>
            <li> Had the product worked, I might have liked it.  </li>
            <li> really enjoy this, and I feel good about the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is also great because I noticed a difference in my skin after the first use.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel super clean and sloughs off all that dullness to reveal awesome new bright skin.</li>
            <li> I will probably use it more than 2 times a week</li>
            <li> but this thing does much more than just decrease wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I wasnt even able to do both feet</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this after seeing many recommendations on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I have seen a \\&quot;better than expected\\&quot; improvement in the softness of my skin.</li>
            <li> You can feel more of the cream working, since there is no water to dilute it.</li>
            <li> I also have started taking a lot more care of my skin and investing into my routine.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> (She hoped for a better alternative product to</li>
            <li> If you do choose to buy this do not use it more then onece a week.</li>
            <li> I literally just stare in the mirror at how much better my skin is looking.  </li>
            <li> love it and am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> My favorite at home dermabrasion system.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> On top of that to buy the pads again it will cost you another $15 that disintegrate after 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li> Mostly on the side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> By the way I tried to call them so many times and they keep telling me that the must lost it or</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought</li>
            <li> used the Dermanew kit with the provided lotion on the lower part of my face where I have more blackheads.</li>
            <li> Purchased one like this from Sephora for my daughter was a lot more found this one for under 60.00</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that after a couple uses it looks much better as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this item on the recommendation of a YouTube Beauty Guru and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of exfoliating and it&#x27;s easy and fun to use.  </li>
            <li> When I received this product I was so excited!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the DermaNew dermabrasion kit for about 3 weeks now and it is a pretty good product.. and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning my pores and keeping my skin looking and feeling young.</li>
            <li> Great tool for buffing off old skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it and love that it has a timer and less time required for the scrub.</li>
            <li> Prior this system I used the original Neutrogena at home microdermabrasion tool/system, which I liked, it improved my skin greatly and I used 3 times a week for 3 years.</li>
            <li> The tool in my opinion is of better quality than my original Neutrogena tool.</li>
            <li> My tear-drop has no signs of wear and tear, and I make sure to clean it every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> this is amazing item, my skin feels so good, i have purchased one before, i like that this has two sides that fits different heads.</li>
            <li> in the end my face feels clean and soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> The brush is a great added feature, it is soft and did not irritate also nice to know if I run out of cr&amp;egrave;me, I&#x27;m not without a way to remove old skin cells and promote healthy skin renewal, which I believe is what skin dermabrasion treatments are for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in my twenties and not looking for fine line remedies just yet....</li>
            <li> Mine are still perfectly fine and usable after all this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe some fine lines have diminished.  </li>
            <li> n fine wrinkles</li>
            <li> The stand is not the best it could stand a little improvement.</li>
            <li> After going 6 months without it, my face showed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Unless you were blessed with perfect, clear, luminous skin, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not seeing a marked improvement in the texture, clarity and luminosity of their skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was happy to see that it was very similar to the cr&amp;egrave;me use.</li>
            <li> There are cheap drugstore brand products, but none that do quite what this system does.</li>
            <li> Lightly move in circular motions.</li>
            <li> The actual microderm abrasian formula works great.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and feels refreshed after using this product.</li>
            <li> The face pads are cheaply made and they wear away within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> So it is a rip off scam for a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> The jury&#x27;s still out, but I&#x27;m giving the thumbs up just by virtue of how wonderful my skin feels after just a few minutes usage.</li>
            <li> The cheap product broke about a couple months after I bought it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been free of pimples in about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes/sponges rotated in a circular motion or did something fabulous.</li>
            <li> Some as many as 18 pages worth.</li>
            <li> My skin felt amazing and noticeably different after the first use; use your own favorite product together with the machine and &#x27;feel&#x27; results.</li>
            <li> No, it is not cosmetic surgery, but it is a significant improvement versus soap and water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like being \\&quot;hooked\\&quot; on products, but this tool improved my skin after the first use and even more with continued use.</li>
            <li> and I have to admit that I prefer it significantly over the dermanew.  </li>
            <li> and it arrived early very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> The tool used properly as directions state, will effectively spread this amount evenly when massaging LIGHTLY over the areas of the face.</li>
            <li> The more you do it the better, not daily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t buy it at the normal price.</li>
            <li> and I think, with proper use, this system will work for most people!</li>
            <li> After using this last night, I can honestly say that my skin glowed and felt very smooth and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin tone (more evenness in color) and it has definitely minimized my pores.</li>
            <li> The DermaNew facial system is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love the brush and the results so far.</li>
            <li> The DermaNew System is WELL worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny</li>
            <li> my skin has never, never, never looked this clear and smooth in my life!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use it every 2-3 days and love the results so far.  </li>
            <li> DermaNew got the grit just right.  </li>
            <li> so far I love this product, I had no problems setting it up and using it the first time.  </li>
            <li> arms lol where I had some dry skin, and now they are baby soft.</li>
            <li> First off the cream doesn&#x27;t even smell quite as good as the ones I own which was a total waste of money</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to adequately express how delighted I am with this little machine!  </li>
            <li> My first facial brush; Love at first sight!</li>
            <li> I use it when I have a big event, because my makeup goes on MUCH more smoothly than it normally would.   </li>
            <li> I have to say that my skin is definitely smoother, more glowing and radiant, and my problem spots (my hairline and right underneath my jaw bone) have started clearing up.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt even move very much -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gentle scrub for something that makes your skin so radiant.</li>
            <li> Even with a very light touch the scrubber can leave the skin red and stinging after use.</li>
            <li> My makeup is going on flawlessly now - I&#x27;m actually using less of it and not applying so much concealer to cover acne.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electronic microderm brush I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I was willing to pay the $60 to try this.</li>
            <li> I started using Proactiv again, things cleared up, but not as well as the first time.</li>
            <li> The first 5 nights every night</li>
            <li> Thanks kandee Johnson for suggesting this product!.</li>
            <li> To the absolute contrary!  </li>
            <li> I would check out a drug store version first before ordering this.</li>
            <li> I know exactly when to stop.  </li>
            <li> so it costs more to buy the replacement pieces than it did to purchase the entire kit in the first place.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think I&#x27;ve heard better things about ClairSonic and wish I&#x27;d tried that instead.</li>
            <li> The asked me to send it first</li>
            <li> I bought this for my own use and it did not really work as well has I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I could tell the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> and they said send us the old one we will send you a new one free of charge!</li>
            <li> The DermaNew wand is so EASY to use, it&#x27;s completely waterproof, and the replacement accessories and cleanser is very affordable (if you&#x27;re smart).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this product and would encourage anyone curious about it to give a try - if you don&#x27;t like it, just send it back.  </li>
            <li> Wow, she was right!</li>
            <li> I usually love using it when taking a bath - just to sit there and relax while I run it all over myself, giving me a nice little facial.</li>
            <li> So now I am just using the large body sponge on my face.</li>
            <li> The grain that actually removes the dead skin on your face is very fine and does not tear ot pull like many exfoiliators do.</li>
            <li> Reduced my acne scars fine lines and bags almost instantly</li>
            <li> and I had very high expectations for it based on all the hype about this product (TV, YOUTUBE CHANNELS, FRIENDS)</li>
            <li> (Thanks Amazon).</li>
            <li> You haven&#x27;t really cleansed your face until you&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> I bought the 80 dolalr version that had the whole body parts.</li>
            <li> It is THAT gentle</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how that happens.</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t expect TOO much.</li>
            <li> However, the vibrating brush helps to really get that grit working.      </li>
            <li> And when I put my moisturizer on, I feel like it&#x27;s really moisturizing my skin now</li>
            <li> When you press the power button, a red light comes on, indicating that it will automatically shut off in two minutes.</li>
            <li> you use the sensitive-skin scrub that comes with, it really does work wonders.  </li>
            <li> It was completely ready for use the minute I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It been over a year now and spots are still very visible.</li>
            <li> I can tell this is really working because my clogged pores are getting cleaned out.  </li>
            <li> The scrub that comes with the wand is the real star of the show...</li>
            <li> Got this product as I had heard so much about it got my order in</li>
            <li> maybe it really works for someone but for me it did not even work for one star...</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very generous with it - you don&#x27;t need to be -</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer and some of the acne scars have gone away.  </li>
            <li> live in the hot humid south</li>
            <li> I am usually very careful with what I do on my face because my skin is very sensitive and I tend to break out very easily from things.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a deep clean, save up and invest in Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Click on see all my reviews next to each positive review.... 50% or more of these people have reviewed MULTIPLE items.</li>
            <li> the only con is that you have to wash the brush and sponge with their special cleanser.</li>
            <li> There are much more expensive products and much cheaper products, but I love this system.  </li>
            <li> It seems like a spinning head would be more ideal, as the vibration is very slight, almost useless.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this little mini spa at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and it really helps fight my adult acne.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and find this is not irritating.  </li>
            <li> My face is soft and so much cleaner</li>
            <li> I expected better results from this product, I cannot see much difference in my skin after I use the facial system</li>
            <li> The dermabrasion cr&amp;egrave;me works well and is not causing my medium toned normal  skin to break out.</li>
            <li> It was dry, more wrinkles started to define themselves, and lack of firmness and color of my skin was simply undesirable compared to what it had been.</li>
            <li> I am going to send this product back right away.</li>
            <li> The pores have absolutely gotten smaller (and if you have oily skin, you know how we are plagued with large pores that can be seen a block away).  </li>
            <li> As a reference, I am 38, have fair sensitive sking, with small lines and wrinkles and occasional break outs.</li>
            <li> It was accidently thrown away and I did not want the \\&quot;new model\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I contacted Derma New and the amazon seller</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and was nervous because I am prone to breakouts from new products.</li>
            <li> I feel like a new woman...</li>
            <li> After you rinse the crystals in the formula off of your face with water you can use the brush end to do a quick sweep of your face to remove any particles that were left behind, which is a bit handy.</li>
            <li> have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was highly dissapointed it didn&#x27;t do much of anything except irratate my skin, cause even more break outs and cause me to spend even more money to get rid of the damage and the sponge on the knob of the dermanew began to get really dirty even after washing it with regular soap and water (as it says to do).</li>
            <li> have not had clear skin in months!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, but the motor has decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I bought this item last week, due to many youtube reviews and Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> Having a stand doesn&#x27;t seem like a big plus, but really it is!  </li>
            <li> You actually get a really good deal for the prices: the tool itself with a low and high setting, a brush head, a tear-dropped shaped sponge head (to reach harder areas of your face), a larger tear-dropped shaped sponge head (for body scrubbing!), the sensitive skin microdermabrasion scrub, double a batteries, and a stand</li>
            <li> Never had I used anything that cleaned my face more profoundly and then... it died on me less than a month later.</li>
            <li> My skin is completely clear of any bumps and the size of the pores on my nose</li>
            <li> I am on my 4th use and my skin is 100% clear and glowing.</li>
            <li> It was so soft.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and still gets adult acne around my cycle.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old</li>
            <li> And my skin was so sensitive that it was feeling quite agitated after using the Dermanew.</li>
            <li> So if you have ultra sensitive skin or rosacea don&#x27;t even try this product.</li>
            <li> Eventually I had to get some of the blackheads professionally cut out because they would not come out - my skin encased them.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the brush side as much as the sponges, and I like the smaller sponge just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does make your skin feel much softer after use without having to pay for a facial.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little information pamphlet also gives you directions on how to deep clean and on microdermabrasion, which I thought was really</li>
            <li> It has two settings; low and high, so either you can do a deep cleanse or intense microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li> (I read somewhere that the skin on your hands was very much like the skin on the face - so if it works on the face so well, I should see similar results on my hands) and now even my hands are looking younger and smoother.  </li>
            <li> I find the two minute timer is ample time enough to exfoliate my entire face, and I love the little brush to help get it off during the cleaning phase.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have not been able to control my black heads or bumps and unusually erupt around my chin daily with few clear days.</li>
            <li> It has improved my complexion and helped me fight off those fine lines and dull spots.</li>
            <li> I am 18 years old, and when I bought this item I used it for about 3-4 weeks trying to get rid of acne as (the real dermanew website) claims to do as well, as other benefits when using the dermanew</li>
            <li> I do not normally break out, and it has made me break out a bit more than usual, but I think it&#x27;s because all this gunk is getting cleaned</li>
            <li> Be gentle and the applicators will last a long time and stay sanitary.    </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for anyone who has fragile or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has a timer that goes off after 2 minutes or so, and you should really run it at least that long to get the full benefits.</li>
            <li> This was worth every single dime I spent on it.  </li>
            <li> This item is a cheap piece of plastic that barely vibrates- seriously how does vibrating while rubbing microdermal abrasion cream on your face do anything?</li>
            <li> (I have to wet my face a bit and wet the applicator sponge as well first</li>
            <li> Before deciding on this particular product vs. other higher-end and lower-end products, I researched lots of different products.    </li>
            <li> I have active breakouts, but my skin is improving steadily with my daily skincare regimen and this system is built into that.</li>
            <li> The scrub is so gritty, it&#x27;s even finer than sand, and when you work it onto your dry face you can definitely feel your old skin getting \\&quot;sanded\\</li>
            <li> ( i guess from makeup even though i wash my face first, or hard water)</li>
            <li> whatever excuse they can come up with, BUT NEVER GAVE ME MY PRODUCT BACK...</li>
            <li> I actually like using it dry though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week - 3 times (currently doing every other day and taking off the weekend)and</li>
            <li> The scrub is a gritty cream that&#x27;s great for sloughing off dead cells from the skin&#x27;s surface, but doesn&#x27;t last very long at all, and is very expensive!  </li>
            <li> Press the button again, and you can go to town on your face as long as you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I dont like long hair.</li>
            <li> Other products either cleans or exfoliate, no drugstore product (that I know of) can do both independently of one another.    </li>
            <li> but I read the other reviews and bought an extra set.</li>
            <li> The tube lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> The microdermabrasion cream will last a few months because you only need about a teaspoon size.    </li>
            <li> Also the wash product it self was alright, but it definatly did not live up to the benefits it promises to do for myself.</li>
            <li> I would use the buffer pad minimally as I noticed my skin looked really dry after using it a couple times in one week.  </li>
            <li> the only way it works is if you rub it and after i rubbed one foot the black stuff started coming off the pad</li>
            <li> I can get the same effect for a lot less money by using baking soda and my fingers.</li>
            <li> but it does not seem to have a negative effect on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my little process: I make sure I have no make-up on, wash my face with cold water, then pat it dry</li>
            <li> The first time you use this, your skin is smoother, but it&#x27;s not so dramatic.</li>
            <li> I wanted something a little extra to get rid of the stubborn spots of acne.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> cannot stress enough the convenience of this little tool.  </li>
            <li> The replacement sponges and brush cost $15 for a pack that includes one of each applicator, but these brushes should last at least three months if sanitized properly and treated with care.</li>
            <li> feared the rough texture of the cream would break me out, but it has yet to do that.</li>
            <li> and I had to be careful from what foundation I put on to lotions, etc.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product a few times to date, however I like the results I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> My face dried out a tiny bit when i first started using it, but it was probably because I was addicted and used it twice a day!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was useless because it didn&#x27;t feel like it was even cleaning my face, but once I washed and touched my skin afterwards my opinion changed.</li>
            <li> I guarantee you the first two reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> then a 5 day break then every other day..</li>
            <li> There are 2 settings, one that lets it run for 2 minutes, the other runs until you turn it off.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to the microdermabrasion cream that is used in conjunction with it, or the actual vibrating wand.  </li>
            <li> I have very rough, dry, and uneven skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> Reading a lot of reviews, I&#x27;ve seen that people were disappointed because they were expecting a whole new face it sounds like.</li>
            <li> I can say that is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Run a few sec, then shuts off.  </li>
            <li> I usually cleanse my skin with the proactiv wash with the brush side and dry my face</li>
            <li> The small dry patches are gone.  </li>
            <li> I took a break, stopped using it, and my acne came back, not as bad, but I would get a new bump or white head usually every morning</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over half a year now.</li>
            <li> After using this product I had a lot of black spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> Even if I tried my typical black head removal practices of steaming the area, exfoliation, or pressure, nothing would come out.</li>
            <li> It also has a little stand</li>
            <li> like it says i just feel my skin a little smoother after i euse it</li>
            <li> I bought it after I saw it endorsed on a beauty website but the results are not very satisfying.</li>
            <li> but it was a big disappointment at the same time.</li>
            <li> I purchsed this item a few months ago as a replacement for my Nutrogena model.</li>
            <li> I think that the formula is a bit heavily scented for me</li>
            <li> I also got a few compliments which reassures me that it works and is noticable.</li>
            <li> I had bought this product from a recommendation of a few friends.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of 70 dollars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  After using this system for a few weeks, I felt it was time for an update.  </li>
            <li> and then I put a few dabs of the scrubbing cream all over my face</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the product would irritate my skin and  make the breakouts worse, but this isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rub the crystals into the skin or excessive irritation might occur.  </li>
            <li> or it doesnt glide on my skin as well as I would like) and then massage the granules with the vibrating device in a small circular motion.</li>
            <li> :\</li>
            <li> The power button stopped working 2 days past the warranty date  Junk.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is the reason.</li>
            <li> So needless to say that alot of my facial product was gone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like returing it because I was so anxious to try it out.</li>
            <li> I had a blanket of small hard balls all over the lower part of my face.</li>
            <li> The scars have decreased slightly, but they are still visible on my jaw line.</li>
            <li> I still use it for microdermabraison once a week, but I hardly ever use it to scrub my face anymore because I feel like it&#x27;s not doing anything.</li>
            <li> They must be buffing for hours on end or pushing really hard on it.</li>
            <li> their product sucks also.</li>
            <li> but I would say at least once a week.</li>
            <li> and afterwards it felt like there were little grains of sand all over my face which were quite difficult to wash off as well.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I hardly EVER get zits now!</li>
            <li> Within two days of using it the pores on my chin became very hard and formed bumps all over.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this machine would be too rough on my skin and make a bad situation worse.  </li>
            <li> I went two weeks without using it and my acne got doubly worse.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I don&#x27;t use the sponge applicator at all, it seems a bit unnecessary to me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing is that I noticed a lot of reviews say their pads have gotten bad after a few uses.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if this is a bad combination -</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find I could no longer purchase sponges and such for my Youthful Essence.  </li>
            <li> Do not be fooled by fake reviews.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic system is WAY overpriced and expensive compared to the $50 this costs.</li>
            <li> and I put the batteries in wrong and for some reason it messed up, and would not work.</li>
            <li> The vibrating wand is useless.  </li>
            <li> After I finish, I wash again with cold water and put just toner on nothing else.</li>
            <li> But I am very angry to have used  this product</li>
            <li> But now I grow so I can cover those ugly spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> I was very very disappointed in this item.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the first electronic microderm brush I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks.  My skin is smoother and the amount of blackheads and under the skin blemishes are drastically reduced.  I would use the buffer pad minimally as I noticed my skin looked really dry after using it a couple times in one week.  Otherwise, I love the brush and the results so far.</li>
            <li> I like the product it helps the skin feel delightful.  I will probably use it more than 2 times a week</li>
            <li> Prior this system I used the original Neutrogena at home microdermabrasion tool/system, which I liked, it improved my skin greatly and I used 3 times a week for 3 years. It was accidently thrown away and I did not want the \\&quot;new model\\&quot;. After going 6 months without it, my face showed a huge difference. It was dry, more wrinkles started to define themselves, and lack of firmness and color of my skin was simply undesirable compared to what it had been. I decided to replace it with the closest I could find, Dermanew appeared to be the best value for what I knew could be effective if the tool was as advertised, so I purchased from amazon. I use as directed (same as before 3 times a week). My skin improved after the 1st use and has continued to improve in softness, color, reduced wrinkle definition and firmness. No, it is not cosmetic surgery, but it is a significant improvement versus soap and water. The tool in my opinion is of better quality than my original Neutrogena tool. It has proven to be quite water resistant and solid built. The dermabrasion cr&amp;egrave;me works well and is not causing my medium toned normal  skin to break out. I use only a \\&quot;pea size\\&quot; amount on 2 areas of my face per treatment. The tool used properly as directions state, will effectively spread this amount evenly when massaging LIGHTLY over the areas of the face. I don&#x27;t like being \\&quot;hooked\\&quot; on products, but this tool improved my skin after the first use and even more with continued use. I like that a \\&quot;brush applicator\\&quot; was included, which I did use for one treatment to see how it worked and I was happy to see that it was very similar to the cr&amp;egrave;me use. The brush is a great added feature, it is soft and did not irritate also nice to know if I run out of cr&amp;egrave;me, I&#x27;m not without a way to remove old skin cells and promote healthy skin renewal, which I believe is what skin dermabrasion treatments are for.  All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this Dermanew product and I hope they do not discontinue it. (Thanks Amazon).</li>
            <li> Update (2012): I have been using this for over half a year now. I really enjoy this product, but the motor has decreased significantly. I still use it for microdermabraison once a week, but I hardly ever use it to scrub my face anymore because I feel like it&#x27;s not doing anything. I received the clairsonic in July and I have to admit that I prefer it significantly over the dermanew.  Initial review:  You haven&#x27;t really cleansed your face until you&#x27;ve used this product. At first I thought it was useless because it didn&#x27;t feel like it was even cleaning my face, but once I washed and touched my skin afterwards my opinion changed. My face is baby-smooth after I used this two days in a row. I use acne-wash in the morning and the Dermanew cleanser for oily skin at night. I got a chance to use the microdermabraison wash last night and I think I see a decrease in my scars already. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my face will look like in a couple of weeks.  Update: I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and it really helps fight my adult acne. I went two weeks without using it and my acne got doubly worse. The mircodermabraison works fairly well. The scars have decreased slightly, but they are still visible on my jaw line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the DermaNew dermabrasion kit for about 3 weeks now and it is a pretty good product.. and easy to use. i have sensitive skin and find this is not irritating.  I use it twice a week and it gets the job done. in the end my face feels clean and soft and looks great. the only con is that you have to wash the brush and sponge with their special cleanser. anyway i use johnson&#x27;s baby wash and it seems to be working great</li>
            <li> Ive been using this system fairly regularly for about 3 years.  I&#x27;m still in my twenties and not looking for fine line remedies just yet....but this thing does much more than just decrease wrinkles.  I use it when I have a big event, because my makeup goes on MUCH more smoothly than it normally would.   This is also great because I noticed a difference in my skin after the first use.  It was so soft.  The tube lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I bought the 80 dolalr version that had the whole body parts. LOL What a rip off. I guarantee you the first two reviews are fake. This item is a cheap piece of plastic that barely vibrates- seriously how does vibrating while rubbing microdermal abrasion cream on your face do anything? I was very very disappointed in this item. Do not be fooled by fake reviews. Now I will say the microdermal abrasion cream is very good and worth the money but you can put taht on by hand and massage it in and get the same effect. The callous removeer does nothing cuz its just sitting on a plastic thing that vibrates and it doesnt even move very much - the only way it works is if you rub it and after i rubbed one foot the black stuff started coming off the pad and then it had nothing left - I wasnt even able to do both feet LOL    save your money buy the microdermal abrasion cream and nothing else from this company</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this after seeing many recommendations on YouTube.  Before deciding on this particular product vs. other higher-end and lower-end products, I researched lots of different products.    Many reviewers claimed this system is expensive or over-priced, and I beg to differ. The Clarisonic system is WAY overpriced and expensive compared to the $50 this costs. Especially considering the DermaNew system cleanses AND microdermabrasions.    There are cheap drugstore brand products, but none that do quite what this system does. The DermaNew cleanses and performs microdermabrasion. Other products either cleans or exfoliate, no drugstore product (that I know of) can do both independently of one another.    I use this to cleans my skin twice daily and I microdermabrasion 3-4 times a week. My skin feels so incredible after microdermabrasion it is unreal! The cleansing is also phenomenal!    The DermaNew wand is so EASY to use, it&#x27;s completely waterproof, and the replacement accessories and cleanser is very affordable (if you&#x27;re smart). The replacement sponges and brush cost $15 for a pack that includes one of each applicator, but these brushes should last at least three months if sanitized properly and treated with care. The [[ASIN:B000R94P5U DermaNew Microdermabrasion Facial Rejuvenation Replacement Creme 2.6oz]] is $36 per tube BUT there is a cheaper alternative by DermaNew called [[ASIN:B000PV1530 DermaNew Antioxidant Dual Crystal Formula 3 oz.]] that costs $15. The microdermabrasion cream will last a few months because you only need about a teaspoon size.    My skin is oily and acne-prone. I have active breakouts, but my skin is improving steadily with my daily skincare regimen and this system is built into that. This system does not irritate my skin at all.    TIPS:  +Don&#x27;t rub into skin (I think this is why many people have issues with this system)! Lightly move in circular motions. The microdermabrasion cream and vibration will do the work when exfoliating.The brush bristles, cleanser, and vibration will do the work when cleansing.  +Rinse the crystals off your face. Don&#x27;t rub the crystals into the skin or excessive irritation might occur.  +Cleanse the sponge and brush after each use. Be gentle and the applicators will last a long time and stay sanitary.    The DermaNew System is WELL worth the money. There are much more expensive products and much cheaper products, but I love this system.  I do not regret my purchase and I think, with proper use, this system will work for most people!</li>
            <li> I bought this item last week, due to many youtube reviews and Amazon reviews. I have to say that I have seen a \\&quot;better than expected\\&quot; improvement in the softness of my skin. I have very rough, dry, and uneven skin to begin with. I was willing to pay the $60 to try this. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than surgical microderm abrasion.&lt;br /&gt;I feared the rough texture of the cream would break me out, but it has yet to do that. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and still gets adult acne around my cycle. I used it in the shower today, as the entire casing is waterproof. I actually like using it dry though. You can feel more of the cream working, since there is no water to dilute it. I find the two minute timer is ample time enough to exfoliate my entire face, and I love the little brush to help get it off during the cleaning phase. It&#x27;s not abrasive either.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this as part of your face cleansing regiment. It is not a cure for acne or wrinkles, but it will improve your skin overall.</li>
            <li> I purchsed this item a few months ago as a replacement for my Nutrogena model. As a reference, I am 38, have fair sensitive sking, with small lines and wrinkles and occasional break outs. This works in the same manner as the Nutrogena product but for a fraction of the price. You place the formula on your face (I have to wet my face a bit and wet the applicator sponge as well first or it doesnt glide on my skin as well as I would like) and then massage the granules with the vibrating device in a small circular motion. The shape of the sponge, which is tear drop shaped, is great for getting the area around your nose and your temples. I have used it about three times a week and have not had to replace the applicator. After you rinse the crystals in the formula off of your face with water you can use the brush end to do a quick sweep of your face to remove any particles that were left behind, which is a bit handy. I did not realize it when I purchased the item but it has a built in two minute timer that beeps and then shuts off the device when the time is up. It also has a little stand so it sits up on your counter. The actual microderm abrasian formula works great. The grain that actually removes the dead skin on your face is very fine and does not tear ot pull like many exfoiliators do. I think that the formula is a bit heavily scented for me but it does not seem to have a negative effect on my very sensitive skin. I give myself a treatment before bed three times a week and follow with a wrinkle cream and a nice moisterizer and my skin is glowing when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I attempt to read up on products before I purchase them. After using this for my skin, I have noticed a tremendeous difference. My skin looks and feels polished. I also got a few compliments which reassures me that it works and is noticable. Its a great product!</li>
            <li> I had bought this product from a recommendation of a few friends. I am usually very careful with what I do on my face because my skin is very sensitive and I tend to break out very easily from things. I also have started taking a lot more care of my skin and investing into my routine.&lt;br /&gt;For some background, I had an acne problem, nothing severe but after using Proactiv, it cleared up. I took a break, stopped using it, and my acne came back, not as bad, but I would get a new bump or white head usually every morning and I had to be careful from what foundation I put on to lotions, etc.&lt;br /&gt;When I started using Proactiv again, things cleared up, but not as well as the first time. I wanted something a little extra to get rid of the stubborn spots of acne.&lt;br /&gt;Now the dermanew comes in....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for several weeks now. The first 5 nights every night then a 5 day break then every other day.. I have to say that my skin is definitely smoother, more glowing and radiant, and my problem spots (my hairline and right underneath my jaw bone) have started clearing up. I was afraid that the product would irritate my skin and  make the breakouts worse, but this isn&#x27;t true. It&#x27;s a very gentle scrub for something that makes your skin so radiant. Reading a lot of reviews, I&#x27;ve seen that people were disappointed because they were expecting a whole new face it sounds like. The first time you use this, your skin is smoother, but it&#x27;s not so dramatic. However, after 3 days, it is. I would have been happy with these results after 2 weeks, but with 3 days, I was ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using my proactiv in the morning and I use the dermanew at night. I usually cleanse my skin with the proactiv wash with the brush side and dry my face then I use the microdermabrasion creme and the buffing side. Following this, I use this product by H2O called calming complexion serum, it has salicylic acid in it. In the morning, I&#x27;ve begun using the brush side with the proactivwash and then follow with their 2 step system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think at this price Amazon is offering, it is definitely a must have for your skin care routine. I&#x27;ve even noticed that they have an acne version of the creme and I have ordered that to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone with any type of skin! It is THAT gentle but you get results as if you buffed your face for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that I noticed a lot of reviews say their pads have gotten bad after a few uses. I really don&#x27;t know how that happens. They must be buffing for hours on end or pushing really hard on it. Mine are still perfectly fine and usable after all this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are fed up with stubborn spots and just want a nicer complexion, I recommend this. It is a really nice addition to my skin care routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It feels so good, I use it twice a day sometimes. I also used it on my upper tricep/biceps/ arms lol where I had some dry skin, and now they are baby soft. My face dried out a tiny bit when i first started using it, but it was probably because I was addicted and used it twice a day! I will say the foam heads do tend to miscolor ( i guess from makeup even though i wash my face first, or hard water) but I read the other reviews and bought an extra set. I also had this about one month and the batteries started running low. When I tried to replace them, I could not find a icon showing me which way to insert batteries and I put the batteries in wrong and for some reason it messed up, and would not work. I finally found the emblem telling me which way to put batteries in, but by then the damage was done. I called the company and they said send us the old one we will send you a new one free of charge! I was very happy! This is worth every penny and then some! Oh, and I hardly EVER get zits now!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a month now and I am so amazied with it. My skin is completely clear of any bumps and the size of the pores on my nose have shrunk to become almost invisible. My face has never felt so clean and flawless.!! Thanks kandee Johnson for suggesting this product!.</li>
            <li> I bought this product during summer and I had very high expectations for it based on all the hype about this product (TV, YOUTUBE CHANNELS, FRIENDS) I am 18 years old, and when I bought this item I used it for about 3-4 weeks trying to get rid of acne as (the real dermanew website) claims to do as well, as other benefits when using the dermanew I was highly dissapointed it didn&#x27;t do much of anything except irratate my skin, cause even more break outs and cause me to spend even more money to get rid of the damage and the sponge on the knob of the dermanew began to get really dirty even after washing it with regular soap and water (as it says to do). Also the wash product it self was alright, but it definatly did not live up to the benefits it promises to do for myself. My mom also bought this product with me and was dissapointed (She hoped for a better alternative product to anti aging- and sunspots and hoped this producted would do wonders) we both were dissapointed we eneded up just going to a dermatologist. If you do choose to buy this do not use it more then onece a week. But I wouldn&#x27;t expect TOO much.</li>
            <li> My first facial brush; Love at first sight! Never had I used anything that cleaned my face more profoundly and then... it died on me less than a month later. :\ No amount of tinkering got it working again. Maybe it was just a dud but it was a big disappointment at the same time.</li>
            <li> i bought this after juicystar07 on youtube started raving about it. i bought it. it was a waste of 70 dollars. it doesnt work that well. id recommend a facial brush form sephora.</li>
            <li> I purchased the DermaNew microderm kit after having it recommended by a friend. Wow, she was right! I love this thing! It makes your skin feel super clean and sloughs off all that dullness to reveal awesome new bright skin. It has improved my complexion and helped me fight off those fine lines and dull spots.</li>
            <li> I scrub twice daily with the bristle end and use the sponge and cream once a week. My face is soft and so much cleaner feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the hot humid south and it seems like my face was holding in a lot of sweaty greasy dirt, this has helped immensely. Yippee</li>
            <li> DermaNew got the grit just right.  It&#x27;s not too gritty, it&#x27;s not smooth like plastic beads that don&#x27;t really work.  I have to admit that I don&#x27;t use the sponge applicator at all, it seems a bit unnecessary to me.  However, the vibrating brush helps to really get that grit working.      My skin feels softer than it&#x27;s felt since I was a kid.  I&#x27;m noticing some improvement of my pit scarring as well.     The only thing that would improve this product would be to get rid of the foam applicator and add a revolving brush.      (Sheila)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to adequately express how delighted I am with this little machine!  I have combination/sensitive/acne prone skin and I&#x27;m kissing 50.  I was worried that this machine would be too rough on my skin and make a bad situation worse.  To the absolute contrary!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week - 3 times (currently doing every other day and taking off the weekend)and my skin has never, never, never looked this clear and smooth in my life!  I literally just stare in the mirror at how much better my skin is looking.  The pores have absolutely gotten smaller (and if you have oily skin, you know how we are plagued with large pores that can be seen a block away).  The small dry patches are gone.  The congested areas where it looked like whiteheads were forming - gone.  Blackheads on my nose and chin - gone.  And when I put my moisturizer on, I feel like it&#x27;s really moisturizing my skin now and I don&#x27;t have to reapply.  My makeup is going on flawlessly now - I&#x27;m actually using less of it and not applying so much concealer to cover acne.  This was worth every single dime I spent on it.  I&#x27;ve now started using it on my hands (I read somewhere that the skin on your hands was very much like the skin on the face - so if it works on the face so well, I should see similar results on my hands) and now even my hands are looking younger and smoother.  I&#x27;m so happy with this product and would encourage anyone curious about it to give a try - if you don&#x27;t like it, just send it back.  Unless you were blessed with perfect, clear, luminous skin, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not seeing a marked improvement in the texture, clarity and luminosity of their skin.  LOVE THIS MACHINE!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a year and I like. The brush part works great and the cream that comes with this is very good. The sponge side of this (the smaller one you use for your face) came unglued after about 8 uses! I contacted Derma New and the amazon seller but I didn&#x27;t get anywhere. So now I am just using the large body sponge on my face. I like how this works on my skin it def makes a difference and I will continue to use it but I think this system is over priced. I would check out a drug store version first before ordering this.</li>
            <li> I have tried anything and everything to get rid of the acne and scarring on the sides of my face.  Nothing worked too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works wonders, though.  You actually get a really good deal for the prices: the tool itself with a low and high setting, a brush head, a tear-dropped shaped sponge head (to reach harder areas of your face), a larger tear-dropped shaped sponge head (for body scrubbing!), the sensitive skin microdermabrasion scrub, double a batteries, and a stand so your tool isn&#x27;t lying around on your counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dermabrasion tool itself is so convenient.  It has two settings; low and high, so either you can do a deep cleanse or intense microdermabrasion.  When you press the power button, a red light comes on, indicating that it will automatically shut off in two minutes. Press the button again, and you can go to town on your face as long as you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like having two different heads to choose from.  I use the brush for cleaning my face and the tear-drop thing (which can be compared to a foam foundation wedge) for microdermabrasion.  My tear-drop has no signs of wear and tear, and I make sure to clean it every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use the sensitive-skin scrub that comes with, it really does work wonders.  The scrub is so gritty, it&#x27;s even finer than sand, and when you work it onto your dry face you can definitely feel your old skin getting \\&quot;sanded\\&quot; off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily.  I use the brush in the morning just for cleaning, but I use the tear drop shape at night.  My acne and scarring have definitely lessened.  I have had just one pimple pop up since I started using this, and I used to have breakouts all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not recommended to do this every day, but until my acne fully goes away, I will be doing this nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little information pamphlet also gives you directions on how to deep clean and on microdermabrasion, which I thought was really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot stress enough the convenience of this little tool.  The batteries haven&#x27;t faultered a bit and with the 2 minute shut-off  I know exactly when to stop.  Having a stand doesn&#x27;t seem like a big plus, but really it is!  I&#x27;m not leaving it on my counter-top exposed to everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for in the shower.  It&#x27;s waterproof so you can scrub while your hair is conditioning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> My favorite at home dermabrasion system.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It came with two sponge pads (one for face, one for body), a bristle brush, a bottle of microdermabrasion, two batteries, and cleaner for the sponges. It was completely ready for use the minute I took it out of the package. There are 2 settings, one that lets it run for 2 minutes, the other runs until you turn it off. I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin tone (more evenness in color) and it has definitely minimized my pores. My face is smooth and feels refreshed after using this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am concurring with the review written by user &#x27;SasyApron&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a couple of times I can say that is not worth the money. The face pads are cheaply made and they wear away within 2 weeks. The body applicator and brush are something we never use. On top of that to buy the pads again it will cost you another $15 that disintegrate after 3-4 uses. So it is a rip off scam for a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> The power button stopped working 2 days past the warranty date  Junk. It was good while it lasted, but I feel robbed.</li>
            <li> After using this product I had a lot of black spots on my skin. Mostly on the side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Both sides. I dont like long hair. But now I grow so I can cover those ugly spots.&lt;br /&gt;It been over a year now and spots are still very visible. Please stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very sensitive skin. Not sure if that is the reason. But I am very angry to have used  this product</li>
            <li> Nice device, works well. The stand is not the best it could stand a little improvement.</li>
            <li> The DermaNew facial system is amazing.  I have been using it for over a year now and the results speak for themselves.  I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift, and really liked it for the 12 months that the creme and applicator sponges lasted. But I recently went to place an order for replacements, and found that it&#x27;s $25 for the pads, and $36 for the creme... so it costs more to buy the replacement pieces than it did to purchase the entire kit in the first place. This is such a sleazy way to turn a profit. I&#x27;m switching brands just to boycott this company.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as an alternative to microderm abrasion sessions at a salon.  I just couldn&#x27;t justify $100 a session when they were telling me I needed six sessions or so.  So, I read the reviews and decided on this product.  It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks, and you INSTANTLY have smoother skin.  I can tell this is really working because my clogged pores are getting cleaned out.  I do not normally break out, and it has made me break out a bit more than usual, but I think it&#x27;s because all this gunk is getting cleaned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this, and I feel good about the purchase.</li>
            <li> When I received this product I was so excited!  BUT then I opened it and the facial product had opened and was all over everything. So needless to say that alot of my facial product was gone.</li>
            <li> The bottle of scrub was burst when I got it. I didn&#x27;t feel like returing it because I was so anxious to try it out. I came here by recommendation of Kandee Johnson from YouTube. Personally, I think I&#x27;ve heard better things about ClairSonic and wish I&#x27;d tried that instead.</li>
            <li> Love this system, been using this product for years and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product a few times to date, however I like the results I&#x27;ve seen.  After applying I find my skin to be radiant and it could be only my imagination, but I believe some fine lines have diminished.  The jury&#x27;s still out, but I&#x27;m giving the thumbs up just by virtue of how wonderful my skin feels after just a few minutes usage.</li>
            <li> This company stole my product. The cheap product broke about a couple months after I bought it. I call and ask them to replace it. The asked me to send it first and then once they receive it they would send me the replacement one. It&#x27;s been over a year and I am still waiting for it. I would never buy a thing from this so untrusting company. They suck. their product sucks also. Hate it. By the way I tried to call them so many times and they keep telling me that the must lost it or whatever excuse they can come up with, BUT NEVER GAVE ME MY PRODUCT BACK... THIEFS,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my own use and it did not really work as well has I had hoped. I would not recommend it for anyone who has fragile or sensitive skin. Even with a very light touch the scrubber can leave the skin red and stinging after use. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and was nervous because I am prone to breakouts from new products. I ordered the acne &amp; oil version of this system and have only used it four times in the last four days. I am so happy! I have read that you can use it 5 days in a row  to resurface your face and then STOP for 5 days before going to a 3x&#x27;s a week schedule. I could tell the difference after the first use. I am on my 4th use and my skin is 100% clear and glowing. I am 35 years old have not had clear skin in months! I recently went off of proactiv because i was getting wrinkles and the BP was making my skin look leathery. Since then, I have not been able to control my black heads or bumps and unusually erupt around my chin daily with few clear days. I haven&#x27;t been free of pimples in about 6 months. This product is amazing. I have been using it in combination with Neutrogena night wrinkle cream after each use with Retinol before going to bed. It says on the packaging not to use the system with retin-A so I am not sure if this is a bad combination - but it works wonders for my skin. I feel like a new woman...</li>
            <li> Great product....sturdy and easy to use. My skin felt amazing and noticeably different after the first use; use your own favorite product together with the machine and &#x27;feel&#x27; results.</li>
            <li> I bought it after I saw it endorsed on a beauty website but the results are not very satisfying. I bought clarisonic Mia recently and I absolutely love it. If you are looking for a deep clean, save up and invest in Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to have great results from this product, but it didn&#x27;t quite measure up. First off the cream doesn&#x27;t even smell quite as good as the ones I own which was a total waste of money and afterwards it felt like there were little grains of sand all over my face which were quite difficult to wash off as well. And my skin was so sensitive that it was feeling quite agitated after using the Dermanew. I am going to send this product back right away. So if you have ultra sensitive skin or rosacea don&#x27;t even try this product.</li>
            <li> All it does is vibrate. I thought the brushes/sponges rotated in a circular motion or did something fabulous. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good product for your face</li>
            <li> After using this last night, I can honestly say that my skin glowed and felt very smooth and soft to the touch.  But I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to the microdermabrasion cream that is used in conjunction with it, or the actual vibrating wand.  It seems like a spinning head would be more ideal, as the vibration is very slight, almost useless.  Still, can&#x27;t argue with beautiful skin!  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After using this system for a few weeks, I felt it was time for an update.  I have changed my rating from four stars to only two stars. The scrub that comes with the wand is the real star of the show...its what actually gets the job done.  The vibrating wand is useless.  The scrub is a gritty cream that&#x27;s great for sloughing off dead cells from the skin&#x27;s surface, but doesn&#x27;t last very long at all, and is very expensive!  I can get the same effect for a lot less money by using baking soda and my fingers. Save your money!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find I could no longer purchase sponges and such for my Youthful Essence.  I saw that this was from the same company and ordered it.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and love that it has a timer and less time required for the scrub.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a lady who blogs who is really great said this was great. I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t buy it at the normal price. It&#x27;s alright maybe just not for me.</li>
            <li> Got this product as I had heard so much about it got my order in and it arrived early very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> maybe it really works for someone but for me it did not even work for one star... I do not know what to do with it, sell or to give it away?! lolzzzzz</li>
            <li> This damaged my skin and I had to get treatment after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Dermanew kit with the provided lotion on the lower part of my face where I have more blackheads. Within two days of using it the pores on my chin became very hard and formed bumps all over. The bumps remained on my face for about 3 months.  I had a blanket of small hard balls all over the lower part of my face. Even if I tried my typical black head removal practices of steaming the area, exfoliation, or pressure, nothing would come out. Eventually I had to get some of the blackheads professionally cut out because they would not come out - my skin encased them. After about four months, my face&#x27;s elasticity returned and my skin is back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps! I&#x27;m staying with chemical-free products from now on!</li>
            <li> I use it on a daily basis. Does a great job cleaning my pores and keeping my skin looking and feeling young.</li>
            <li> this is amazing item, my skin feels so good, i have purchased one before, i like that this has two sides that fits different heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what i think. I bough it 6 months ago it didn&#x27;t help with sun damage like brown spots n fine wrinkles like it says i just feel my skin a little smoother after i euse it i have sensitive skin. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> so far I love this product, I had no problems setting it up and using it the first time.  Works Great!  Purchased one like this from Sephora for my daughter was a lot more found this one for under 60.00</li>
            <li> Click on see all my reviews next to each positive review.... 50% or more of these people have reviewed MULTIPLE items. Some as many as 18 pages worth. Paid reviewers?????? Beware</li>
            <li> This thing is a miracle worker. My skin feels amazing after every use and I&#x27;ve noticed that after a couple uses it looks much better as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift from the in-laws and I&#x27;ve already use it a dozen times. I usually love using it when taking a bath - just to sit there and relax while I run it all over myself, giving me a nice little facial. You know, I have to say it has worked surprisingly well. I don&#x27;t use the brush side as much as the sponges, and I like the smaller sponge just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DermaNew is really a great way to take care of your skin. It has a timer that goes off after 2 minutes or so, and you should really run it at least that long to get the full benefits. Here&#x27;s my little process: I make sure I have no make-up on, wash my face with cold water, then pat it dry but still some dampness, and then I put a few dabs of the scrubbing cream all over my face, I&#x27;m very generous with it - you don&#x27;t need to be - and then I get to work on giving myself a facial. After I finish, I wash again with cold water and put just toner on nothing else. It feels wonderful. The more you do it the better, not daily but I would say at least once a week. Love this little mini spa at home. Your skin deserves the VERY best!</li>
            <li> Great tool for buffing off old skin.  I use it every 2-3 days and love the results so far.  My skin is so much softer and some of the acne scars have gone away.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure but if you&#x27;re patient and take the time, it will definitely make a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> Had the product worked, I might have liked it.  The darned thing would stay running.  Tried everything I knew how to get it to stay on.  Run a few sec, then shuts off.  Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Reduced my acne scars fine lines and bags almost instantly ,&lt;br /&gt;Reduces my breakouts and makes my face feel younger.&lt;br /&gt;Was running out of options and then I found this.&lt;br /&gt;Seer amazing !</li>
            <li> This product does make your skin feel much softer after use without having to pay for a facial. It comes with two foam pad attachments and works well.</li>
            <li> I expected better results from this product, I cannot see much difference in my skin after I use the facial system</li>
            <li> I bought this item on the recommendation of a YouTube Beauty Guru and I love it.  It does a good job of exfoliating and it&#x27;s easy and fun to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
