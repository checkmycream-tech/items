            <li>Great set!</li>
            <li>These are the best files around.</li>
            <li>Perfect product.</li>
            <li>Marvelous price.</li>
            <li>If you want the best for your nails</li>
            <li>very good finger and toe nail files.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality.</li>
            <li>These are great and seem to be a bit finer grit than others I have used.  </li>
            <li>Really happy with these.</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>These are great files.  </li>
            <li>The price is great as well.  </li>
            <li>I very pleased with these files.</li>
            <li>I love these nail files!  </li>
            <li>with this Czech Crystal Glass File set, he can safely file the nails without worrying about damaging skin, and he doesn&#x27;t have to hunt for the industrial strength nail clippings (so others won&#x27;t be injured on them) because now filing his nails turns the excess to micro-dust!  </li>
            <li>Good nail files, however don&#x27;t drop them, they break easily.</li>
            <li>The large size is perfect for dressing the callouses on my fretting fingers, it works quickly and leaves the surface very smooth.</li>
            <li>I recently discovered how wonderful it is to use crystal nail files, and my Dad decided to order a set.  </li>
            <li>These etched glass files work much better than the &amp;#34;sandpaper&amp;#34; type files</li>
            <li>The images don&#x27;t really give a good idea of the size.</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s about a good of an experience as I could hope for.  </li>
            <li>Just rinse them under water and they are good as new.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price for the set, but I do wish I was able to comfortably use all three files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>files are easy to clean (tapping them lightly on a folded hand towel removes built-up dust, and hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol disinfect the surfaces.</li>
            <li>They glide smoothly over the nail edge and file the nail quickly, smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>If you have similar sensitivities these files may not be a good fit for you, but I love them.</li>
            <li>Sent these to my Daughter as a stocking Stuffer she is over the moon for them!Thank you for such a great product</li>
            <li>The two smaller sizes are good for shaping nails.  </li>
            <li>These just seem to have a crystal finish or coating that wears away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other brands just as capable, this kit was the first I could find in any type of masculine color palate and the three sizes were perfect for one at home, one at work and one in my backpack.</li>
            <li>and I have a feeling they won&#x27;t last as long, but they do a nice job of filing and are a good replacement for me.</li>
            <li>so I think I&#x27;ll mostly put the two smaller files to use.</li>
            <li>THESE get the job done - and fast!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying my second set!</li>
            <li>Love these seem to last.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s almost too big for me to comfortably use</li>
            <li>Proper nail care is important and I file both my picking hand nails and fretting hand callouses a couple times each week.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>i particularly like the three different sizes available.</li>
            <li>Better than other crystal files I have owned.  </li>
            <li>They are the real etched type not the painted on kind.. will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Spend a bit more and get actual crystal files that last forever.</li>
            <li>They far better than the ordinary ones available in the regular markets.</li>
            <li>As a massage therapist my nail trim must be short and smooth as glass, with no rough edges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that they won&#x27;t wear down like regular nail files.  </li>
            <li>These DO NOT dull.</li>
            <li>They took a little getting used to, but after a few minutes I was filing away and they worked great.  </li>
            <li>My only surprise was with how HUGE the big one is.</li>
            <li>I occasionally have to order a new set because I am constantly misplacing the middle size file, which is the one I use the most-</li>
            <li>and I just like to quickly take off the rough edges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And there is no sandpaper grit from more common files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would expect these to be a little more hardy, especially considering it was not roughly handled, nor was it dropped.</li>

            <li> I love these nail files!  They glide smoothly over the nail edge and file the nail quickly, smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Better than other crystal files I have owned.  These are great and seem to be a bit finer grit than others I have used.  Really happy with these.</li>
            <li> These DO NOT dull. Just rinse them under water and they are good as new. I occasionally have to order a new set because I am constantly misplacing the middle size file, which is the one I use the most- if I was less scatterbrained this would be the last set I would ever need! Beware of impostors that are coated and NOT etched!</li>
            <li> I have long had a CHI crystal nail file which finally broke and since I was unable to find a replacement, I ordered these. They seem a bit thinner than the CHI and I have a feeling they won&#x27;t last as long, but they do a nice job of filing and are a good replacement for me. My only surprise was with how HUGE the big one is. The images don&#x27;t really give a good idea of the size. The larger one is designated for toe nails but it&#x27;s almost too big for me to comfortably use so I think I&#x27;ll mostly put the two smaller files to use. Not a bad price for the set, but I do wish I was able to comfortably use all three files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/23/15: I downgraded my rating to 3 stars because one of these files has already broken. It was in a pocket of my purse, in its protective sleeve, and it just shattered into several pieces. I would expect these to be a little more hardy, especially considering it was not roughly handled, nor was it dropped.</li>
            <li> THESE get the job done - and fast!  Carry the smaller one with me in case a nail tears while out. Fits in my wallet!  Great set!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not used to using a glass nail file these will send you into a squirm-fest.  They took a little getting used to, but after a few minutes I was filing away and they worked great.  I&#x27;m thrilled that they won&#x27;t wear down like regular nail files.  However, when I asked my husband and daughter to give them a try they squirmed like someone was dragging their nails down a chalkboard and when they were done wiggling around and squealing both of them put down the file and walked away, lol.  If you have similar sensitivities these files may not be a good fit for you, but I love them.</li>

            <li> very good finger and toe nail files.  no complaints.</li>
            <li> Sent these to my Daughter as a stocking Stuffer she is over the moon for them!Thank you for such a great product</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s about a good of an experience as I could hope for.  I&#x27;m a guy and I just like to quickly take off the rough edges.&lt;br /&gt;My wife, however, LOVES them and especially appreciates the dual-sided foot file for taming the callouses.  Flip-flop season is here!</li>
            <li> These are great files.  The price is great as well.  They are the real etched type not the painted on kind.. will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love these seem to last.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered how wonderful it is to use crystal nail files, and my Dad decided to order a set.

            <li> I play finger-style guitar and clawhammer.  Proper nail care is important and I file both my picking hand nails and fretting hand callouses a couple times each week.  These etched glass files work much better than the &amp;#34;sandpaper&amp;#34; type files and they&#x27;re holding up well.  The two smaller sizes are good for shaping nails.  They leave a smoother edge and I haven&#x27;t had a split nail since using these.  The large size is perfect for dressing the callouses on my fretting fingers, it works quickly and leaves the surface very smooth.</li>
            <li> Spend a bit more and get actual crystal files that last forever. These just seem to have a crystal finish or coating that wears away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Perfect product. Very good quality. Fast delivery. Marvelous price. If you want the best for your nails this is it!</li>
