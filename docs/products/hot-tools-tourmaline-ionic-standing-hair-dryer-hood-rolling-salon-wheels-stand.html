            <li>It has two heat settings, high and low.</li>
            <li>Two speed settings, high and low, and it has an on/off ionic knob.</li>

            <li> great dryer, easy to put together, gets hot very fast</li>
            <li> The heat setting is only two it said it would have four not happy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too loud, so i didn&#x27;t used it a lot,(like aroud seven times)the last time i used it, it stop working suddenly and it smells like something just burned, already is in the dumpster.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a Christmas gift.  The recipient got it on time and is using it and enjoying it.  Now no need to go the the salon so very often and is saving a lot of money and time by doing hair at home.  Everything was packaged securely and very easy to put together. Ordered on 01/22/2015 Delivery Estimate: January 28, 2015 - February 2, 2015 Shipped on 01/26/2015 Recevied on 01/29/2015</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gets hotter than the normal hooded dryers yet my ears don&#x27;t get hot because it&#x27;s enough off the top &amp; the angled purple walls directs the heat up at my hair and does not concentrate on my ears.  I used to have to stop everything so I can hold my old dryer in certain positions that I could stand it, now I can just roll it up to whatever chair I&#x27;m sitting in &amp; continue doing whatever I&#x27;m doing!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item so I could return to styling my granddaughter&#x27;s hair at home. I was very upset that she and her mother had chosen to perm her hair, because it is falling out terribly. The dryer functions very well with minimum noise. She does not mind sitting under it. Her hair was thoroughly dried. It stores very well out of site in a closet. My grandson tries to use the stand as a coat rack. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer and it has been a complete disaster...luckily I am here to tell the story. It is DANGEROUS...the dryer must have overheated...started melting and caught on firm. It caused burns on my scalp and neck...I would love to sue the company for a defective and health hazard product.[[ASIN:B0012HEGCI HOT Tools Tourmaline Ionic 1875 Watt Rollaround Dryer with Pro-moisture System Model #1059 Sale!]]</li>
            <li> My purchase of the Hot Tools Tourmaline Ionic Standing Hair Dryer was a great investment. I love the purple and black color. It has two heat settings, high and low. Two speed settings, high and low, and it has an on/off ionic knob. It has an adjustable pole which is great when you have more than one person using it. It also has wheels so it is easy for me to roll it around the house. This is much better that the hooded dryer that I had to sit on the table and find a chair low enough so I could fit under the hood. I use my dryer on a weekly basis. The hood is very roomy and has a flip up front. I can dry my hair with large rollers with no problem. Now I can get the salon feel of the hair dryer at home.</li>
            <li> Bought this in May and it just died (August)  this is the second one of these to die quickly.  Clearly I need to find a more reliable brand.</li>
            <li> First time I set it up the base where the wheels are cracked! !!</li>
            <li> This is great product!</li>
            <li> great design base could be more sturdy</li>
            <li> Had this dryer a little over a year. Quit getting hot. I didn&#x27;t use it very often. Did not last!</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of  being able to wash and set my hair at home.(I&#x27;m  very talented  in that area) I only WISH that the &amp;#34;HIGH&amp;#34; temperature were NOT SO HOT....as I have to take  cotton to place in areas in between the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that they should have offered a &amp;#34;MEDIUM SETTING&amp;#34; would be a improvement!</li>
            <li> I bought this for using at home on family and friends and it works just great! Great dryer for the cheap price!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product from Amazon more than a year ago and have had no issues with it all. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Im a professional salon owner and i bought this. Something inside broke off and every time it is turnes on it makes this excruciating click clank cling sound that hurts your ears while under the dryer plus the loud sound of the dryer. I have to use it on the lowest settings which takes hours upon hours just to dry.  I used this dryer 3 times before the problem started.</li>
            <li> I have  2 girls and me with long hair in my family. I find very helpful to use for different hairstyle actually with very long hair.&lt;br /&gt;I gave only 4 stars because it is not the best quality but for the price is good enough!&lt;br /&gt;Was a good buy, try it.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE DOES HAIR..SHE ENJOY THIS</li>
