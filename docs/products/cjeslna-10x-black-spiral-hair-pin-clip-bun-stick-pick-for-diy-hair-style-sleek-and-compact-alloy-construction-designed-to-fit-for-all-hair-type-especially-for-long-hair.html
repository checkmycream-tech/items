            <li>Every girl needs their own set!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Goody brand &amp;#34;spin pins&amp;#34; before and loved them.</li>
            <li>Took over three weeks to receive, but arrived in bubble mailer, in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good substitution and would save me some money.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, good.</li>
            <li>That seems to me like a good fix to the problem if you already bought this product.</li>
            <li>At the price, they are a good value</li>
            <li>This is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Good thing:</li>
            <li>These are just as good as the ones I got at Walmart that were $6 for 2 of them.</li>
            <li>but I thought it was still a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>Great my favorite hair accessories</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found these!  </li>
            <li>I can do so many things with my medium curly hair now!  </li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I love these pins!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Bought here - these things are magic!</li>
            <li>I love my spin pins!</li>
            <li>I love these hair pins!</li>
            <li>The price fit the amount was great.</li>
            <li>the spiral hair pin works amazing in holding her hair up.  </li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing design and</li>
            <li>/&gt;These cheap, Chinese-made spin pins are great.</li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>Item arrived BEFORE the estimated date which was nice.</li>
            <li>Good price for that many.</li>
            <li>which I really liked it</li>
            <li>these had some kind of plastic coating on the end I would have given them 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It took forever to get the pins, but they are wonderful and a real deal.</li>
            <li>and these are really effective at pinning it up.</li>
            <li>Kind of like a screw in wood.</li>
            <li>They are very effective, even for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re great to carry in your purse for a quick change up.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy.</li>
            <li>Nice and secure!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to have so many and not have to worry.</li>
            <li>OMG these are amazing and so much better than the $12 - $14 ones you get at the stores.</li>
            <li>a get the Goody brand, which is much more substantial and has nice rubber ends.</li>
            <li>right lol</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I originally bought these curl pins (as I call them) at WalMart and loved them.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really nice to be able to just keep sticking in more without having to even think about it.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>These are fine, honestly.</li>
            <li>Works but need more to do the job.</li>
            <li>What more can I say - the youtube clips about these pins are telling the truth.</li>
            <li>These get a two because of the great effort they make to keep these reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>i love the twisty hair pins, they do for my hair</li>
            <li>but they are way more money than these.</li>
            <li>So I order quite many of these.</li>
            <li>I have a pair I bought at the store gave that pair to my sister because I was getting this order need to be longer but still love them</li>
            <li>I love this and the idea</li>
            <li>Wish I could find more uses for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get some more Goody&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>To be frank, I love the price, they serve their function, and it comes with way more than the Goody brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving these 4 stars because you really do get a great value here.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic, much better than bobby pins.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many clips or pins that stand the test of vigorous movement.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for pins which really hold when you move, these are great.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>These are awesome for buns, french twists and whatever.</li>
            <li>I bought a pair of original Spin Pins at Target for $6, which seemed a bit steep for two hair pins, but they worked magically!</li>
            <li>They work perfectly for buns or for roll back hair styles.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>The ones I got wasn&#x27;t plastic, it&#x27;s metal and having deform after many uses.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cause pain or pulling when properly placed and allow me to create perfect &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; up-dos.</li>
            <li>I can finally do all those awesome Pinterest hairdos.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>and you get more for your money.</li>
            <li>I love how these spiral hair pins hold your hair.  </li>
            <li>They work OK.  </li>
            <li>Honestly though, these cost like 12 cents apiece right now, so even if they broke after one use they&#x27;d probably still be more cost effective than the goody ones considering how easy it is to lose hair pins.</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t happy with this particular brand compared to the Goody brand.</li>
            <li>If normal pins work for you these may be great.</li>
            <li>They arrived before the estimated delivery date and they work pretty good.</li>
            <li>Excellent for holding long hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect for securing long hair onto my head</li>
            <li>The pins are pretty good</li>
            <li>These things are perfect for long hair.</li>
            <li>I got these spin pins to secure my top bun.</li>
            <li>These weren&#x27;t available when I went to order more and</li>
            <li>I love my original spin pins.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy!</li>
            <li>These are super easy to use!</li>
            <li>twist in and out easily without tangling</li>
            <li>spin pins are so easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use, well made.</li>
            <li>These hair pins work so easily and hold hair in place well.</li>
            <li>They are easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li>Great price and quality considering the retail stores charge much more for a smaller quantity.</li>
            <li>love these so even went back and ordered more!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It normally takes me two hair ties and 20 bobby pins to get a good bun, with these I just twist one in from each side and it stays all day without pulling.</li>
            <li>it was fine to just wait a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>people are fine without treating the tips at all</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the huge discount on the price I guess.</li>
            <li>The product is definitely worth the waiting. :)</li>
            <li>so it took 3 of these to keep my hair secure.</li>
            <li>definitely shorter than its competitor, but a great value.</li>
            <li>feels light</li>
            <li>These work well, but the finish isn&#x27;t entirely smooth.</li>
            <li>Fit in hair so well</li>
            <li>I thought they were a great length, not at all too short</li>
            <li>These work great, especially for sock buns and poufy hairdos.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a fantastic invention.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely secure and don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>Took a few weeks to get but they are perfect!</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap version of the original.  </li>
            <li>I loved the idea of being able to use less pins and have them be more secure.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>The original ones I purchased at WalMart</li>
            <li>These honestly work great holding up buns in my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>These pins were cheap, but are also pretty cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I bought them because I already had a pack of the Goody Spin Pins and loved them - but the Goody brand only has two in a pack.  </li>
            <li>holds very well, wish they were a bit more flexible though.</li>
            <li>For the price this item is great; however, the ends are to sharp and can cause hair damage.</li>
            <li>I can do a perfect french twist with only ONE of these buggers - it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sellers product much better quality</li>
            <li>Love, love, love these little tools.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, they are cheap in price, but not in quality.</li>
            <li>They sell them individually at most drug stores for way too much money, but it&#x27;s a bobby pin, so this is the right price and the right sturdiness.</li>
            <li>These are a great amount of spin pins for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>These little hair screws work great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth it though for the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth it, will order again.</li>
            <li>Useful stays in place.</li>
            <li>For the price and amount of pins, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>These things are made of witchcraft and are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They make my quick hairstyles so much quicker!  </li>
            <li>These take some practice to get right</li>
            <li>Still, the price of these is excellent, and as long as you are careful when putting in and taking out the pins, the sharper ends shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li>I used clear nail polish on the ends so they weren&#x27;t as rough and that works great.</li>
            <li>I have very soft and smooth hair and no bobby pin will stay in.</li>
            <li>I was able to get my super long hair in a Gibson tuck and keep it there all day with spin pins!</li>
            <li>I recommend these, so easy to use quickly gets hair out of the way, especially when in the kitchen</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I bought extra.</li>
            <li>They really do hold my long hair nicely.</li>
            <li>in all - even with the extra work to make these work better - you can&#x27;t beat the value you get out of this deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to put a dab of hot glue on the ends</li>
            <li>For such an inexpensive price, I can&#x27;t expect much more but if you are considering these be aware.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested  to fix that problem by adding a bit of silicon with a hot glue gun.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re smart and put them in right</li>
            <li>I still need 4-5 screwed in in different directions to hold up a bun, for instance, but it&#x27;s certainly better than bobby pins.</li>
            <li>These were able to hold my hair up in a bun with only 3.</li>
            <li>They are also about 3/4 of the size of standard Spin Pins; they are more like the minis.</li>
            <li>They hold more hair than the standard bobby pin and hold it tighter too!</li>
            <li>These are exactly like the &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34; brand you find in stores.</li>
            <li>can get a perfect bun with nothing but a hair tie and two of these, but usually add about six for extra security.</li>
            <li>One of these does the job of many regular bobby pins.  </li>
            <li>Love how easy to keep hair up just wish they were a little longer</li>
            <li>Also a little more cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>They are sturdy and smooth, with no sharp edges.</li>
            <li>5 foot long hair and hair stuff is super important to me.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also pretty fast (came a *lot</li>
            <li>They are suspiciously cheap, yes, but they work much much better than the (more expensive) metal ones.</li>
            <li>Am going to purchase more in the future for other family and friends :-)</li>
            <li>Easy to use, you simply just twist them in.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, curly hair and these pins are awesome.  </li>
            <li>tried placing hot glue in edges to make them soft but the glue came right off</li>
            <li>Thanks to him there are a few stuck under the fridge, but nbd because it came with SOOO many!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty steady too.</li>
            <li>Granted the shipping took a little longer because it came from China, but being that this was such a great deal</li>
            <li>Not as painful as bunches of bobby pins, and they&#x27;re able to grab a lot more hair, so you don&#x27;t need as many.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a very pointy end like people say but for the price just use a piece of sandpaper or metal nail file.</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>and they shipped fast.</li>
            <li>They stay in her hair really well and hold her hair in place.</li>
            <li>these really work</li>
            <li>but it is really overpriced</li>
            <li>so my scalp doesn&#x27;t hurt even after a whole day of my hair being up in a bun.  </li>
            <li>Can hold a bun the whole day without needing to redo my hair.</li>
            <li>and they really do the trick.</li>
            <li>These were better quality than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>They cannot hold a bun up for a whole day.</li>
            <li>A much cheaper alternative to store brand spin pins, which are about $6 a PAIR.</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>so putting it in a bun and have it stay was a real challenge.</li>
            <li>but they hold up my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I ordered these even though I had heard they have sharp ends, I figured it was worth the risk since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and no sharp ends!</li>
            <li>You may have to use more clips for updos then you would with other brands.</li>
            <li>The spiral design is great for holding my long, straight hair up in a messy bun, but do yourself a favor</li>
            <li>I have very long, straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>A simple solution would be to work each end with a dremel (I tried a file and a sander, but those don&#x27;t do a good a job as a dremel - remember, you&#x27;re still sanding down metal) and then buy liquid plastic to coat the end.  </li>
            <li>my hair bun is secure and sturdy all day long with these pins.</li>
            <li>Strange packaging, but arrived securely.</li>
            <li>perfect for long thick hair holds in place no slipping</li>
            <li>but this particular brand did not.</li>
            <li>The main writing translates as &amp;#34;Hairpin of the Screw&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These work great for securing a bun, especially for people with thick hair like me.</li>
            <li>I purchased a pair of the Goody Simple Styles Spin Pin from Amazon a while back and fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>but I was starting to run out, so I&#x27;m so glad I finally found a place that sells them.</li>
            <li>and so the whole updo is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has long hair and was excited when she discovered this style of pin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend purchase</li>
            <li>Highly recommend because of the price.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They have little metal snags hanging off most of them.</li>
            <li>Makes a quick and easy updo for mornings that I am running late.</li>
            <li>There was just this sharp piece of metal that could (and did) easily stick in your scalp!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super useful and tight.</li>
            <li>Her hair is not really thick</li>
            <li>Great value, works just like the expensive one.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the shipping took a month; it wasn&#x27;t worth the wait.</li>
            <li>and then a few more of these to catch all the strays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these pins I use them in my hair everyday instead of hair ties that rip my hair out.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t dig into my head like normal bobby pins do.  </li>
            <li>My hair should be way too long for a Gibson tuck, but the spin pins were able to keep my hair rolled up properly inside the tuck.</li>
            <li>It takes tons of regular bobby pins to keep my hair in place, but about 5 of these in the right spot works as well as a banana clip.  </li>
            <li>As a ballerina with super long hair, I cannot live without these.</li>
            <li>I was hoping these would be a miracle solution for my thick, fine, slippery hair - but they slip right out just like normal bobby pins.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the ends sharp though, the ends are not as smooth as the Goody pins</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and there&#x27;s a ton of it, so typically bobby pins take like 10-15 to hold a normal bun in place.</li>
            <li>So for work now, I gather my hair into a low pony tail (but don&#x27;t actually put it in a pony tail), braid it and roll it into a bun which I secure with these pin curls.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, although I have allot of it, and it slips out and comes down when I wear it up for work.  </li>
            <li>the ends scrape your scalp too much, dab a drop of nail polish or hot glue and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li>These were slightly smaller than the first set of clips -</li>
            <li>I wasted so much money on the expensive Goody spin pins before I came across these awesome spiral pins.</li>
            <li>I usually intersect two, and they hold a bun better than a hairband.  </li>
            <li>They are especially useful to me because I have a TON of long, thick hair and the two I originally bought were not quite enough to hold it all up.</li>
            <li>The bare ends catch a little and the plastic would make them slide in better.  </li>
            <li>They arrived fairly quickly, but they are smaller than the regular Goodys pins.</li>
            <li>The material is not as strong, the tips are not covered so if you are not careful you might stab your scalp and the black sheath chips off.  </li>
            <li>These were amazing, I love spin pins but hate the price.</li>
            <li>Like a bobby pin that has lost the soft tips on the ends.  </li>
            <li>In fact, these pins do not have as much of a soft tip as the Goody brand</li>
            <li>I was very thankful for that, as the pictures left me a bit apprehensive.</li>
            <li>They still work nearly as well as the brand ones.</li>
            <li>The tips were not capped in any way, but they hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far.</li>
            <li>I just got my pins last night and they work really well.</li>
            <li>I used to just collect them every time I got my hair done professionally</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair that is currently cut with layers and was looking for a way to roll it back into a bun quickly and easily, and these pins do the trick well.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as the Goody Spin pins but ten for the price of one.</li>
            <li>not too sure what the other reviewers meant by the sharp or jagged ends.</li>
            <li>These seem to work similar to the name brand ones, however, the difference is the lack of smooth ball at the ends to prevent pulling of the hair which causes slight pain.</li>
            <li>I have thick straight hair that just wouldn&#x27;t give into any pins, but these actually manage to hold it up securely.</li>
            <li>Need to use a few for a tight fur but a nice change from a ponytail</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and when I put it up in a bun, I really needed three of the Goody spin pins.  </li>
            <li>They are not sharp, but they do lack the bulbous tip that some brands have, although a dab of hotmelt glue on the tip</li>
            <li>The ends are not sharp, and they&#x27;re rounded.</li>
            <li>The ends are not sharp at all, they are rounded just like the Goody version.</li>
            <li>My hair has some texture - loose waves - but I tend to wear it straight.</li>
            <li>Once you &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; them all the way in, they are very hard to see and remain mostly invisible.</li>
            <li>I have thick, long, straight hair down to just below my shoulders but these pins hold it up nicely.</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that the ends of the metal are not covered with a smooth plastic.  </li>
            <li>At least they were cheap, I guess.</li>
            <li>The spiral end is blunt and scratches my scalp if I am not extremely careful.  </li>
            <li>They are usable but do poke and scratch if not careful.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a bit smaller than the Goody brand, and the ends do not have a soft plastic end.</li>
            <li>I kept losing my old ones, now I have them each placed in different rooms.  </li>
            <li>The ends are covered in laquer or whatever, but they do snag some and could scratch your scalp if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>These are okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using only two of them for the last couple of weeks, almost every day, and they still look brand new-</li>
            <li>Thought I wouldn&#x27;t need the whole pack, but you do end up misplacing them just like other hair pins.</li>
            <li>If you treat the ends like I described above, there are no sharp ends poking out and getting caught in things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spin pins, for those new to these little miracles of modern hair-science, are designed to hold your hair in place by essentially screwing into the different layers of your hair.</li>
            <li>so they were pretty much a waste.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super thick</li>
            <li>These are not long enough to hold a bun for me with just one clip (unlike the goody brand).  </li>
            <li>A bit thin, but work fine.</li>
            <li>They are a little shorter then the Goody version but not by much.</li>
            <li>but if I fiddle with them a little they don&#x27;t bother me too much.  </li>

            <li> Every girl needs their own set!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Goody brand &amp;#34;spin pins&amp;#34; before and loved them.</li>
            <li> Took over three weeks to receive, but arrived in bubble mailer, in good condition.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good substitution and would save me some money.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, good.</li>
            <li> That seems to me like a good fix to the problem if you already bought this product.</li>
            <li> At the price, they are a good value</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Good thing:</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the ones I got at Walmart that were $6 for 2 of them.</li>
            <li> but I thought it was still a good deal for the price.</li>

            <li> I love these hair pins!</li>
            <li> The price fit the amount was great.</li>
            <li> the spiral hair pin works amazing in holding her hair up.  </li>
            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing design and</li>
            <li> /&gt;These cheap, Chinese-made spin pins are great.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> Item arrived BEFORE the estimated date which was nice.</li>
            <li> Good price for that many.</li>
            <li> which I really liked it</li>
            <li> these had some kind of plastic coating on the end I would have given them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It took forever to get the pins, but they are wonderful and a real deal.</li>
            <li> and these are really effective at pinning it up.</li>
            <li> Kind of like a screw in wood.</li>
            <li> They are very effective, even for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re great to carry in your purse for a quick change up.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy.</li>
            <li> Nice and secure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to have so many and not have to worry.</li>
            <li> OMG these are amazing and so much better than the $12 - $14 ones you get at the stores.</li>
            <li> a get the Goody brand, which is much more substantial and has nice rubber ends.</li>
            <li> right lol</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> I originally bought these curl pins (as I call them) at WalMart and loved them.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really nice to be able to just keep sticking in more without having to even think about it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> These are fine, honestly.</li>
            <li> Works but need more to do the job.</li>
            <li> What more can I say - the youtube clips about these pins are telling the truth.</li>
            <li> These get a two because of the great effort they make to keep these reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> i love the twisty hair pins, they do for my hair</li>
            <li> but they are way more money than these.</li>
            <li> So I order quite many of these.</li>
            <li> I have a pair I bought at the store gave that pair to my sister because I was getting this order need to be longer but still love them</li>
            <li> I love this and the idea</li>
            <li> Wish I could find more uses for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get some more Goody&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> To be frank, I love the price, they serve their function, and it comes with way more than the Goody brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these 4 stars because you really do get a great value here.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic, much better than bobby pins.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many clips or pins that stand the test of vigorous movement.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for pins which really hold when you move, these are great.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> These are awesome for buns, french twists and whatever.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of original Spin Pins at Target for $6, which seemed a bit steep for two hair pins, but they worked magically!</li>
            <li> They work perfectly for buns or for roll back hair styles.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> The ones I got wasn&#x27;t plastic, it&#x27;s metal and having deform after many uses.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cause pain or pulling when properly placed and allow me to create perfect &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; up-dos.</li>
            <li> I can finally do all those awesome Pinterest hairdos.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> and you get more for your money.</li>
            <li> I love how these spiral hair pins hold your hair.  </li>
            <li> They work OK.  </li>
            <li> Honestly though, these cost like 12 cents apiece right now, so even if they broke after one use they&#x27;d probably still be more cost effective than the goody ones considering how easy it is to lose hair pins.</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t happy with this particular brand compared to the Goody brand.</li>
            <li> If normal pins work for you these may be great.</li>
            <li> They arrived before the estimated delivery date and they work pretty good.</li>
            <li> Excellent for holding long hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for securing long hair onto my head</li>
            <li> The pins are pretty good</li>
            <li> These things are perfect for long hair.</li>
            <li> I got these spin pins to secure my top bun.</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t available when I went to order more and</li>
            <li> I love my original spin pins.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy!</li>
            <li> These are super easy to use!</li>
            <li> twist in and out easily without tangling</li>
            <li> spin pins are so easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use, well made.</li>
            <li> These hair pins work so easily and hold hair in place well.</li>
            <li> They are easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality considering the retail stores charge much more for a smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> love these so even went back and ordered more!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It normally takes me two hair ties and 20 bobby pins to get a good bun, with these I just twist one in from each side and it stays all day without pulling.</li>
            <li> it was fine to just wait a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> people are fine without treating the tips at all</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the huge discount on the price I guess.</li>
            <li> The product is definitely worth the waiting. :)</li>
            <li> so it took 3 of these to keep my hair secure.</li>
            <li> definitely shorter than its competitor, but a great value.</li>
            <li> feels light</li>
            <li> These work well, but the finish isn&#x27;t entirely smooth.</li>
            <li> Fit in hair so well</li>
            <li> I thought they were a great length, not at all too short</li>
            <li> These work great, especially for sock buns and poufy hairdos.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a fantastic invention.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely secure and don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to get but they are perfect!</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap version of the original.  </li>
            <li> I loved the idea of being able to use less pins and have them be more secure.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> The original ones I purchased at WalMart</li>
            <li> These honestly work great holding up buns in my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> These pins were cheap, but are also pretty cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I bought them because I already had a pack of the Goody Spin Pins and loved them - but the Goody brand only has two in a pack.  </li>
            <li> holds very well, wish they were a bit more flexible though.</li>
            <li> For the price this item is great; however, the ends are to sharp and can cause hair damage.</li>
            <li> I can do a perfect french twist with only ONE of these buggers - it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sellers product much better quality</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these little tools.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, they are cheap in price, but not in quality.</li>
            <li> They sell them individually at most drug stores for way too much money, but it&#x27;s a bobby pin, so this is the right price and the right sturdiness.</li>
            <li> These are a great amount of spin pins for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> These little hair screws work great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth it though for the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth it, will order again.</li>
            <li> Useful stays in place.</li>
            <li> For the price and amount of pins, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> These things are made of witchcraft and are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They make my quick hairstyles so much quicker!  </li>
            <li> These take some practice to get right</li>
            <li> Still, the price of these is excellent, and as long as you are careful when putting in and taking out the pins, the sharper ends shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> I used clear nail polish on the ends so they weren&#x27;t as rough and that works great.</li>
            <li> I have very soft and smooth hair and no bobby pin will stay in.</li>
            <li> I was able to get my super long hair in a Gibson tuck and keep it there all day with spin pins!</li>
            <li> I recommend these, so easy to use quickly gets hair out of the way, especially when in the kitchen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I bought extra.</li>
            <li> They really do hold my long hair nicely.</li>
            <li> in all - even with the extra work to make these work better - you can&#x27;t beat the value you get out of this deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to put a dab of hot glue on the ends</li>
            <li> For such an inexpensive price, I can&#x27;t expect much more but if you are considering these be aware.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested  to fix that problem by adding a bit of silicon with a hot glue gun.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re smart and put them in right</li>
            <li> I still need 4-5 screwed in in different directions to hold up a bun, for instance, but it&#x27;s certainly better than bobby pins.</li>
            <li> These were able to hold my hair up in a bun with only 3.</li>
            <li> They are also about 3/4 of the size of standard Spin Pins; they are more like the minis.</li>
            <li> They hold more hair than the standard bobby pin and hold it tighter too!</li>
            <li> These are exactly like the &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34; brand you find in stores.</li>
            <li> can get a perfect bun with nothing but a hair tie and two of these, but usually add about six for extra security.</li>
            <li> One of these does the job of many regular bobby pins.  </li>
            <li> Love how easy to keep hair up just wish they were a little longer</li>
            <li> Also a little more cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> They are sturdy and smooth, with no sharp edges.</li>
            <li> 5 foot long hair and hair stuff is super important to me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also pretty fast (came a *lot</li>
            <li> They are suspiciously cheap, yes, but they work much much better than the (more expensive) metal ones.</li>
            <li> Am going to purchase more in the future for other family and friends :-)</li>
            <li> Easy to use, you simply just twist them in.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and these pins are awesome.  </li>
            <li> tried placing hot glue in edges to make them soft but the glue came right off</li>
            <li> Thanks to him there are a few stuck under the fridge, but nbd because it came with SOOO many!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty steady too.</li>
            <li> Granted the shipping took a little longer because it came from China, but being that this was such a great deal</li>
            <li> Not as painful as bunches of bobby pins, and they&#x27;re able to grab a lot more hair, so you don&#x27;t need as many.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a very pointy end like people say but for the price just use a piece of sandpaper or metal nail file.</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> and they shipped fast.</li>
            <li> They stay in her hair really well and hold her hair in place.</li>
            <li> these really work</li>
            <li> but it is really overpriced</li>
            <li> so my scalp doesn&#x27;t hurt even after a whole day of my hair being up in a bun.  </li>
            <li> Can hold a bun the whole day without needing to redo my hair.</li>
            <li> and they really do the trick.</li>
            <li> These were better quality than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> They cannot hold a bun up for a whole day.</li>
            <li> A much cheaper alternative to store brand spin pins, which are about $6 a PAIR.</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> so putting it in a bun and have it stay was a real challenge.</li>
            <li> but they hold up my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I ordered these even though I had heard they have sharp ends, I figured it was worth the risk since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and no sharp ends!</li>
            <li> You may have to use more clips for updos then you would with other brands.</li>
            <li> The spiral design is great for holding my long, straight hair up in a messy bun, but do yourself a favor</li>
            <li> I have very long, straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> A simple solution would be to work each end with a dremel (I tried a file and a sander, but those don&#x27;t do a good a job as a dremel - remember, you&#x27;re still sanding down metal) and then buy liquid plastic to coat the end.  </li>
            <li> my hair bun is secure and sturdy all day long with these pins.</li>
            <li> Strange packaging, but arrived securely.</li>
            <li> perfect for long thick hair holds in place no slipping</li>
            <li> but this particular brand did not.</li>
            <li> The main writing translates as &amp;#34;Hairpin of the Screw&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These work great for securing a bun, especially for people with thick hair like me.</li>
            <li> I purchased a pair of the Goody Simple Styles Spin Pin from Amazon a while back and fell in love with them.</li>
            <li> but I was starting to run out, so I&#x27;m so glad I finally found a place that sells them.</li>
            <li> and so the whole updo is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair and was excited when she discovered this style of pin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend purchase</li>
            <li> Highly recommend because of the price.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They have little metal snags hanging off most of them.</li>
            <li> Makes a quick and easy updo for mornings that I am running late.</li>
            <li> There was just this sharp piece of metal that could (and did) easily stick in your scalp!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super useful and tight.</li>
            <li> Her hair is not really thick</li>
            <li> Great value, works just like the expensive one.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the shipping took a month; it wasn&#x27;t worth the wait.</li>
            <li> and then a few more of these to catch all the strays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these pins I use them in my hair everyday instead of hair ties that rip my hair out.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dig into my head like normal bobby pins do.  </li>
            <li> My hair should be way too long for a Gibson tuck, but the spin pins were able to keep my hair rolled up properly inside the tuck.</li>
            <li> It takes tons of regular bobby pins to keep my hair in place, but about 5 of these in the right spot works as well as a banana clip.  </li>
            <li> As a ballerina with super long hair, I cannot live without these.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would be a miracle solution for my thick, fine, slippery hair - but they slip right out just like normal bobby pins.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the ends sharp though, the ends are not as smooth as the Goody pins</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and there&#x27;s a ton of it, so typically bobby pins take like 10-15 to hold a normal bun in place.</li>
            <li> So for work now, I gather my hair into a low pony tail (but don&#x27;t actually put it in a pony tail), braid it and roll it into a bun which I secure with these pin curls.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, although I have allot of it, and it slips out and comes down when I wear it up for work.  </li>
            <li> the ends scrape your scalp too much, dab a drop of nail polish or hot glue and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> These were slightly smaller than the first set of clips -</li>
            <li> I wasted so much money on the expensive Goody spin pins before I came across these awesome spiral pins.</li>
            <li> I usually intersect two, and they hold a bun better than a hairband.  </li>
            <li> They are especially useful to me because I have a TON of long, thick hair and the two I originally bought were not quite enough to hold it all up.</li>
            <li> The bare ends catch a little and the plastic would make them slide in better.  </li>
            <li> They arrived fairly quickly, but they are smaller than the regular Goodys pins.</li>
            <li> The material is not as strong, the tips are not covered so if you are not careful you might stab your scalp and the black sheath chips off.  </li>
            <li> These were amazing, I love spin pins but hate the price.</li>
            <li> Like a bobby pin that has lost the soft tips on the ends.  </li>
            <li> In fact, these pins do not have as much of a soft tip as the Goody brand</li>
            <li> I was very thankful for that, as the pictures left me a bit apprehensive.</li>
            <li> They still work nearly as well as the brand ones.</li>
            <li> The tips were not capped in any way, but they hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far.</li>
            <li> I just got my pins last night and they work really well.</li>
            <li> I used to just collect them every time I got my hair done professionally</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that is currently cut with layers and was looking for a way to roll it back into a bun quickly and easily, and these pins do the trick well.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as the Goody Spin pins but ten for the price of one.</li>
            <li> not too sure what the other reviewers meant by the sharp or jagged ends.</li>
            <li> These seem to work similar to the name brand ones, however, the difference is the lack of smooth ball at the ends to prevent pulling of the hair which causes slight pain.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair that just wouldn&#x27;t give into any pins, but these actually manage to hold it up securely.</li>
            <li> Need to use a few for a tight fur but a nice change from a ponytail</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and when I put it up in a bun, I really needed three of the Goody spin pins.  </li>
            <li> They are not sharp, but they do lack the bulbous tip that some brands have, although a dab of hotmelt glue on the tip</li>
            <li> The ends are not sharp, and they&#x27;re rounded.</li>
            <li> The ends are not sharp at all, they are rounded just like the Goody version.</li>
            <li> My hair has some texture - loose waves - but I tend to wear it straight.</li>
            <li> Once you &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; them all the way in, they are very hard to see and remain mostly invisible.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, straight hair down to just below my shoulders but these pins hold it up nicely.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the ends of the metal are not covered with a smooth plastic.  </li>
            <li> At least they were cheap, I guess.</li>
            <li> The spiral end is blunt and scratches my scalp if I am not extremely careful.  </li>
            <li> They are usable but do poke and scratch if not careful.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit smaller than the Goody brand, and the ends do not have a soft plastic end.</li>
            <li> I kept losing my old ones, now I have them each placed in different rooms.  </li>
            <li> The ends are covered in laquer or whatever, but they do snag some and could scratch your scalp if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> These are okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using only two of them for the last couple of weeks, almost every day, and they still look brand new-</li>
            <li> Thought I wouldn&#x27;t need the whole pack, but you do end up misplacing them just like other hair pins.</li>
            <li> If you treat the ends like I described above, there are no sharp ends poking out and getting caught in things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spin pins, for those new to these little miracles of modern hair-science, are designed to hold your hair in place by essentially screwing into the different layers of your hair.</li>
            <li> so they were pretty much a waste.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super thick</li>
            <li> These are not long enough to hold a bun for me with just one clip (unlike the goody brand).  </li>
            <li> A bit thin, but work fine.</li>
            <li> They are a little shorter then the Goody version but not by much.</li>
            <li> but if I fiddle with them a little they don&#x27;t bother me too much.  </li>
            <li> But overall, despite the slow shipping, they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Unlike bobby pins, spin pins also work in all kinds of hair textures so long as  there is enough hair for it to hold.</li>
            <li> Some people complained that the tips are sharp, they are alittle sharp but they need to be to twist into hair easily.</li>
            <li> Work as expected, the ends are a little sharp against your scalp but I filed them down and they are now fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the ends to be very pointy and my hair is so thick that I don&#x27;t feel them on my actual head anyway.</li>
            <li> My hair is really long.  </li>
            <li> I can put all of my medium long hair up with 2 Goody&#x27;s pins, but it takes 4 of these.</li>
            <li> These are not as sturdy as the name brand ones, also they are not as long</li>
            <li> Just took long to ship</li>
            <li> but they took an extremely long time to ship</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> Holds my hair and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> so when I take my hair down there is not a single point of pain caused by a hair tie or clip.</li>
            <li> May be fine for thinner hair, but no way will they hold thick hair in a bun unless you use at least 6-8 of them.</li>
            <li> Only downside, the ends are a bit sharp</li>
            <li> The ends look sharp in the picture, but they&#x27;re actually rounded off so they don&#x27;t hurt your scalp</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair - so I use two Goody ones for the main part of my bun</li>
            <li> It can scratch your scalp occasionally if you angle it down too steeply towards yourhead.</li>
            <li> but the &#x27;slight difference&#x27; I described is really a big difference in comfort of product.</li>
            <li> quit a few, These small spiral hair pins really hold all my hair up.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave them four star is that  the quality feels slightly inferior compared to goody ones.</li>
            <li> We have long hair in our family,  thick and corse to thin and fine.</li>
            <li> Sharp edges that are sharp enough to cut skin.</li>
            <li> No rubber tips on these - just the bare metal, which HURTS and requires some manipulating to get in my hair (the raw ends snag).</li>
            <li> These spin pins work amazing in thin hair!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use in my crazy hair!</li>
            <li> Package came from overseas and arrived a little earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I still need a few bobby pins to tuck in the last part of the hair.</li>
            <li> They are not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but they shouldn&#x27;t cause any harm if you&#x27;re somewhat careful.</li>
            <li> These wires are of a heavy enough gauge to take the abuse.</li>
            <li> so be careful putting them in</li>
            <li> These hair pins are missing the soft round tips that protect  your hair from breakage.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, heavy hair and these allow me to do the &amp;#34;messy bun&amp;#34; without it being a true mess.</li>
            <li> I will only use them in an emergency when my other spin spins are not available.</li>
            <li> It just takes 2-3 and my hair will stay up and tight all day long.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, long hair</li>
            <li> And I have Long thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li> These were too short and slippery to work in my thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> One minor drawback is that the ends of the pins aren&#x27;t covered in a little dot of glue or metal to blunt the edge.</li>
            <li> Also, you can store like 5 of these in the space of 1 if you just twist them into each other.</li>
            <li> The ends of the spiral clip are sharp, however, and can scratch the skin.</li>
            <li> The ends are not covered and are sharp.  </li>
            <li> They work well for thin to normal thickness hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, the ends can be sharp and pull on hair - if you&#x27;ve used wire snippers - that&#x27;s like what happened with these.  </li>
            <li> I do feel they are sharp and catch on my hair.  </li>
            <li> The ends are blunted so that I won&#x27;t have sharp spikes digging into my skull.</li>
            <li> Like other posters have stated, the ends aren&#x27;t sharp.</li>
            <li> The ends have sharp edges and break off my hair every time I put them in.</li>
            <li> THIS VERSION is a bit sharp, as it would be if they were just snipped with wire cutters.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about sharp points or flimsy material, but neither was a problem.</li>
            <li> The tips of the pin can be sharp &amp; may scratch your scalp.</li>
            <li> Holds my heavy long hair!</li>
            <li> Ends can be a little sharp, so be careful</li>
            <li> So they are sorta half way flattened with sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> You want the tip to be a soft/slippery material like hard plastic - not something potentially grabby like rubber.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep because not worth the inconvenience of returning</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> They hold well, but I had to be so careful in using them, it because too much trouble.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair or a sensitive scalp, these might not work for you.</li>
            <li> Like, to about halfway down my thighs.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other hair pin!</li>
            <li> And the ends on these are sharp!</li>
            <li> They are bigger than I expected but work very well for my crazy thick hair.</li>
            <li> Or you could order these and get 10 for less.</li>
            <li> These are also slightly shorter than the Goody ones.  </li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re less pointy.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a few of them develop little nicks in the plastic (on the body of it not the ends), and I guess you could consider those parts slightly sharp however it does not affect the use at all.</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and these pins hold my hair up and out of my face all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and two pins keeps my hair up all day.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> : I am an Asian-American woman with naturally thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long and thick hair</li>
            <li> They hold girls&#x27; hair really tight.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I cannot give these specific pins 5 stars because they lack the little protecting plastic bits on the ends of the pins which when screwing them into my bun they grab and pull little hairs instead of screwing in smoothly (somewhat painful) and may also scrape your scalp if you don&#x27;t carefully put them in.</li>
            <li> and I have very long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re covered in plastic, but mine don&#x27;t have little nobbies on the end like the Goody ones</li>
            <li> so it does hurt a little sometimes when I&#x27;m spiraling them in on my scalp, but I&#x27;ve never been scratched or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I did get 10 of these little guys for $1.75</li>
            <li> I have some Mennonite friends I have shared these with, as they beat hairpins hands down!</li>
            <li> Did a partial updo with 2!!!</li>
            <li> and my hair stayed firmly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting one out of my hair and had to have help to avoid ripping/breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> These hold just as well as the Goody Spin Pins, but they don&#x27;t have the rubber tips on the ends, so they tend to break a few hairs going in.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and using a hair tie to put it in a bun usually gives me headaches after about an hour.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also less wear and tear damage on hair that hair ties usually cause.</li>
            <li> so I usually have to use about 2-3 to keep my bun in place.</li>
            <li> These do not work as well as the Goody brand because they have a slick finish whereas the Goody brand have ridges to help grip your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I usually need a lot of clips or pins to hold my hair up.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly, not much more</li>
            <li> They are uncomfortable to put in but are the same once they are in.....  </li>
            <li> They only problem is that the ends of the spiral were not rounded, so they hurt the scalp if pointed at the wrong angle.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not super thin</li>
            <li> They are tough little pins and don&#x27;t get bent out of shape when I accidentally lock them together in my hair.</li>
            <li> so I could use them in my daughters hair without worrying that She might loose the expensive goody spin pins.  </li>
            <li> No way would I waste my money on the Goody ones with these being so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be hard to learn how to use them, but it literally took me 20 seconds to put them in.</li>
            <li> The ends are hard and have no tips to protect the hair.</li>
            <li> Price is aaaamazing but they aren&#x27;t hard</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time keeping my hair up in a bun when I&#x27;m working.</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled with these spiral hair clips.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to put it in an updo or partial updo.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t remember the brand) had tiny rounded tips on the ends</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> They claim to hold thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the ends are not too bad, sometimes they can have a little leftover sharp tip from the cut.  </li>
            <li> They were flimsy and not good quality.</li>
            <li> The ends are not as sharp as we were afraid they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> One holds my hair, while I need at least 3 hairpins!</li>
            <li> poor quality.</li>
            <li> Thin.</li>
            <li> The ends are razor sharp and incredibly painful when using on your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I, on the other hand am disappointed.</li>
            <li> They hold my very thick hair and don&#x27;t scratch my scalp in the process for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Bobby pins have failed to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re so expensive to buy in the store.</li>
            <li> The ends can sorta scratch your head if the angle is wrong and if you rest your head against the pillow you can feel them.</li>
            <li> They serve their purpose and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price</li>
            <li> While these items are what was pictured, I am disappointed with the purchase since they are so small.  </li>
            <li> No rubber tips- makes spinning them into your hair without a bit of pulling difficult.</li>
            <li> I can even use these in complicated updos!</li>
            <li> Not recommended. :(</li>
            <li> These are horrible.</li>
            <li> These hair pins are horrible!</li>

            <li> My hair is really long.  Like, to about halfway down my thighs.  These actually can hold my hair.  One day, I forgot my hair elastic, put my hair in a braid but wanted it up, twisted it into a bun in the braid, threw a couple of these in, and it held all day better than a hair elastic even held a bun in.  Also, you can store like 5 of these in the space of 1 if you just twist them into each other.</li>
            <li> They arrived before the estimated delivery date and they work pretty good. My hair isn&#x27;t super thick but it&#x27;s not super thin either so I usually have to use about 2-3 to keep my bun in place. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m even using them right lol but I like it</li>
            <li> Awesome hairpins! They are sturdy and smooth, with no sharp edges. I&#x27;ve been using only two of them for the last couple of weeks, almost every day, and they still look brand new- no bending or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work wonderfully. I can put my hair up in a bun in the morning, and not have to touch it until I get home at night. I fully recommend these!</li>
            <li> These are great for buns and twists.  Not as painful as bunches of bobby pins, and they&#x27;re able to grab a lot more hair, so you don&#x27;t need as many.</li>
            <li> I can use three of these spiral ones and they hold my hair in a top bun awesomely. My hair is fine and there&#x27;s a ton of it, so typically bobby pins take like 10-15 to hold a normal bun in place. I went two days with my hair in a bun using these spiral things, including sleeping and going to work where I&#x27;m constantly moving around and my hair stayed firmly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: the ends are kinda pointy. They&#x27;re covered in plastic, but mine don&#x27;t have little nobbies on the end like the Goody ones so it does hurt a little sometimes when I&#x27;m spiraling them in on my scalp, but I&#x27;ve never been scratched or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it though for the price. No way would I waste my money on the Goody ones with these being so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Shorter than others I&#x27;ve used.  Also a little more cheaply made.  Works but need more to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair.  These are not long enough to hold a bun for me with just one clip (unlike the goody brand).  I also don&#x27;t think they are as sturdy.  Lastly, the shipping took a month; it wasn&#x27;t worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They are awesome!!! I don&#x27;t believe that they are flimsy and great for buns! Nice and secure!</li>
            <li> I have 5 foot long hair and hair stuff is super important to me. These pins were cheap, but are also pretty cheap quality. They have little metal snags hanging off most of them. I had trouble getting one out of my hair and had to have help to avoid ripping/breaking my hair. I will only use them in an emergency when my other spin spins are not available.</li>
            <li> These hold just as well as the Goody Spin Pins, but they don&#x27;t have the rubber tips on the ends, so they tend to break a few hairs going in.</li>
            <li> They work well. The price fit the amount was great. Only downside, the ends are a bit sharp</li>
            <li> My daughter has a lot of hair and the spiral hair pin works amazing in holding her hair up.  She even wears them for sports and has no problem with them falling out.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, heavy hair and these allow me to do the &amp;#34;messy bun&amp;#34; without it being a true mess. Thought I wouldn&#x27;t need the whole pack, but you do end up misplacing them just like other hair pins.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would be a miracle solution for my thick, fine, slippery hair - but they slip right out just like normal bobby pins. If normal pins work for you these may be great.</li>
            <li> What more can I say - the youtube clips about these pins are telling the truth. my hair bun is secure and sturdy all day long with these pins.</li>
            <li> These get a two because of the great effort they make to keep these reasonably priced.  That said, I&#x27;ll be overpaying Goody until a safer alternative appears.  The spiral end is blunt and scratches my scalp if I am not extremely careful.  Got these so I could use them in my daughters hair without worrying that She might loose the expensive goody spin pins.  Given the blunt edge I would not use these on her at all.&lt;br /&gt;I tried placing hot glue in edges to make them soft but the glue came right off</li>
            <li> These seem to work similar to the name brand ones, however, the difference is the lack of smooth ball at the ends to prevent pulling of the hair which causes slight pain. That&#x27;s the huge discount on the price I guess. I&#x27;ll keep because not worth the inconvenience of returning but the &#x27;slight difference&#x27; I described is really a big difference in comfort of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Goody brand &amp;#34;spin pins&amp;#34; before and loved them. These are not the same. The ends are not rounded, so they snag and break hairs as you twist. Waste of money. Buying the Goody pins from now on.</li>
            <li> The ends aren&#x27;t rounded so sometimes it catches hair and hurts while I screw it in.</li>
            <li> highly recommend purchase</li>
            <li> Excellent for holding long hair. I use 4 to 5 for pinning my braid into a bun. Bobby pins have failed to hold my hair. I still need a few bobby pins to tuck in the last part of the hair. The ends of the spiral clip are sharp, however, and can scratch the skin. I took off a star for that. I&#x27;m glad that I bought extra. Package came from overseas and arrived a little earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a very pointy end like people say but for the price just use a piece of sandpaper or metal nail file.</li>
            <li> Took over three weeks to receive, but arrived in bubble mailer, in good condition.  They are not what I expected.  The ends are not covered and are sharp.  They are usable but do poke and scratch if not careful.</li>
            <li> Holds my heavy hair up really well and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> i love the twisty hair pins, they do for my hair what nothing else will... however, these have no protective coating at the tip and damage my hair as well as scratching my scalp.  i will stick to name brand on this product.</li>
            <li> Granted the shipping took a little longer because it came from China, but being that this was such a great deal it was fine to just wait a couple of weeks. The product is definitely worth the waiting. :)</li>
            <li> Great my favorite hair accessories</li>
            <li> Item arrived BEFORE the estimated date which was nice. I have thick, coarse, long hair so it took 3 of these to keep my hair secure. I was scared to use these because I thought they&#x27;d get tangled in my hair, but nope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They twist in and out easily without tangling AND they disperse the pressure of holding my hair up so when I take my hair down there is not a single point of pain caused by a hair tie or clip.</li>
            <li> These suck because they dont have the rounded ends which ended up breaking off a lot of my hair And scraping my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these clips for years but they&#x27;re so expensive to buy in the store. I bought 10 this time and keep them in my purse, my vanity and in my junk drawer! Love it! Highly recommend because of the price.</li>
            <li> These take some practice to get right so it holds all my hair but they work great. I have really thick long hair and they hold it all up in a bun. The ends can sorta scratch your head if the angle is wrong and if you rest your head against the pillow you can feel them. I bet the goody brand with the ball ends don&#x27;t scratch at all but they are way more money than these. I really like these and they shipped fast.</li>
            <li> perfect for long thick hair holds in place no slipping</li>
            <li> Took a couple of weeks to get.. But i know that. This is a great deal !! It cost $6 for 2 or 4 in the store..Definitely  durable for the hair . (not junk) I would recommend!!</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered them. Good price for that many. They stay in her hair really well and hold her hair in place. Her hair is not really thick but she has a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> As a ballerina with super long hair, I cannot live without these. I lose things. So I order quite many of these.</li>
            <li> definitely shorter than its competitor, but a great value.</li>
            <li> The ends are not coated with anything. They&#x27;re just cut off. Stabs your scalp.</li>
            <li> Product was as described. Very easy to use in my crazy hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried these that worked from another brand but this particular brand did not. I would not recommend purchasing these.</li>
            <li> Work as expected, the ends are a little sharp against your scalp but I filed them down and they are now fine. These work just as well as the more expensive brands for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found these!  They work well for thin to normal thickness hair. Very easy to use.  Figuring out different styles just using these. For adults and children. Just paint if you want different colors...tho, they hide in hair well.  Am going to purchase more in the future for other family and friends :-)</li>
            <li> Love how easy to keep hair up just wish they were a little longer I have a pair I bought at the store gave that pair to my sister because I was getting this order need to be longer but still love them feels light it only takes two to hold hair up</li>
            <li> I love this and the idea I this!! I only use two I hold up a bun- using no rubber bands. And I have Long thick Asian hair. Wish I could find more uses for it. But for bun, it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> I got these because I lost one of my Goodys Spin Pins and the price was great. They arrived fairly quickly, but they are smaller than the regular Goodys pins. I can put all of my medium long hair up with 2 Goody&#x27;s pins, but it takes 4 of these. I&#x27;ll get some more Goody&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This was actually my second purchase of these spiral pins. These were slightly smaller than the first set of clips - but I think they will work almost as well. They really do hold my long hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I thought that there was only four in a set however there was 10 in each set I ordered 3 sets so I thirty of them these really work I have given away quit a few, These small spiral hair pins really hold all my hair up. You can not bet the price at all.</li>
            <li> I got these spin pins to secure my top bun. It works fine. Before buying these, I got goody spin pins; which I really liked it but it is really overpriced so when I saw these, I had to grab them. The only reason I gave them four star is that  the quality feels slightly inferior compared to goody ones.</li>
            <li> These do not have rubber tips like the goodys brand and are shorter. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great price, not as bulky as some of the others. They are not sharp, but they do lack the bulbous tip that some brands have, although a dab of hotmelt glue on the tip and they&#x27;re just like the pricier ones. :) Great product!</li>
            <li> These are the best things ever I love them!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these little tools.  They realy do the work of 20 bobby pins.  Just two spiral pins and my hair stays all day.  Makes a quick and easy updo for mornings that I am running late.</li>
            <li> These took a while to come in after I ordered them but it was well worth it. You can buy these at target or walmart for about $3 for two or three of them. Or you could order these and get 10 for less. Well worth it, will order again.</li>
            <li> I am delighted that I found these!  I can do so many things with my medium curly hair now!  I can do a perfect french twist with only ONE of these buggers - it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> These are fine, honestly. I don&#x27;t find the ends to be very pointy and my hair is so thick that I don&#x27;t feel them on my actual head anyway. To be frank, I love the price, they serve their function, and it comes with way more than the Goody brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these 4 stars because you really do get a great value here.  Yes, the ends can be sharp and pull on hair - if you&#x27;ve used wire snippers - that&#x27;s like what happened with these.  Sometimes the ends are not too bad, sometimes they can have a little leftover sharp tip from the cut.  The outside is coated so it glides into your hair - but the ends can catch on hair.  A simple solution would be to work each end with a dremel (I tried a file and a sander, but those don&#x27;t do a good a job as a dremel - remember, you&#x27;re still sanding down metal) and then buy liquid plastic to coat the end.  You want the tip to be a soft/slippery material like hard plastic - not something potentially grabby like rubber.  These are also slightly shorter than the Goody ones.  I have very long, thick hair - so I use two Goody ones for the main part of my bun and then a few more of these to catch all the strays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These spin pins are so easy to use and they disperse the weight so my scalp doesn&#x27;t hurt even after a whole day of my hair being up in a bun.  They disappear into your bun and so the whole updo is very natural looking.  If you treat the ends like I described above, there are no sharp ends poking out and getting caught in things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people are fine without treating the tips at all but I prefer to do it.  I do feel they are sharp and catch on my hair.  Another tip is to keep on the lookout in your local Dollar stores for the Goody ones.  Sometimes, they are there...but they go quick!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - even with the extra work to make these work better - you can&#x27;t beat the value you get out of this deal.  I think it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as the Goody Spin pins but ten for the price of one. Excellent deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the ends scrape your scalp too much, dab a drop of nail polish or hot glue and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> These spiral pins are a simple solution for putting hair up in a bun. I thought it would be hard to learn how to use them, but it literally took me 20 seconds to put them in. The ends look sharp in the picture, but they&#x27;re actually rounded off so they don&#x27;t hurt your scalp</li>
            <li> They took forever to ship, but it is great for the price. They are bigger than I expected but work very well for my crazy thick hair.</li>
            <li> These are okay, but not great.  I bought them because I already had a pack of the Goody Spin Pins and loved them - but the Goody brand only has two in a pack.  My hair is very long and when I put it up in a bun, I really needed three of the Goody spin pins.  I thought this would be a good substitution and would save me some money.  These are lighter weight than the Goody brand, and the ends of these pins seem to . . . hmmm . . . how to describe . . . the ends of these seem to want to &#x27;catch&#x27; in my hair as I&#x27;m trying to spin them into the bun.  Like a bobby pin that has lost the soft tips on the ends.  In fact, these pins do not have as much of a soft tip as the Goody brand and it feels like they are tearing at my hair as I insert them.  I ended up just buying another pack of the Goody brand and am doing away with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn&#x27;t already used the Goody brand, I probably would have like these for holding up my hair.  I do like how the spiral pins work - like that a lot!  I just wasn&#x27;t happy with this particular brand compared to the Goody brand.</li>
            <li> I wasted so much money on the expensive Goody spin pins before I came across these awesome spiral pins. They are suspiciously cheap, yes, but they work much much better than the (more expensive) metal ones. I have thick straight hair that just wouldn&#x27;t give into any pins, but these actually manage to hold it up securely.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly.  I wish the ends were tipped, but I can&#x27;t feel them tugging at hair so...fine.  They make my quick hairstyles so much quicker!  Shipping took AGES.  But that&#x27;s not a reflection of the the product.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Do not even compare to the ones made by Clairol. May be fine for thinner hair, but no way will they hold thick hair in a bun unless you use at least 6-8 of them.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, well made. Perfect for securing long hair onto my head</li>
            <li> These are great. The ends are not sharp, and they&#x27;re rounded. I have noticed a few of them develop little nicks in the plastic (on the body of it not the ends), and I guess you could consider those parts slightly sharp however it does not affect the use at all. Honestly though, these cost like 12 cents apiece right now, so even if they broke after one use they&#x27;d probably still be more cost effective than the goody ones considering how easy it is to lose hair pins. It&#x27;s also nice to have so many and not have to worry. Sometimes a bun may technically work with just two or three of these(what you get in the more expensive pack), but it&#x27;s really nice to be able to just keep sticking in more without having to even think about it. Shipping was also pretty fast (came a *lot* faster than the estimate).</li>
            <li> I ordered these even though I had heard they have sharp ends, I figured it was worth the risk since it was so cheap. These things are great! They are a little shorter then the Goody version but not by much. The ends are not sharp at all, they are rounded just like the Goody version. I love these pins I use them in my hair everyday instead of hair ties that rip my hair out. I recommend these, they are great and a great price!</li>
            <li> We have long hair in our family,  thick and corse to thin and fine. This works like a dream for everyone.</li>
            <li> love these so even went back and ordered more!!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and these pins hold my hair up and out of my face all day long.  They don&#x27;t dig into my head like normal bobby pins do.  I would definitely recommend to anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic, much better than bobby pins. Can hold a bun the whole day without needing to redo my hair. I work in a lab so my hair is ALWAYS up, and this ensures that I don&#x27;t have to worry about fixing it every two minutes. Ends can be a little sharp, so be careful</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pokey on the ends, but they work *great* and are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> OMG these are amazing and so much better than the $12 - $14 ones you get at the stores. These actually hold my hair up!!!!</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled with these spiral hair clips. They were flimsy and not good quality. However, they do work. You may have to use more clips for updos then you would with other brands.</li>
            <li> They serve their purpose and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price</li>
            <li> Useful stays in place.</li>
            <li> While these items are what was pictured, I am disappointed with the purchase since they are so small.  I guess if you need them for a &amp;#34;small doo&amp;#34;, then they are a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, on the other hand am disappointed.</li>
            <li> They hurt my head a bit, the pricier ones don&#x27;t but if I fiddle with them a little they don&#x27;t bother me too much.  Great price.  Sloooooooooooow shipping.</li>
            <li> I love these! Every girl needs their own set!</li>
            <li> I love my original spin pins. I have this fear I&#x27;ll lose them, so I purchased these. They&#x27;re a bit smaller than the Goody brand, and the ends do not have a soft plastic end. I&#x27;m going to put a dab of hot glue on the ends so they&#x27;re less pointy. Otherwise, good. Get what you pay for, I suppose.</li>
            <li> As pictured, the ends of these spiral pins lack the knobs that are on the pricier brands. Still, the price of these is excellent, and as long as you are careful when putting in and taking out the pins, the sharper ends shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. I have thick, wavy hair that is currently cut with layers and was looking for a way to roll it back into a bun quickly and easily, and these pins do the trick well.</li>
            <li> These do not work as well as the Goody brand because they have a slick finish whereas the Goody brand have ridges to help grip your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they do kinda work, but begin to slip after a while.</li>
            <li> I have very long, straight, fine hair. There aren&#x27;t many clips or pins that stand the test of vigorous movement. I came across this type of pin a while ago and they really do the trick. If you are looking for pins which really hold when you move, these are great.  I can run without my bun falling when I use these pins. Sadly, I cannot give these specific pins 5 stars because they lack the little protecting plastic bits on the ends of the pins which when screwing them into my bun they grab and pull little hairs instead of screwing in smoothly (somewhat painful) and may also scrape your scalp if you don&#x27;t carefully put them in. For such an inexpensive price, I can&#x27;t expect much more but if you are considering these be aware.</li>
            <li> holds very well, wish they were a bit more flexible though. Otherwise, great for curly hair to keep in place.</li>
            <li> These are amazing. Love them. Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> These were better quality than I had expected.  The ends are blunted so that I won&#x27;t have sharp spikes digging into my skull. I was very thankful for that, as the pictures left me a bit apprehensive.</li>
            <li> I think that these are great for getting my hair out of the way.  I kept losing my old ones, now I have them each placed in different rooms.  I recommend these, so easy to use quickly gets hair out of the way, especially when in the kitchen</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work on me. poor quality. took forever to arrive</li>
            <li> These were amazing, I love spin pins but hate the price. These weren&#x27;t available when I went to order more and the ones I did get were a lesser quality and snag, pull at you hair and do not have the coating on the ends like this specific product and seller. I highly recommend this sellers product much better quality</li>
            <li> I love these pins! I have long thick hair and two pins keeps my hair up all day. I have fallen asleep in a them and woke up with perfect hair! I will never use any other hair pin!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on these! They are GREAT! I suggest putting some nail polish on the ends to make it easier on the scalp, and twisting into the hair. I have some Mennonite friends I have shared these with, as they beat hairpins hands down! One holds my hair, while I need at least 3 hairpins!</li>
            <li> These are awesome for buns, french twists and whatever. My cat plays with them too. Thanks to him there are a few stuck under the fridge, but nbd because it came with SOOO many!</li>
            <li> Shorter in length and smaller in diameter than the goody pins. I don&#x27;t find the ends sharp though, the ends are not as smooth as the Goody pins but they shouldn&#x27;t cause any harm if you&#x27;re somewhat careful. It&#x27;s a bargain at $1.63 for ten pins compared to Goody&#x27;s $4.00 for two pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo attached is a Goody pin and one of the pins. The background is a college ruled piece of paper, in case one would want to have a sense of the actual size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Perfect! I used clear nail polish on the ends so they weren&#x27;t as rough and that works great.</li>
            <li> For the price this item is great; however, the ends are to sharp and can cause hair damage. These hair pins are missing the soft round tips that protect  your hair from breakage. Someone suggested  to fix that problem by adding a bit of silicon with a hot glue gun. That seems to me like a good fix to the problem if you already bought this product.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped. They cannot hold a bun up for a whole day.</li>
            <li> A much cheaper alternative to store brand spin pins, which are about $6 a PAIR. I have long, thick hair and using a hair tie to put it in a bun usually gives me headaches after about an hour. I use two spin pins, and it holds my bun perfectly even when I sleep - and no headaches! There&#x27;s also less wear and tear damage on hair that hair ties usually cause. And when I take the pins out, I don&#x27;t have that bump that also comes from wearing a regular elastic hair tie. For the price and amount of pins, it&#x27;s totally worth it. I keep a couple on by my bed, in purse, in my car, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not too sure what the other reviewers meant by the sharp or jagged ends. I had no problems with the set I received.  Although, sometimes, if I didn&#x27;t insert them properly into my bun, the tips did stick out a bit, but they weren&#x27;t bothersome at all.</li>
            <li> Good price and value!</li>
            <li> These work well, but the finish isn&#x27;t entirely smooth. At the price, they are a good value</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of original Spin Pins at Target for $6, which seemed a bit steep for two hair pins, but they worked magically! These are not as sturdy as the name brand ones, also they are not as long and the ends are a bit sharper. The ends are covered in laquer or whatever, but they do snag some and could scratch your scalp if you&#x27;re not careful. However, I did get 10 of these little guys for $1.75 so I really can&#x27;t complain. They still work nearly as well as the brand ones. They are especially useful to me because I have a TON of long, thick hair and the two I originally bought were not quite enough to hold it all up.</li>
            <li> These hair pins work so easily and hold hair in place well. Need to use a few for a tight fur but a nice change from a ponytail</li>
            <li> Love it! Just took long to ship</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair. It is difficult to put it in an updo or partial updo. I would need a million bobby pins. Have seen these in stores but didnt want to spend a lot of money and have them not work. Bought here - these things are magic! Works incredibly in my hair. Did a partial updo with 2!!! I SAID 2! Amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing design and you can&#x27;t beat the china price! They work perfectly for buns or for roll back hair styles.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price. They don&#x27;t have the rubber ends to protect your scalp but if you&#x27;re smart and put them in right it&#x27;s not a problem at all. I love my spin pins!</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, straight hair down to just below my shoulders but these pins hold it up nicely. I still need 4-5 screwed in in different directions to hold up a bun, for instance, but it&#x27;s certainly better than bobby pins. Like other posters have stated, the ends aren&#x27;t sharp. This is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This product works but it doesn&#x27;t have knobs on the end so it pulls my hair as its going in.</li>
            <li> No rubber tips- makes spinning them into your hair without a bit of pulling difficult.</li>
            <li> My girls do dance and gymnastics. They hold girls&#x27; hair really tight.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair and was excited when she discovered this style of pin. We took a chance on this no-name brand. She&#x27;s worn them several times to school and they work great. The ends are not as sharp as we were afraid they&#x27;d be. She&#x27;s never poked her scalp.</li>
            <li> great product and great price</li>
            <li> These were too short and slippery to work in my thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these several times to pass out to my friends.  Fit in hair so well and they&#x27;re great to carry in your purse for a quick change up.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of being able to use less pins and have them be more secure. The problem I had with this was that the ends had no protective coating. There was just this sharp piece of metal that could (and did) easily stick in your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;If these had some kind of plastic coating on the end I would have given them 5 stars. They hold well, but I had to be so careful in using them, it because too much trouble.</li>
            <li> It took forever to get the pins, but they are wonderful and a real deal.</li>
            <li> The ends are hard and have no tips to protect the hair. It keeps pulling my hair. Not recommended. :(</li>
            <li> These honestly work great holding up buns in my thick curly hair. Love love love! highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The pins are pretty good but they took an extremely long time to ship and when I finally received the package it was supposed to be a pack of 10 and there were only 9 in the bag.</li>
            <li> I love these. I have really thick hair and I usually need a lot of clips or pins to hold my hair up. I also break a lot of hair clips, plastic and metal. These were able to hold my hair up in a bun with only 3. They are easy to put in and take out. It&#x27;s pretty steady too. The ones I got wasn&#x27;t plastic, it&#x27;s metal and having deform after many uses.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and these are really effective at pinning it up. They don&#x27;t cause pain or pulling when properly placed and allow me to create perfect &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; up-dos.</li>
            <li> Price is aaaamazing but they aren&#x27;t hard so they were pretty much a waste.</li>
            <li> Spin pins, for those new to these little miracles of modern hair-science, are designed to hold your hair in place by essentially screwing into the different layers of your hair. Kind of like a screw in wood. Once you &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; them all the way in, they are very hard to see and remain mostly invisible. Unlike bobby pins, you need fewer spin pins because they are designed to hold a LOT of hair together at once. Unlike bobby pins, spin pins also work in all kinds of hair textures so long as  there is enough hair for it to hold. However, like bobby pins, you can &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; two together to get extra hold. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: I am an Asian-American woman with naturally thick long hair. My hair has some texture - loose waves - but I tend to wear it straight. I have a really hard time keeping my hair up in a bun when I&#x27;m working. Elastics will eventually fall out or break and bobby pins have NEVER worked. Spin pins are the holy grail for me. It just takes 2-3 and my hair will stay up and tight all day long. I can even use these in complicated updos! I was able to get my super long hair in a Gibson tuck and keep it there all day with spin pins! My hair should be way too long for a Gibson tuck, but the spin pins were able to keep my hair rolled up properly inside the tuck. (See Youtube for tutorials.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cheap, Chinese-made spin pins are great. Firstly, they are cheap in price, but not in quality. They are tough little pins and don&#x27;t get bent out of shape when I accidentally lock them together in my hair. These wires are of a heavy enough gauge to take the abuse. These pins are also shorter than the Goody spin pins that you can buy from CVS or Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, but they hold just as well. You get 10 of them for the price of 2 brand name pins. One minor drawback is that the ends of the pins aren&#x27;t covered in a little dot of glue or metal to blunt the edge. It can scratch your scalp occasionally if you angle it down too steeply towards yourhead. But overall, despite the slow shipping, they are totally worth it. Buy 2 or 3 packages, and give them to your friends. These are amazing. I can finally do all those awesome Pinterest hairdos.</li>
            <li> They claim to hold thick hair but they&#x27;re too short</li>
            <li> Great value, works just like the expensive one. I thought they were a great length, not at all too short and I have very long and thick hair. The tips were not capped in any way, but they hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Works well and arrived ahead of schedule. Strange packaging, but arrived securely.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly, not much more I can say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It normally takes me two hair ties and 20 bobby pins to get a good bun, with these I just twist one in from each side and it stays all day without pulling. Great if you tend to get headaches from updos.</li>
            <li> I love these hair pins! I just got my pins last night and they work really well. I have really long and thick hair so putting it in a bun and have it stay was a real challenge. The ends are capped so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your scalp, and they are the perfect size. I would definitely buy theses again.</li>
            <li> Good thing: Cheaper than Spin Pins&lt;br /&gt;Acceptable thing: Took a while to arrive, but I knew that, so I can&#x27;t complain there&lt;br /&gt;Bad thing: No rubber tips on these - just the bare metal, which HURTS and requires some manipulating to get in my hair (the raw ends snag). They are also about 3/4 of the size of standard Spin Pins; they are more like the minis.</li>
            <li> The ends have sharp edges and break off my hair every time I put them in. I had to quit using them.</li>
            <li> These are a great amount of spin pins for a lot less money. They pins were made in China for people in Japan. The main writing translates as &amp;#34;Hairpin of the Screw&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Quick and easy! I first bought 2 on sale for $6!!!!! Got some for a friend too!</li>
            <li> A bit thin, but work fine.</li>
            <li> These are superb! I love them. I have thick hair. If you have thin hair or a sensitive scalp, these might not work for you.</li>
            <li> Super useful and tight. 3 stars because I was skimped out of one</li>
            <li> The tips are not coated with anything, so they catch my hair as I put them in. I coated the tips with nail polish, but I wish they were coated.</li>
            <li> Sharp edges that are sharp enough to cut skin.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I just now ran into these! They work so well. They hold more hair than the standard bobby pin and hold it tighter too! Easy to use, you simply just twist them in.</li>
            <li> These are super easy to use! Great price and quality considering the retail stores charge much more for a smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> These are exactly like the &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34; brand you find in stores. Plus, they are way cheaper and you get more for your money. Thank you!</li>
            <li> shipped from china so it took a while. but for the price and quantity, its awesome. i have no complains</li>
            <li> I originally bought these curl pins (as I call them) at WalMart and loved them.  My hair is fine, although I have allot of it, and it slips out and comes down when I wear it up for work.  So for work now, I gather my hair into a low pony tail (but don&#x27;t actually put it in a pony tail), braid it and roll it into a bun which I secure with these pin curls.  They are very effective, even for my fine hair.  And since I&#x27;m brunette, they are virtually invisible....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, THIS VERSION, of the curl pins is a cheaper one.  The original ones I purchased at WalMart (I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t remember the brand) had tiny rounded tips on the ends so it didn&#x27;t scrap your head as you screwed it in.  THIS VERSION is a bit sharp, as it would be if they were just snipped with wire cutters.  So they are sorta half way flattened with sharp edges.  They are uncomfortable to put in but are the same once they are in.....  In essence, you get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> I have very soft and smooth hair and no bobby pin will stay in. These work great, especially for sock buns and poufy hairdos.</li>
            <li> I love how these spiral hair pins hold your hair.  My one complaint is that the ends of the metal are not covered with a smooth plastic.  The bare ends catch a little and the plastic would make them slide in better.  Otherwise it is a fantastic invention.</li>
            <li> the ends are not rounded. they scratch and hurt. they are also shorter than the goody&#x27;s spin pins...</li>
            <li> These work great for securing a bun, especially for people with thick hair like me. They&#x27;re definitely secure and don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to get but they are perfect!</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the ones I got at Walmart that were $6 for 2 of them. I was worried about sharp points or flimsy material, but neither was a problem. They hold my very thick hair and don&#x27;t scratch my scalp in the process for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased a pair of the Goody Simple Styles Spin Pin from Amazon a while back and fell in love with them. I decided to buy some spares and didn&#x27;t pay attention when I ordered these that they were not the same brand.  These are horrible. Cheap. Thin. And the ends on these are sharp! No, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m twirling these things into my hair.  The spiral design is great for holding my long, straight hair up in a messy bun, but do yourself a favor a get the Goody brand, which is much more substantial and has nice rubber ends.</li>
            <li> These things are perfect for long hair. They sell them individually at most drug stores for way too much money, but it&#x27;s a bobby pin, so this is the right price and the right sturdiness. After all, you want them to dissappear into your hair. These are the same ones I&#x27;ve had used when getting an updo at salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can get a perfect bun with nothing but a hair tie and two of these, but usually add about six for extra security. They&#x27;re also a must have for anything more complicated. I used to just collect them every time I got my hair done professionally but I was starting to run out, so I&#x27;m so glad I finally found a place that sells them.</li>
            <li> These spin pins work amazing in thin hair!!!</li>
            <li> The tips of the pin can be sharp &amp; may scratch your scalp. It&#x27;s take some time to get used to but they hold up my hair very well.</li>
            <li> One of these does the job of many regular bobby pins.  I can hold a bun in my thick/heavy hair using 3-4 of these.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and these pins are awesome.  I just pull my hair up and twist them in and voila!  My hair stays in place.  It takes tons of regular bobby pins to keep my hair in place, but about 5 of these in the right spot works as well as a banana clip.  I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> These have no protective stuff on the ends so be careful putting them in but they work great. This is my second order.</li>
            <li> Holds my heavy long hair! Comfy</li>
            <li> These hair pins are horrible! The ends are razor sharp and incredibly painful when using on your hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and no sharp ends!</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and I still can&#x27;t get these things to work. At least they were cheap, I guess.</li>
            <li> These things are made of witchcraft and are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> For two dollars this is great deal.</li>
            <li> These little hair screws work great.  They are effortless and do the job.</li>
            <li> They work well to keep a bun in place.  I usually intersect two, and they hold a bun better than a hairband.  They only problem is that the ends of the spiral were not rounded, so they hurt the scalp if pointed at the wrong angle.</li>
            <li> Great value and works great! Twist them in....they stay all day....then twist them out. Very easy. Some people complained that the tips are sharp, they are alittle sharp but they need to be to twist into hair easily. Your putting them into your hair not your scalp. Lol</li>
            <li> This is a cheap version of the original.  They work OK.  The material is not as strong, the tips are not covered so if you are not careful you might stab your scalp and the black sheath chips off.  I would not purchase again but I thought it was still a good deal for the price.</li>
    </ol>
