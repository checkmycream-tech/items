            <li>Amazing wish I had more</li>
            <li>I actually kind of like the pear-shaped Makeup Blender better, it&#x27;s easier to grip and hold, but you can choose whichever you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to replace these every 3 months no matter how often you clean them, and at this price no bloodletting is involved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sponge is awesome it blends like no other sponge I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li>Very cheap, should have read the description.  </li>

            <li>The tip is perfect for applying my foundation around my eyes, nose and lips and the rounder side allows for even, streak free application on the remaining areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft against my skin</li>

            <li>Have enjoyed using and will order again.</li>
            <li>I recieved the one not shaped like a tear drop but more like an hourglass kinda shape....</li>
            <li>I bought it because it had great reviews and was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>and I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>And have not receive any free ones and this is my honest review.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I don&#x27;t have a beauty blender nor have tried one to compare it with this beauty sponge.</li>
            <li>It seems to just let the foundation stay on top rather than help it sink into skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using Beauty Blender more than a month, I found that these sponges work much better than the Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li>Love it I got this with a promotional discount</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t absorb the water and when you do your makeup with it, it absorbs more makeup than is applied to your face.</li>
            <li>She likes it better than some of the top brands of makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this and hope to buy more for everyone on my gift list this year.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I recieved this item free of charge for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>Order more than one :).</li>
            <li>There are better Blender knockoffs out there ladies.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this product.</li>
            <li>The original droplet  is better!</li>
            <li>okay with</li>
            <li>Theirs seem to be more flexible</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for blender sponges for a while now but have not been able to justify spending $15</li>
            <li>Besides, I figured that with the price, if I fell in love, I would feel much better spending the $15 to stock up and get 7 sponges rather than</li>
            <li>I never saw this as a problem because I would go over it again with the brush to even out the streaks and blend the foundation in more before applying my powdered foundation on over top.</li>
            <li>I love that it is tear shaped so</li>
            <li>I love that it is tear shaped so</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Might be able to use for painting or art projects</li>
            <li>Love the way it blends my make up 😍😍😍</li>
            <li>I endup applying more than I did before using this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used the all magical beauty blender</li>
            <li>I have since purchased more for myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li>i read the reviews and i was expecting more.</li>
            <li>Great product and would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews I read suggested that the Real Techniques Miracle Beauty Sponge is just as good (some say better) than the BB.</li>
            <li>so it blends easily and let&#x27;s you mold it into the shape you wish :)</li>
            <li>this is far from authentic beauty blender, not that great</li>
            <li>Amazing quality and came very fast!</li>
            <li>I like to use my sponge A LOT and use makeup brushes for more defined areas or something really precise, but I apply a light amount of makeup for a natural look almost all of the time, so this sponge is perfect for my full face of makeup.</li>
            <li>I liked this sponge the first couple times I used it, however after about four times it started falling apart!</li>
            <li>Love this beauty sponge I got it for free</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free because of code that was posted on a freebie site that I follow.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free, in feel like it soaks up more of my foundation than what goes on my face.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s latex free as well since I do sometimes have problems with latex.</li>
            <li>Excellent for applying make-up, all is as expected!</li>
            <li>I love the size and it is an overall great</li>
            <li>So easy to apply make up with</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and and helps apply foundation easily.</li>
            <li>The shape of it makes it easy to hold and the design makes it easy to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave any unwanted streaks on my face.</li>
            <li>made applying makeup quite easy</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t blend easily.</li>
            <li>Loved this free sample soft and easy to hold to put on makeup, I would recommend the Pink Beauty Sponge to anyone who want smooth flawless makeup on.</li>
            <li>and I especially love that it doesn&#x27;t soak up my makeup during the application process if I moisten it slightly before I use</li>
            <li>latex free ,,,so easy to use to apply make up ...</li>
            <li>However, blending out my concealer it worked just fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed that no matter how fine my brushes are, I still get streaks in my foundation.</li>
            <li>Arrived quick and blends my foundation in well!</li>
            <li>wonderful little tool...</li>
            <li>Will be buying some once this one is used up.&lt;br /&gt;I got this item for free to review.</li>
            <li>the Real Techniques sponge ($10) is amazing.</li>
            <li>A great tool for make up enthusiasts, those who don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up, AND people looking to learn about proper application.</li>
            <li>This is important to me because it helps blend your liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Cheap and blended my concealer</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on soooo smooth, this sponge covers evenly and blends miraculously.</li>
            <li>I received the gourd shaped sponge for free for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>have received free products to help facilitate my review</li>
            <li>Smoothly applies any type of makeup.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a makeup sponge to apply their makeup smoothly.</li>
            <li>it is important to blend.</li>
            <li>When I saw that Salonsupplystore.com had their Latex Free Makeup Blender Foundation Sponge on sale for $1.98, I knew that I just had to try it.</li>
            <li>: I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>These clean easily and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use out of mine, it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart or started to harden.</li>
            <li>Is cheap but it also looks and feels and smells really cheap</li>
            <li>This is suppose to be the latex free droplet and dupe for a beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m probably sure most of the functionality of the beauty blender really depends on the hand of the user itself.</li>
            <li>its ok for the price, it blends good but not as good as the more expensive ones</li>
            <li>worth the under $3 asking price!</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Then, you can apply foundation or BB cream so quickly and evenly, so your face will look smooth and streak-free.</li>
            <li>I use my BlenderCleanser to clean this.</li>
            <li>Lol) and longer or narrow may be a better word for it.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved this teardrop for her make up collection, reasonable price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>never had a make up sponge but loved it the instant I used it</li>
            <li>There are plenty of decent makeup sponges out there but based on reviews - as well as my own personal experience - the Real Techniques one is the way to go for flawless, natural looking coverage.</li>
            <li>While I have makeup brushes that are good as applying my makeup individually, I haven&#x27;t quite been able to find one that blends them in well enough that it doesn&#x27;t look like I have makeup just caked on or look like I have makeup just sitting on top of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super beauty sponges.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a decent product, but it need a bit more work.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and is long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I love this better than the regular applicator.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this blender sponge, it is perfect, especially if you are on a budget like</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this blender sponge, it is perfect, especially if you are on a budget like</li>
            <li>You can rub this on your face like a normal sponge, or you can kinda dab it on your skin, which is better because it allows you to apply makeup really quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>but I would easily pay full price any day thanks</li>
            <li>its very soft and really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s very soft and easy to clean out and loves the point on it</li>
            <li>Even when I tried to apply some water back after squeezing out the excess, it just does not blend the foundation nicely into your skin.</li>
            <li>Blends nice especially for contours.</li>
            <li>No sponge is worth $20.  </li>
            <li>Since I have started using this sponge, I have been able to completely eliminate a step.</li>
            <li>so you look cleaner and lighter and your makeup stays fresh longer.</li>
            <li>I received this product necessary to facilitate my honest review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, even for the inexpensive price tag, I&#x27;d say that this product isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Works well, worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a super cute, easy to hold onto and manipulate Pink Droplet Beauty Sponge!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The color was too rich and since it wasn&#x27;t blended in with the rest of my skin, it really stood out</li>
            <li>The color was too rich and since it wasn&#x27;t blended in with the rest of my skin, it really stood out</li>
            <li>I was scared to purchase the product since I saw someone say they didn&#x27;t get the right product</li>
            <li>This one, however, despite squeezing all the water out the way I would with a normal BB, stayed damp and huge for FOUR DAYS.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the texture of this is no different than the triangular or square makeup sponges that you can buy at the drugstore in those big bags, and even then I believe those are better than this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and use, and I honestly can&#x27;t live without a blender sponge ever since first discovering them.</li>
            <li>sponge works just as well as my more expensive one (that my dog decided would make a great chew toy).</li>
            <li>It really gives you nice coverage of all those tiny creases.</li>
            <li>It is soft, lightweight and cleans up easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and it applies my foundation on so smooth</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li>it great for getting all those hard to reach areas (under the eyes, nose, by the ears, etc.)</li>
            <li>it great for getting all those hard to reach areas (under the eyes, nose, by the ears, etc.)</li>
            <li>the product arrived earlier than the estimated date ! :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first sponge she has ever used</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>Nothing like the real Beauty Blender!</li>
            <li>Love how they come with different shapes so that I can reach all the hard-to-reach areas on my face.</li>
            <li>I actually ordered more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I am more of a bargain shopper and did not want to spend the amount for an actual name brand Beauty Blender</li>
            <li>Totally love it and definitely repurchasing!!&#x27;</li>
            <li>It is really good for my everyday makeup regimen</li>
            <li>The material is not the same (so it tears more easily and doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly when you &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; it), and the product is much harder than the BB</li>
            <li>Absolutely would suggest buying this if your looking for a more inexpensive alternative to the Beauty Blender with the same results.</li>
            <li>I got very lucky because the 4 dupes that I had worked very well and I am using my last one right now.</li>
            <li>Sponges are super soft!</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty and vibrant!</li>
            <li>Not nearly as soft as the Sephora Beauty Blender and doesn&#x27;t spread the makeup as easily, but at the price it&#x27;s probably worth it.  </li>
            <li>Received the pear shaped beauty sponge instead due to high demand but am still just as satisfied!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I know this should be a Pros, but even when it seems to bounce nicely on the skin, to me it is not as nicely as my previous ones.</li>
            <li>Whether we have seen somebody else make these makeup mistakes or we have committed them ourselves, there is one thing for certain:</li>
            <li>The larger round side is great for the wider planes of the face and neck.</li>
            <li>It makes the whole process easier...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend $20 on the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>how well it helps foundation sink in will be important when needing to make your foundation last longer.</li>
            <li>Who ever said its just like the Beauty Blender has never had the real thing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I may as well have just ordered the real thing, which is what I&#x27;m off to do now...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a real beauty blender</li>
            <li>It blends very well and my makeup stays on all day.</li>
            <li>and it is still holding its shape and holding up very well.</li>
            <li>This is in no way comparable to a real Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin and does not irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ready for</li>
            <li>These are working out really well.</li>
            <li>I can dampen them and the sponge seems to blend really well.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve also seen the girls who don&#x27;t blend their blush in really well</li>
            <li>sponge is cute and pink in color</li>
            <li>sponge is cute and pink in color</li>
            <li>my daughter really likes using this</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge blender.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Pink Droplet Beauty Sponge.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get a low cost sponge without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li>Small size works great for blending and contouring, you can use wet or dry, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s puny and really light pink, and too stiff to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>This one is still not exactly the same as the BeautyBlender, but is the best knockoff I&#x27;ve tried so far and definitely the softest of the blender sponges I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I found it kind of to stiff to blend my makeup the way that I like.</li>
            <li>For instance, I sometimes double up my foundation as concealer for dark spots, usually, I be able to apply a bit more foundation on the spot and use my old sponge&#x27;s tip to just blend it and it will stay put.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping for an affordable dupe of the Beauty Blender (I love it, but it&#x27;s roughly 16 dollars a pop!).</li>
            <li>If you watch Kandee Johnson&#x27;s video about the Beauty Blender, you&#x27;ll see the original version inflates twice as big when it&#x27;s submerged in water.  </li>
            <li>you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate this as &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love my pink beauty sponge it removes my makeup quickly and mess free I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Clean up is also really easy, I simply rinse mine off with water, squeeze out the excess water, and let it air dry the rest of the way.</li>

            <li>: I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.cently started using blush and the first time I tried using it, I felt like I looked like a drag queen!</li>
            <li>Ive been wanting to buy the beauty blender but the price makes me think twice &amp; so far i really like this sponge!</li>
            <li>the current sale price they&#x27;re offering them, this is an amazing deal, especially compare to some higher end brands that offer similar items.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As previously said, I have makeup brushes that allow me to apply most of my makeup</li>
            <li>have a feeling that several of the good reviews on here are customers who&#x27;ve never used the official BB and don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing out on.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this based on the reviews, however, it just didn&#x27;t deliver in quality for</li>
            <li>- I had to use nearly three times as much</li>
            <li>This sponge does not expand at all when wet, and has a bumpy foam texture that does not apply makeup evenly or smoothly.</li>
            <li>sponge is easy to clean with just running water and a few drops of your facial cleanser or hand soap.</li>
            <li>normally would.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I specifically ordered 4 of the hot pink because I was putting together a colorful gift basket.  </li>
            <li>I used brand new make up and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly at all.</li>
            <li>Very soft and squishy.</li>
            <li>The beauty sponge came very early and was very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li>It works fine however it has an odd odor.</li>
            <li>I have washed it several times even before its first use.</li>
            <li>I feel like this particular &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; is possibly a cheaper version of the real one.</li>
            <li>it makes for a mess free make up application.</li>
            <li>I used the pink droplet sponge the very first day i received it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything bad about this sponge which is surprising since I can usually point out at least one thing I dislike about most beauty products I own.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything bad about this sponge which is surprising since I can usually point out at least one thing I dislike about most beauty products I own.</li>
            <li>Love this little gadget and I use it daily!</li>
            <li>but I used it for complete coverage of my foundation</li>
            <li>and it went on smooth and well blended in,no lines of uneven tones at all .</li>
            <li>This sponge is so soft I just recieved it today.</li>
            <li>and they weren&#x27;t even soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller then the real blender</li>
            <li>but the wait is ridiculous but for the price Is very cheap for the qualify of this sponge</li>
            <li>I received my pink Beauty Sponge Blender today for my Daughter and she used it right away and said she loves it.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend you spend a bit more money and purchase a sponge from the actual beauty blender brand, it will last a very long time and be way more effective than this terrible product.</li>
            <li>How have i survived so long without one of these haha</li>
            <li>not easy to clean though.</li>
            <li>just wet it first before using</li>
            <li>Picks up a lot of product if you don&#x27;t wet it first</li>
            <li>I honestly think that this little guy is BETTER than the expensive Sephora beauty blender!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being relatively new to the whole makeup thing, I haven&#x27;t used this sponge for anything else other than foundation and to help blend blush in when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I love how it is mess free and leaves not streaks on my face like other sponges or brushes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the buy, is too hard, absorbs too much water, just wipes my makeup off.</li>
            <li>I find that leaving it on the counter overnight after washing allows it to be thoroughly dry and ready for use by morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No other forms of payment were or will be received.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous dupes and unfortunately they&#x27;re usually so hard, so I was in shock at how this feels and applies so exactly like those overpriced (but unfortunately super effective) big name sponges.</li>
            <li>Even after soaking it  in water, it barely softens.</li>
            <li>You get it really wet and then squeeze the water out with a towel to really &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It is soft, absorb water, and expand to almost double its size.</li>
            <li>Not pink, it&#x27;s a pastel orange.</li>
            <li>It is also very dense and doesn&#x27;t swell up when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>Mine was peach not pink.</li>
            <li>It blended the blush in enough that it looked natural on my skin while still giving my cheekbones the definition I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I just recently started using blush and the first time I tried using it, I felt like I looked like a drag queen!</li>
            <li>This particular sponge seems very dry when I try to blend my foundation.</li>
            <li>so it really stands out amongst all of my other makeup tools.</li>
            <li>so it really stands out amongst all of my other makeup tools.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the real beauty sponge - no softness, no absorbency - it stays hard and doesn&#x27;t facilitate the application of makeup as well as the real thing.</li>
            <li>The sponge is soft and gentle on the skin but firm enough to retain its shape.</li>

            <li>I have purchased other BeautyBlender knockoffs in the past and they aren&#x27;t usually as soft as the original (which is like a marshmallow and never pulls or tugs on the skin).</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to because it is a not as soft as the sponges I normally use.</li>
            <li>The application is ok, but its a little small.  </li>
            <li>Some of my sponges in the past is a bit harder to clean bc</li>

            <li> Customer service was superb.</li>

            <li> Amazing wish I had more</li>
            <li> I actually kind of like the pear-shaped Makeup Blender better, it&#x27;s easier to grip and hold, but you can choose whichever you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had this sponge before it get the job done best beauty blend I use so far</li>
            <li> This product is easy to put your make up on and use it as you need too!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong  latex smell like the others do!</li>
            <li> The better among those with the best so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to replace these every 3 months no matter how often you clean them, and at this price no bloodletting is involved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This sponge is awesome it blends like no other sponge I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li> Very cheap, should have read the description.  </li>
            <li> love the design of this sponge.</li>
            <li> The tip is perfect for applying my foundation around my eyes, nose and lips and the rounder side allows for even, streak free application on the remaining areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft against my skin</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> There are so many better dupes out there.</li>
            <li> will buy more as I got this wirth discount</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed using and will order again.</li>
            <li> I recieved the one not shaped like a tear drop but more like an hourglass kinda shape....</li>
            <li> I bought it because it had great reviews and was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> and I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> And have not receive any free ones and this is my honest review.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I don&#x27;t have a beauty blender nor have tried one to compare it with this beauty sponge.</li>
            <li> It seems to just let the foundation stay on top rather than help it sink into skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Beauty Blender more than a month, I found that these sponges work much better than the Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li> Love it I got this with a promotional discount</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t absorb the water and when you do your makeup with it, it absorbs more makeup than is applied to your face.</li>
            <li> She likes it better than some of the top brands of makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this and hope to buy more for everyone on my gift list this year.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I recieved this item free of charge for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> Order more than one :).</li>
            <li> There are better Blender knockoffs out there ladies.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product.</li>
            <li> The original droplet  is better!</li>
            <li> okay with</li>
            <li> Theirs seem to be more flexible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for blender sponges for a while now but have not been able to justify spending $15</li>
            <li> Besides, I figured that with the price, if I fell in love, I would feel much better spending the $15 to stock up and get 7 sponges rather than</li>
            <li> I never saw this as a problem because I would go over it again with the brush to even out the streaks and blend the foundation in more before applying my powdered foundation on over top.</li>
            <li> I love that it is tear shaped so</li>
            <li> I love that it is tear shaped so</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Might be able to use for painting or art projects</li>
            <li> Love the way it blends my make up 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> I endup applying more than I did before using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the all magical beauty blender</li>
            <li> I have since purchased more for myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li> i read the reviews and i was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Great product and would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews I read suggested that the Real Techniques Miracle Beauty Sponge is just as good (some say better) than the BB.</li>
            <li> so it blends easily and let&#x27;s you mold it into the shape you wish :)</li>
            <li> this is far from authentic beauty blender, not that great</li>
            <li> Amazing quality and came very fast!</li>
            <li> I like to use my sponge A LOT and use makeup brushes for more defined areas or something really precise, but I apply a light amount of makeup for a natural look almost all of the time, so this sponge is perfect for my full face of makeup.</li>
            <li> I liked this sponge the first couple times I used it, however after about four times it started falling apart!</li>
            <li> Love this beauty sponge I got it for free</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free because of code that was posted on a freebie site that I follow.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free, in feel like it soaks up more of my foundation than what goes on my face.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s latex free as well since I do sometimes have problems with latex.</li>
            <li> Excellent for applying make-up, all is as expected!</li>
            <li> I love the size and it is an overall great</li>
            <li> So easy to apply make up with</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and and helps apply foundation easily.</li>
            <li> The shape of it makes it easy to hold and the design makes it easy to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave any unwanted streaks on my face.</li>
            <li> made applying makeup quite easy</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t blend easily.</li>
            <li> Loved this free sample soft and easy to hold to put on makeup, I would recommend the Pink Beauty Sponge to anyone who want smooth flawless makeup on.</li>
            <li> and I especially love that it doesn&#x27;t soak up my makeup during the application process if I moisten it slightly before I use</li>
            <li> latex free ,,,so easy to use to apply make up ...</li>
            <li> However, blending out my concealer it worked just fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that no matter how fine my brushes are, I still get streaks in my foundation.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and blends my foundation in well!</li>
            <li> wonderful little tool...</li>
            <li> Will be buying some once this one is used up.&lt;br /&gt;I got this item for free to review.</li>
            <li> the Real Techniques sponge ($10) is amazing.</li>
            <li> A great tool for make up enthusiasts, those who don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up, AND people looking to learn about proper application.</li>
            <li> This is important to me because it helps blend your liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Cheap and blended my concealer</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on soooo smooth, this sponge covers evenly and blends miraculously.</li>
            <li> I received the gourd shaped sponge for free for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> have received free products to help facilitate my review</li>
            <li> Smoothly applies any type of makeup.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a makeup sponge to apply their makeup smoothly.</li>
            <li> it is important to blend.</li>
            <li> When I saw that Salonsupplystore.com had their Latex Free Makeup Blender Foundation Sponge on sale for $1.98, I knew that I just had to try it.</li>
            <li> : I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> These clean easily and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use out of mine, it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart or started to harden.</li>
            <li> Is cheap but it also looks and feels and smells really cheap</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be the latex free droplet and dupe for a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m probably sure most of the functionality of the beauty blender really depends on the hand of the user itself.</li>
            <li> its ok for the price, it blends good but not as good as the more expensive ones</li>
            <li> worth the under $3 asking price!</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Then, you can apply foundation or BB cream so quickly and evenly, so your face will look smooth and streak-free.</li>
            <li> I use my BlenderCleanser to clean this.</li>
            <li> Lol) and longer or narrow may be a better word for it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this teardrop for her make up collection, reasonable price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> never had a make up sponge but loved it the instant I used it</li>
            <li> There are plenty of decent makeup sponges out there but based on reviews - as well as my own personal experience - the Real Techniques one is the way to go for flawless, natural looking coverage.</li>
            <li> While I have makeup brushes that are good as applying my makeup individually, I haven&#x27;t quite been able to find one that blends them in well enough that it doesn&#x27;t look like I have makeup just caked on or look like I have makeup just sitting on top of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super beauty sponges.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a decent product, but it need a bit more work.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and is long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I love this better than the regular applicator.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this blender sponge, it is perfect, especially if you are on a budget like</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this blender sponge, it is perfect, especially if you are on a budget like</li>
            <li> You can rub this on your face like a normal sponge, or you can kinda dab it on your skin, which is better because it allows you to apply makeup really quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> but I would easily pay full price any day thanks</li>
            <li> its very soft and really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> She said it&#x27;s very soft and easy to clean out and loves the point on it</li>
            <li> Even when I tried to apply some water back after squeezing out the excess, it just does not blend the foundation nicely into your skin.</li>
            <li> Blends nice especially for contours.</li>
            <li> No sponge is worth $20.  </li>
            <li> Since I have started using this sponge, I have been able to completely eliminate a step.</li>
            <li> so you look cleaner and lighter and your makeup stays fresh longer.</li>
            <li> I received this product necessary to facilitate my honest review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, even for the inexpensive price tag, I&#x27;d say that this product isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Works well, worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a super cute, easy to hold onto and manipulate Pink Droplet Beauty Sponge!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The color was too rich and since it wasn&#x27;t blended in with the rest of my skin, it really stood out</li>
            <li> The color was too rich and since it wasn&#x27;t blended in with the rest of my skin, it really stood out</li>
            <li> I was scared to purchase the product since I saw someone say they didn&#x27;t get the right product</li>
            <li> This one, however, despite squeezing all the water out the way I would with a normal BB, stayed damp and huge for FOUR DAYS.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the texture of this is no different than the triangular or square makeup sponges that you can buy at the drugstore in those big bags, and even then I believe those are better than this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and use, and I honestly can&#x27;t live without a blender sponge ever since first discovering them.</li>
            <li> sponge works just as well as my more expensive one (that my dog decided would make a great chew toy).</li>
            <li> It really gives you nice coverage of all those tiny creases.</li>
            <li> It is soft, lightweight and cleans up easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and it applies my foundation on so smooth</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li> it great for getting all those hard to reach areas (under the eyes, nose, by the ears, etc.)</li>
            <li> it great for getting all those hard to reach areas (under the eyes, nose, by the ears, etc.)</li>
            <li> the product arrived earlier than the estimated date ! :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first sponge she has ever used</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> Nothing like the real Beauty Blender!</li>
            <li> Love how they come with different shapes so that I can reach all the hard-to-reach areas on my face.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered more.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am more of a bargain shopper and did not want to spend the amount for an actual name brand Beauty Blender</li>
            <li> Totally love it and definitely repurchasing!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> It is really good for my everyday makeup regimen</li>
            <li> The material is not the same (so it tears more easily and doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly when you &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; it), and the product is much harder than the BB</li>
            <li> Absolutely would suggest buying this if your looking for a more inexpensive alternative to the Beauty Blender with the same results.</li>
            <li> I got very lucky because the 4 dupes that I had worked very well and I am using my last one right now.</li>
            <li> Sponges are super soft!</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty and vibrant!</li>
            <li> Not nearly as soft as the Sephora Beauty Blender and doesn&#x27;t spread the makeup as easily, but at the price it&#x27;s probably worth it.  </li>
            <li> Received the pear shaped beauty sponge instead due to high demand but am still just as satisfied!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I know this should be a Pros, but even when it seems to bounce nicely on the skin, to me it is not as nicely as my previous ones.</li>
            <li> Whether we have seen somebody else make these makeup mistakes or we have committed them ourselves, there is one thing for certain:</li>
            <li> The larger round side is great for the wider planes of the face and neck.</li>
            <li> It makes the whole process easier...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend $20 on the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> how well it helps foundation sink in will be important when needing to make your foundation last longer.</li>
            <li> Who ever said its just like the Beauty Blender has never had the real thing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I may as well have just ordered the real thing, which is what I&#x27;m off to do now...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a real beauty blender</li>
            <li> It blends very well and my makeup stays on all day.</li>
            <li> and it is still holding its shape and holding up very well.</li>
            <li> This is in no way comparable to a real Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin and does not irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ready for</li>
            <li> These are working out really well.</li>
            <li> I can dampen them and the sponge seems to blend really well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve also seen the girls who don&#x27;t blend their blush in really well</li>
            <li> sponge is cute and pink in color</li>
            <li> sponge is cute and pink in color</li>
            <li> my daughter really likes using this</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge blender.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Pink Droplet Beauty Sponge.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get a low cost sponge without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li> Small size works great for blending and contouring, you can use wet or dry, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s puny and really light pink, and too stiff to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> This one is still not exactly the same as the BeautyBlender, but is the best knockoff I&#x27;ve tried so far and definitely the softest of the blender sponges I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I found it kind of to stiff to blend my makeup the way that I like.</li>
            <li> For instance, I sometimes double up my foundation as concealer for dark spots, usually, I be able to apply a bit more foundation on the spot and use my old sponge&#x27;s tip to just blend it and it will stay put.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for an affordable dupe of the Beauty Blender (I love it, but it&#x27;s roughly 16 dollars a pop!).</li>
            <li> If you watch Kandee Johnson&#x27;s video about the Beauty Blender, you&#x27;ll see the original version inflates twice as big when it&#x27;s submerged in water.  </li>
            <li> you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate this as &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love my pink beauty sponge it removes my makeup quickly and mess free I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Clean up is also really easy, I simply rinse mine off with water, squeeze out the excess water, and let it air dry the rest of the way.</li>

            <li> : I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.cently started using blush and the first time I tried using it, I felt like I looked like a drag queen!</li>
            <li> Ive been wanting to buy the beauty blender but the price makes me think twice &amp; so far i really like this sponge!</li>
            <li> the current sale price they&#x27;re offering them, this is an amazing deal, especially compare to some higher end brands that offer similar items.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As previously said, I have makeup brushes that allow me to apply most of my makeup</li>
            <li> have a feeling that several of the good reviews on here are customers who&#x27;ve never used the official BB and don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing out on.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this based on the reviews, however, it just didn&#x27;t deliver in quality for</li>
            <li> - I had to use nearly three times as much</li>
            <li> This sponge does not expand at all when wet, and has a bumpy foam texture that does not apply makeup evenly or smoothly.</li>
            <li> sponge is easy to clean with just running water and a few drops of your facial cleanser or hand soap.</li>
            <li> normally would.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered 4 of the hot pink because I was putting together a colorful gift basket.  </li>
            <li> I used brand new make up and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly at all.</li>
            <li> Very soft and squishy.</li>
            <li> The beauty sponge came very early and was very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> It works fine however it has an odd odor.</li>
            <li> I have washed it several times even before its first use.</li>
            <li> I feel like this particular &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; is possibly a cheaper version of the real one.</li>
            <li> it makes for a mess free make up application.</li>
            <li> I used the pink droplet sponge the very first day i received it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything bad about this sponge which is surprising since I can usually point out at least one thing I dislike about most beauty products I own.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything bad about this sponge which is surprising since I can usually point out at least one thing I dislike about most beauty products I own.</li>
            <li> Love this little gadget and I use it daily!</li>
            <li> but I used it for complete coverage of my foundation</li>
            <li> and it went on smooth and well blended in,no lines of uneven tones at all .</li>
            <li> This sponge is so soft I just recieved it today.</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t even soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller then the real blender</li>
            <li> but the wait is ridiculous but for the price Is very cheap for the qualify of this sponge</li>
            <li> I received my pink Beauty Sponge Blender today for my Daughter and she used it right away and said she loves it.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend you spend a bit more money and purchase a sponge from the actual beauty blender brand, it will last a very long time and be way more effective than this terrible product.</li>
            <li> How have i survived so long without one of these haha</li>
            <li> not easy to clean though.</li>
            <li> just wet it first before using</li>
            <li> Picks up a lot of product if you don&#x27;t wet it first</li>
            <li> I honestly think that this little guy is BETTER than the expensive Sephora beauty blender!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being relatively new to the whole makeup thing, I haven&#x27;t used this sponge for anything else other than foundation and to help blend blush in when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love how it is mess free and leaves not streaks on my face like other sponges or brushes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the buy, is too hard, absorbs too much water, just wipes my makeup off.</li>
            <li> I find that leaving it on the counter overnight after washing allows it to be thoroughly dry and ready for use by morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No other forms of payment were or will be received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous dupes and unfortunately they&#x27;re usually so hard, so I was in shock at how this feels and applies so exactly like those overpriced (but unfortunately super effective) big name sponges.</li>
            <li> Even after soaking it  in water, it barely softens.</li>
            <li> You get it really wet and then squeeze the water out with a towel to really &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is soft, absorb water, and expand to almost double its size.</li>
            <li> Not pink, it&#x27;s a pastel orange.</li>
            <li> It is also very dense and doesn&#x27;t swell up when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Mine was peach not pink.</li>
            <li> It blended the blush in enough that it looked natural on my skin while still giving my cheekbones the definition I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I just recently started using blush and the first time I tried using it, I felt like I looked like a drag queen!</li>
            <li> This particular sponge seems very dry when I try to blend my foundation.</li>
            <li> so it really stands out amongst all of my other makeup tools.</li>
            <li> so it really stands out amongst all of my other makeup tools.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the real beauty sponge - no softness, no absorbency - it stays hard and doesn&#x27;t facilitate the application of makeup as well as the real thing.</li>
            <li> The sponge is soft and gentle on the skin but firm enough to retain its shape.</li>

            <li> I have purchased other BeautyBlender knockoffs in the past and they aren&#x27;t usually as soft as the original (which is like a marshmallow and never pulls or tugs on the skin).</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to because it is a not as soft as the sponges I normally use.</li>
            <li> The application is ok, but its a little small.  </li>
            <li> Some of my sponges in the past is a bit harder to clean bc</li>
            <li> Some people would do a dab and twist when using beauty blender, but this exact sponge make it a bit hard to do</li>
            <li> The regular BB would dry and return to regular size within an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I set my foundation with powder, but it does not last as long as it</li>
            <li> All of these reviews are sponsored and clearly not about this same product.</li>
            <li> The pink droplet that I received was actually different then the photo provided but still does the same thing.  </li>
            <li> I tried for about a week before going back to my plain old Covergirl sponges.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I may be a cheap skate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Beauty Blender dupes before, and they all have a smooth foam texture and expand to at least twice their size when wet.</li>
            <li> Complete waste</li>
            <li> I apply the same technique, but this sponge seems to some how drag both layers and just does not blend and even take away product.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave 4 stars is bc I recieved was smaller and wasnt pink its a peach color which im</li>
            <li> It did take a long time for them to get to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I expected though.</li>
            <li> Tad bit smaller than expected</li>
            <li> The real one, what I mean by saying that, are the ones that are used by the beauty gurus.</li>
            <li> Super small and hard.</li>
            <li> This sponge is too hard doesnt really get soft with the water makes it hard to appy your makeup</li>
            <li> I know it sounds odd, but I find that even when it does not absorb foundation (barely any staining visibly on sponge), it seems to some how drag the foundation and not make it stay.</li>
            <li> These are pretty bad, they are about 1/2 the size of the real beauty blender and they suck up all the makeup</li>
            <li> pictures show the sponge dry (picture 1) and wet (picture 2).</li>
            <li> I bought three of these, one for me, my mom and sister and since I have previously used these from different brands, I had to teach them to how to use the sponge.  </li>
            <li> Works great, smells terrible.</li>
            <li> received this Pink Droplet Makeup Sponge at a reduced price in exchange for testing and review and am giving it a well deserved 5 star recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It did not expand when wet either.</li>
            <li> So curious</li>
            <li> This is nothing like a beauty blender, if you try to get it wet</li>
            <li> (imagine applying your makeup with a wet stress ball).</li>
            <li> The amount of money I wasted trying out multiple dupes ended up costing me about 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I received the wrong item or a different item; mine was a much lighter pink color than the picture (think pastel baby pink).</li>
            <li> The color of the droplet was a peach color and the name of the droplet claims that it is pink.</li>
            <li> The droplet itself does not expand whatsoever when squeezed several times under water and the droplet is firm and hurts my face when I dab my foundation around.</li>
            <li> I would have rather spent the almost two dollars on candy than this.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely NOT what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t expand when wet.</li>
            <li> Soaks my foundation up, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Arrived a week sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> You can use the thick rounded side for larger areas of the face (like the forehead and cheeks) and the pointy end for smaller areas (like around the nose and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, it&#x27;s just not very &amp;#34;spongy.&amp;#34; It just kind of smears around liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> However, with my past experiences, the sponges that I had were a tad bit harder and had somewhat a resistance in the core, so when squeezing out water, some retained back.</li>
            <li> However, after my first use, I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Extremely dense.</li>
            <li> It did not irritate my skin, it applies liquid foundation on extremely well.  </li>
            <li> The droplet is less than two inches long and one inch and a half in width.</li>
            <li> The key, as always, is to blend blend blend, but you don&#x27;t need to work nearly as hard with this brush to help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was too hard and after like a month it started breaking and flaking off with only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A bit easier to clean, does not stain badly.</li>
            <li> When I use the sponge to apply my liquid foundation on, I am left behind with absolutely no streaks</li>
            <li> You need less than half of the foundation for coverage</li>
            <li> No really flexible and to small</li>
            <li> I have had some bad luck with cheap makeup sponges in the past but this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> So, I like this little sponge.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little closer to a BB since spending $15/every 3 months, for a makeup sponge is against my religion.</li>
            <li> I paid extra to get the 4 pink, rather then choosing the option to just get the set of 4 random colors.  </li>
            <li> Not too firm</li>
            <li> Though put in mind that I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but those were durable.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it, but may be not an everyday use.</li>
            <li> because it was to firm.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used Makeup Blender Sponges before, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.</li>
            <li> so it was a waste of about $2.</li>
            <li> I am not that mad since I don&#x27;t completely waste that much money on it.</li>
            <li> The sponge is pale pink and very small.</li>
            <li> There is no strong smell at all.</li>
            <li> Waste of money also cause it&#x27;s really small</li>
            <li> Way to stiff and small</li>
            <li> I mean I do understand that I get what I paid for, but those that I received were worse than those white makeup wedges that you can buy from dollar stores.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it was hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Lately, I want to buy a few backup, but the seller that I bought those from were no longer on ebay, so I started to buy them here since I had a lot of GCs on here.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, aside from its shape (color was different from the product photo), this is nothing like the official BB.</li>
            <li> Reason being is whenever I tried using it, it was difficult getting it into the tiny crevices like around my nose, etc.</li>
            <li> (is it even suppose to be that small)</li>
            <li> It did have a small smell but nothing that lasted past one wash.</li>
            <li> This thing is stiff and doesn&#x27;t absorb water hardly at all.</li>
            <li> It is very firm though.</li>
            <li> But very stiff.</li>
            <li> its very stiff and hard.</li>
            <li> They are hard, has latex smell, does not absorb water, cannot expand, and does not help you blend your foundation.</li>
            <li> it absorb foundation and make it hard to remove stain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its hard and doesn&#x27;t expand at all.</li>
            <li> and it feels like a rubbery and hard spongy material.</li>
            <li> So hard.</li>
            <li> Its not  the same thing, It sucks up my makeup alot and practically looks like I didn&#x27;t put any foundation on, in the bad way.</li>
            <li> This sponge is so little and totally useless.  </li>
            <li> I even try to buy one on ebay and 4 sponges from 4 different sellers on here sold me bad ones.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> This sponge was stiff and uncomfortable when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very, very hard.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the beauty blender, very hard  texture.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t be the only one that thinks that price is a little outrageous for a sponge.</li>
            <li> This is the worst one I&#x27;ve tried, I have no idea how it got nearly a 5 star rating?</li>
            <li> I recommend spending 5 extra bucks and purchasing that one because this one is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received the wrong droplet</li>
            <li> GET FOR WHAT YOU PAY :( not happy about it</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought a small teardrop shaped one and it was horrible</li>
            <li> but I got a bad vibe from it.</li>
            <li> No problems or bad reviews with this product</li>
            <li> but when I received it, I was completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to receive 4 of the peach ones.  </li>
            <li> and I hated the way it looked.</li>
            <li> and I hated the way it looked.</li>
            <li> Very bad.</li>
            <li> I was very frustrated.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a super cute, easy to hold onto and manipulate Pink Droplet Beauty Sponge!&lt;br /&gt;I love the design of this sponge. The tip is perfect for applying my foundation around my eyes, nose and lips and the rounder side allows for even, streak free application on the remaining areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft against my skin and I especially love that it doesn&#x27;t soak up my makeup during the application process if I moisten it slightly before I use it.&lt;br /&gt;It holds up well to washing and doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s shape. I find that leaving it on the counter overnight after washing allows it to be thoroughly dry and ready for use by morning.&lt;br /&gt;I received this Pink Droplet Makeup Sponge at a reduced price in exchange for testing and review and am giving it a well deserved 5 star recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the under $3 asking price!</li>
            <li> Received the pear shaped beauty sponge instead due to high demand but am still just as satisfied!</li>
            <li> Works better with finger...don&#x27;t get me wrong it will work for you if you know what you are doing!</li>
            <li> wroks great. Took a little getting used to but once I used a coule of times was great. Evenly spreads foundation out. Thank you for allowing me to review this product</li>
            <li> Was going to buy, but raised the price!!</li>
            <li> Very soft and squishy. I like the feel of it while putting my foundation on. Very nice makeup sponge. Will be buying some once this one is used up.&lt;br /&gt;I got this item for free to review.</li>
            <li> Love this beauty sponge I got it for free and I love it. It works great for my liquid foundation</li>
            <li> I used the pink droplet sponge the very first day i received it. I wilk definitely be buying, i like the way it blends my makeup.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product... I had gotten it on promotion, but believe me will be buying more and putting the good word out. It makes the whole process easier...</li>
            <li> this is a great product that i did receive for free to try....latex free ,,,so easy to use to apply make up ...love the point ,,great to get around eyes and doesnt take but one application of make up ...on applicator for me...love the bright color..does not cause any irritation...wonderful little tool...</li>
            <li> The sponge I received is a different shape but still does what I need it to do. They even sent a slip along stating that they rain out of the tear drop shape and that is why I received a different one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read tons of reviews and comparisons of various brands of makeup sponges to the BB. Most of the reviews I read suggested that the Real Techniques Miracle Beauty Sponge is just as good (some say better) than the BB. While I haven&#x27;t tried the BB ($20 for a sponge? No thank you) the Real Techniques sponge ($10) is amazing. There are plenty of decent makeup sponges out there but based on reviews - as well as my own personal experience - the Real Techniques one is the way to go for flawless, natural looking coverage. I recommend spending 5 extra bucks and purchasing that one because this one is AWFUL. There are so many better dupes out there. This is the worst one I&#x27;ve tried, I have no idea how it got nearly a 5 star rating? It&#x27;s very, very hard. Even after soaking it  in water, it barely softens. Complete waste</li>
            <li> A great tool for make up enthusiasts, those who don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up, AND people looking to learn about proper application. I love the size and it is an overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my review on my blog https://airforcewifeairforcelife.wordpress.com/2015/05/11/amazon-reviews-may-11/</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I got this free through a promotion code and honestly I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> You can use a blender sponge to apply your makeup or to blend it out. I like to use my sponge A LOT and use makeup brushes for more defined areas or something really precise, but I apply a light amount of makeup for a natural look almost all of the time, so this sponge is perfect for my full face of makeup. You can use the thick rounded side for larger areas of the face (like the forehead and cheeks) and the pointy end for smaller areas (like around the nose and eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You always want to use this damp. You get it really wet and then squeeze the water out with a towel to really &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; it, so it&#x27;s just moist. Then, you can apply foundation or BB cream so quickly and evenly, so your face will look smooth and streak-free. You can rub this on your face like a normal sponge, or you can kinda dab it on your skin, which is better because it allows you to apply makeup really quickly and evenly. It&#x27;s easy to hold and use, and I honestly can&#x27;t live without a blender sponge ever since first discovering them. This holds its shape well and you can keep your blender sponges for up to 8 months. I use my BlenderCleanser to clean this. I have purchased other BeautyBlender knockoffs in the past and they aren&#x27;t usually as soft as the original (which is like a marshmallow and never pulls or tugs on the skin). This one is still not exactly the same as the BeautyBlender, but is the best knockoff I&#x27;ve tried so far and definitely the softest of the blender sponges I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> this is nice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; must have item</li>
            <li> Loved  it. Have senestive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irrate it. will buy more as I got this wirth discount</li>
            <li> So, I like this little sponge. Took forever to arrive and smelled kind of like chemicals, but that went away once I washed it. It is very firm though.</li>
            <li> This sponge is so little and totally useless.  I threw it in the trash as soon as I saw it.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had some bad luck with cheap makeup sponges in the past but this one did not disappoint. I always read reviews but still sometimes end up with some not so great products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge works just as well as my more expensive one (that my dog decided would make a great chew toy). I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot because I knew it was possible it would get destroyed again. I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get a low cost sponge without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed using and will order again.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the beauty blender, very hard  texture. Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> ITS AWSOME ! the product arrived earlier than the estimated date ! :)</li>
            <li> Super beauty sponges.  I am delighted with the product and would order them again.  Customer service was superb.</li>
            <li> very nice and the price was great</li>
            <li> This was terrible. I&#x27;d rather spend $20 on the real beauty blender. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter it&#x27;s the first sponge she has ever used it works great applys makeup evenly</li>
            <li> I recieved the one not shaped like a tear drop but more like an hourglass kinda shape....I found it kind of to stiff to blend my makeup the way that I like. If you use more of a watery foundation this would work perfect.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. I bought it because it had great reviews and was very inexpensive. I have a beauty blender and it is nothing to compared to it. This sponge was stiff and uncomfortable when applying makeup. It did not expand when wet either.</li>
            <li> Very affordable. But very stiff. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I love my pink beauty sponge it removes my makeup quickly and mess free I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, it&#x27;s just not very &amp;#34;spongy.&amp;#34; It just kind of smears around liquid foundation. I&#x27;ve been using it to blend instead.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to put your make up on and use it as you need too!</li>
            <li> Really works! Not too firm so it blends easily and let&#x27;s you mold it into the shape you wish :)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, I got as a special and I love how it feels on my skin. It works great as it blends in my foundation on my face.</li>
            <li> At first, when this arrive, I was very happy. However, after my first use, I am not impressed. I have seen a lot of review on here were from being given item, but with honest review. I bought this from Salon Supply Store seller. And have not receive any free ones and this is my honest review. I am not a pro-makeup artist, but considered myself a makeup enthusiast. I have done some freelance for my close friends and family, so I considered myself in intermediate level. Truthfully, I don&#x27;t have a beauty blender nor have tried one to compare it with this beauty sponge. However, I will try my best to give you an idea of what you look for and why paying the price of five dollar vs paying 2-3 dollars for one. About 3-4 years ago, I bought several beauty blender dupes on ebay for around $2-3 dollar each. I got very lucky because the 4 dupes that I had worked very well and I am using my last one right now. Though put in mind that I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but those were durable. Lately, I want to buy a few backup, but the seller that I bought those from were no longer on ebay, so I started to buy them here since I had a lot of GCs on here. I even try to buy one on ebay and 4 sponges from 4 different sellers on here sold me bad ones. I mean I do understand that I get what I paid for, but those that I received were worse than those white makeup wedges that you can buy from dollar stores. They are hard, has latex smell, does not absorb water, cannot expand, and does not help you blend your foundation. I was very frustrated. I decided to buy this sponge and fork out almost $5 bucks to buy this and here is my Pros and Cons for it:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It is soft, absorb water, and expand to almost double its size. Does not absorb foundation.&lt;br /&gt;-A bit easier to clean, does not stain badly. Some of my sponges in the past is a bit harder to clean bc it absorb foundation and make it hard to remove stain.&lt;br /&gt;-A lot cheaper than an actual Beauty Blender&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Rememberthat you need to soak this in water and squeeze out the excess water when using  this to blend. However, with my past experiences, the sponges that I had were a tad bit harder and had somewhat a resistance in the core, so when squeezing out water, some retained back. This is important to me because it helps blend your liquid foundation. This particular sponge seems very dry when I try to blend my foundation. Even when I tried to apply some water back after squeezing out the excess, it just does not blend the foundation nicely into your skin. It seems to just let the foundation stay on top rather than help it sink into skin. The blend-ability and how well it helps foundation sink in will be important when needing to make your foundation last longer. I set my foundation with powder, but it does not last as long as it normally would.&lt;br /&gt;-I know this should be a Pros, but even when it seems to bounce nicely on the skin, to me it is not as nicely as my previous ones. That bouncing also help when blending your foundation. Some people would do a dab and twist when using beauty blender, but this exact sponge make it a bit hard to do so.&lt;br /&gt;- I know it sounds odd, but I find that even when it does not absorb foundation (barely any staining visibly on sponge), it seems to some how drag the foundation and not make it stay. For instance, I sometimes double up my foundation as concealer for dark spots, usually, I be able to apply a bit more foundation on the spot and use my old sponge&#x27;s tip to just blend it and it will stay put. I apply the same technique, but this sponge seems to some how drag both layers and just does not blend and even take away product. So curious why?!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this three stars because it kinda do its job. I am not that mad since I don&#x27;t completely waste that much money on it. I think it is a decent product, but it need a bit more work. I will continue using it, but may be not an everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this sponge before &amp; it works wonders , need more !</li>
            <li> How have i survived so long without one of these haha</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product and we use it often</li>
            <li> Love these! Works great</li>
            <li> I do not like it !!! I thought will expand if a damp it but not...</li>
            <li> Works great, smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the buy, is too hard, absorbs too much water, just wipes my makeup off.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality and came very fast!</li>
            <li> Amazing wish I had more</li>
            <li> Nothing like the real Beauty Blender! Its hard and doesn&#x27;t expand at all. Who ever said its just like the Beauty Blender has never had the real thing. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Works great. Bought this for my niece and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy! Blends nice especially for contours. Good thing I didn&#x27;t buy the $20 one from sephora!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  It&#x27;s nice and soft and works great when I use it to apply and blend my makeup!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Not pink, it&#x27;s a pastel orange. Super small and hard. Feels like a stress ball tapping against my face. Doesn&#x27;t absorb water well at all</li>
            <li> I have been using Beauty Blender more than a month, I found that these sponges work much better than the Beauty Blender.  Love how they come with different shapes so that I can reach all the hard-to-reach areas on my face. These sponges have definitely changed the way I wear makeup. My foundation goes on flawlessly. Sponges are super soft! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought a ton of these and absolutely love them applies make up smoothly and great blending tool</li>
            <li> It works really well. I actually ordered more.</li>
            <li> Love it I got this with a promotional discount but I would easily pay full price any day thanks</li>
            <li> This is nothing like a beauty blender, if you try to get it wet it doesn&#x27;t absorb the water and when you do your makeup with it, it absorbs more makeup than is applied to your face. I highly recomend you spend a bit more money and purchase a sponge from the actual beauty blender brand, it will last a very long time and be way more effective than this terrible product. Even though it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> never had a make up sponge but loved it the instant I used it</li>
            <li> I bought for my wife. She uses it alot. She likes it better than some of the top brands of makeup. She&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I love it, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My wife likes to use this stuff. The better among those with the best so far.</li>
            <li> so great for blending! I recommend this blender so cheap and works so great just wet it first before using</li>
            <li> This sponge not only does touch-up areas but I used it for complete coverage of my foundation and it went on smooth and well blended in,no lines of uneven tones at all . I love this and hope to buy more for everyone on my gift list this year.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay $20!  This works great for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Thanks! I love this product... Keeps my skin oil free since Im not using my hands to apply my makeup anymore!!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a sponge like this for my foundation so that I don&#x27;t have to use my fingers. I love how it is mess free and leaves not streaks on my face like other sponges or brushes I have used in the past. It also works great for blending.  I recieved this item free of charge for an honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured. The sponge is pale pink and very small. It is also very dense and doesn&#x27;t swell up when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Love love love this make up sponge! Order more than one :).</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for an affordable dupe of the Beauty Blender (I love it, but it&#x27;s roughly 16 dollars a pop!). Unfortunately, aside from its shape (color was different from the product photo), this is nothing like the official BB. The material is not the same (so it tears more easily and doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly when you &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; it), and the product is much harder than the BB (imagine applying your makeup with a wet stress ball). It soaks up liquid foundation like you wouldn&#x27;t believe - I had to use nearly three times as much product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly at all. The regular BB would dry and return to regular size within an hour or two. This one, however, despite squeezing all the water out the way I would with a normal BB, stayed damp and huge for FOUR DAYS. Perfect for a freaking bacteria orgy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling that several of the good reviews on here are customers who&#x27;ve never used the official BB and don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing out on. The amount of money I wasted trying out multiple dupes ended up costing me about 20 bucks. I may as well have just ordered the real thing, which is what I&#x27;m off to do now...</li>
            <li> I had to buy another one it doesn&#x27;t work well&lt;br /&gt;U GET FOR WHAT YOU PAY :( not happy about it</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and blends my foundation in well!</li>
            <li> I still have this it&#x27;s great for foundation my daughter cleans it and it&#x27;s great for a couple of months then it starts to Tare alittle</li>
            <li> Not nearly as soft as the Sephora Beauty Blender and doesn&#x27;t spread the makeup as easily, but at the price it&#x27;s probably worth it.  No sponge is worth $20.  It does its job and is a satisfactory replacement for the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a Beauty Blender dupe, then look elsewhere. Honestly, the texture of this is no different than the triangular or square makeup sponges that you can buy at the drugstore in those big bags, and even then I believe those are better than this. I&#x27;ve tried a few Beauty Blender dupes before, and they all have a smooth foam texture and expand to at least twice their size when wet. This sponge does not expand at all when wet, and has a bumpy foam texture that does not apply makeup evenly or smoothly. Perhaps I received the wrong item or a different item; mine was a much lighter pink color than the picture (think pastel baby pink).</li>
            <li> This sponge is awesome it blends like no other sponge I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li> Nope, it&#x27;s nothing like the actual Beauty Blender AT ALL.  It&#x27;s puny and really light pink, and too stiff to do a good job.  There are better Blender knockoffs out there ladies.</li>
            <li> Cheap and blended my concealer well! I haven&#x27;t tried a real beauty blender but I&#x27;m good with this one!</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product. It blends very well and my makeup stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a lot and it is still holding its shape and holding up very well. its very soft and really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was scared to purchase the product since I saw someone say they didn&#x27;t get the right product but I still took the chance and don&#x27;t regret it at all!</li>
            <li> These are pretty bad, they are about 1/2 the size of the real beauty blender and they suck up all the makeup so you can&#x27;t blend anything unless you use a ton of product!</li>
            <li> The original droplet  is better! This sponge is too hard doesnt really get soft with the water makes it hard to appy your makeup</li>
            <li> I received my pink Beauty Sponge Blender today for my Daughter and she used it right away and said she loves it. She said it does a great job of blending her makeup into her skin without streaks. She said it&#x27;s very soft and easy to clean out and loves the point on it so she can go around her eyes and nose</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SPONGE!!! I honestly think that this little guy is BETTER than the expensive Sephora beauty blender! My makeup goes on soooo smooth, this sponge covers evenly and blends miraculously. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product not expecting something similar as the beauty blender for the price I paid but when I received it, I was completely disappointed. The color of the droplet was a peach color and the name of the droplet claims that it is pink. If I had wanted a peach colored droplet I would have looked elsewhere with that colored sponge. The droplet itself does not expand whatsoever when squeezed several times under water and the droplet is firm and hurts my face when I dab my foundation around. The droplet is less than two inches long and one inch and a half in width. I don&#x27;t know if I received the wrong droplet but I would never recommend anyone to buy this. I would have rather spent the almost two dollars on candy than this.</li>
            <li> Nice easy to use makeup sponge! It is just so simple</li>
            <li> Extremely dense. Not like beauty blender at all. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This sponge is so soft I just recieved it today. The reason I gave 4 stars is bc I recieved was smaller and wasnt pink its a peach color which im okay with it isnt a big deal but the wait is ridiculous but for the price Is very cheap for the qualify of this sponge I do recommend this just dont expect everything to be perfect.</li>
            <li> I received the gourd shaped sponge for free for the purpose of my review. It took a little getting used to because it is a not as soft as the sponges I normally use. The coverage is great though and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free because of code that was posted on a freebie site that I follow. It arrived extremely fast and works great!</li>
            <li> This is a slightly different version of the teardrop shaped beauty blender that has been uber-popular in recent years with beauty mavens everywhere. I actually kind of like the pear-shaped Makeup Blender better, it&#x27;s easier to grip and hold, but you can choose whichever you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are amazing for applying liquid foundation with no streaks or edges. The pointed side is perfect for hard-to-reach areas around eyes and nose. It really gives you nice coverage of all those tiny creases. The larger round side is great for the wider planes of the face and neck. The key, as always, is to blend blend blend, but you don&#x27;t need to work nearly as hard with this brush to help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice for applying a perfect powder finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is easy to clean with just running water and a few drops of your facial cleanser or hand soap. It dries quickly and is long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the current sale price they&#x27;re offering them, this is an amazing deal, especially compare to some higher end brands that offer similar items. I would definitely stock up on them while you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> just sponge for make up remover</li>
            <li> This is in no way comparable to a real Beauty Blender. It was rubbery and didn&#x27;t even expand in water. It soaked up my foundation and blush. It was shaped differently than the pictures submitted by reviewers. I think they&#x27;re just sending out crummy ones now that they already have the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Ive been wanting to buy the beauty blender but the price makes me think twice &amp; so far i really like this sponge! I can no longer apply foundation with a brush or my fingers this sponge makes it faster &amp; easit. love it!</li>
            <li> product works great as expected very happy thank you</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting this to be like a Beauty Blender, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a beauty blender for several months now because I&#x27;d recently been introduced to the beauty channels on YouTube.  Although I&#x27;m probably sure most of the functionality of the beauty blender really depends on the hand of the user itself. I feel like this particular &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; is possibly a cheaper version of the real one. The real one, what I mean by saying that, are the ones that are used by the beauty gurus. Theirs seem to be more flexible&lt;br /&gt;(squishy??? Lol) and longer or narrow may be a better word for it. Reason being is whenever I tried using it, it was difficult getting it into the tiny crevices like around my nose, etc. because it was to firm.  However, blending out my concealer it worked just fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I liked this sponge the first couple times I used it, however after about four times it started falling apart!</li>
            <li> I love this better than the regular applicator. It is great tool for contouring my face. I have used it using my concealer, face blush and bronzer. It is really good for my everyday makeup regimen</li>
            <li> If I could rate this product got 0 stars then I honestly would. This was absolutely NOT what I ordered. I didn&#x27;t order four of these and they weren&#x27;t even soft. I technically bought this product because of the reviews but I got a bad vibe from it. Waste of money also cause it&#x27;s really small (is it even suppose to be that small) and it feels like a rubbery and hard spongy material. Smells like burnt rubber and medicine also. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Mine was peach not pink. I think it&#x27;s smaller than the beauty blender</li>
            <li> So easy to use and works great, glad I got this product to test...</li>
            <li> It works fine however it has an odd odor. I have washed it several times even before its first use. I used brand new make up and the smell was still there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I specifically ordered 4 of the hot pink because I was putting together a colorful gift basket.  I was disappointed to receive 4 of the peach ones.  I paid extra to get the 4 pink, rather then choosing the option to just get the set of 4 random colors.  The application is ok, but its a little small.  I wish I would have gotten what I ordered though.</li>
            <li> The Sponge applied my foundation perfectly and is the perfect product for makeup use.  It is soft, lightweight and cleans up easily.  Shipping was very fast.  Thank you! Great seller!</li>
            <li> Smoothly applies any type of makeup. Gentle on the skin and does not irritate the skin at all. Washing is a breeze and the sponge retains its shape nicely even after washing. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a makeup sponge to apply their makeup smoothly. I did receive this product at a reduced price for review.</li>
            <li> Love this! So easy to apply make up with &amp; then I can just toss it in the washer &amp; it&#x27;s ready for it&#x27;s next use!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it was hard as a rock. Even when damp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller then the real blender but it&#x27;s awesome. Blends my foundation and concealer beautifully.  It&#x27;s great for creams too and pop color blushes/bronzers.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges for applying my makeup!!! Makes it apply evenly, and my skin looks great!!!</li>
            <li> this is far from authentic beauty blender, not that great</li>
            <li> Way to stiff and small</li>
            <li> These are working out really well. I can dampen them and the sponge seems to blend really well. The sponge does NOT smell. There is no strong smell at all. I got 4 of them and they were very nice. I just wish they had arrived quicker. It did take a long time for them to get to me.</li>
            <li> Works great!!!!! Doesn&#x27;t have a strong  latex smell like the others do! I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The beauty sponge came very early and was very soft on the skin. It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I expected though.</li>
            <li> If you watch Kandee Johnson&#x27;s video about the Beauty Blender, you&#x27;ll see the original version inflates twice as big when it&#x27;s submerged in water.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t inflate at all, and soaks up your foundation.  I wish it was a little closer to a BB since spending $15/every 3 months, for a makeup sponge is against my religion.</li>
            <li> Picks up a lot of product if you don&#x27;t wet it first</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all seen those girls, the ones whose face appears to be about two shades darker than their necks and the rest of their bodies. We&#x27;ve also seen the girls who don&#x27;t blend their blush in really well (this used to me). Whether we have seen somebody else make these makeup mistakes or we have committed them ourselves, there is one thing for certain: it is important to blend. While I have makeup brushes that are good as applying my makeup individually, I haven&#x27;t quite been able to find one that blends them in well enough that it doesn&#x27;t look like I have makeup just caked on or look like I have makeup just sitting on top of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for blender sponges for a while now but have not been able to justify spending $15+ in order to get one. Sorry, I may be a cheap skate but I can&#x27;t be the only one that thinks that price is a little outrageous for a sponge. When I saw that Salonsupplystore.com had their Latex Free Makeup Blender Foundation Sponge on sale for $1.98, I knew that I just had to try it. Besides, I figured that with the price, if I fell in love, I would feel much better spending the $15 to stock up and get 7 sponges rather than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As previously said, I have makeup brushes that allow me to apply most of my makeup but I have noticed that no matter how fine my brushes are, I still get streaks in my foundation. I never saw this as a problem because I would go over it again with the brush to even out the streaks and blend the foundation in more before applying my powdered foundation on over top. Since I have started using this sponge, I have been able to completely eliminate a step. When I use the sponge to apply my liquid foundation on, I am left behind with absolutely no streaks so I don&#x27;t have to retrace my steps to get rid of the streak lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being relatively new to the whole makeup thing, I haven&#x27;t used this sponge for anything else other than foundation and to help blend blush in when I wear it. I just recently started using blush and the first time I tried using it, I felt like I looked like a drag queen! Not good. The color was too rich and since it wasn&#x27;t blended in with the rest of my skin, it really stood out and I hated the way it looked. I decided to try my blending sponge to fix this problem and it worked wonders. It blended the blush in enough that it looked natural on my skin while still giving my cheekbones the definition I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is cute and pink in color so it really stands out amongst all of my other makeup tools. I love that it is tear shaped so the pointed end it great for getting all those hard to reach areas (under the eyes, nose, by the ears, etc.). The sponge is soft and gentle on the skin but firm enough to retain its shape. Clean up is also really easy, I simply rinse mine off with water, squeeze out the excess water, and let it air dry the rest of the way. I never wring my sponges because I don&#x27;t want to tear any of the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very happy with this sponge. It is latex free so it would be perfect for anyone who has a latex allergy. I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything bad about this sponge which is surprising since I can usually point out at least one thing I dislike about most beauty products I own. I would definitely recommend this blender sponge, it is perfect, especially if you are on a budget like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.cently started using blush and the first time I tried using it, I felt like I looked like a drag queen!

            <li> i&#x27;ve been wanting one of these for a while. it makes for a mess free make up application. not easy to clean though.</li>
            <li> I have used a Beauty Blender for years and LOVE the flawless look you get, but not the not-so-flawless price. If you haven&#x27;t used Makeup Blender Sponges before, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing. You need less than half of the foundation for coverage so you look cleaner and lighter and your makeup stays fresh longer. I&#x27;ve tried numerous dupes and unfortunately they&#x27;re usually so hard, so I was in shock at how this feels and applies so exactly like those overpriced (but unfortunately super effective) big name sponges. These clean easily and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use out of mine, it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart or started to harden. It&#x27;s a good idea to replace these every 3 months no matter how often you clean them, and at this price no bloodletting is involved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate this as &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34;. I received this product necessary to facilitate my honest review. No other forms of payment were or will be received.</li>
            <li> my daughter really likes using this</li>
            <li> Blends perfectly with my foundation. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, should have read the description.  Just added to save the postage.  Might be able to use for painting or art projects</li>
            <li> Is cheap but it also looks and feels and smells really cheap</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge blender. It is easy to use and and helps apply foundation easily. The shape of it makes it easy to hold and the design makes it easy to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this teardrop for her make up collection, reasonable price and fast delivery. No problems or bad reviews with this product</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be the latex free droplet and dupe for a beauty blender. This thing is stiff and doesn&#x27;t absorb water hardly at all. A beauty blender is suppose to absorb the water and get larger. This is basically a regular make up sponge in the shape of a droplet. Highly disappointed! All of these reviews are sponsored and clearly not about this same product.</li>
            <li> Love the way it blends my make up 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Received the product before the estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;2. Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t expand when wet. At all.&lt;br /&gt;2. Soaks my foundation up, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. Does not spread foundation evenly on to the face.&lt;br /&gt;4. A lot tougher material than others that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even for the inexpensive price tag, I&#x27;d say that this product isn&#x27;t worth it. I tried for about a week before going back to my plain old Covergirl sponges. I had high hopes for this based on the reviews, however, it just didn&#x27;t deliver in quality for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures show the sponge dry (picture 1) and wet (picture 2). There is no difference in size at all.</li>
            <li> Love it! Bought one and my mom wanted one as well! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free, in feel like it soaks up more of my foundation than what goes on my face. I endup applying more than I did before using this.</li>
            <li> Had this sponge before it get the job done best beauty blend I use so far</li>
            <li> I had always wanted to try out a blending sponge after hearing all the hype about how big of a difference in can make in the smoothness of your foundation. I am more of a bargain shopper and did not want to spend the amount for an actual name brand Beauty Blender so I sought out this sponge instead and I have to say that I am very happy with it and I definitely notice a difference in my foundation application than there was before without using it. I don&#x27;t have that cakey look or extra foundation stuck in my creases. Absolutely would suggest buying this if your looking for a more inexpensive alternative to the Beauty Blender with the same results.</li>
            <li> Arrived a week sooner than expected. It did have a small smell but nothing that lasted past one wash. I&#x27;ve never used the all magical beauty blender so I can&#x27;t compare them but this is a good sponge and great considering it was 2 bucks.</li>
            <li> Very bad. So hard. No way you can apply make up w it. Nothing like a beauty blender. Its in the trash now</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive it, some sort of car lights came in the package instead but the package was label beauty sponge</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Pink Droplet Beauty Sponge. It&#x27;s so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave any unwanted streaks on my face. I love that it&#x27;s latex free as well since I do sometimes have problems with latex. The color is really pretty and vibrant! I think everyone who uses makeup should have one of these so I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Loved this free sample soft and easy to hold to put on makeup, I would recommend the Pink Beauty Sponge to anyone who want smooth flawless makeup on.</li>
            <li> The pink droplet that I received was actually different then the photo provided but still does the same thing.  I wish that they came with instructions or individually wrapped so that I could give them as a gift with instructions on how to use them.  I bought three of these, one for me, my mom and sister and since I have previously used these from different brands, I had to teach them to how to use the sponge.  It did not irritate my skin, it applies liquid foundation on extremely well.  Overall even though I got a sponge different then pictured, they work well and do give an airbrushed looking application.</li>
            <li> its ok for the price, it blends good but not as good as the more expensive ones</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the real beauty sponge - no softness, no absorbency - it stays hard and doesn&#x27;t facilitate the application of makeup as well as the real thing.</li>
            <li> Works well, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Soaks up the product (yes it was damp)</li>
            <li> Love this little gadget and I use it daily! I have since purchased more for myself and my daughter. Excellent for applying make-up, all is as expected!</li>
            <li> Small size works great for blending and contouring, you can use wet or dry, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Bought for sister,she loves it!</li>
            <li> made applying makeup quite easy</li>
            <li> This Sponge is Amazing!!! I bought a small teardrop shaped one and it was horrible it was too hard and after like a month it started breaking and flaking off with only 2 uses. But this one is Great!!! Totally love it and definitely repurchasing!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Makeup went on smoother than I&#x27;d thought. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Tad bit smaller than expected and it was orange not pink.</li>
            <li> soaks up all my foundation and it&#x27;s hard!</li>
            <li> Its not  the same thing, It sucks up my makeup alot and practically looks like I didn&#x27;t put any foundation on, in the bad way.</li>
            <li> Great product and would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t blend easily. i read the reviews and i was expecting more. so it was a waste of about $2. its very stiff and hard. Also soaks up A LOT of product</li>
            <li> No really flexible and to small</li>
            <li> Works great!! It&#x27;s very soft and it applies my foundation on so smooth</li>
