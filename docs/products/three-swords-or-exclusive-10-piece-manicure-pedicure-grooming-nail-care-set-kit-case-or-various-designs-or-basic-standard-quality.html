            <li>The sissors and nail clippers are very sharp and work extremely well so far, the case is good thought would have prefered a leather case.</li>

            <li> I bought several high quality manicure/pedicure sets from this German producer as a christmas gifts for my customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate this high German/Solingen quality at reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, excellent quality and great value for money. Seller and goods are recommendable!</li>
            <li> It could of been better. It come with a shoe horn, who uses a shoe horn. I had previously purchased something similar that had a metal toothbrush Which what I was hoping this to have but it&#x27;s a plastic brush. I won&#x27;t purchase it again</li>
            <li> For the price it makes sense. Box was a little beat up when it arrived and as soon as I opened it the tweezers fell out. Overall the quality is reasonable I suppose, the nail clippers do not clip as smoothly which is where the nail filer comes into play. Its a nice case. If anything, replace the nail clippers or any other important item.</li>
            <li> everything seems to be well made and durable. The only real questions is why is the shoe horn included? but I will be ready to use it whenever that time comes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the quality of the product. I&#x27;ve only used the toe nail clipper a few times and the part that attaches the lever to the body has deformed. That&#x27;s not what I expected from a reputable manufacturer. Remains to be seen whether customer support picks up the slack by replying to this review.</li>
            <li> Giving to my dad as a gift for Christmas this year. Has everything he needs and is very compact and clean.</li>
            <li> Purchased for travel and have used it several times. Very happy with the set. The sissors and nail clippers are very sharp and work extremely well so far, the case is good thought would have prefered a leather case. All in all a great buy.</li>
            <li> This set of man-tools is just what I needed. I could never find clippers when I needed them, and MANY other sets didn&#x27;t have the nose-hair scissors (circular-tip to reduce risk of cutting the inside of the nostril). Now everything has its place and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It works well as a case to take traveling and what not, however the nail clippers broke on their first use. Replaced with Revlon clippers, and the set has done well otherwise.  The zipper is a little shady, but it has yet to break over the past year.</li>
            <li> Was extremely well received as part of a high school graduation gift.</li>
            <li> I purchased 6 of these sets for gifts. They are so nice, and quality is awesome. I am now buying 2 more. They are packaged in a nice box, and the clippers cut very well. Great for holiday gifts, and personal treat.</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE  REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> Nice little kit with plenty of items, but several I&#x27;ll never use (blackhead remover, Hoofstick?, shoe horn).  The case is attractive, convenient and good for travel.  Nail clippers are good quality, not great, but better than you will get off the shelf at your local drugstore.  Comb and toothbrush would be for emergency use only, but are nice to have.  This would be a great present for a young adult going off to college or the military.</li>
            <li> Gotta love Germans, they really know their steel haha, this set is awsome!!!! I will order more for the holiday gifts for sure.</li>
            <li> nail cutters broke after three uses, lots of non working tools</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my grandchild moving from home.  So far no feed back as to like or love.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of tools for my needs.  Tools are sharp and function well</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, zipper on case broke the first time it was used.</li>
            <li> This kit is small, it fits nicely into a travel bag or overnight kit. But best of all the Sissors and other tools are very sharp and work Great even after a good bit of use!</li>
            <li> The clippers have sharp edges so they are painful to use. The smaller clipper is very difficult to use and extremely unergonomic.</li>
