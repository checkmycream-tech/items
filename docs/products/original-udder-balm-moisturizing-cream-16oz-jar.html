            <li> Great for my dry legs and feet.</li>
            <li> In the cold dry climate of Colorado winters it works great!  I had painful split fingers every time it turned cold.  I have not had any problems since I started using Udder Balm!  You cannot believe how many creams and lotions I have tried in the past with no or marginal relief.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> We purchased this to use on a daily basis and it works very well.  When we travel we use the 3 oz tube version. We use it at night before we go to bed.  It doesn&#x27;t get all over the sheets while in bed and doesn&#x27;t stain.  Sometimes in the morning we put on after our shower.  It is one of the best products we have found for rough calloused feet.</li>
            <li> it has helped my husbends itch on his legsvery  much</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail ,and tried it out .I put  on my feet because ,I really have  dry feet because of my type two diabetes .And it sure feels better than the Gold Bond that I was using.And the Aveeno.This stuff is all natural ,no chemicals .And that&amp;#34;s is good for your liver,less toxins to take in your blood stream .Any thing ,you put on your skin goes ,right into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> I use this on my callused heels. It is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I only use skin cream during the winter and this does the job, plus it has a short lived mild smell.</li>
            <li> The best cream/moisturizer for your hand and face... Period!</li>
            <li> This is the best cream ever.use it from face to feet, soothes the skin.Helps heal dry skin, sores an any itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I smelled the lemony fragrance, boy was I wrong!  The lemony fragrance disappears within minutes and after using this product several times, I now like the smell it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product totally non greasy and keeps the skin moist for many hours.  Plus, you get a lot of product for the price that will last a long time.  What a great find!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  We use it on our Labs elbows and pads to keep them soft and leathery.  It works great on our hands and feet also.  This is the same balm we use to buy under the name Dionne.</li>
            <li> Using this product for 16 years, never disappointed, not greasy and works on dry skin immediately</li>
            <li> Have used original udder balm for years. The product I had prior was in Orange and black tub from Doinne. Product seems similar in feel and texture when applied but so far after does not seem to moisturize skin as good as old product.  But still better than anything else on market. Supplier was quick with delivery as promised. Will keep using product, I am a diabetic and physician stated on last visit that feet were in fantastic condition and udder balm is only thing I use.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these jars of cream. They were both open and smashed all over the box. None was usuable. I can not get a refund because I am not returning the product.  The Post Office admitted it was a mess but since it wasn&#x27;t insured, I just had a mess. I will not order again.</li>
            <li> This is working wonderful. I use it on my feet and it sure has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;A lot less in cost than others I have used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for many years, can&#x27;t live without it. I have skin problems that keep my skin very dry and itchy. Only Udder Balm helps the scaley skin. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for harsh weather.</li>
            <li> Very good, not greasy and definitely moisturizing.  I have recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best lotion in the world.  Made in America and gives you supple hands in 1-2 days!!</li>
