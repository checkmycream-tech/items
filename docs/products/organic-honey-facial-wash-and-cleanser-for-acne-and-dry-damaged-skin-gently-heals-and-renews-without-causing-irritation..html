            <li>Wish I would have found this product first.</li>

            <li>once it finishes I am certainly going to purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency of the product</li>
            <li>I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts and this cleanser was really helpful in clearing my breakouts (it is a mild-antiseptic) and reducing the oiliness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I just expected more smell...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal consumer to the major acne skin care line on the market.</li>
            <li>I love this product -  love how my face feels after cleansing - need to use only a small amount</li>
            <li>Very nice cleanser, a little goes a long way and it foams very well which is not always the case with natural products!</li>

            <li>I highly recommend the Honey Facial Cleanser to everyone.</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount to lather &amp; goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>After I wash my face with this cleanser, my face feels really fresh and firm.</li>

            <li> I will be sticking with this product for a long time!!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> Either my skin was still oily or it was dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several cleansers in the past</li>
            <li> I noticed after a few days of using it, I patted my face dry after showering, then felt my face.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick and creamy and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry and tight like regular soap does.</li>
            <li> It gets the excessive oil off my face and doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin like other products have.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but just a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> My skin is softer &amp; my pores are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it my face is softer and less prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> coming from a black man in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worst is that it made my skin so horribly dry that it was hard to resist itching</li>
            <li> and I was at at work unable to concentrate on a deadline I had to meet.</li>
            <li> It burns and itches too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m utterly disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> used it, found very good for my face.</li>
            <li> I never tried this before, but glad I did. Leaves your skin feeling great and clean. Nice smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> great product, I love it</li>
            <li> It probably could be a good product. Just note, that the honey is the only organic ingredient. My biggest problem was the smell. The texture was nice and silky, but the smell made me so nauseous, I couldn&#x27;t stand it. I am returning this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used! And believe me Ive tried them all. I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and I still have breakouts and have combination skin this cleanser feels great on my face. It feels clean not tight or dry I also have been using the stem cell serum Apple 3000 after and the vitamin C serum ...what a wonderful combination! I haven&#x27;t tried anything else like it on the market! 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Honey Facial Cleanser to everyone. I am considered elderly {over 70} with wrinkles &amp; enlarged pores. I am now using this cleanser daily in my morning shower. My skin is softer &amp; my pores are less noticeable. It only takes a small amount to lather &amp; goes on smoothly. Even if I don&#x27;t put on the Swiss Apple Stem Cell 3000 right after my shower, my skin does not feel dry or tight as it has in the past using other brands of cleanser. This is now part of my skin care routine&amp; will be from now on. Wish I had discovered it years ago. My daughter-in-law recommend it to me &amp; I&#x27;m so glad she did.</li>
            <li> Because my skin is sensitive to harsh chemicals I wanted to give this cleanser a try. Since I&#x27;ve been using it my face is softer and less prone to dryness. I really like the consistency of the product, it&#x27;s thick and creamy and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry and tight like regular soap does. The bottle is small but just a little bit goes a long way so I am definitely happy about that. Everyone in my family can use this without worry since it&#x27;s very gentle, being organic is a plus to me too. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very nice cleanser, a little goes a long way and it foams very well which is not always the case with natural products! It does make my skin feel soft and cleansed. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal consumer to the major acne skin care line on the market. Not anymore!!! I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products, prescription and over the counter. From the dermatologist office to ordering online. Wish I would have found this product first. Not only is it affordable, but it&#x27;s a good size bottle and a little goes a long way. It gets the excessive oil off my face and doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin like other products have. I noticed after a few days of using it, I patted my face dry after showering, then felt my face. It was so soft. I&#x27;ve never had that before. Either my skin was still oily or it was dry and tight. I will be sticking with this product for a long time!!!</li>
            <li> This product not working after 3 day used my skin got red and sore</li>
            <li> Very gentle cleaner, I have very sensitive skin and it works great on my face</li>
            <li> Amazing  product..it seems to minimize pores, clears and prevent  break outs...its a must have for flawless skin...coming from a black man in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product. Does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several cleansers in the past and I think I&#x27;ve finally found the one that suits my skin the best. I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts and this cleanser was really helpful in clearing my breakouts (it is a mild-antiseptic) and reducing the oiliness of my skin. After I wash my face with this cleanser, my face feels really fresh and firm. It removes all of my makeup and my skin looks brighter (my overall complexion is better)! I&#x27;ve had this cleanser for a month and there is still a lot left, once it finishes I am certainly going to purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> I have come to realize that you only need one drop of this cleanser to do your face and neck.  This product has made a huge difference for me.  At 45, I still had very oily skin, with occasional breakouts.  Now my skin feels soft and normal.  I also am using the Swiss Apple Stem Cell 3000 by Swiss Botany.  I think this is good combination for me.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very gentle on your skin but thoroughly cleans. It doesn&#x27;t do a great job at removing mascara and eyeliner, but otherwise does a good job at removing makeup.</li>
            <li> I love swiss botany products, I regularly use their face pack and 2 other skin creams so I thought why not try the face wash. I ignored an earlier review from another user about it causing redness of skin. But it happened to me too, just after 2 uses! ! Whatever good their other products made to my skin in 2 months, this one took away in 1 day!! What&#x27;s worst is that it made my skin so horribly dry that it was hard to resist itching and I was at at work unable to concentrate on a deadline I had to meet. I&#x27;m utterly disappointed with this product. I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers before and the damage this one did in 2 washes... I don&#x27;t have words to describe how horrible my skin feels now. It burns and itches too bad. Sigh!</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t buy again...I like a bit of smell in my face wash, but it cleans nicely without over drying and would be perfect for people with sensitivity to smell..I just expected more smell...it&#x27;s not a bad product...just not what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this product -  love how my face feels after cleansing - need to use only a small amount but your face feels very clean as well as being nourished</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells nice, it&#x27;s gentle but still gets off make up! Plus it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Total keeper.</li>
