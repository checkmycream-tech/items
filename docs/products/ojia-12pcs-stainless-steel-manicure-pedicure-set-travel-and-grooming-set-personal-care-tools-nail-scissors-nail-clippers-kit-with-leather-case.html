            <li>So glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how to use many of the pieces.</li>
            <li>Love the fancy leather case that it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased OJIA...</li>
            <li>Yeah, It&#x27;s kinda okay for the price...</li>
            <li>The tools are top quality and the case is well made.  </li>
            <li>I really love this set, good sturdy and high in quality.  </li>
            <li>The tools are good, but the leather is peeling really fast.</li>
            <li>It was advertised as &amp;#34;brown genuine leather case&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>tools inside are always great, sturdy, and looks like it will last for  years !</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>There are nice pictures of it, showing natural leather in brownish color.</li>
            <li>I would like to return it for a full refund - including shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product with a full range of manicure and pedicure tools.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a bit more with the main tools...that is, the clippers.  </li>
            <li>My cuticles are amazing, finally.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The pouch itself is worth the price</li>
            <li>the right amount of tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The many pieces are labelled - in Chinese!</li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I suggested that you buy a nail clipper at the gas station instead which appeared to be fine cutlery as opposed to this totally unusable product.</li>
            <li>This is real leather and tools are stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Everything in the pouch is sturdy and ready for use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer if the manufacturer would just ship it straight to the landfill instead of making me the middleman.</li>
            <li>The quality of this item seems to be very sturdy so much so that he has taken one of the clippers out of the set and thrown it in his work bag.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are cheap and flimsy but the leather holder is good and the other tools besides the cutting tools seem pretty good; so hence, I&#x27;m giving this item an average rating of three starts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the leather case is very masculine and seems to be of a high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gave it as a gift but the case seemed to be of a quality product and the clippers looked very professional like.</li>
            <li>It came in such a pretty box that I didn&#x27;t even have to wrap it.  </li>
            <li>Good for your use, not good for a present.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product.</li>
            <li>my husband was always complaining that he couldn&#x27;t find my nail trimming items when he needed them, so I wanted to get him a quality, masculine set of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; manicure scissors do not cut properly; toenail cutters too small to be effective; tweezers do not align properly.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the scissors are not sharp and don&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li>Also, they have little smiley faces on the tools, though maybe not &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; in that concern, it&#x27;s still fun to look at.</li>
            <li>Metal equipment extremely cheap and shoddy: Clippers do not close edge-to-edge</li>
            <li>What I received is cheap PU leather plain brown / grey piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t actual stainless steel and the scissors aren&#x27;t sharp.</li>
            <li>Very poor quality pieces have broken already nice case cheap instruments, cannot recommend this to anyone.</li>

            <li> Feel free to see my other comments; I doubt I ever wrote another negative review despite buying almost all my merchandise through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that a flap is needed above the tools on the left as they tend to slip out if tilted even slightly.  </li>
            <li> edges of clippers aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting the case to be the fanciest part, but this is actually a heavy duty, solid manicure kit.  </li>
            <li> Well not really.</li>
            <li> Cutting edges are rough and don&#x27;t cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> As one other reviewer pointed out, not one metal item performed properly - the scissor blades didn&#x27;t meet (in part the rivet was loose), the cuticle slide ripped your cuticles out instead of slicing through them, the clippers were so dull or out of an alignment, I doubt they could cut a wet noodle.  </li>
            <li> you come up with other items that are comparable, I would like to know about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that the kit does all that I hoped it would at a price I couldn&#x27;t argue with.</li>
            <li> The tools are very roughly made.</li>
            <li> So there it floats around all day and so far no damage or broken parts.  </li>
            <li> Nice pouch, however the tools are terrible.</li>
            <li> 1 star only because they would not submit without a star 0 stars not a good buy!</li>
            <li> Its a little dull.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the process, I went with another product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what I will do with it.</li>
            <li> you gave this to me for free, I would be outraged.</li>
            <li> The nail file is dull.</li>
            <li> Please ignore negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Dishonest ,change tools</li>
            <li> 2 months late beware don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Cutting edges on one of the clippers are not aligned properly so are unusable.</li>
            <li> I told Amazon to throw it out if I returned it too late.</li>
            <li> FAKE - BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> The handles on the scissors are not rounded, small, and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> All of the cutting edges are dull, the scissors won&#x27;t cut butter, and if that case is leather I would like to know what type of animal it came from.</li>
            <li> Lousy product, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Face leather and very poor tools</li>
            <li> The case isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the quality of this set.</li>
            <li> This is horrible product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> real nice very pleased</li>
            <li> Please ignore negative reviews. This is real leather and tools are stainless steel. This is perfect for anyone that wants a manicure set for home or travel. Worth every penny. And btw it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> FAKE - BE CAREFUL! This is horrible product. It was advertised as &amp;#34;brown genuine leather case&amp;#34;. There are nice pictures of it, showing natural leather in brownish color. What I received is cheap PU leather plain brown / grey piece of garbage. I&#x27;ve returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my man for Christmas, he loves it, just one thing I didn&#x27;t like, is that I didn&#x27;t get the package before Christmas, it came 1 week after.</li>
            <li> Lousy product, buyer beware. There was not one quality item in the kit. All of the cutting edges are dull, the scissors won&#x27;t cut butter, and if that case is leather I would like to know what type of animal it came from. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product. If I could give this a zero rating I would.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the process, I went with another product.</li>
            <li> Dishonest ,change tools</li>
            <li> This set had all the tools you need to take good care of your feet. I did not like the leather carrying case. To feminine. Gave it to my wife.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly; good packaging.  Nice leather case.  Metal equipment extremely cheap and shoddy: Clippers do not close edge-to-edge; manicure scissors do not cut properly; toenail cutters too small to be effective; tweezers do not align properly.  Nothing in the package feels good in the hand.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s Christmas present.  It came in such a pretty box that I didn&#x27;t even have to wrap it.  The leather case is excellent quality, but the manicure tools are beyond excellent.  I was expecting the case to be the fanciest part, but this is actually a heavy duty, solid manicure kit.  He was very impressed.  So glad I bought it.  Also, they have little smiley faces on the tools, though maybe not &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; in that concern, it&#x27;s still fun to look at.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the quality of this set. The handles on the scissors are not rounded, small, and uncomfortable to use. In addition, the scissors are not sharp and don&#x27;t cut. The nail file is dull. The tweezers didn&#x27;t work. The many pieces are labelled - in Chinese! There are no instructions and I don&#x27;t know how to use many of the pieces. The metal lacks the smoothness and polishing of the manicure implements you can buy in the drugstore. It looks good, but is junk. I would like to return it for a full refund - including shipping.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality pieces have broken already nice case cheap instruments, cannot recommend this to anyone. Would never re purchase</li>
            <li> - the leather is good&lt;br /&gt;- it looks good and packs well&lt;br /&gt;- the quality of most of the tools is not that great. They aren&#x27;t actual stainless steel and the scissors aren&#x27;t sharp.</li>
            <li> I did a search for men&#x27;s grooming products. The case appears to be geared towards women so I&#x27;m not sure what I will do with it. The utensils appear to be of a nice quality. My granddaughter and I both laughed when we saw the case - maybe I will still give it to my son - his eyesight is not that great.</li>
            <li> my husband was always complaining that he couldn&#x27;t find my nail trimming items when he needed them, so I wanted to get him a quality, masculine set of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the leather case is very masculine and seems to be of a high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools inside are always great, sturdy, and looks like it will last for  years !</li>
            <li> Great gift item, comes in a gift box and packaging is good.</li>
            <li> Everything in the pouch is sturdy and ready for use. Love the fancy leather case that it&#x27;s in. Nice job</li>
            <li> 1 star only because they would not submit without a star 0 stars not a good buy! Product was 2 months late beware don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> This is a quality product with a full range of manicure and pedicure tools.  It arrived promptly and without any problems.  I do my own manis and pedis, and this kit is all I need.  Nice leather case too.  I would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t visit a nail parlor reguarly.</li>
            <li> The tools are good, but the leather is peeling really fast. Good for your use, not good for a present.</li>
            <li> Great instruments that worked better than all others I have tried. My cuticles are amazing, finally. I am glad I purchased OJIA...</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bit more with the main tools...that is, the clippers.  The clippers are cheap and flimsy but the leather holder is good and the other tools besides the cutting tools seem pretty good; so hence, I&#x27;m giving this item an average rating of three starts.</li>
            <li> Nice pouch, however the tools are terrible. I&#x27;ve modified a couple of them so they can be used. The pouch itself is worth the price</li>
            <li> Yeah, It&#x27;s kinda okay for the price... Well not really. The tools are very roughly made. Cutting edges are rough and don&#x27;t cut cleanly. Cutting edges on one of the clippers are not aligned properly so are unusable. This company obviously has no quality control. Unfortunately it seems like most of these lower priced kits seem to be made by the same manufacturer. The case isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I really love this set, good sturdy and high in quality.  I highly recommend this product.  I almost forgot to mention the case.... Very handsome</li>
            <li> I guess they removed my review because I returned the item.  I told Amazon to throw it out if I returned it too late. As one other reviewer pointed out, not one metal item performed properly - the scissor blades didn&#x27;t meet (in part the rivet was loose), the cuticle slide ripped your cuticles out instead of slicing through them, the clippers were so dull or out of an alignment, I doubt they could cut a wet noodle.  I suggested that you buy a nail clipper at the gas station instead which appeared to be fine cutlery as opposed to this totally unusable product.

Feel free to see my other comments; I doubt I ever wrote another negative review despite buying almost all my merchandise through Amazon. The one star is for the case.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift but the case seemed to be of a quality product and the clippers looked very professional like.</li>
            <li> looks great. not functional. edges of clippers aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut.  I&#x27;d prefer if the manufacturer would just ship it straight to the landfill instead of making me the middleman.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  My husband loved it.  The quality of this item seems to be very sturdy so much so that he has taken one of the clippers out of the set and thrown it in his work bag.  So there it floats around all day and so far no damage or broken parts.  This is a very nice and good looking set of nail tools and worth the money great value.</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. The leather is perfect and fits my personality and needs, the tools are exactly what I was looking for and the right amount of tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you come up with other items that are comparable, I would like to know about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Cant beat the price.  Ive used every piece in the kit.  They all work great except for the cuticle trimmer.  Its a little dull.</li>
            <li> Face leather and very poor tools</li>
            <li> The tools are top quality and the case is well made.  I have noticed that a flap is needed above the tools on the left as they tend to slip out if tilted even slightly.  If you found this under men&#x27;s nail kits just know that the case looks like a ladies wallet.  Other than that the kit does all that I hoped it would at a price I couldn&#x27;t argue with.</li>
