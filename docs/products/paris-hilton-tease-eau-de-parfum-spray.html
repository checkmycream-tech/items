            <li>My mum even gave compliments on how good it really smelled too.</li>
            <li>fast deliver--smells good.</li>
            <li>Very good.my gf loved it</li>
            <li>Tease is worth the money and a nice size bottle.</li>
            <li>but I always ended up by picking up this one, there was something about that scent I could not forget easily.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s more of a classy and sophisticated scent, perhaps to be worn out to dinner at a nice restaurant..?  </li>
            <li>The smell is sexy and sweet with floral accents and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this perfume</li>
            <li>Smells great, and it lasts longer than i expect, I totally recommend it ...</li>
            <li>My new favorite purfume!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried this parfum and I was extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>its a huge bottle that may last me a good year.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, strong yet soft, the smell does not fade quickly!  </li>
            <li>I was really excited that it arrived that quickly.  </li>
            <li>Not too sweet or fruity</li>
            <li>I am a 1st time perfume user and I happened to spot this at the mall and loved it instantly.</li>
            <li>It has an old fashioned kind of smell, not my preference.</li>
            <li>I got this perfume for Christmas last year, I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>very nice,,I LOVE PARIS HILTON BY PARIS HILTON</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li>This scent is not bad.</li>
            <li>Love it and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is mild, it is sweet and makes me feel fresh all the time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Not the most expensive perfume, but it has very good quality</li>
            <li>A more mature scent in the Paris hilton collection.  </li>
            <li>but fresh</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like any was worth me breaking my budget</li>
            <li>Definitely worth spending your money on.</li>
            <li>i feel that this is for the more mature type of woman because its more of a white floral scent and isn&#x27;t sweet or sugary.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good on my beautiful lady, it drives me crazy!</li>
            <li>it is similar to michael kors, very holllywood, and kim kardashian, however, once the heavey floral \\&quot;gardenia\\&quot; dries down its so delicious on my skin..</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>When I found this one I didn&#x27;t like the idea of it being only 3.4 oz, but when I got it in the mail today I realized this bottle is huge!</li>
            <li>First time I try this one &amp; will buy it again</li>
            <li>i bought this without smelling it first which was risky</li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume at the perfume store.</li>
            <li>Whenever I wear it I feel sexy, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Smells great got lots of compliments last long.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this fragrance!</li>
            <li>Tease was a a cologne that is some what floral but is very pleasing and complimentary.</li>
            <li>Perfume has a captivating smell not loud but very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>In my personal opinion it is similar to Poison but in a much more fresh and clean way.</li>
            <li>its smell is rather sweet and soft</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a really unique smell, strong enough that it lasts all day but light enough to not hurt your nose if you spray an extra squirt or two.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>this and paris hilton are my absolute favorites..</li>
            <li>I really liket he smell</li>
            <li>It was packed very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the size of this bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>Stays on you the whole day.</li>
            <li>and I bought one for her birthday ,she really loves it.</li>
            <li>BUYING FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY</li>
            <li>I would recommend for ages 25 and above because it has that more mature scent but still has a flirty scent to it.</li>
            <li>My co-worker (male &amp; female) tell me they like it &amp; that I smell nice.</li>
            <li>The tuberose stands out more than any of the other notes on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>I really wanted some new perfume.</li>
            <li>Its nothing to go head over heels for but for the price its a decent fragrance.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like the smell smell very old fashion</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to buy this product.</li>
            <li>came as seen in image,once sprayed it lights up the room after a couple minutes has passed it smelled like fruity chewing gum,the scent lasted for some hours very strong but the following day when i smelled the top i wore it was still smelling but not as strong,this could have been because i hardly sprayed it over the entire jacket.</li>
            <li>Not a real fan on Paris Hilton, however I am a huge fan of her perfume now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found Ms. Hilton&#x27;s scents smell lovely on me and are very long wearing (especially Fairy Dust) but my husband likes none of them, so I suppose I&#x27;m at an impasse there.</li>
            <li>YOUR LOOKING FOR A NEW ONE</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very pretty, feminine, sophisticated scent that smells more expensive than it is!!  </li>
            <li>and she is happy to drive me crazy because she likes the smell just as much.</li>
            <li>My 1st and only perfume ;D</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I wanted and there was even extra coupons and mini samples in the box.</li>
            <li>I would love to say that I would recommend this to anyone, however I know everyone is different and perfume may smell good or bad on you depending on how it mix with your natural body chemicals.</li>
            <li>Smells a little cheap to me.</li>
            <li>I received compliments on this fragrance also, however this fragrance has been a little stronger than I am use to, so I spray it on lightly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not to heavy and not to light</li>
            <li>Truly smells like an old lady and is nearly repulsive.  </li>
            <li>Old lady purfume to me</li>
            <li>Just received mine in the mail today, it has an okay smell but not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend purchasing a different scent and/or brand.</li>
            <li>I bought a smaller bottle from the perfume store, so when I saw this larger one (3 times the size I originally had), for half the price, I knew I had to buy.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I expected this to be a real winner.</li>
            <li>Not long lasting.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My mum even gave compliments on how good it really smelled too.</li>
            <li> fast deliver--smells good.</li>
            <li> Very good.my gf loved it</li>
            <li> Tease is worth the money and a nice size bottle.</li>
            <li> but I always ended up by picking up this one, there was something about that scent I could not forget easily.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s more of a classy and sophisticated scent, perhaps to be worn out to dinner at a nice restaurant..?  </li>
            <li> The smell is sexy and sweet with floral accents and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this perfume</li>
            <li> Smells great, and it lasts longer than i expect, I totally recommend it ...</li>
            <li> My new favorite purfume!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried this parfum and I was extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> its a huge bottle that may last me a good year.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, strong yet soft, the smell does not fade quickly!  </li>
            <li> I was really excited that it arrived that quickly.  </li>
            <li> Not too sweet or fruity</li>
            <li> I am a 1st time perfume user and I happened to spot this at the mall and loved it instantly.</li>
            <li> It has an old fashioned kind of smell, not my preference.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for Christmas last year, I LOVED it.</li>
            <li> very nice,,I LOVE PARIS HILTON BY PARIS HILTON</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li> This scent is not bad.</li>
            <li> Love it and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is mild, it is sweet and makes me feel fresh all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Not the most expensive perfume, but it has very good quality</li>
            <li> A more mature scent in the Paris hilton collection.  </li>
            <li> but fresh</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like any was worth me breaking my budget</li>
            <li> Definitely worth spending your money on.</li>
            <li> i feel that this is for the more mature type of woman because its more of a white floral scent and isn&#x27;t sweet or sugary.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good on my beautiful lady, it drives me crazy!</li>
            <li> it is similar to michael kors, very holllywood, and kim kardashian, however, once the heavey floral \\&quot;gardenia\\&quot; dries down its so delicious on my skin..</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> When I found this one I didn&#x27;t like the idea of it being only 3.4 oz, but when I got it in the mail today I realized this bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> First time I try this one &amp; will buy it again</li>
            <li> i bought this without smelling it first which was risky</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume at the perfume store.</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear it I feel sexy, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells great got lots of compliments last long.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Tease was a a cologne that is some what floral but is very pleasing and complimentary.</li>
            <li> Perfume has a captivating smell not loud but very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion it is similar to Poison but in a much more fresh and clean way.</li>
            <li> its smell is rather sweet and soft</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a really unique smell, strong enough that it lasts all day but light enough to not hurt your nose if you spray an extra squirt or two.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> this and paris hilton are my absolute favorites..</li>
            <li> I really liket he smell</li>
            <li> It was packed very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the size of this bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> Stays on you the whole day.</li>
            <li> and I bought one for her birthday ,she really loves it.</li>
            <li> BUYING FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY</li>
            <li> I would recommend for ages 25 and above because it has that more mature scent but still has a flirty scent to it.</li>
            <li> My co-worker (male &amp; female) tell me they like it &amp; that I smell nice.</li>
            <li> The tuberose stands out more than any of the other notes on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> I really wanted some new perfume.</li>
            <li> Its nothing to go head over heels for but for the price its a decent fragrance.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the smell smell very old fashion</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to buy this product.</li>
            <li> came as seen in image,once sprayed it lights up the room after a couple minutes has passed it smelled like fruity chewing gum,the scent lasted for some hours very strong but the following day when i smelled the top i wore it was still smelling but not as strong,this could have been because i hardly sprayed it over the entire jacket.</li>
            <li> Not a real fan on Paris Hilton, however I am a huge fan of her perfume now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found Ms. Hilton&#x27;s scents smell lovely on me and are very long wearing (especially Fairy Dust) but my husband likes none of them, so I suppose I&#x27;m at an impasse there.</li>
            <li> YOUR LOOKING FOR A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very pretty, feminine, sophisticated scent that smells more expensive than it is!!  </li>
            <li> and she is happy to drive me crazy because she likes the smell just as much.</li>
            <li> My 1st and only perfume ;D</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I wanted and there was even extra coupons and mini samples in the box.</li>
            <li> I would love to say that I would recommend this to anyone, however I know everyone is different and perfume may smell good or bad on you depending on how it mix with your natural body chemicals.</li>
            <li> Smells a little cheap to me.</li>
            <li> I received compliments on this fragrance also, however this fragrance has been a little stronger than I am use to, so I spray it on lightly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not to heavy and not to light</li>
            <li> Truly smells like an old lady and is nearly repulsive.  </li>
            <li> Old lady purfume to me</li>
            <li> Just received mine in the mail today, it has an okay smell but not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend purchasing a different scent and/or brand.</li>
            <li> I bought a smaller bottle from the perfume store, so when I saw this larger one (3 times the size I originally had), for half the price, I knew I had to buy.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I expected this to be a real winner.</li>
            <li> Not long lasting.</li>
            <li> but only because I bought the 3.4 oz and since its a fragrance that I won&#x27;t wear often it will last me a really long time.</li>
            <li> my husband (who admittedly has an... unusual sense of smell to say the least proclaims the scent to be akin to \\&quot;air freshener in a bathroom where someone has gone after having a lot of curry\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I went in with a friend with absolutely not intention to buy anything.</li>
            <li> In Venezuela the original perfumes are very expensive, so bring them out is the solution .. 100% recommended</li>
            <li> I was running out of my other one and was trying to preserve every little bit of it, until I found this one.</li>
            <li> My everyday perfume Paris by Paris Hilton stays on the clothes until you wash it with soap.</li>
            <li> To me this scent is a delicate citrusy floral, that lasts and lasts on skin, on the other hand</li>
            <li> it did not disappoint to say the least.</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 star is because I hate spending money on perfume/Cologne.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> you guys sold me a fake spray, this spray doesn&#x27;t last for 5mins, i am very disappointed with guys..</li>
            <li> kina weird</li>
            <li> or we got a bad bottle, but this stuff smells terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this perfume based on reviews and I am so happy I love it. The smell is sexy and sweet with floral accents and lasts all day. It reminds me of Liz Claiborne &amp;#34;Bora Bora&amp;#34; but better and at better price. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome smelling perfume!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it makes her smell real \\&quot;purty\\&quot; :D  I like it.  I&#x27;d buy it again, and I&#x27;m sure she would as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for girl friend or gift for women friends!!</li>
            <li> A more mature scent in the Paris hilton collection.  I feel like it&#x27;s more of a classy and sophisticated scent, perhaps to be worn out to dinner at a nice restaurant..?  i feel that this is for the more mature type of woman because its more of a white floral scent and isn&#x27;t sweet or sugary.  It&#x27;s definately an evening perfume, and 2-3 sprays will go far because it has good sillage and good staying power.  The tuberose stands out more than any of the other notes on my skin.  Overall it&#x27;s a very pretty, feminine, sophisticated scent that smells more expensive than it is!!  If you like white florals, then this is for you!  Would I buy it again?  Probably not, but only because I bought the 3.4 oz and since its a fragrance that I won&#x27;t wear often it will last me a really long time.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this perfume it&#x27;s not to heavy and not to light but it does wear off in about 2 hours</li>
            <li> came as seen in image,once sprayed it lights up the room after a couple minutes has passed it smelled like fruity chewing gum,the scent lasted for some hours very strong but the following day when i smelled the top i wore it was still smelling but not as strong,this could have been because i hardly sprayed it over the entire jacket. My mum even gave compliments on how good it really smelled too.</li>
            <li> First time I try this one &amp; will buy it again</li>
            <li> Product was great, shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD SCENT&lt;br /&gt;VERY FEMININE&lt;br /&gt;WOULD BUY AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;FAIR PRICE FOR A LOVELY FRAGRANCE&lt;br /&gt;IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A NEW ONE TRY THIS ONE</li>
            <li> This perfume I like a lot is my generalemte style I use almost the entire range of paris hilton this is good</li>
            <li> Like the smell. Not too sweet or fruity</li>
            <li> I am a 1st time perfume user and I happened to spot this at the mall and loved it instantly. My 1st and only perfume ;D</li>

            <li> Perfume has a captivating smell not loud but very soft and smooth. Im happy i bought the product. Good quality.</li>

            <li> I love this  perfume and most of the paris hilton fragrances. Smells wonderful, not too overwhelming either.</li>
            <li> fast deliver--smells good.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how it smells so good and its a huge bottle that may last me a good year.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the smell. Not long lasting. My everyday perfume Paris by Paris Hilton stays on the clothes until you wash it with soap. Paris by Paris Hilton perfume cost only $20 dollars compared to this perfume. Somewhat dissapointed with Tease by Paris Hilton. Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Its nothing to go head over heels for but for the price its a decent fragrance. I would recommend for ages 25 and above because it has that more mature scent but still has a flirty scent to it. It lasts for most of the day. Overall it is not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I expected this to be a real winner. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok. Smells a little cheap to me.</li>
            <li> Very nice I would buy again</li>
            <li> I love this perfume smell kind of sweat but fresh I receive many compleiments when I wear it. And the price is very good I love that too.</li>

            <li> i order  because good looking bottal,but i donot like.next time i will not buy.even my wife ot like.so not not not</li>
            <li> I love it! smells delicious, arrived in perfect condition .... i love it! In Venezuela the original perfumes are very expensive, so bring them out is the solution .. 100% recommended</li>
            <li> This scent is not bad. In my opinion it is not noteworthy. If you want an okay scent at a good price, this is it.</li>
            <li> It is very sexy and seductive smelling. I wish I knew about this long time ago.  Super sexy on her!!</li>
            <li> i have known about this since march or april of 2010, and have been waiting for its release in june.. forget about ms. hilton&#x27;s image but the girl can come out with a perfume.. i have every one except siren and the male versions. i have not once smelled one i didnt like.. this and paris hilton are my absolute favorites.. i bought this without smelling it first which was risky but thankfully i wasnt burned.. it is similar to michael kors, very holllywood, and kim kardashian, however, once the heavey floral \\&quot;gardenia\\&quot; dries down its so delicious on my skin.. gardenias, to me, define hollywood. it also brings me back to billie holiday and \\&quot;lady sings the blues\\&quot;. it did not disappoint to say the least.</li>
            <li> I really liket he smell, it is sooo good, in fact I used this up super fast, I really liked the smell and my boyfriend did as well, so every date I wore it until it was gone, plan to order more....good price too!</li>
            <li> Smelled correct; she loved it and was happy....</li>
            <li> Smells so good on my beautiful lady, it drives me crazy! The cost was way, way better than any department store and she is happy to drive me crazy because she likes the smell just as much.</li>
            <li> Very good.my gf loved it</li>
            <li> This was given to me for a birthday gift. Great scent and pretty bottle for a price within my son&#x27;s budget.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume at the perfume store. I went in with a friend with absolutely not intention to buy anything. I smelled lots of perfume that day and although there was many I liked I didn&#x27;t feel like any was worth me breaking my budget...... that was until I smelled this one. I immediately feel in love. Not a real fan on Paris Hilton, however I am a huge fan of her perfume now. I bought a smaller bottle from the perfume store, so when I saw this larger one (3 times the size I originally had), for half the price, I knew I had to buy. I was running out of my other one and was trying to preserve every little bit of it, until I found this one. I would love to say that I would recommend this to anyone, however I know everyone is different and perfume may smell good or bad on you depending on how it mix with your natural body chemicals.</li>
            <li> Just received mine in the mail today, it has an okay smell but not exactly what I expected. It has an old fashioned kind of smell, not my preference.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for Christmas last year, I LOVED it. I had gotten a 1 oz bottle when it ran out after a month I knew I had to get more. When I found this one I didn&#x27;t like the idea of it being only 3.4 oz, but when I got it in the mail today I realized this bottle is huge! Definitely worth spending your money on. And it&#x27;s a really unique smell, strong enough that it lasts all day but light enough to not hurt your nose if you spray an extra squirt or two.</li>
            <li> I love this for work and anytime I want something that smells good but not over baring.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried this parfum and I was extremely satisfied.  It exceeded my expectations.  It was packed very well.  Though it said I would receive it in a week, it arrived in two days.  I was really excited that it arrived that quickly.  I would definitely recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> great value nice smell</li>
            <li> Have repurchased twice, very good longevity 5/5, projection 5/5 and compliment flooding in from every direction. A MUST BUY!!!!</li>

            <li> Outstanding deal. The wice loved it I love the smell, and the purple bottle was icing on the cake. The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 star is because I hate spending money on perfume/Cologne.</li>

            <li> I smelled this perfume when I was looking at some perfumes in a store and I liked it. I tried many more on my skin but I always ended up by picking up this one, there was something about that scent I could not forget easily. In my personal opinion it is similar to Poison but in a much more fresh and clean way. Whenever I wear it I feel sexy, I would definitely recommend it.</li>

            <li> Love this perfume. Smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> Truly smells like an old lady and is nearly repulsive.  Highly recommend purchasing a different scent and/or brand. Yikes spike!</li>
            <li> I really wanted some new perfume. I didn&#x27;t want to brake the bank doing it either. This perfume was only 10.00 and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I cant tell difference between this and 100 stuff I buy at department store.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mom and my aunt and loved them. It&#x27;s Not the most expensive perfume, but it has very good quality</li>
