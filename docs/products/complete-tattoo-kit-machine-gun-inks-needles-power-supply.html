            <li>its easy to use</li>
            <li>It fades out very quickly and looks tacky.</li>
            <li>I did however have to go on youtube to learn how to set the gun up but was easy setup after that.</li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and nice packaging btw.</li>
            <li>Came in a timely fashion and everything works fine</li>

            <li>Such a great starter kit.</li>
            <li>Altogether great product, would definitely recommend...</li>
            <li>the ink is cheap but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>Seems legit, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Just needs more ink and practice skin but overall good product</li>
            <li>So far so good, everything was there and works as it should,</li>
            <li>The ink wasn&#x27;t very good ink and there weren&#x27;t enough needles other than that it worked great</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really loved it, simple &amp; easy to work with</li>
            <li>So let us have fun mutilating our body!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about getting it at first but after doing some online window shopping here on Amazon and seeing what others had to say about their purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would use a better quality ink for real tattoos, but they work fine for practice skins.</li>
            <li>The video is a little out dated and could be updated, but is a very good tutorial.</li>
            <li>Everything true to description.</li>
            <li>So I just cleaned out and let it cool.</li>
            <li>Arrived early which is always nice.</li>
            <li>So far the power supply, gun and foot pedal is working nicely.</li>
            <li>For a price like this it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>this is my third kit ive orderd and by far the best, good machine, if you get it tuned and set up right,  one or two inks were bad but othert than that flawless</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tiger skin was fine but you&#x27;ll fill it the first day if you are anything like my student.&lt;br /&gt;Foot</li>
            <li>3 sizes of needles, the smallest size is super super fine point, so don&#x27;t be fooled if it looks large.</li>
            <li>works really good,its nice to have decent equipmwnt</li>
            <li>Got our kit an it works real good tattoo kit came professional threw black ink so far is the best other colors chalk colors ....</li>
            <li>Guns and power supply are great but ink is not good at all need better ink supply.</li>
            <li>should have been more aware of what I was getting I will be more prepared next time</li>
            <li>Great little kit for people looking to learn.</li>
            <li>lowest price I&#x27;ve ever seen and comes with EVERYTHING you need to  start tattooing right away.</li>
            <li>Very good product doing a thing that I dislike is the size of the ink they don&#x27;t last very long when you are going to tattoo</li>
            <li>but I found that on youtube very quickly and clearly.</li>
            <li>It came with enough of everything and the tattoo gun itself is eay to put together and feels like quality, with weights and comfort! :)</li>
            <li>love all the different colors.</li>
            <li>Yesterday (when i got it in the mail) was the first time ever using one of these...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the gun becomes a bit hot after 10-15 mins.</li>
            <li>so would you do buy this kit you need to make sure the tattoo has enough ink before you start</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Cups, they don&#x27;t give you to many and you will burn threw them, but they are good for practicing on the fake tiger skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came fully ekupted everything was sterilized individually packed an easy setup</li>
            <li>The only ink that works really great is the black.</li>
            <li>Good machine lil hard to hook u</li>
            <li>but the dvd doesnt help that much</li>
            <li>But you get it really fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Its value fir your money and tge delivery was fast&amp;#34; highly recommended!</li>
            <li>.they ship fast</li>
            <li>You can do some real damage to someone if you don&#x27;t have Tatoo exp.</li>
            <li>I found it easier working on real skin than the practice skin.</li>
            <li>1 star because the seller refused to replace the dvd, and because the power supply is cheap chinese junk.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It came much sooner than what the estimated delivery stated.</li>
            <li>Ink... eh not so much really.</li>
            <li>Those 2 is straight garbage aha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>thanks to those for putting up reviews.</li>
            <li>The gun and power supply are much better than I expected!</li>
            <li>the only reason why its a 3 star is because sometimes the machine doesnt want to go even with no rubber band and the needles arent that good and the white sucks its like goo but all the other colors worked great  </li>
            <li>The ink is cheap however, tread lightly, especially if u have sensitive skin, weakened immune system, etc.</li>
            <li>The machine itself is decent quality.</li>
            <li>but the needles could be a little bit better quality</li>
            <li>This for a very very BEGINNER the gun heats up after about ten minutes but it does line and shade decently.</li>
            <li>But pretty cool little kit.</li>
            <li>If you buy this product, get a new foot pedal, it don&#x27;t work 80% of the time.</li>
            <li>I am new to tattooing</li>
            <li>but be prepared to get a new power supply</li>
            <li>I was skeptical in getting a cheap tattoo kit, and I chose this one because it seemed to have the most accessories for the lowest price.</li>
            <li>The DVD and practice skin are pretty crappy, but they are just extras that obviously do not effect the machine.</li>
            <li>Obviously you shouldn&#x27;t expect anything super high quality, it is only 30$ and from china, but nonetheless, a gnarly deal.</li>
            <li>The black turns to a light greyish faded color.</li>
            <li>it came with everything no trouble with the gun.</li>
            <li>very efficient starting product, hes been using it for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>so far I gave myself a tat</li>
            <li>The ink is ok, not very great</li>
            <li>good item, little hard to control speed</li>
            <li>and the colors red and blue didnt stick very well</li>
            <li>but other then that first began tattoo machine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the red and black so far and the colors are bold.</li>
            <li>it arrived in less than a week and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>finally the ink inst bad, hes done a couple tattoos on himself that look great.</li>
            <li>The gun actually came in much sooner than I expected it to.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I love art.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s no problem, for I could just pick up better quality ink here per se.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with this tattoo gun.</li>
            <li> An most.</li>
            <li> Super cute machine!</li>
            <li> The price is the best you&#x27;ll find, the kit has everything you&#x27;ll need to start tattooing or practicing, and the shipping time was better than expected.</li>
            <li> The power supply/pedal are very light and cheap feeling, but they get the job don&#x27;t and for the price</li>
            <li> Its worked great so far</li>
            <li> Good to start with really.</li>
            <li> I feel the product will suffice any novice, it does exactly what is says it does and the price is great and right for the product.</li>
            <li> But otherwise, sweet deal!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> its easy to use</li>
            <li> It fades out very quickly and looks tacky.</li>
            <li> I did however have to go on youtube to learn how to set the gun up but was easy setup after that.</li>
            <li> Would strongly recommend</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and nice packaging btw.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely fashion and everything works fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;The needles are fine, went through the ones they gave within a week.&lt;br /&gt;Ink</li>
            <li> works fine</li>
            <li> My tattoo kit works just fine.</li>
            <li> Everything works fine.</li>
            <li> Very awesome little kit here.</li>
            <li> but overall great product, esp for the price</li>
            <li> Such a great starter kit.</li>
            <li> Altogether great product, would definitely recommend...</li>
            <li> the ink is cheap but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Seems legit, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Just needs more ink and practice skin but overall good product</li>
            <li> So far so good, everything was there and works as it should,</li>
            <li> The ink wasn&#x27;t very good ink and there weren&#x27;t enough needles other than that it worked great</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really loved it, simple &amp; easy to work with</li>
            <li> So let us have fun mutilating our body!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about getting it at first but after doing some online window shopping here on Amazon and seeing what others had to say about their purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would use a better quality ink for real tattoos, but they work fine for practice skins.</li>
            <li> The video is a little out dated and could be updated, but is a very good tutorial.</li>
            <li> Everything true to description.</li>
            <li> So I just cleaned out and let it cool.</li>
            <li> Arrived early which is always nice.</li>
            <li> So far the power supply, gun and foot pedal is working nicely.</li>
            <li> For a price like this it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> this is my third kit ive orderd and by far the best, good machine, if you get it tuned and set up right,  one or two inks were bad but othert than that flawless</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tiger skin was fine but you&#x27;ll fill it the first day if you are anything like my student.&lt;br /&gt;Foot</li>
            <li> 3 sizes of needles, the smallest size is super super fine point, so don&#x27;t be fooled if it looks large.</li>
            <li> works really good,its nice to have decent equipmwnt</li>
            <li> Got our kit an it works real good tattoo kit came professional threw black ink so far is the best other colors chalk colors ....</li>
            <li> Guns and power supply are great but ink is not good at all need better ink supply.</li>
            <li> should have been more aware of what I was getting I will be more prepared next time</li>
            <li> Great little kit for people looking to learn.</li>
            <li> lowest price I&#x27;ve ever seen and comes with EVERYTHING you need to  start tattooing right away.</li>
            <li> Very good product doing a thing that I dislike is the size of the ink they don&#x27;t last very long when you are going to tattoo</li>
            <li> but I found that on youtube very quickly and clearly.</li>
            <li> It came with enough of everything and the tattoo gun itself is eay to put together and feels like quality, with weights and comfort! :)</li>
            <li> love all the different colors.</li>
            <li> Yesterday (when i got it in the mail) was the first time ever using one of these...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the gun becomes a bit hot after 10-15 mins.</li>
            <li> so would you do buy this kit you need to make sure the tattoo has enough ink before you start</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Cups, they don&#x27;t give you to many and you will burn threw them, but they are good for practicing on the fake tiger skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came fully ekupted everything was sterilized individually packed an easy setup</li>
            <li> The only ink that works really great is the black.</li>
            <li> Good machine lil hard to hook u</li>
            <li> but the dvd doesnt help that much</li>
            <li> But you get it really fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Its value fir your money and tge delivery was fast&amp;#34; highly recommended!</li>
            <li> .they ship fast</li>
            <li> You can do some real damage to someone if you don&#x27;t have Tatoo exp.</li>
            <li> I found it easier working on real skin than the practice skin.</li>
            <li> 1 star because the seller refused to replace the dvd, and because the power supply is cheap chinese junk.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It came much sooner than what the estimated delivery stated.</li>
            <li> Ink... eh not so much really.</li>
            <li> Those 2 is straight garbage aha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> thanks to those for putting up reviews.</li>
            <li> The gun and power supply are much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> the only reason why its a 3 star is because sometimes the machine doesnt want to go even with no rubber band and the needles arent that good and the white sucks its like goo but all the other colors worked great  </li>
            <li> The ink is cheap however, tread lightly, especially if u have sensitive skin, weakened immune system, etc.</li>
            <li> The machine itself is decent quality.</li>
            <li> but the needles could be a little bit better quality</li>
            <li> This for a very very BEGINNER the gun heats up after about ten minutes but it does line and shade decently.</li>
            <li> But pretty cool little kit.</li>
            <li> If you buy this product, get a new foot pedal, it don&#x27;t work 80% of the time.</li>
            <li> I am new to tattooing</li>
            <li> but be prepared to get a new power supply</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in getting a cheap tattoo kit, and I chose this one because it seemed to have the most accessories for the lowest price.</li>
            <li> The DVD and practice skin are pretty crappy, but they are just extras that obviously do not effect the machine.</li>
            <li> Obviously you shouldn&#x27;t expect anything super high quality, it is only 30$ and from china, but nonetheless, a gnarly deal.</li>
            <li> The black turns to a light greyish faded color.</li>
            <li> it came with everything no trouble with the gun.</li>
            <li> very efficient starting product, hes been using it for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so far I gave myself a tat</li>
            <li> The ink is ok, not very great</li>
            <li> good item, little hard to control speed</li>
            <li> and the colors red and blue didnt stick very well</li>
            <li> but other then that first began tattoo machine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the red and black so far and the colors are bold.</li>
            <li> it arrived in less than a week and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> finally the ink inst bad, hes done a couple tattoos on himself that look great.</li>
            <li> The gun actually came in much sooner than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> The skin is worthless and the DVD is in some odd format that won&#x27;t play on my pc or Xbox so other than that this is pretty good but only for the brand new artist</li>
            <li> Not pleased with that too much.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is I can&#x27;t use it for too long or it&#x27;ll stop in the skin</li>
            <li> which wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The ink isn&#x27;t long lasting</li>
            <li> The cd was 3 minutes long with nothing but a guy doing a line on a tattoo.</li>
            <li> Arrived a couple days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re all the same thin lining needles which is all a beginner really needs.</li>
            <li> I bought the kit and when I assembled it the gun was not working because of a loose coil and wiring in the gun.</li>
            <li> This kit came in the mail a week eariler than expected.</li>
            <li> Had everything I expected.</li>
            <li> disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one for using anything other than drawing pencils for my art</li>
            <li> Not sure on the ink issues, I purchased different ink.</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s been watered down.</li>
            <li> Most s***ty bad ink n just not good</li>
            <li> waste of my money, and was missing half the stuff on the picture.</li>
            <li> Was missing rubber bands though.</li>
            <li> I had trouble hooking the wires to the machine</li>
            <li> Gun itself is well made but heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this.</li>
            <li> Other than the horrible power supply the gun is solid and the inks take really</li>
            <li> Everything crammed into a small box.</li>
            <li> Power input prongs both small which makes it f as ll out of the power outlet.</li>
            <li> Eh cheaply made, and horrible instruction video!</li>
            <li> The POWER BOX SUCKS.  </li>
            <li> But the inks in the kit are not good at all</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work having to send back :(</li>
            <li> However, the Video CD that was supposed to show you how to use it was total crap.</li>
            <li> Ink sucks cd is useless.</li>
            <li> Mine had the wires out in front of the coil showing, sloppy, from china.</li>
            <li> Power supply looks horrible but it does work, only fluctuates 0.1 off at time when running the machine awhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructional DVD is cheesy and lame, but you get a lot for what you pay.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> It was a horrible quality short video that showed a guy tattooing an ankle.</li>
            <li> Ill never refer iron sakura to anyone!</li>
            <li> Bad pedal I&#x27;m guessing.</li>
            <li> it was a Xmas gift bad all together</li>
            <li> This thing was a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> but the dvd is worthless</li>
            <li> Not at all what I thought it would or should  be very disappointed  </li>
            <li> THE INK IS TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Horrible sale!</li>
            <li> Terrible purchase!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE DONT BUY !</li>
            <li> The power supply is just &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34; The ink, however, is absolutely horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> the only reason why its a 3 star is because sometimes the machine doesnt want to go even with no rubber band and the needles arent that good and the white sucks its like goo but all the other colors worked great  but the dvd doesnt help that much but it still helped at times</li>
            <li> It was a great Beginners set.</li>
            <li> Good to start with really. The ink is ok, not very great and i would consider getting better ink. But pretty cool little kit.</li>
            <li> It works great. i can adjust it to be used as a shader, liner, and color packer. i tried it out on myself and it i love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit to get excited about and have fun with, the ink isnt that great and i wish it would have came with a blank pig skin, i havent watched the disk yet, but thats what youtubes for! It came with enough of everything and the tattoo gun itself is eay to put together and feels like quality, with weights and comfort! :)</li>
            <li> By far the best starter kit your going to find on Amazon for this price range. The ink is cheap however, tread lightly, especially if u have sensitive skin, weakened immune system, etc. Could use a couple sharers but like I said u can&#x27;t beat this price. 4 stars for good shipping and including everything as advertised</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really loved it, simple &amp; easy to work with</li>
            <li> Everything they said it was except mine didn&#x27;t come with rubber bands, awesome deal</li>
            <li> Seems legit, so far so good. Gives out off and on though like it don&#x27;t want to work. Don&#x27;t know why though. Not pleased with that too much.</li>
            <li> Super cute machine! Great products and came fast! Was missing rubber bands though. But everything else was there. Would strongly recommend</li>
            <li> Came in a timely fashion and everything works fine</li>
            <li> Easy to use. The dvd is so helpful for beginners. love all the different colors. great for it&#x27;s price. perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a great product I wish I had bought it years ago. I love tattooing and having this is great I no longer have to borrow my friends</li>
            <li> It is everything it said it would be</li>
            <li> Everything true to description. I had trouble hooking the wires to the machine but I figured it out and tested it. Comes with allen wrenches and everything. 3 sizes of needles, the smallest size is super super fine point, so don&#x27;t be fooled if it looks large. Colours are great and rich. Yesterday (when i got it in the mail) was the first time ever using one of these... But you get it really fast. Awesome deal for the price. Obviously you shouldn&#x27;t expect anything super high quality, it is only 30$ and from china, but nonetheless, a gnarly deal. So let us have fun mutilating our body! Thanks</li>
            <li> no instructions to putting the actual gun together but I found that on youtube very quickly and clearly. its easy to use and I have already done a tattoo and I love this kit its great</li>
            <li> My ink leaked all over the packaging, after I set everything up I realized no rubberbands were included. I hooked the machine up only to have it do NOTHING. the power supply was making a reading but nothing happened. Bad pedal I&#x27;m guessing. As for the gun itself it&#x27;s one of the &amp;#34;prettier&amp;#34; ones I&#x27;ve seen in kits like this. Mine had the wires out in front of the coil showing, sloppy, from china. Returning this to buy something that works.</li>
            <li> I like the gun and it came like a week earlier that I thought it would everything works great from all I can tell.</li>
            <li> inks suck!!! waste of my money, and was missing half the stuff on the picture. disappointed for sure. dont buy</li>
            <li> Got our kit an it works real good tattoo kit came professional threw black ink so far is the best other colors chalk colors .... It came fully ekupted everything was sterilized individually packed an easy setup</li>
            <li> love it , learning how to do tattoos every day... It&#x27;s now one of my hobbies. Shipping was fast. Thank you!</li>
            <li> this is my third kit ive orderd and by far the best, good machine, if you get it tuned and set up right,  one or two inks were bad but othert than that flawless</li>
            <li> Guns and power supply are great but ink is not good at all need better ink supply.</li>
            <li> 2 days i had it 14 hrs of work the power supply fried.... gun is great though.... need refund for the box</li>
            <li> my friend asked me to order this for him and he loves it. we&#x27;re both very satisfied. I would recommend it to people who want to start tattooing.</li>
            <li> Five because it&#x27;s everything it said it would be a S shipped on time. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This kit came in the mail a week eariler than expected. It has a nice gun and ink. The only thing about it that I wasn&#x27;t to fancy on was the power supply. but overall great product, esp for the price</li>
            <li> I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND BUYING THIS THE POWER BOX WENT OUT THE SAME DAY. THE INK IS TERRIBLE! THE GUN ITSELF IS GOOD GREAT GRIP.</li>
            <li> Its value fir your money and tge delivery was fast&amp;#34; highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it came with everything no trouble with the gun. The only thing that didnt work was the cd. and the colors red and blue didnt stick very well i gave my brother a tattoo and it didnt stick.</li>
            <li> Very awesome little kit here. I bought this for an apprentice who was looking to start but had some financial troubles. Ive been watching him use it and ive used it myself. very efficient starting product, hes been using it for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The Power supply looks horrible but it does work, only fluctuates 0.1 off at time when running the machine awhile.&lt;br /&gt;The Tattoo (gun) was good as well. it hold nice and its not to heavy.&lt;br /&gt;The needles are fine, went through the ones they gave within a week.&lt;br /&gt;Ink Cups, they don&#x27;t give you to many and you will burn threw them, but they are good for practicing on the fake tiger skin.&lt;br /&gt;Tiger skin was fine but you&#x27;ll fill it the first day if you are anything like my student.&lt;br /&gt;Foot Peddle is simple but i like the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;The CD is rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;And finally the ink inst bad, hes done a couple tattoos on himself that look great.</li>
            <li> The gun and power supply are much better than I expected! The ink smh, that bull s*** was wattery as hell. Ill never refer iron sakura to anyone! Very fast shipping and nice packaging btw.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price. The kit I bought was gifted off. I got the 1st tattoo and my brother kept the kit. Affordable and Convenient.</li>
            <li> Ink and power supply ? not so good , but everything else was good... Could use some transfer paper and more needles</li>
            <li> Great gun and power supply good ink and alot of niddles .they ship fast i love it thank you guys</li>
            <li> A great starter kit to get your skills up or to practice or make your money with it what ever you please to do with it, it&#x27;s a great kit I was vary empresses with so I think who ever else buys it will be satisfied I give y&#x27;all a 5 star rating I&#x27;d love to buy more kits from them...</li>
            <li> I bought the kit and when I assembled it the gun was not working because of a loose coil and wiring in the gun.I wish I can get a refund on it smh. Horrible sale!</li>
            <li> Such a great starter kit. Works well and the price cant be beat. Would buy another for family or friends as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one for using anything other than drawing pencils for my art but it&#x27;s not perminet, transfering my drawings onto someone&#x27;s body makes them perminet &amp; they&#x27;ll have them for life unless they pay a lot of money to have them removed....  If you are looking for an excellent Tattoo Kit at a great deal then this is what you need, I&#x27;ve read reviews where people were having issues with the power supply, I haven&#x27;t had any issues at all with it &amp; the entire system works great!!!</li>
            <li> It is perfect.. everything included as stated in listing.  Packaging was good.  My son has used it and is impressed.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> What a great price! The instructional DVD is cheesy and lame, but you get a lot for what you pay. It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions so you have to search elsewhere to figure out how to put the machine together.</li>
            <li> I recommend this is youre a beginner! Just make sure to have a spare power supply! &amp; more practice skin unless youre gonna use yours! Ink isnt THAT good but come on you get what you pay for ,so honestly its not bad at all! Recommend it</li>
            <li> Not at all what I thought it would or should  be very disappointed  should have been more aware of what I was getting I will be more prepared next time</li>
            <li> Great starter kit....Just needs more ink and practice skin but overall good product I would recommend this product to anyone thats just want to get into the tattooing world</li>
            <li> It came with all that was n the sellers statment and pic....i got to try it out and works great but the power supply isnt the greatest but it works an im happy</li>
            <li> No setup info. Sorry but DVD is a joke! If you buy this product, get a new foot pedal, it don&#x27;t work 80% of the time. Gun itself is well made but heavy. You can do some real damage to someone if you don&#x27;t have Tatoo exp.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in getting a cheap tattoo kit, and I chose this one because it seemed to have the most accessories for the lowest price. Never having used a tattoo machine before, or knowing if I got the right depth in my skin, it feels awesome to be able to tattoo myself! I&#x27;ve only used the red and black so far and the colors are bold. It works, does the trick. But there is no cup holder and the files on the VCD do not play or open with any program so that&#x27;s no help if you&#x27;re looking for instructions you&#x27;ll have to go to YouTube. But otherwise, sweet deal! Oh, and the gun becomes a bit hot after 10-15 mins. So I just cleaned out and let it cool.</li>
            <li> The ink wasn&#x27;t very good ink and there weren&#x27;t enough needles other than that it worked great and I&#x27;ve had no problems</li>
            <li> Works great! I found it easier working on real skin than the practice skin. It took me a while to figure out how to hook the wires up to the machine but I got it eventually. Tattoos amazingly. The only downfall is I can&#x27;t use it for too long or it&#x27;ll stop in the skin and I&#x27;ll have to click the petal to turn it off and then back on again which wouldn&#x27;t last long. But for beginners it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Its worked great so far and i have had it for a month now! But the inks in the kit are not good at all</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for but its definitely a good kit for starters.</li>
            <li> This thing was a piece of crap. The cd was 3 minutes long with nothing but a guy doing a line on a tattoo. Terrible purchase! Nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time. Everything crammed into a small box. Everything listed was there. The power supply I got is not the one pictured. Power input prongs both small which makes it f as ll out of the power outlet. The instructional dvd was found under everything else,  cracked, and is just a burned copy.the practice skin is just a rubber pad and cannot be tattooed on. 1 star because the seller refused to replace the dvd, and because the power supply is cheap chinese junk. The machine itself is decent quality. Cables needles good too. The ink was all coagulated. I would have paid this price for just the machine alone though.</li>
            <li> I like it so far I gave myself a tat</li>
            <li> Shipping time and cost was great.  Ink is not the best quality. But all in all the kit was good.</li>
            <li> Product did come on time but it didn&#x27;t work having to send back :(</li>
            <li> The ink isn&#x27;t long lasting</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE DONT BUY ! I think everyone on this is a liar  I rate this 0 stars</li>
            <li> works really good,its nice to have decent equipmwnt</li>
            <li> Arrived a couple days earlier than expected. GREAT tattoo kit, perfect for a beginner, lowest price I&#x27;ve ever seen and comes with EVERYTHING you need to  start tattooing right away. The power supply/pedal are very light and cheap feeling, but they get the job don&#x27;t and for the price it&#x27;s all better than I expected. It comes with quite a bit of needles (all the same, no varieties like shaders or thicker liners or anything) they&#x27;re all the same thin lining needles which is all a beginner really needs. As a whole, this kit is perfect and I would recommend it to any beginner. The price is the best you&#x27;ll find, the kit has everything you&#x27;ll need to start tattooing or practicing, and the shipping time was better than expected. Altogether great product, would definitely recommend...</li>
            <li> it arrived in less than a week and was exactly as described. good quality for the price. comes with a tutorial dvd. i havent watched it though. machine works great. comes with everything you need except stencil paper.</li>
            <li> everything i hoped for!</li>
            <li> Works great. Had everything I expected. I am new to tattooing but I love art. I had never tattooed before and there were no instructions to assemble the gun.</li>
            <li> This for a very very BEGINNER the gun heats up after about ten minutes but it does line and shade decently. The skin is worthless and the DVD is in some odd format that won&#x27;t play on my pc or Xbox so other than that this is pretty good but only for the brand new artist</li>
            <li> Absolutley..it was a great buy..ofbcourse u need bettervink but the video was great! It wasntb3 minutes like others said it wasbfull length and great detail</li>
            <li> Can any one tell me if it comes with stencil paper i just ordered it and i was just wondering</li>
            <li> Easy to learn with this! The video is a little out dated and could be updated, but is a very good tutorial. Everything that it comes with, works great and is perfect for a first one,..</li>
            <li> Had my kit for 3 weeks and the power supply and the gun overheated.I asked for a refund and they said I had to pay for postage to get it.The only ink that works really great is the black.But I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good product doing a thing that I dislike is the size of the ink they don&#x27;t last very long when you are going to tattoo so would you do buy this kit you need to make sure the tattoo has enough ink before you start</li>
            <li> Other than the horrible power supply the gun is solid and the inks take really we&#x27;ll. but be prepared to get a new power supply</li>
            <li> Most s***ty bad ink n just not good it was a Xmas gift bad all together</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s Great - love it !!!!</li>
            <li> The gun and needles are great. The power supply is just &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34; The ink, however, is absolutely horrible. The kit is great for the price, but please buy more ink as the ink this comes with is garbage. It fades out very quickly and looks tacky. The black turns to a light greyish faded color. Take my advice, if you buy this, also buy different ink.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my kit. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and she is learning how to do tattoo needed it she practiced on the tattoo gun works fine but the needles could be a little bit better quality</li>
            <li> good item, little hard to control speed</li>
            <li> Very good product. Will buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect tattoo kit! Comes with everything you need! The machine works perfectly! I definitely recommend, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> The gun actually came in much sooner than I expected it to. However, the Video CD that was supposed to show you how to use it was total crap. It was a horrible quality short video that showed a guy tattooing an ankle. There are zero instructions and nothing that even shows how to assemble the gun. How do they expect us to use this?</li>
            <li> Good machine lil hard to hook u but got n got to my tatting up but other then that first began tattoo machine</li>
            <li> Eh cheaply made, and horrible instruction video! Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this.</li>
            <li> cord didnt work at all yall slackin</li>
            <li> Arrived early which is always nice. So far so good, everything was there and works as it should, I didn&#x27;t watch the dvd or use the practice skin.  I did however have to go on youtube to learn how to set the gun up but was easy setup after that. I would recommend this to anyone! Not sure on the ink issues, I purchased different ink. Thanks</li>
            <li> great for a starter but the dvd is worthless</li>
            <li> My tattoo kit works just fine. Its just what i was looking for and it does the job. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Order id # 113-7670587-6384219&lt;br /&gt;Name: Brian Adkins</li>
            <li> Two days after I placed the order it arrived. It came much sooner than what the estimated delivery stated. Everything listed in the product description was included. I feel the product will suffice any novice, it does exactly what is says it does and the price is great and right for the product.</li>
            <li> the ink is cheap but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Mine arrived earlier today. Came from work and tested everything. So far the power supply, gun and foot pedal is working nicely. Ink... eh not so much really. It feels like it&#x27;s been watered down. But that&#x27;s no problem, for I could just pick up better quality ink here per se. For a price like this it&#x27;s not bad at all. I&#x27;m pretty happy with what I got. Except for the DVD and practice skin. Those 2 is straight garbage aha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and thanks to those for putting up reviews. Definitely was helpful. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about getting it at first but after doing some online window shopping here on Amazon and seeing what others had to say about their purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I will be coming to Amazon for the things I need.</li>
            <li> Everything works fine. I am happy with my kit. The kit included everything that was shown in the pictures. I am totally satisfied with this tattoo gun.</li>
            <li> Very nice machine  . Has a solid feel to it</li>
            <li> Ink sucks cd is useless. An most. My needles. Were. Bent</li>
            <li> This set up is very good for beginners, I used it and learned a lot from it.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit, Comes with everything that is stated, everything that you need to begin tattooing. We had no problem with the power supply, worked great. The DVD and practice skin are pretty crappy, but they are just extras that obviously do not effect the machine. I would use a better quality ink for real tattoos, but they work fine for practice skins. Great little kit for people looking to learn.</li>
            <li> The POWER BOX SUCKS.  DIED AFTER 2 TATTOOS.BLEW UP IN MY HAND..  LETS. SEE IF THE MANUFACTURER GIVES A S***...</li>
