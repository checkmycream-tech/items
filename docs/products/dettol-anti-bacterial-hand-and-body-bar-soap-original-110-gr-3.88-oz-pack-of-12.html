            <li>Excellent product and shipper!  </li>
            <li>My husband is from St Thomas VI and he told me about this product I didn&#x27;t believe him when he said it was the best soap to buy couldn&#x27;t find it here</li>

            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a great ant bacterial soap without all the perfumes and this is it.</li>
            <li>I received the order faster than I thought, and also the soap is one of the best that most people don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>If you want soap that will truly clean and disinfect your body, this is the best antibacterial soap around.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>We love it!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for seeking this excellent product!</li>
            <li>I love it , smells good</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so confident about Anti - bacteria.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Great product and the delivery was early.  </li>
            <li>I know that this soap contains the two active ingredients I&#x27;m looking for, to kill bacteria, and it cleanses the hands very effectively with nice lather.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a company finely being honest about it product.</li>
            <li>This has always been a fantastic product</li>

            <li>I first encountered Dettol hand soap in England in 1987.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li>I love the antibacterial properties of Dettol without the harshness of other soaps.</li>
            <li>If you want sweet smelling soaps then just buy soap at your local store.  </li>
            <li>However, you will not beat the price, service and fast shipping that this company offers!</li>
            <li>Really cuts down the germs and keeps their skin clean.</li>
            <li>In these times of Ebola and other weird germs this is the best soap to use.  </li>
            <li>my skin feels soft ot does not dry my skin</li>
            <li>Then, I found it for sale in New York City in 1994, which surprised me, since it was imported from the U.K. in U.K. packaging with the weight stated only in grams -- clearly not meant for sale in the U.S.A. though perfectly legal to show only the metric quantity.  </li>

            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently trying this out on a skin fungus similar looking to excema or dry skin, to see if it helps.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smells like the other Dettol products, however, after flushing the soap from the hands, the dettol smell goes away, and only a soapy smell remains on the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can not live without it .</li>
            <li> I do find that this &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Dettol soap is drying to the hands, so I typically put on some lotion after using it, but that&#x27;s no big deal to me.  </li>
            <li> received on time and its wha i expected tankyou ln</li>
            <li> this is not like other soaps that do so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also leaves a slightly moisturized after feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is not sold on shelves in the USA, probably because it is not sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li> All this reviews are fake.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It smells like shoe polish.All this reviews are fake.How they know that it kills the germs??? And no one complain about the smell???</li>
            <li> Use this soap regularly on my four kids. Really cuts down the germs and keeps their skin clean.</li>
            <li> I used this soap prior to surgery and after surgery. It literally remove all the built up residue I had on my skin.</li>
            <li> The best prodyct ever .. I can not live without it . It is not my country product but still same quality ..</li>
            <li> Smells like the other Dettol products, however, after flushing the soap from the hands, the dettol smell goes away, and only a soapy smell remains on the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves a slightly moisturized after feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for getting hands and body parts anti-bacteried :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently trying this out on a skin fungus similar looking to excema or dry skin, to see if it helps.&lt;br /&gt;I presume it will help against cloved skin as well; but never tried.</li>
            <li> These are the best when you need to be protected from germs</li>
            <li> I first encountered Dettol hand soap in England in 1987.  Then, I found it for sale in New York City in 1994, which surprised me, since it was imported from the U.K. in U.K. packaging with the weight stated only in grams -- clearly not meant for sale in the U.S.A. though perfectly legal to show only the metric quantity.  So I took a chance on the instant product, which is actually made in Indonesia.  But it&#x27;s Dettol antibacterial soap just I remember it -- the bar of soap is the same yellow color and has the same fragrance, like Pine-Sol.  The ingredients list seems to be in English, even if the rest of the labeling isn&#x27;t.  I do find that this &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Dettol soap is drying to the hands, so I typically put on some lotion after using it, but that&#x27;s no big deal to me.  I know that this soap contains the two active ingredients I&#x27;m looking for, to kill bacteria, and it cleanses the hands very effectively with nice lather.</li>
            <li> Best stuff. No residue. Been using for years</li>
            <li> Very good soap for anti-bacterial use.</li>
            <li> This has always been a fantastic product</li>
            <li> I love the antibacterial properties of Dettol without the harshness of other soaps.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and shipper!  We will continue to buy from this seller.  Product arrived in only a couple days across country.  We discovered this soap in Spain and now would never be with out it.  This is the real stuff and we will be buying 36 more bars soon.  If you want sweet smelling soaps then just buy soap at your local store.  If you want soap that will truly clean and disinfect your body, this is the best antibacterial soap around.  In these times of Ebola and other weird germs this is the best soap to use.  We love it!  The product is not sold on shelves in the USA, probably because it is not sweet smelling.  It is made by the same people who make Lysol and it would be GREAT if one could buy it locally.  However, you will not beat the price, service and fast shipping that this company offers! Thanks for seeking this excellent product!</li>
