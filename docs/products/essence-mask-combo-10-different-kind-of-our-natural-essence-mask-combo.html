            <li>Easy to use and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>They are AMAZING</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s a nice way to pamper myself and have a bit of me time.</li>
            <li>I often put together my own combination of ingredients for a homemade mask.  </li>
            <li>did a good job refreshing my face</li>
            <li>These masks are nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the variety.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard so many good things about</li>
            <li>good deal but okay quality</li>
            <li>really nice mask.</li>
            <li>Great item at a great cost with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Sort of nice self-pampering at home treatment</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a nice set of face masks.  </li>
            <li>Will order more very pleased</li>
            <li>All in all, they are easy to use and are a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>and I can then also use my ice roller on top for more soothing coolness!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin and these are great!</li>
            <li>But these are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>The EGF one was amazing, my skin remained looking better for about 72 hrs after using it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really refreshing after sweating all day.</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is that I don&#x27;t know if the ingredients are safe.</li>
            <li>Great price abd fast shipping</li>
            <li>This masks made me breakout even more.</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing when you have the mask on.</li>
            <li>So refreshing and hydrating.</li>
            <li>I just put one of these on for 10-20 minutes and it immediately looks better.</li>
            <li>The shipping was timely and the mask it self is of a better quality cloth then</li>
            <li>and I must say these are just as effective and fit way better than most masks.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE these masks.</li>
            <li>These masks are okay.</li>
            <li>I like the gel or mud masks better.</li>
            <li>Love these masks</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes your skin feel afterwards.  </li>
            <li>i fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>i understand pictures better</li>
            <li>i really love</li>
            <li>I love these masks.  </li>
            <li>I really love these masks.  </li>
            <li>eleccion para mis clientes ,muy buena calidas ,es adorable suevecita y tiene abundante mascarillas .RECOMENDADA .</li>
            <li>Perhaps these are better suited for people subjected to harsher weather conditions.</li>
            <li>There are so many choices to pick from</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>I knew I had to have more.  </li>
            <li>I want hundreds more.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Most of the information on the packets is in Korean, so you may not be able to sort out the ingredients, if that is a concern to you.  </li>
            <li>they are ok!, But very cheap, huge pads, compare the ones my friend brought me from Korea, they are so cheap.  </li>
            <li>the bright side the masks works in moisturizing your face, but they leave a sticky residue in which you have to wash your face again which defeats the purpose of even putting it on in the first place.</li>
            <li>This is the best on days when my skin feels really dry.</li>
            <li>But they are very good for facial health</li>
            <li>These are very hydrating and feel good on.</li>
            <li>However, good price, don&#x27;t expect too much</li>
            <li>So I have to make sure to use a natural product or product that was made with good ingredients.   </li>
            <li>I guess I have a huge face.</li>
            <li>See my lengthy and detailed review of Essence Mask Combo No.2.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>This just tells me that this product is made with cheap ingredients.   </li>
            <li>For the price this is more then worth it.</li>
            <li>Important note.</li>
            <li>These masks are amazing, you can really feel the difference on your face.</li>
            <li>Serum cannot be easily absorbed and stays on top of the face.</li>
            <li>I found that these aren&#x27;t as absorbent as &amp;#34;my beauty diary&amp;#34; masks, but the range of fun options makes this a great purchase when you just want to have some cool masks that you probably wouldn&#x27;t normally stock.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using them twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I truly enjoy the application</li>
            <li>recommend leaving the mask on the face for 20 full minutes, then working in the solution into the skin with fingers in mini-circular motion until most of it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>really made me feel fresh and comfortable when after using this one~~I recommened it~~!!</li>
            <li>My first set of face masks and these are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Makes you feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>First, the mask is very big,which I love!</li>
            <li>With the combo of a fridge-cooled mask, the silicone over top and using the ice roller over that, I find I can micro needle my skin and look largely recovered from it within an hour or two.</li>
            <li>Luckily she has been to Japan, so she was familiar with the type of masks these are.  </li>
            <li>Cool product, you can see a difference in your skin right after aplying the mask!</li>
            <li>You would benefit mostly from it, if you do it in the morning, and carry that glow with you for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality of thr facial mask was good.</li>
            <li>Your face feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>ok, i don&#x27;t really write reviews</li>
            <li>The ingredients seem so gentle that I think this product would be appropriate for all skin types.</li>
            <li>Not bad, I guess.</li>
            <li>They come in one size, so be prepared if it doesn&#x27;t fit your face quite right.</li>
            <li>Other than that i am so happy with the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and was in a secure package.</li>
            <li>These are great for anyone with dry skin; they moisturize really well and leave your skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Not all of them have the right moisture for skin, but some of them are good for dry skin, beside the honey</li>
            <li>In summary,  these are very good products produced in Korea by people who have become the leaders in facial health and beauty in recent years.</li>
            <li>I really like the way these masks fit my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used six of them so far in two weeks, and my face feels a lot more moisturized.</li>
            <li>They were fun to try out at the group party</li>
            <li>I bought the mask for the second time, and I love the smooth feeling after applied it.</li>
            <li>Nice selection of different scent.</li>
            <li>They would be handy if you want to have a spa day with friends, or just to keep on hand for personal use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other types before, but these ones conform better, and the moisturizing treatment, though it feels a little &#x27;slimy&#x27;, does an excellent job moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>I was a little weary at first because I had never heard of or used this brand, but they are great.  </li>
            <li>They are just as good as the other masks I have tried</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the huge variety in this package for different skin care concerns based on the time of year.</li>
            <li>thats is my choise for my clients ,very god quality ,lovely soft product ,</li>
            <li>i like it very much .</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like most of the facial moisturizing masks.</li>
            <li>GREAT,I love  these masks, deep moisture with each one</li>
            <li>But the results are short-lived, just as many facial treatments are.</li>
            <li>And it arrived so fast!</li>
            <li>Reasonably moisturizing and luxurious!</li>
            <li>but they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love that the package has different combinations.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>If you have your heart set on the exact ones listed, just be aware of this from that seller (I was really pleased with their service and prices, especially since they ship from MD and use 2-day priority mail!</li>
            <li>The product is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>Will totally buy more after I finish using them.</li>
            <li>They also sent me an extra one &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to be so wet and liquid</li>
            <li>These are the first sheet masks I have ever used.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great during the winter time when my skin is extra dry from the weather.  </li>
            <li>No messy clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This package is a good combinations of various different kinds of masks.</li>
            <li>a mast for traveling, very juicy, so use first on your neck.</li>
            <li>And to be honest, my skin was no different after the masks in general.</li>
            <li>I keep the EGF one in the fridge before needling my face and then apply it afterwards and the cold, plus the wonderful ingredients, soothe my skin so much!</li>
            <li>the next day, my skin looks more vivid^^</li>
            <li>I highly recommend warming it up before usage while still inside the package (either in the bath or under running hot water).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The masks are huge to accomodate anyone, especially men.  </li>
            <li>These masks are very moisturizing, I have never tried anything like it.</li>
            <li>I really like these masks.</li>
            <li>After peeling it off, feels very oily on the face...</li>
            <li>very like it.</li>
            <li>i was really hoping to try the aloe,pearl, and like 4 others.&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>It feels very slimy, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>They are very soothing and invigorating.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any real toning effects, which was what I sought in this product.</li>
            <li>beside the jokes, your face really looks refreshed.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t know why asian back scrubs aren&#x27;t popular in America.</li>
            <li>After that, you feel that super smooth baby skin on your face, less the oily feelings like those from face lotion &amp; moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I feel like other brands leave my face a bit more moisturized than these</li>
            <li>Contrast that with the 48 hours it normally takes me to have the burning redness recede!</li>
            <li>There are lots of other better sheet masks on amazon .</li>
            <li>Maybe the price is a little bit higher but the quality is much better.</li>
            <li>but these items aren&#x27;t really true masks, in my opinion, as the benefit is simply a pretty heavy residue of cream left sitting on top after removing the cloth mask.</li>
            <li>Not bad, especially for the quality.</li>
            <li>I love the coverage, it goes down my chin too.</li>
            <li>Also, you&#x27;re able to do other things while this mask is on, or you could just relax!</li>
            <li>It makes your face vibrant.</li>
            <li>I love the paper masks, eliminates the mess</li>
            <li>It frightened my husband, so the entertainment value is high.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used two so far and don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any real benefits</li>
            <li>Granted, I do exfoliate my skin daily using the Korean scrub cloths, which I also bought on Amazon; so, exfoliating is an integral part of the regimen of keeping my skin looking radiant and fresh, day-in and day-out.</li>
            <li>They all smell pretty much the same</li>
            <li>Overall a nice addition to the daily routine in facial care.</li>
            <li>I love these but the only problem is is that they take literally forever to dry.</li>
            <li>I used half of them so far and love how moist they make my face feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>Then I let it dry for 5 minutes then apply Nature Republic&#x27;s Super Aqua Max Watery Cream.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft !</li>
            <li>It moisturizes skin and leaves skin smooth and tight.  </li>
            <li>When you wash it off, it&#x27;s gone and your face goes back to how it is (maybe a little better).</li>
            <li>It feels much better when it&#x27;s warm than a cold wet cloth hitting your skin.</li>
            <li>I do find that these help hydrate the skin very well, and my face always feels soft and looks glowy the next day after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I have used to the EGF and the Herb.</li>
            <li>They each made my skin feel soft and replenished.</li>
            <li>My skin is really soft today, so it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Went on an amazon binge to try many different wet masks from different companies as I could find, but I know these are a product I will buy again, and the seller was reliable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And they were still cheaper than the ones direct from Korea.).</li>
            <li>I have eczema on my cheeks and when I use these mask it really helps my skin stay moist especially with the winter winds coming soon.</li>
            <li>I buy these for the wife occasionally, and she really likes them.</li>
            <li>My skins always feels soft after using them.</li>
            <li>I bought the other versions too and they&#x27;re very fun to use, especially with friends or family.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using these on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I experienced dry skin and some blemishes due to my late sleeping habit and fastfood diet, so I decided to try this on at night when I go to bed.</li>
            <li>So far, of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, none have had hardly any smell to them which is important to me since I am so sensitive to smells (and</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying the wet masks.</li>
            <li>The masks are paper cutouts of a face, imbued with a large amount of ten different products in each combo pack.  </li>
            <li>Fun to try, but I could tell no real difference in my skin between the different types.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but my skin felt so soft and hydrated afterward!</li>
            <li>I only wish it covered more of my skin next to my nose, which is narrow, so I&#x27;ll have to re-position the next one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried 4 of them so far</li>
            <li>So far the 4 I&#x27;ve tried feels the same.</li>
            <li>Different than what I am used to, but makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>The cloth does feel a lil sicker than most of the other ones I have used, but that hasn&#x27;t affected my skin in a negative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my mom has dry mature skin</li>
            <li>Was surprised at how thick the cloths were and how much product was on them!</li>
            <li>In other words, I have very sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> They look really funny on, Lol!</li>
            <li> and when I remove it, my skin is so much better!</li>

            <li> Easy to use and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> They are AMAZING</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s a nice way to pamper myself and have a bit of me time.</li>
            <li> I often put together my own combination of ingredients for a homemade mask.  </li>
            <li> did a good job refreshing my face</li>
            <li> These masks are nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the variety.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard so many good things about</li>
            <li> good deal but okay quality</li>
            <li> really nice mask.</li>
            <li> Great item at a great cost with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Sort of nice self-pampering at home treatment</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a nice set of face masks.  </li>
            <li> Will order more very pleased</li>
            <li> All in all, they are easy to use and are a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> and I can then also use my ice roller on top for more soothing coolness!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and these are great!</li>
            <li> But these are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> The EGF one was amazing, my skin remained looking better for about 72 hrs after using it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really refreshing after sweating all day.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is that I don&#x27;t know if the ingredients are safe.</li>
            <li> Great price abd fast shipping</li>
            <li> This masks made me breakout even more.</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing when you have the mask on.</li>
            <li> So refreshing and hydrating.</li>
            <li> I just put one of these on for 10-20 minutes and it immediately looks better.</li>
            <li> The shipping was timely and the mask it self is of a better quality cloth then</li>
            <li> and I must say these are just as effective and fit way better than most masks.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE these masks.</li>
            <li> These masks are okay.</li>
            <li> I like the gel or mud masks better.</li>
            <li> Love these masks</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes your skin feel afterwards.  </li>
            <li> i fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> i understand pictures better</li>
            <li> i really love</li>
            <li> I love these masks.  </li>
            <li> I really love these masks.  </li>
            <li> eleccion para mis clientes ,muy buena calidas ,es adorable suevecita y tiene abundante mascarillas .RECOMENDADA .</li>
            <li> Perhaps these are better suited for people subjected to harsher weather conditions.</li>
            <li> There are so many choices to pick from</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> I knew I had to have more.  </li>
            <li> I want hundreds more.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Most of the information on the packets is in Korean, so you may not be able to sort out the ingredients, if that is a concern to you.  </li>
            <li> they are ok!, But very cheap, huge pads, compare the ones my friend brought me from Korea, they are so cheap.  </li>
            <li> the bright side the masks works in moisturizing your face, but they leave a sticky residue in which you have to wash your face again which defeats the purpose of even putting it on in the first place.</li>
            <li> This is the best on days when my skin feels really dry.</li>
            <li> But they are very good for facial health</li>
            <li> These are very hydrating and feel good on.</li>
            <li> However, good price, don&#x27;t expect too much</li>
            <li> So I have to make sure to use a natural product or product that was made with good ingredients.   </li>
            <li> I guess I have a huge face.</li>
            <li> See my lengthy and detailed review of Essence Mask Combo No.2.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li> This just tells me that this product is made with cheap ingredients.   </li>
            <li> For the price this is more then worth it.</li>
            <li> Important note.</li>
            <li> These masks are amazing, you can really feel the difference on your face.</li>
            <li> Serum cannot be easily absorbed and stays on top of the face.</li>
            <li> I found that these aren&#x27;t as absorbent as &amp;#34;my beauty diary&amp;#34; masks, but the range of fun options makes this a great purchase when you just want to have some cool masks that you probably wouldn&#x27;t normally stock.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using them twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I truly enjoy the application</li>
            <li> recommend leaving the mask on the face for 20 full minutes, then working in the solution into the skin with fingers in mini-circular motion until most of it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> really made me feel fresh and comfortable when after using this one~~I recommened it~~!!</li>
            <li> My first set of face masks and these are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Makes you feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> First, the mask is very big,which I love!</li>
            <li> With the combo of a fridge-cooled mask, the silicone over top and using the ice roller over that, I find I can micro needle my skin and look largely recovered from it within an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Luckily she has been to Japan, so she was familiar with the type of masks these are.  </li>
            <li> Cool product, you can see a difference in your skin right after aplying the mask!</li>
            <li> You would benefit mostly from it, if you do it in the morning, and carry that glow with you for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quality of thr facial mask was good.</li>
            <li> Your face feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> ok, i don&#x27;t really write reviews</li>
            <li> The ingredients seem so gentle that I think this product would be appropriate for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Not bad, I guess.</li>
            <li> They come in one size, so be prepared if it doesn&#x27;t fit your face quite right.</li>
            <li> Other than that i am so happy with the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and was in a secure package.</li>
            <li> These are great for anyone with dry skin; they moisturize really well and leave your skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Not all of them have the right moisture for skin, but some of them are good for dry skin, beside the honey</li>
            <li> In summary,  these are very good products produced in Korea by people who have become the leaders in facial health and beauty in recent years.</li>
            <li> I really like the way these masks fit my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used six of them so far in two weeks, and my face feels a lot more moisturized.</li>
            <li> They were fun to try out at the group party</li>
            <li> I bought the mask for the second time, and I love the smooth feeling after applied it.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of different scent.</li>
            <li> They would be handy if you want to have a spa day with friends, or just to keep on hand for personal use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types before, but these ones conform better, and the moisturizing treatment, though it feels a little &#x27;slimy&#x27;, does an excellent job moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> I was a little weary at first because I had never heard of or used this brand, but they are great.  </li>
            <li> They are just as good as the other masks I have tried</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the huge variety in this package for different skin care concerns based on the time of year.</li>
            <li> thats is my choise for my clients ,very god quality ,lovely soft product ,</li>
            <li> i like it very much .</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like most of the facial moisturizing masks.</li>
            <li> GREAT,I love  these masks, deep moisture with each one</li>
            <li> But the results are short-lived, just as many facial treatments are.</li>
            <li> And it arrived so fast!</li>
            <li> Reasonably moisturizing and luxurious!</li>
            <li> but they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love that the package has different combinations.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> If you have your heart set on the exact ones listed, just be aware of this from that seller (I was really pleased with their service and prices, especially since they ship from MD and use 2-day priority mail!</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> Will totally buy more after I finish using them.</li>
            <li> They also sent me an extra one &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to be so wet and liquid</li>
            <li> These are the first sheet masks I have ever used.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great during the winter time when my skin is extra dry from the weather.  </li>
            <li> No messy clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li> This package is a good combinations of various different kinds of masks.</li>
            <li> a mast for traveling, very juicy, so use first on your neck.</li>
            <li> And to be honest, my skin was no different after the masks in general.</li>
            <li> I keep the EGF one in the fridge before needling my face and then apply it afterwards and the cold, plus the wonderful ingredients, soothe my skin so much!</li>
            <li> the next day, my skin looks more vivid^^</li>
            <li> I highly recommend warming it up before usage while still inside the package (either in the bath or under running hot water).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The masks are huge to accomodate anyone, especially men.  </li>
            <li> These masks are very moisturizing, I have never tried anything like it.</li>
            <li> I really like these masks.</li>
            <li> After peeling it off, feels very oily on the face...</li>
            <li> very like it.</li>
            <li> i was really hoping to try the aloe,pearl, and like 4 others.&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> It feels very slimy, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> They are very soothing and invigorating.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any real toning effects, which was what I sought in this product.</li>
            <li> beside the jokes, your face really looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t know why asian back scrubs aren&#x27;t popular in America.</li>
            <li> After that, you feel that super smooth baby skin on your face, less the oily feelings like those from face lotion &amp; moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I feel like other brands leave my face a bit more moisturized than these</li>
            <li> Contrast that with the 48 hours it normally takes me to have the burning redness recede!</li>
            <li> There are lots of other better sheet masks on amazon .</li>
            <li> Maybe the price is a little bit higher but the quality is much better.</li>
            <li> but these items aren&#x27;t really true masks, in my opinion, as the benefit is simply a pretty heavy residue of cream left sitting on top after removing the cloth mask.</li>
            <li> Not bad, especially for the quality.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage, it goes down my chin too.</li>
            <li> Also, you&#x27;re able to do other things while this mask is on, or you could just relax!</li>
            <li> It makes your face vibrant.</li>
            <li> I love the paper masks, eliminates the mess</li>
            <li> It frightened my husband, so the entertainment value is high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two so far and don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any real benefits</li>
            <li> Granted, I do exfoliate my skin daily using the Korean scrub cloths, which I also bought on Amazon; so, exfoliating is an integral part of the regimen of keeping my skin looking radiant and fresh, day-in and day-out.</li>
            <li> They all smell pretty much the same</li>
            <li> Overall a nice addition to the daily routine in facial care.</li>
            <li> I love these but the only problem is is that they take literally forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I used half of them so far and love how moist they make my face feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> Then I let it dry for 5 minutes then apply Nature Republic&#x27;s Super Aqua Max Watery Cream.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft !</li>
            <li> It moisturizes skin and leaves skin smooth and tight.  </li>
            <li> When you wash it off, it&#x27;s gone and your face goes back to how it is (maybe a little better).</li>
            <li> It feels much better when it&#x27;s warm than a cold wet cloth hitting your skin.</li>
            <li> I do find that these help hydrate the skin very well, and my face always feels soft and looks glowy the next day after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have used to the EGF and the Herb.</li>
            <li> They each made my skin feel soft and replenished.</li>
            <li> My skin is really soft today, so it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Went on an amazon binge to try many different wet masks from different companies as I could find, but I know these are a product I will buy again, and the seller was reliable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And they were still cheaper than the ones direct from Korea.).</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my cheeks and when I use these mask it really helps my skin stay moist especially with the winter winds coming soon.</li>
            <li> I buy these for the wife occasionally, and she really likes them.</li>
            <li> My skins always feels soft after using them.</li>
            <li> I bought the other versions too and they&#x27;re very fun to use, especially with friends or family.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using these on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I experienced dry skin and some blemishes due to my late sleeping habit and fastfood diet, so I decided to try this on at night when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> So far, of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, none have had hardly any smell to them which is important to me since I am so sensitive to smells (and</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying the wet masks.</li>
            <li> The masks are paper cutouts of a face, imbued with a large amount of ten different products in each combo pack.  </li>
            <li> Fun to try, but I could tell no real difference in my skin between the different types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but my skin felt so soft and hydrated afterward!</li>
            <li> I only wish it covered more of my skin next to my nose, which is narrow, so I&#x27;ll have to re-position the next one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried 4 of them so far</li>
            <li> So far the 4 I&#x27;ve tried feels the same.</li>
            <li> Different than what I am used to, but makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> The cloth does feel a lil sicker than most of the other ones I have used, but that hasn&#x27;t affected my skin in a negative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my mom has dry mature skin</li>
            <li> Was surprised at how thick the cloths were and how much product was on them!</li>
            <li> In other words, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These are so relaxing after a long day at work,and if you put them in the fridge,it really cools you down.</li>
            <li> Normally, it takes me 48 hours for the redness and inflammation to go down after needling, but I leave the mask on for about an hour</li>
            <li> These I take off and ten minutes later I feel dry.</li>
            <li> I plan to use a mask on my next long flight to keep skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend taking a bath where you don&#x27;t have to see or talk because the masks are large and hard to do anything in.</li>
            <li> expensive products may have longer lasting effects, but this is economical enough to use it daily.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you  that there is no harm in doing something that makes your face feel soft, smells heavenly, costs about a buck a mask, and gives you a few minutes to pamper yourself.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I leave it on as long as possible,then rub in the leftovers.</li>
            <li> I massaged in the cream left sitting atop my face and down my neck/décolletage, then used the remaining mask (quite a bit left of the slippery stuff) on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> While this mask left my shin moisturizer I never noticed and other differance or long term effects.</li>
            <li> I never tried Korean masks before, but I&#x27;m definitely not buying any other countries&#x27; masks anymore, since they were all just a-okay.</li>
            <li> After removal, allow some time for the excess to dry.</li>
            <li> Whenever my skin is getting dry</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a single mask to try.</li>
            <li> Not sure if different &#x27;flavor&#x27; does anything differently.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> See my lengthy and detailed review of Essence Mask Combo No.2.  In summary,  these are very good products produced in Korea by people who have become the leaders in facial health and beauty in recent years. The masks are paper cutouts of a face, imbued with a large amount of ten different products in each combo pack.  But the purpose of each mask is not described on the packet, and some of the products used in the masks are not familiar to a Western user  --  mugwort, snail, ocher, for example.  They can be messy to use if you&#x27;re not lying down giving yourself over to the relaxing nature of the experience.  But they are very good for facial health and I do recommend them.  (Well, maybe I won&#x27;t use the snail or the mugwort.)</li>
            <li> I got hooked on the paper/cloth face masks after my step-mom got me the Sephora sample pack for my birthday, but $24 for 5 is a little steep for me. I have sensitive combination skin and these are great! My face and neck are definitely tightened up and well moisturized after using, and I haven&#x27;t had a reaction at all. Since it&#x27;s getting summery here I threw them in the fridge and it&#x27;s really refreshing after sweating all day.</li>
            <li> wonderful masks... quality product. Same treatment that you get at the salon for a lot less price!</li>
            <li> This package is a good combinations of various different kinds of masks. I alternate this mask with Collagen Mask every week. The latter is also a product of the same company. Works well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product.  Easy to use and feels great on my skin. No messy clean up afterwards.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Will order more very pleased</li>
            <li> It is convenient. Whenever you need to use it, you open the package and here you go -- you have your face pampered. The reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is that I don&#x27;t know if the ingredients are safe.</li>
            <li> Great price abd fast shipping</li>
            <li> Good masks for a good price!</li>
            <li> Love this affordable product!!</li>
            <li> I breakout. In other words, I have very sensitive skin. So I have to make sure to use a natural product or product that was made with good ingredients.   This masks made me breakout even more. I am hating it. This just tells me that this product is made with cheap ingredients.   Will never purchase it or recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Made and packed overseas. Instructions in broken English</li>
            <li> I bought these due to friend&#x27;s suggestion. She was raving about her trip to California and sheet masks she got there. I decided to get these since I don&#x27;t have access to Asian markets in my state. These masks are very moisturizing, I have never tried anything like it. I have oily combination skin and my mom has dry mature skin and we both saw magnificent results after using these. I will be repurchasing again.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped swiftly to my mother as a gift.  Since she received it she has been using one packet a night and simply loves them.  She says they make her skin feel like it has had a spa treatment.  For the price this is more then worth it.</li>
            <li> I experienced dry skin and some blemishes due to my late sleeping habit and fastfood diet, so I decided to try this on at night when I go to bed. They smell so good. It feels refreshing when you have the mask on. After removal, allow some time for the excess to dry. After that, you feel that super smooth baby skin on your face, less the oily feelings like those from face lotion &amp; moisturizers. You would benefit mostly from it, if you do it in the morning, and carry that glow with you for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meanwhile, it&#x27;s only getting 4-stars from me because I don&#x27;t see it as a long-term treatment. When you have it on, great. When you wash it off, it&#x27;s gone and your face goes back to how it is (maybe a little better).</li>
            <li> We received the same type on the face masks. And we ordered diff types. Ive been intending to write you and Now i received a feedback email. How can we solve this? Important note. Quality of thr facial mask was good.</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto, llegó sin problemas y en las condiciones en las que el vendedor indicó, gracias lo recomiendo 100%</li>
            <li> I really like these masks. I&#x27;ve used six of them so far in two weeks, and my face feels a lot more moisturized. They are also designed to moisturize the eye part, which a lot of the masks don&#x27;t have. The cloth does feel a lil sicker than most of the other ones I have used, but that hasn&#x27;t affected my skin in a negative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the downsides is that the kinds of masks are randomly selected each time. I have bought two batches so far, and unfortunately I&#x27;m allergic to one of them (I didn&#x27;t try it on, I know that I&#x27;m allergic to propolis, which is one of the ingredients in one of the masks).</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product! I absolutely love these sheet masks! They&#x27;re great during the winter time when my skin is extra dry from the weather.  I enjoy using the huge variety in this package for different skin care concerns based on the time of year. I use one a few times a week in the middle of my skin care routine. I like to sit in bed with one of these on with some herbal tea and just read a little bit. I feel it&#x27;s a nice way to pamper myself and have a bit of me time. These are very hydrating and feel good on. My husband and kids think i look a bit silly with them on though! I do find that these help hydrate the skin very well, and my face always feels soft and looks glowy the next day after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case you didn&#x27;t know, when you use these, you&#x27;re not supposed to wash the serums off after you&#x27;ve used them. You want to rub or pat the rest of the product into your skin like you would a thick serum or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> These are great for anyone with dry skin; they moisturize really well and leave your skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is my second order.  I love the paper masks, eliminates the mess</li>
            <li> These face masks are everything. So refreshing and hydrating. I use one or two a week and my skin feels nourished.</li>
            <li> I am a fanatic when it comes to facial products.  I often put together my own combination of ingredients for a homemade mask.  But these are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masks are huge to accomodate anyone, especially men.  They are saturated with product but not to where it is dripping all over the place.  I&#x27;ve only tried 4 of them so far but I can tell you that I&#x27;ve had no irriation or allergic reactions and they all smell divine.  I can&#x27;t say that they&#x27;re gonna improve your skin 100% just by putting them on, but I can tell you  that there is no harm in doing something that makes your face feel soft, smells heavenly, costs about a buck a mask, and gives you a few minutes to pamper yourself. Positives all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that Amazon would consider a subscription program for this product because I would jump at the chance to have these automatically sent to me every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> These masks are so hydrating. Whenever my skin is getting dry I just put one of these on for 10-20 minutes and it immediately looks better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but my skin felt so soft and hydrated afterward! It&#x27;s cooling on the skin and the effects don&#x27;t go away even overnight. The shipping was very fast and was in a secure package. There is a wide variety of types of masks you receive. Also, you&#x27;re able to do other things while this mask is on, or you could just relax! I will definitely be buying these again once I run out. They are AMAZING</li>
            <li> Fun to try, but I could tell no real difference in my skin between the different types. And to be honest, my skin was no different after the masks in general.</li>
            <li> So far I have used to the EGF and the Herb. The shipping was timely and the mask it self is of a better quality cloth then a lot of the other ones I have used. It did not rip or tare. The price was excellent for the quality. I look forward to buying this again and hope in the future I can buy sets of the ones I like best. The EGF one was amazing, my skin remained looking better for about 72 hrs after using it.</li>
            <li> not so impressive..Smells good, though... After peeling it off, feels very oily on the face...I never used other mask before, so not sure if it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I use masks often and find most brands to be expensive. I purchase mine online and at ulta and I must say these are just as effective and fit way better than most masks.</li>
            <li> Cool product, you can see a difference in your skin right after aplying the mask!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE these masks. They each made my skin feel soft and replenished. They were fun to try out at the group party I took them to. Everyone asked where I got them from and said they too would be purchasing them. Will buy these again.</li>
            <li> I think it is a little heavy and I cannot absorb the nutrition from the masks. I feel disappointed with Korean skin care products.</li>
            <li> These masks are okay. Nothing inherently wrong with them. No breakouts. I feel like other brands leave my face a bit more moisturized than these do though. Other brands I take the mask off and my face feels supple and moist. These I take off and ten minutes later I feel dry.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing! It&#x27;s only about $1 a mask and I think it works better than some mask that cost $15!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use and freak out you&#x27;re boyfriend by looking like a serial killer. I like to say \\&quot;it puts the lotion on the skin while looking at him through the eye slits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend taking a bath where you don&#x27;t have to see or talk because the masks are large and hard to do anything in. It seems to be making my skin feel moisturized. But because of the creepy look and bad fit I probably won&#x27;t buy anymore. I like the gel or mud masks better.</li>
            <li> These masks are amazing, you can really feel the difference on your face. Your face feels nice and soft. And their inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Not all of them have the right moisture for skin, but some of them are good for dry skin, beside the honey one gave my a rash.</li>
            <li> Excelent product!!! they are great and are very refreshing! 100% recommended.&lt;br /&gt;My face changed a lot! I really loved them</li>
            <li> good mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i shared it with my co-workers.all of us very like it.</li>
            <li> Very, very impressed! These masks did WONDERS for my skin! I never tried Korean masks before, but I&#x27;m definitely not buying any other countries&#x27; masks anymore, since they were all just a-okay. What&#x27;s especially game-changing is the effect your skin will feel for days afterwards: hydrated, no blackheads, and brighter. Granted, I do exfoliate my skin daily using the Korean scrub cloths, which I also bought on Amazon; so, exfoliating is an integral part of the regimen of keeping my skin looking radiant and fresh, day-in and day-out. My friends and strangers have been complimenting me on my complexion a lot since I&#x27;ve started to use Korean skincare products exclusively so, I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s not just me who sees the change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend leaving the mask on the face for 20 full minutes, then working in the solution into the skin with fingers in mini-circular motion until most of it is absorbed. No rinsing necessary. Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I tried the collagen version last night. It frightened my husband, so the entertainment value is high. My skin is really soft today, so it works as advertised. Great skin pick-me up for the price. I only wish it covered more of my skin next to my nose, which is narrow, so I&#x27;ll have to re-position the next one. I plan to use a mask on my next long flight to keep skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> I bought the mask for the second time, and I love the smooth feeling after applied it. Love these masks</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and it was great. I was very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to someone else!</li>
            <li> I prefer mud masks ...  thought I would try this... just too awkward to use for me... kinda slimy too lol</li>
            <li> I love it. Feel good after use.</li>
            <li> Got this in Japan from a Korean sales guy at the mall. It&#x27;s like most of the facial moisturizing masks. Love the way it makes your skin feel afterwards.  I try to sleep with it on my face or eyes overnight. Whenever my skin starts looking worn or wrinkly, I use this. I need to start using it every night though. My skin has never been that bad, but I feel like this would benefit damaged skin a lot. Especially dry, worn skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t know why asian back scrubs aren&#x27;t popular in America. As well as, not frying your skin in the sun. lol&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/s/ref&#x3D;nb_sb_noss_2?url&#x3D;search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords&#x3D;japanese+back+scrub</li>
            <li> Great. happy with product and service.</li>
            <li> ok, i don&#x27;t really write reviews but omg this is something to RANT about! when i ordered this i was expecting what was in teh description, one of each of the items but instead i got a RANDOM mix of different masks. i was really hoping to try the aloe,pearl, and like 4 others.&lt;br /&gt;on the bright side the masks works in moisturizing your face, but they leave a sticky residue in which you have to wash your face again which defeats the purpose of even putting it on in the first place. Well you don&#x27;t have to wash your face unless you like the sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister for Christmas.  Luckily she has been to Japan, so she was familiar with the type of masks these are.  I wouldn&#x27;t get them for someone who is unfamiliar with products from other countries.  I am not sure she will try the Snail one...</li>
            <li> perfect for a quick spa day</li>
            <li> I used only several masks but I like it! This is refresh and relax  feelings.</li>
            <li> GREAT,I love  these masks, deep moisture with each one</li>
            <li> i have combo/sensitive skin and i wanted 2 find great hydration for my skin so i&lt;br /&gt;decided to try this out and i used it once a week even though i don&#x27;t see results&lt;br /&gt;but the hydration is really incredible i fell in love with it. i understand pictures better&lt;br /&gt;than words, i added this part of my skin care routine and all i&#x27;m using 4 my skin is&lt;br /&gt;washing my face with water and hydrating moisturizier cream that is it. i really love&lt;br /&gt;these mask combos</li>
            <li> works great. I feel the difference after I take off the mask. I usually leave it on for 30-45 minutes. But the results are short-lived, just as many facial treatments are.</li>
            <li> Love all of these mask!! Will order more soon!!! S</li>
            <li> Still going through them to see which I like best. So far the 4 I&#x27;ve tried feels the same. First, the mask is very big,which I love! I guess I have a huge face. I love the coverage, it goes down my chin too. I put it on after I wash my face,it moisturizes well. I leave it on as long as possible,then rub in the leftovers. These are so relaxing after a long day at work,and if you put them in the fridge,it really cools you down. No miracles,but you can&#x27;t beat the price. And it arrived so fast! I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Was surprised at how thick the cloths were and how much product was on them! This was my first time trying the wet masks. I&#x27;ve always been a Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque person. Now that I&#x27;m going into my 40s that mask is over drying for me. Went on an amazon binge to try many different wet masks from different companies as I could find, but I know these are a product I will buy again, and the seller was reliable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought these to use with them to keep my hair non gooey: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ISBU0WG/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> mask paper is way too thick.</li>
            <li> did a good job refreshing my face</li>
            <li> This is my second time to buy this staff....really made me feel fresh and comfortable when after using this one~~I recommened it~~!!</li>
            <li> made a great spa night for the girls</li>
            <li> These masks are nice. They come in one size, so be prepared if it doesn&#x27;t fit your face quite right. It works for me and seems like a good product. I bought the other versions too and they&#x27;re very fun to use, especially with friends or family. It feels very slimy, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> This broke out my face but I just loved the feeling of this on.  Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I liked the variety.&lt;br /&gt;This way you can try which one you like and then buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> The mask is very thick. Serum cannot be easily absorbed and stays on top of the face. When I wash my face, serum goes away.&lt;br /&gt;And, there is no significant improvement after use.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good things about and I have to agree with them. I love these but the only problem is is that they take literally forever to dry. Other than that i am so happy with the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Buy these for my wife who has used them before and likes them. Price is very fair in comparison to others.</li>
            <li> good deal but okay quality</li>
            <li> Not bad, especially for the quality. I found that these aren&#x27;t as absorbent as &amp;#34;my beauty diary&amp;#34; masks, but the range of fun options makes this a great purchase when you just want to have some cool masks that you probably wouldn&#x27;t normally stock. Reasonably moisturizing and luxurious!</li>
            <li> good skin care product, recommend</li>
            <li> While this mask left my shin moisturizer I never noticed and other differance or long term effects.</li>
            <li> They all smell pretty much the same but they are exactly what I was looking for. Makes you feel clean and refreshed. They look really funny on, Lol!</li>
            <li> I have been using this a coupe of times already. It makes your face vibrant. I love that the package has different combinations.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask for my wife, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way these masks fit my face. I&#x27;ve tried other types before, but these ones conform better, and the moisturizing treatment, though it feels a little &#x27;slimy&#x27;, does an excellent job moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using them twice a week.  It moisturizes skin and leaves skin smooth and tight.  I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> really nice mask. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;23mg of the essence oil. my face feels like silk after i use this mask.</li>
            <li> Not bad, I guess. The masks are incredibly big, on my face though... And to tell the truth, I haven&#x27;t thought about them in MONTHS, till just now, as I am checking out my Amazon account. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again. This is coming from someone who is a penny pincher, so I don&#x27;t just buy tons of crap and forget about it. This product just didn&#x27;t impress me.</li>
            <li> I bought these from Toktok and received a few different types than listed here, though none were duplicates. If you have your heart set on the exact ones listed, just be aware of this from that seller (I was really pleased with their service and prices, especially since they ship from MD and use 2-day priority mail! And they were still cheaper than the ones direct from Korea.). I started using this brand of mask after micro needling my skin in order to get product to penetrate, as well as to soothe my skin. I keep the EGF one in the fridge before needling my face and then apply it afterwards and the cold, plus the wonderful ingredients, soothe my skin so much! Normally, it takes me 48 hours for the redness and inflammation to go down after needling, but I leave the mask on for about an hour and when I remove it, my skin is so much better! So far, of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, none have had hardly any smell to them which is important to me since I am so sensitive to smells (and tons of other stuff). If I find any to smell strongly, or terribly, I will edit this to let you know which one(s). Also, I found using a silicone mask over these sheet masks helps me keep them on longer and I can then also use my ice roller on top for more soothing coolness! https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GN2BYY0  With the combo of a fridge-cooled mask, the silicone over top and using the ice roller over that, I find I can micro needle my skin and look largely recovered from it within an hour or two. Contrast that with the 48 hours it normally takes me to have the burning redness recede!</li>
            <li> I was a little weary at first because I had never heard of or used this brand, but they are great.  They are just as good as the other masks I have tried (I&#x27;ve tried a lot,) and the price is great.  I doubt you will find the same number of masks with similar quality at this price.  I love these masks.  My skin feels so great after each use.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> It is very good.I will buy again.</li>
            <li> waste of money. doesn&#x27; work at all</li>
            <li> These are my secret weapon for tired days!</li>
            <li> It made the skin felt softer and supple. Overall a nice addition to the daily routine in facial care. A must have for women.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of different scent. Not sure if different &#x27;flavor&#x27; does anything differently. The product is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;More expensive products may have longer lasting effects, but this is economical enough to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking great and reduces the size of my pores.  When the mask is done, I use it on my neck afterward.  Very good value.</li>
            <li> I used half of them so far and love how moist they make my face feel afterwards. I have eczema on my cheeks and when I use these mask it really helps my skin stay moist especially with the winter winds coming soon. Will totally buy more after I finish using them. They also sent me an extra one &#x3D;] It&#x27;s a good price!</li>
            <li> My first set of face masks and these are fantastic! My skin feels so good afterwards! I highly recommend warming it up before usage while still inside the package (either in the bath or under running hot water). It feels much better when it&#x27;s warm than a cold wet cloth hitting your skin.</li>
            <li> I buy these for the wife occasionally, and she really likes them. She claims that her face is softer and smoother; doesn&#x27;t seem to be any softer or smoother to me than before she used them, but she&#x27;s happy so i&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great item at a great cost with fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My second set. a mast for traveling, very juicy, so use first on your neck.</li>
            <li> I really love these masks.  They are very soothing and invigorating.  My skins always feels soft after using them.</li>
            <li> This is the best on days when my skin feels really dry. I keep this on for almost an hour and then use it on my neck and hands. Then I let it dry for 5 minutes then apply Nature Republic&#x27;s Super Aqua Max Watery Cream. My skin is so soft !</li>
            <li> Love this masks!!it does wonders!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using these on a regular basis. They work and your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> thats is my choise for my clients ,very god quality ,lovely soft product ,recomended!&lt;br /&gt;esta es  i eleccion para mis clientes ,muy buena calidas ,es adorable suevecita y tiene abundante mascarillas .RECOMENDADA .</li>
            <li> Different than what I am used to, but makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> they are ok!, But very cheap, huge pads, compare the ones my friend brought me from Korea, they are so cheap.  However, good price, don&#x27;t expect too much</li>
            <li> i like it very much . i will buy  again when i need it</li>
            <li> i have been using three of them, i like them!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after i put mask and put some moisture cream, the next day, my skin looks more vivid^^</li>
            <li> Sort of nice self-pampering at home treatment but these items aren&#x27;t really true masks, in my opinion, as the benefit is simply a pretty heavy residue of cream left sitting on top after removing the cloth mask. Didn&#x27;t see any real toning effects, which was what I sought in this product. I massaged in the cream left sitting atop my face and down my neck/décolletage, then used the remaining mask (quite a bit left of the slippery stuff) on my hands and feet. I&#x27;ve used two so far and don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any real benefits but since I keep my skin regularly moisturized, these simply aren&#x27;t products for me. Perhaps these are better suited for people subjected to harsher weather conditions.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mask! The skin is hydrated and luminous !</li>
            <li> I have used a few and I am pleased it them, I am not thrilled, but Ido feel it is product for the money, as I said i have not sued them all yet</li>
            <li> There are so many choices to pick from and I cannot wait to try all of them out over the weeks!!!!</li>
            <li> Use it! It will not turn the clock back, but make you feel good.&lt;br /&gt;And beside the jokes, your face really looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to be so wet and liquid like once I opened it. It made a dripping mess in my room. Mianhae~</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK. There are lots of other better sheet masks on amazon . Maybe the price is a little bit higher but the quality is much better.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a single mask to try. As soon as I tried it I knew I had to have more.  I truly enjoy the application relax time plus the benefit of moisture is unmistakeable. After I have allowed my face to soak I use the leftover moisture on the mask to moisturize my arms and legs. The ingredients seem so gentle that I think this product would be appropriate for all skin types.</li>
            <li> These are the first sheet masks I have ever used. I want hundreds more. I love them. I want to marry them. Protip: there is enough product left after you use them on your face to use on your entire body. Treat yoself.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a nice set of face masks.  They would be handy if you want to have a spa day with friends, or just to keep on hand for personal use.  Most of the information on the packets is in Korean, so you may not be able to sort out the ingredients, if that is a concern to you.  All in all, they are easy to use and are a good buy for the price.</li>
