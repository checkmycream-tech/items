    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and the fact that I can now have it delivered to my house!  </li>
            <li>it has help me maintain my hair excellent product</li>
            <li>The package was delivered on time and the price was very good.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Great price, works well.</li>
            <li>What a great deal.</li>
            <li>They stopped supplying the 2% which worked great.  </li>
            <li>This is much more affordable and a great buy.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and I am still uncertain about its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Kirkland is a much better price than the name brand product and cheaper by $10.</li>
            <li>This was delivered very very quickly which was a plus.  </li>
            <li>Cant notice any difference between this and actual Rogaine except the amazing price!</li>
            <li>This is exactly how it should work being free shipping or not (this is how it used to work with Amazon&#x27;s free shipping for orders over 25 dollars</li>
            <li>However, I am not sure whether Minoxidil is very effective.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it twice regularly</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my heart started racing and it scared me.</li>
            <li>The next day it was better.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that it comes with a dropper whereas I prefer a spray top.</li>
            <li>This increase works as well, yet the extra percentage is not needed; a sales gimmick which puts more chemicals on our heads.</li>
            <li>The trick is to be consistent in your application and don&#x27;t use any cheapo shampoos.</li>
            <li>Kirkland is a leader in making generic minoxidil and has been around and tested for many years.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>, I have a great feeling about this product tho, I use Rogaine before an it works very well but to expensive to keep up those prices , will see what happens 2 months from now.</li>
            <li>but I do have high blood pressure.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Minoxidil is highly toxic to cats, and may cause death with just inadvertent skin contact.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>It has certainly improved my hair considerably.</li>
            <li>They both work great, but this stuff is less than half the cost.</li>
            <li>this is exactly the same stuff.  </li>
            <li>Well I just got the Product 2 1/2 week&#x27;s ago so far No Results yet but will see 2 Months from now</li>
            <li>Does it work, absolutely, but it is a daily thing, just like washing your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so inexpensive from AMAZON compared to other places , I believe its better to be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, but i wish it didn&#x27;t dry my hair and make it itch a little bit.</li>
            <li>according to the directions of use, it is specific only to certain area of the scalp and cannot apply it to all the scalp</li>

            <li> my age are showing pretty badly, I&#x27;ve been doing this routine for over ten years and at age 52 I still have about 90% of my original growth.</li>

            <li> I usually made the trip once or twice a year to the US to pick up a supply.  </li>
            <li> The thing is, I put mine in a small spray bottle and spray it on every morning, so I go through the &amp;#34;six month&amp;#34; pack in about 6 weeks..</li>
            <li> It works very slow, but it does work.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive in Canada and the &#x27;no-name&#x27; brands are not available here.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Make sure you use it twice regularly and I would recommend using it with hair roller (dermaroller or other brand will do). The roller helps absorb 98% of the solution you put in.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for longer than I can remember. I can&#x27;t tell if its working or not. If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say it isn&#x27;t. I am still losing hair in the areas that I apply this and it doesn&#x27;t look like I am experiencing any regrowth. I keep using it because I am concerned that if I stop, my hair loss might accelerate.  Who knows. It&#x27;s so inexpensive from AMAZON compared to other places , I believe its better to be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> Great price, works well.</li>
            <li> Not sure if minoxidil works.</li>
            <li> according to the directions of use, it is specific only to certain area of the scalp and cannot apply it to all the scalp</li>
            <li> So expensive for the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; SAME product- this is exactly the same stuff.  This is much more affordable and a great buy.</li>
            <li> Well I just got the Product 2 1/2 week&#x27;s ago so far No Results yet but will see 2 Months from now, I have a great feeling about this product tho, I use Rogaine before an it works very well but to expensive to keep up those prices , will see what happens 2 months from now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend big money on the name brand stuff.  I&#x27;ve used both.  They both work great, but this stuff is less than half the cost.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered on time and the price was very good. However, I am not sure whether Minoxidil is very effective. I have used this product for many years and I am still uncertain about its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The product is as described and my batch expires 01/2015.  I ordered this on Aug 22, 2013 (Thursday) and on Aug 26, 2013 (Monday) I had it in my hands using USPS.  This is exactly how it should work being free shipping or not (this is how it used to work with Amazon&#x27;s free shipping for orders over 25 dollars but it no longer does for any order I have used it with this year).</li>
            <li> I was watching a TV program and it was stated that women could use this product also. I only use it once a day. The first time I used it my heart started racing and it scared me. That is why I only use it once a day. The next day it was better. I think a person with medical condition should be careful. I do not have cardiac problems but I do have high blood pressure. I am a nurse so I monitored my blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair had thinned at the crown so I guess I was determined. It works very slow, but it does work. I can really tell the difference. I actually have hair in my thin spots. I also do not have any side effects.</li>
            <li> I was using Rogaine and thought this is the better or the same, but I was wrong. I have seen no improvement. I still have two cases left, but stopped using it anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been using Minoxidil for several years.  It is very expensive in Canada and the &#x27;no-name&#x27; brands are not available here.  I usually made the trip once or twice a year to the US to pick up a supply.  I am very happy with this product and the fact that I can now have it delivered to my house!  It works as well as the &#x27;name brand&#x27; one.  What a great deal.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Low price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that it comes with a dropper whereas I prefer a spray top. Fixed that by going to Walgreens and buying a small spray bottle to apply it too my head. Does it work, absolutely, but it is a daily thing, just like washing your face. Kirkland is a much better price than the name brand product and cheaper by $10. Oh the vanity of men. Refusing to age gracefully, what&#x27;s next for me; shaving my chest hair? I hear tell that some men are doing that now.</li>
            <li> Is worthed for the low price of the pack.I bought the 6 bottle pack. The product mantains the amount of hair you have. Does what you are expecting for, though leaves flakes in your skin when it&#x27;s dry. That is something the laboratories should work on.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but i wish it didn&#x27;t dry my hair and make it itch a little bit.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Minoxidil is highly toxic to cats, and may cause death with just inadvertent skin contact.&amp;#34;  There are two sources to back it up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for years and had no problems the price cannot be beat it has help me maintain my hair excellent product</li>
            <li> They stopped supplying the 2% which worked great.  This increase works as well, yet the extra percentage is not needed; a sales gimmick which puts more chemicals on our heads.</li>
            <li> There are basically two big labs, one in Baltimore and one in Canada that make generic Minoxidil and resell it under various labels. It doesn&#x27;t matter which one you get, I like Kirkland and the fact that I can get a six month supply for around $27. The thing is, I put mine in a small spray bottle and spray it on every morning, so I go through the &amp;#34;six month&amp;#34; pack in about 6 weeks.. the proof is in the pudding, all of my friends my age are showing pretty badly, I&#x27;ve been doing this routine for over ten years and at age 52 I still have about 90% of my original growth. The trick is to be consistent in your application and don&#x27;t use any cheapo shampoos. You don&#x27;t have to use &amp;#34;salon variety&amp;#34; shampoos, just not the cheapest thing and I&#x27;d especially recommend any formulation made for thinning hair. I like Jason Naturals or Biotanica or even Progaine for shampoo. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female and have been using the %5 for years. Cant notice any difference between this and actual Rogaine except the amazing price!</li>
            <li> Kirkland is a leader in making generic minoxidil and has been around and tested for many years.  This was delivered very very quickly which was a plus.  I would recommend this to any male who has thinning hair or bald spots.  It has certainly improved my hair considerably.</li>
            <li> Acceptable, could be lower price</li>
