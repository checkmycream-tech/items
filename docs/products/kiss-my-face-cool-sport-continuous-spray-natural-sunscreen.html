            <li>Sprays on easily, held up well.  </li>
            <li>However, it goes very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>this product has great smell, it is very easy to dry, not like sun cream.</li>
            <li>and it is  light, easy to take .</li>
            <li>Protects your skin, easy to put on, the bottle doesn&#x27;t leak, and it smells freaking fantastic.</li>
            <li>To get more use out of it, apply in calm conditions or indoors.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a sunscreen with fewer chemicals and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Plus this stuff smells so good and makes my skin feel soft, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Goes on clean.</li>
            <li>Does it cool your application spot when you spray it?</li>
            <li>Sprayer clogged immediately, but seller gave full refund.</li>
            <li>Cool and works</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s non greasy and it drys quick do your dressed and out the door fast.</li>
            <li>Smells great and not overpoweringly so like some other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Can only tell by the nice light tropical smell.</li>
            <li>This is much better than the older style pump spray bottle.</li>
            <li>but it gets very hot in KY in the summers.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is good, light and not greasy  like a lot of other spray suncream.</li>
            <li>Putting sunscreen on large parts of your body is so fast and easy with spray sunscreen!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and very cooling.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I really did enjoy using this spray on sun block.</li>
            <li>Good sunblock for reapplying while at the pool or beach and already being wet.</li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen so far</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wanted a more natural sunscreen and purchased this (as well as a couple others to compare).  </li>
            <li>The spray is easy to use - especially great for hard to reach spots like your back.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, not messy or greasy.</li>
            <li>This product we trust and the application process is easy and not messy.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and love that it&#x27;s natural and free from harmful chemicals found in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>The only problem with these spray applicators is that most of it is lost to the wind.  </li>
            <li>I try to get into the pool daily &amp; don&#x27;t want any more color , this has worked for me ....</li>
            <li>so I did not have to worry too much about reapplying!</li>
            <li>Although I received this product for free to test and review as a True Kisser, I am not promoting this as a personal gain.</li>
            <li>, I felt as if it stayed on pretty well.</li>
            <li>Love this and definitely will buy again!  </li>
            <li>Just returned from vacation and tried this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Kiss my Face is a brand I trust and they have not failed me in the sunscreen department.</li>
            <li>I am a reluctant sunscreen user, and the spray makes it 100% more likely that I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li>in all I love this product and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>This is the first spray sunblock I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>So easy to use, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my skin, and definitely protected me from the sun!</li>
            <li>(I used hands to rub it in certain spots).</li>
            <li>It should be noted too that I have dry skin and live in Hawaii where the sun is very strong.</li>
            <li>It is so fast and easy to apply, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>My daughter wants this product for her camp in june</li>
            <li>and it goes on sweaty skin so much easier than some others I have tried.</li>
            <li>It works really well and is long-lasting</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very transportable.</li>
            <li>I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work very well and after using it this summer</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally burn at all and have gotten a pretty tan using this.</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate that it&#x27;s an air powered delivery system and doesn&#x27;t use chemical propellants.</li>
            <li>Very sticky too.</li>
            <li>Goes on light with no residue or white sheen.</li>
            <li>Goes on fast, dries fast, unobtrusive odor, seems to prevent tanning/burning.</li>
            <li>It is rated a 3 on Skin Deep, which is important.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands&#x27; spray sunscreens before, and this worked just as well as those - thrilled to see a version from a natural brand I like and trust.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and consistently.  </li>
            <li>My kids haven&#x27;t burned once and my husband who normally gets a very burnt neck and ears, hasn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product,and seller.</li>
            <li>Just left a light sheen on my skin and a feeling similar to most other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Not as light as I expected, a little more oily for me</li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen for less harmful chemicals and how it feels and works!</li>
            <li>I got this randomly, but ended up loving it, but now i am a loyal customer</li>
            <li>The sport lines seem to work better on wet skin and is the specific reason I buy them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a typical coconut-y sunscreen smell, but it&#x27;s not overly strong.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time several weeks ago in Florida.  </li>
            <li>However, I took this to a water park over the weekend and still got burned (not bad, but I&#x27;m certainly pink).</li>
            <li>Stinks.... I sprayed on my hand, smells like gasoline once you put it, very strong odor, unless you care about scent feel free to use...</li>
            <li>so make sure you spray it outside only; it contains alcohol, so spraying on sensitive skin, like recently shaved legs, can sting a</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product because it is the least chemically infused spray sunscreen that I could find for times that zinc oxide based lotions are cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>With a spray you do lose some of the product if you don&#x27;t direct it.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to lotions and sunblock.</li>
            <li>No nasty scent, smells a bit like subtle coconut.</li>
            <li>This might be because I didn&#x27;t apply it enough or as often as necessary, but I suspect that it isn&#x27;t very waterproof.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare to any other spray as this is my first time using an sph spray.</li>
            <li>Caused MAJOR acne all over the sides of my face where I sprayed and I never have an acne problem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t go into the water after using this, I can&#x27;t say how well it lasted but staying in the hot sun for a few hours</li>
            <li>The design is to make half of the spray goes into the air and the whole bottle was used up before our 2 weeks&#x27; holiday ends -</li>
            <li>I love this, though my only complaint is I wish the bottle was a little larger.</li>

            <li> To get more use out of it, apply in calm conditions or indoors.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunscreen with fewer chemicals and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> It smells good and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Plus this stuff smells so good and makes my skin feel soft, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Goes on clean.</li>
            <li> Does it cool your application spot when you spray it?</li>
            <li> Sprayer clogged immediately, but seller gave full refund.</li>
            <li> Cool and works</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s non greasy and it drys quick do your dressed and out the door fast.</li>
            <li> Smells great and not overpoweringly so like some other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Can only tell by the nice light tropical smell.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the older style pump spray bottle.</li>
            <li> but it gets very hot in KY in the summers.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is good, light and not greasy  like a lot of other spray suncream.</li>
            <li> Putting sunscreen on large parts of your body is so fast and easy with spray sunscreen!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and very cooling.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I really did enjoy using this spray on sun block.</li>
            <li> Good sunblock for reapplying while at the pool or beach and already being wet.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen so far</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wanted a more natural sunscreen and purchased this (as well as a couple others to compare).  </li>
            <li> The spray is easy to use - especially great for hard to reach spots like your back.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, not messy or greasy.</li>
            <li> This product we trust and the application process is easy and not messy.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and love that it&#x27;s natural and free from harmful chemicals found in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> The only problem with these spray applicators is that most of it is lost to the wind.  </li>
            <li> I try to get into the pool daily &amp; don&#x27;t want any more color , this has worked for me ....</li>
            <li> so I did not have to worry too much about reapplying!</li>
            <li> Although I received this product for free to test and review as a True Kisser, I am not promoting this as a personal gain.</li>
            <li> , I felt as if it stayed on pretty well.</li>
            <li> Love this and definitely will buy again!  </li>
            <li> Just returned from vacation and tried this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Kiss my Face is a brand I trust and they have not failed me in the sunscreen department.</li>
            <li> I am a reluctant sunscreen user, and the spray makes it 100% more likely that I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li> in all I love this product and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is the first spray sunblock I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> So easy to use, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my skin, and definitely protected me from the sun!</li>
            <li> (I used hands to rub it in certain spots).</li>
            <li> It should be noted too that I have dry skin and live in Hawaii where the sun is very strong.</li>
            <li> It is so fast and easy to apply, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My daughter wants this product for her camp in june</li>
            <li> and it goes on sweaty skin so much easier than some others I have tried.</li>
            <li> It works really well and is long-lasting</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very transportable.</li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work very well and after using it this summer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally burn at all and have gotten a pretty tan using this.</li>
            <li> I also really appreciate that it&#x27;s an air powered delivery system and doesn&#x27;t use chemical propellants.</li>
            <li> Very sticky too.</li>
            <li> Goes on light with no residue or white sheen.</li>
            <li> Goes on fast, dries fast, unobtrusive odor, seems to prevent tanning/burning.</li>
            <li> It is rated a 3 on Skin Deep, which is important.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands&#x27; spray sunscreens before, and this worked just as well as those - thrilled to see a version from a natural brand I like and trust.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and consistently.  </li>
            <li> My kids haven&#x27;t burned once and my husband who normally gets a very burnt neck and ears, hasn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product,and seller.</li>
            <li> Just left a light sheen on my skin and a feeling similar to most other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Not as light as I expected, a little more oily for me</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen for less harmful chemicals and how it feels and works!</li>
            <li> I got this randomly, but ended up loving it, but now i am a loyal customer</li>
            <li> The sport lines seem to work better on wet skin and is the specific reason I buy them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a typical coconut-y sunscreen smell, but it&#x27;s not overly strong.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time several weeks ago in Florida.  </li>
            <li> However, I took this to a water park over the weekend and still got burned (not bad, but I&#x27;m certainly pink).</li>
            <li> Stinks.... I sprayed on my hand, smells like gasoline once you put it, very strong odor, unless you care about scent feel free to use...</li>
            <li> so make sure you spray it outside only; it contains alcohol, so spraying on sensitive skin, like recently shaved legs, can sting a</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product because it is the least chemically infused spray sunscreen that I could find for times that zinc oxide based lotions are cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> With a spray you do lose some of the product if you don&#x27;t direct it.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to lotions and sunblock.</li>
            <li> No nasty scent, smells a bit like subtle coconut.</li>
            <li> This might be because I didn&#x27;t apply it enough or as often as necessary, but I suspect that it isn&#x27;t very waterproof.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare to any other spray as this is my first time using an sph spray.</li>
            <li> Caused MAJOR acne all over the sides of my face where I sprayed and I never have an acne problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t go into the water after using this, I can&#x27;t say how well it lasted but staying in the hot sun for a few hours</li>
            <li> The design is to make half of the spray goes into the air and the whole bottle was used up before our 2 weeks&#x27; holiday ends -</li>
            <li> I love this, though my only complaint is I wish the bottle was a little larger.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling natural and not greasy like some other sunscreens</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about these spray sunscreens in general is that they seem to empty a lot faster than the lotion type.</li>
            <li> Only downside is the spray sunscreen doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the lotion.</li>
            <li> As such, I would not recommend this if you plan to go swimming for a long time.</li>
            <li> Our family has used the sports spray (pump) by the same brand due to contact allergies and sensory issues, and recently decided to give the continuous spray bottle a try.</li>
            <li> I reapply if out in the sun for a particularly long time.  </li>
            <li> comes on dry &amp; feels Dry ....</li>
            <li> Two slight drawback that might be obvious:</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if I got enough on as it is totally invisible.</li>
            <li> I wore this every day and the Florida summer sun, and did not get any pink.</li>
            <li> and I only reapplied after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I end up missing several spots, and got burned on those spots.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and clear and actually works without the terrible chemicals!</li>
            <li> No errant flying mists going all over the place as some other products might.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get red in the usual places (shoulders, arms, etc.)</li>
            <li> We are diligent about protecting our skin due to skin cancers which have been treated.  </li>
            <li> Another plus, didn&#x27;t feel sticky after putting it on like with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I used half the bottle, considering the price I paid for it, then threw it away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted a bit longer, my only complaint!</li>
            <li> Covers and protects without feeling too heavy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the fragrance and the product&#x27;s dispatcher broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> Smell is not strong</li>
            <li> I hate the greasy and hot feeling from other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> No more messy hands.</li>
            <li> Usually I prefer no fragrance.</li>
            <li> but my daughter complained on the way to summer day camp about this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a complaint about it, however my boyfriend used it and complained that it made him look &amp;</li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Not good value for money.</li>
            <li> I realize I was SO WRONG.</li>
            <li> maybe just a combination of ingredients, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to get off of your hands and skin</li>
            <li> Made my face break out really bad.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have all the bad chemicals that alot of sunscreens have.</li>
            <li> , TASTES BAD</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of nasty ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This done what it&#x27;s supposed to, protecting my skin from the sun, but it&#x27;s horribly greasy and disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does it cool your application spot when you spray it? My daughter wants this product for her camp in june but it gets very hot in KY in the summers.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Dries quickly. No greasy feeling. Also great for spraying top of the hair/head to prevent sunburn of the scalp.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  The only problem with these spray applicators is that most of it is lost to the wind.  To get more use out of it, apply in calm conditions or indoors.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used .... I try to get into the pool daily &amp; don&#x27;t want any more color , this has worked for me ....comes on dry &amp; feels Dry ....&lt;br /&gt;Plus it smells great ....</li>
            <li> I burn easily and this sunblock works great. Smells good and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived on time and in tact. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Made my face break out really bad.</li>
            <li> Love the coconut scent.Makes you feel like your at the beach even if you are 4 hrs from one. Great product!</li>
            <li> Good sunblock for reapplying while at the pool or beach and already being wet. The sport lines seem to work better on wet skin and is the specific reason I buy them. Pleasant smell and smooth spraying. Bonus feature is that the cap twists to lock, so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally spray in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use this one while playing tennis and it goes on sweaty skin so much easier than some others I have tried. Covers and protects without feeling too heavy.</li>
            <li> The quality of this sunscreen is impeccable yet it is reasonably priced! It works really well and is long-lasting so I did not have to worry too much about reapplying! If there is one way to judge a sunscreen, it would be based on how burnt you get while using it and I can say I did not get burnt in the slightest while using this sunscreen spray! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is ok. Not as light as I expected, a little more oily for me</li>
            <li> Amazingly Covered ! I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;Ginger&amp;#34; and this spray held up the test of cloud white skin and 90 degree TN summer heat ! I will buy again and recommended to all who love fun in the sun without a burn !</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling natural and not greasy like some other sunscreens</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Goes on clean. Very transportable. It also has no chemical propellants &#x3D; bonus!</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen for less harmful chemicals and how it feels and works! I wore this every day and the Florida summer sun, and did not get any pink. Plus it feels good. I hate the greasy and hot feeling from other sunscreens. For my face, I sprayed it on my hand and applied it that way and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, not messy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunscreen with fewer chemicals and this fit the bill. I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work very well and after using it this summer I realize I was SO WRONG. This stuff is great! My kids haven&#x27;t burned once and my husband who normally gets a very burnt neck and ears, hasn&#x27;t either. As a side bonus, it smells great. I don&#x27;t normally burn at all and have gotten a pretty tan using this. We spend a lot of time in the sun and this is by far the best sunscreen I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Although I received this product for free to test and review as a True Kisser, I am not promoting this as a personal gain. With that being said, I really did enjoy using this spray on sun block. The ease of using this product is spectacular and it goes on rather easily and smoothly. No errant flying mists going all over the place as some other products might.&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t go into the water after using this, I can&#x27;t say how well it lasted but staying in the hot sun for a few hours, I felt as if it stayed on pretty well.

            <li> I had to find something that didnt irritate my face this one does not</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! So easy to use, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my skin, and definitely protected me from the sun! Hasty Pudding loves this product!</li>
            <li> It works well, smells great, and is worth every penny!  I got this randomly, but ended up loving it, but now i am a loyal customer</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product because it is the least chemically infused spray sunscreen that I could find for times that zinc oxide based lotions are cumbersome.  EWG gave it good marks re: toxicity and kids, well, as good as you&#x27;re gonna get with sprays, so I will continue to use for that reason.  However, you &amp;#34;glisten&amp;#34; while wearning it and you smell like a pina colada. Which may be okay if you are at the pool but my daughter complained on the way to summer day camp about this and she did  &amp;#34;reak&amp;#34; of coconut from the backseat.  She did not however burn so I&#x27;ll still keep it for those emergency situations.</li>
            <li> The spray is easy to use - especially great for hard to reach spots like your back. It smells good and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. It gives my skin a nice healthy looking sheen. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Although we haven&#x27;t used this in the water we have used it while being outside at a park.  It is easy to use, smells pleasant &amp; covers well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product,works great,my wife swears by it now! Highly recommended product,and seller.</li>
            <li> No nasty scent, smells a bit like subtle coconut. Love it! Wish it lasted a bit longer, my only complaint! The only sunscreen I will buy!</li>
            <li> So far so good. The smell is nice and refreshing, and the product does not leave my skin feeling oily. You can twist the orange knob to lock or unlock to prevent accidental spraying. I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, goes on very easily easy to get thorough coverage, the scent is light not too overpowering and the protection lasts very long. I also really appreciate that it&#x27;s an air powered delivery system and doesn&#x27;t use chemical propellants.</li>
            <li> this product has great smell, it is very easy to dry, not like sun cream. and it is  light, easy to take .</li>
            <li> Our family has used the sports spray (pump) by the same brand due to contact allergies and sensory issues, and recently decided to give the continuous spray bottle a try. WE LOVE IT. It is so fast and easy to apply, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Seriously. Protects your skin, easy to put on, the bottle doesn&#x27;t leak, and it smells freaking fantastic. I wish it would get warmer here in Boston so I could use it (and smell it) again.</li>
            <li> There is a lot to like about this sunscreen. The ingredients are good. It is easy to apply (because it is a spray). It smells good. It feels great on your skin. Even the bottle looks interesting. However, I took this to a water park over the weekend and still got burned (not bad, but I&#x27;m certainly pink). This might be because I didn&#x27;t apply it enough or as often as necessary, but I suspect that it isn&#x27;t very waterproof. As such, I would not recommend this if you plan to go swimming for a long time. But for fishing, hiking, or sipping pina coladas on the beach this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this product locally anywhere.  I was looking for a spray-on and sweat resistant product. My daughter loves the coconut smell. I trust the Kiss My Face brand.  It doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of nasty ingredients.  Environmental Working Group rated #3.  Yes it is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock! Goes on easy and clear and actually works without the terrible chemicals!</li>
            <li> Works great and smells even better!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare to any other spray as this is my first time using an sph spray. I love how it&#x27;s non greasy and it drys quick do your dressed and out the door fast. The best is it having a coconut fragrance which I love. Usually I prefer no fragrance. It&#x27;s sph 50 which you know your protected from the suns harmful rays while being outside. Cooling effect on contact with aloe and cooling cucumber. Love!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. My grandkids can spray it on themselves and get good coverage.  Doesn&#x27;t have all the bad chemicals that alot of sunscreens have.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen for sports or just about anytime I&#x27;m in the sun.  I have pale skin and I&#x27;ve never burned using this product.  The coverage is great.  I prefer the pump to the aerosol, but that&#x27;s just a preference thing.  Smell is good and it lasts through a good sweat.  I reapply if out in the sun for a particularly long time.  The lid twists to lock, so you can pack it in your luggage.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Non greasy and easy application. Great sunscreen without all the harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen so far</li>
            <li> Love this and definitely will buy again!  Just returned from vacation and tried this for the first time.  Sprays on easily, held up well.  You definitely can tell you are wearing sunscreen.  If you don&#x27;t want to feel anything on your skin, this won&#x27;t be for you.  However, I liked knowing that I could I had something on and didn&#x27;t feel sticky.  Just left a light sheen on my skin and a feeling similar to most other sunscreens.  Happy to have found a great option without harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic and works great. I am allergic to, well almost everything, and I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation with this. Kiss my Face is a brand I trust and they have not failed me in the sunscreen department.</li>
            <li> Love this product, smell is great</li>
            <li> Seems good. Smell is not strong</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the fragrance and the product&#x27;s dispatcher broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic, has a wonderful coconut-y scent.  I&#x27;m also obsessive about toxic chemicals going into our bodies and into the environment so I feel better using Kiss My Face products.  I love this, though my only complaint is I wish the bottle was a little larger.</li>
            <li> This done what it&#x27;s supposed to, protecting my skin from the sun, but it&#x27;s horribly greasy and disgusting. I don&#x27;t know what it is, maybe just a combination of ingredients, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to get off of your hands and skin (I used hands to rub it in certain spots). The spray is nice, except that in the wind at the beach most of it blows away and misses the skin. I end up missing several spots, and got burned on those spots. Honestly I&#x27;d only use this for my back and use a lotion for the rest of my body.  Very sticky too. Leaves a film on clothes, and will stain anything cotton. I need to take a shower just thinking about having this on my skin again. I used half the bottle, considering the price I paid for it, then threw it away. It should be noted too that I have dry skin and live in Hawaii where the sun is very strong. I can&#x27;t imagine how this would feel on someone with a different skin type.</li>
            <li> I went to Bermuda for almost an entire week with this sunscreen and never got sunburned once. It was my pleasure to apply it. Such a wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful (like coconuts) and goes on so easy! No more messy hands. Protects well from sunburn.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunblock. Will buy again for sure.  Worked great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about these spray sunscreens in general is that they seem to empty a lot faster than the lotion type.</li>
            <li> Smells great and not overpoweringly so like some other sunscreens. Goes on light with no residue or white sheen. With a spray you do lose some of the product if you don&#x27;t direct it. Hard to tell if I got enough on as it is totally invisible. Can only tell by the nice light tropical smell.</li>
            <li> Goes on fast, dries fast, unobtrusive odor, seems to prevent tanning/burning.</li>
            <li> Caused MAJOR acne all over the sides of my face where I sprayed and I never have an acne problem.  It&#x27;s been months since I used it and I&#x27;m finally almost cleared up.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is fantastic! It is rated a 3 on Skin Deep, which is important. I have used it while swimming and otherwise, and have not gotten burned. Sprays on evenly and smells great. Awesome product I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> described as coconut smell, no... more like rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> Its my favorite sunscreen. It is quick and easy. If you are in a rush it can double up as a lotion and sun protectant.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is good, light and not greasy  like a lot of other spray suncream. However, it goes very quickly. The design is to make half of the spray goes into the air and the whole bottle was used up before our 2 weeks&#x27; holiday ends - my husband and I were using it, we have no children. Not good value for money.</li>
            <li> I am a reluctant sunscreen user, and the spray makes it 100% more likely that I&#x27;ll use it. I&#x27;ve used other brands&#x27; spray sunscreens before, and this worked just as well as those - thrilled to see a version from a natural brand I like and trust.</li>
            <li> Very good spray. It was easy to use and very cooling. Another plus, didn&#x27;t feel sticky after putting it on like with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING SUNSCREEN I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED&lt;br /&gt;FEELS GREAT, SMELLS GREAT, TASTES BAD BUT SUNSCREEN SHOULDN&#x27;T TASTE GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A SUNSCREEN</li>
            <li> This is much better than the older style pump spray bottle. Smells god too.</li>
            <li> This stuff could double as perfume... I mean... If you&#x27;re into that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted a more natural sunscreen and purchased this (as well as a couple others to compare).  This one shoots a nice fine mist and just smells amazing.  My husband and I put it on before going out for a day on the boat and it stood the test of time.  I didn&#x27;t have to reapply and was never burned.  Note - I was wearing a hat and didn&#x27;t ever fully submerge in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I love this product and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It goes on clear and consistently.  It seems to work well when I&#x27;ve been in the sun for a period of time.  The smell is light and pleasant without being overpowering.  I received it in a timely manner.  I will be ordering it again to take on my trip to Puerto Vallarta next month!</li>
            <li> Sprayer clogged immediately, but seller gave full refund.</li>
            <li> This is the first spray sunblock I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s so great! Plus this stuff smells so good and makes my skin feel soft, not greasy.  I wish it came in a higher SPF, but it&#x27;s still great!</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to lotions and sunblock. This one works well, smells good and does not make you feel sticky.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen.  I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t entirely harmful to my skin and body (a lot of sunscreens have harmful and kind of dangerous ingredients).  This one seemed like the lesser of some evils.  It seems to be a trade off with the more &amp;#34;natural sunscreens&amp;#34; but this one is excellent.  The spray is convenient, and gets even coverage.  I don&#x27;t have a complaint about it, however my boyfriend used it and complained that it made him look &amp;#34;too shiny&amp;#34;.  It definitely gives a &amp;#34;dewy, sweaty&amp;#34; look when its applied.  To me, that doesn&#x27;t matter, but to others it might.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and love that it&#x27;s natural and free from harmful chemicals found in other sunscreens. Only downside is the spray sunscreen doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the lotion. However, it is much more convenient!</li>
            <li> BURNT! Sprayed a ton on at the beach and reapplied after coming out of the water ... BURNT!</li>
            <li> Works well and I love the scent!</li>
            <li> I like know my face is protected</li>
            <li> A light and breezy, safe sunscreen for my family.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Cool and works</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time several weeks ago in Florida.  I apply it when I run outdoors. I loved the smell, it wasn&#x27;t too oily and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Stinks.... I sprayed on my hand, smells like gasoline once you put it, very strong odor, unless you care about scent feel free to use...</li>
