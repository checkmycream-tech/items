            <li> Smell (whatever the little smell you get) is different.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no way</li>
            <li> Package a little bit damages.</li>
            <li> Goes hand in hand with products of the past; Loreal, Frizz, Aqua-Net Hairspray, Mousse, And your Ordinary Curl Activated Hair-Gel.</li>
            <li> not as expensive as other fragrances .</li>
            <li> I say give it a chance and smell it and see if you are one of what must be very few women who don&#x27;t go weak in the knees when they do smell it!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t fall for this rip-off.</li>
            <li> It is a fake that loses its smell in 15 minutes.</li>

            <li> I love it.  It is one of my favorite colognes &amp; i will buy it again &amp; i like colognes that come in bottles with more then 4 ounces</li>
            <li> I get this one, because my wife likes it..</li>
            <li> Been my choice for over20 plus years.  Goes hand in hand with products of the past; Loreal, Frizz, Aqua-Net Hairspray, Mousse, And your Ordinary Curl Activated Hair-Gel. Duffy Line....</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for a father and son. They both love it.</li>
            <li> I loved Drakkar Noir for many years, until this purchase.  There is absolutely no way this is the same product as before.  Scent is gone 5 minutes as soon as it is applied.  I believe it contains alcohol and it evaporates rapidly.  Smell (whatever the little smell you get) is different.  Except the bottle &amp; label, the rest feels just like a $5 bottle on the over-the-counter cheap spray.  When you buy, pay attention to who handles &amp; ships.  This is not the real product.....</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product 3 times now  and like the product. I am sure I will order again when I am almost out of it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and what my husband wears. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great cologne, stays on for hrs. I get a lot of comments while wearing this. Will continue using this cologne for a long time</li>
            <li> I have loved the clean smell of Drakkar Noir since the first time that I smelled it on my first college roommate&#x27;s boyfriend back in 1986. Cologne was never very big in the High School that I attended so when I got my first sniff of this cologne, I was absolutely hooked. It is a complete breath of fresh air. I would ask my roommate&#x27;s boyfriend for a few sprays on my pillow that first time after I smelled it! I actually met my boyfriend, now husband in the fall of 1988, and I am sure that the first time I ever bought him cologne, it was Drakkar Noir. We have been together for 25 years this September  and I will honestly say that this is one cologne that I never tire of smelling on him! It is a perfect mix of sexiness and pure clean man! I say give it a chance and smell it and see if you are one of what must be very few women who don&#x27;t go weak in the knees when they do smell it! In fact as you see, it is the most recent cologne I bought for my husband for our 18th wedding anniversary in June! It is something that I do imagine smelling many years from now too. I just absolutely love it! It has been around forever and there is a very good reason why! It smells so good you could eat whoever is wearing it! lol Hope you get to enjoy the fresh clean smell of Drakkar!</li>
            <li> Package a little bit damages. As it is a gift it don&#x27;t looks nices....</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t fall for this rip-off. It is a fake that loses its smell in 15 minutes. I should&#x27;ve known by the price for this size bottle.</li>
            <li> GREAT VALUE!  FINE MEN;S FRAGRANCE!</li>
            <li> excellent product. it smells great . not as expensive as other fragrances . it was a good buy. 200ml bottle is economical</li>
