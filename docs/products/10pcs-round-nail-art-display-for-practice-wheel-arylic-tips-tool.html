            <li>I love the raised design!</li>
            <li>I have purchased more than 1 set of these because they are SO nice!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad they did!</li>
            <li>i love these nail wheels!</li>
            <li>They are adequately sized and they are perfect for displaying your nail art :)</li>
            <li>Also, come nice package.</li>
            <li>These arrived in nice condition.</li>
            <li>Nice product for practicing</li>
            <li>There are a lot in the package, which was nice.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to keep putting on and taking off on your own nails.</li>
            <li>There nice if you wanna practice and if you dont mind a smell of strong plastic but its a good deal as well</li>
            <li>These are perfect for trying out new color combinations or designs.</li>
            <li>The combo of the polish drying on these acrylic wheels smells a lot so have good ventilation and maybe be ready to leave the room, lol.</li>
            <li>Very easy to practice on.</li>
            <li>Good quality and free shipping</li>
            <li>Luv them, they are great for finding the right polish for the day or just playing.</li>
            <li>This is a very cheap product.</li>
            <li>and they are FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Love them, I would buy them again and again</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love to practice my nail designs on these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Technically OK, but I&#x27;ll probably try another seller.</li>
            <li>Perfect for doing my swatches with, and can&#x27;t beat the price versus what I would pay at my local beauty store.</li>
            <li>but now I realized I don&#x27;t have that many nail polishes as I thought I did .</li>
            <li>Love that the nails are flesh toned.</li>
            <li>I recommend these better than the oval nails.</li>
            <li>I respectfully disagree.</li>
            <li>so I can mix and match as I get more into nail art.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to order any more for a while, but I&#x27;d get these again.</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more once my 10 pack is filled</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to see and choose nail polish colors.</li>
            <li>Easy to use even with gel polish.</li>
            <li>The seller is quick to deliver too!</li>
            <li>I received a most prompt reply, reassuring me of this quick delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came quick , packaged good , I love it I&#x27;ve used 3 so far</li>
            <li>Great quality and bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li>Perfect for practicing on and a whole lot cheaper that purchasing locally.</li>
            <li>...looks realistic when you place them over your own nails...</li>
            <li>I have already ordered 4 more sets from this seller ;)</li>
            <li>My daughter was so excited to receive this item.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just so cool</li>
            <li>They are more realistic and easier to paint on.</li>
            <li>These are the type of nail wheels that stack together perfectly, the nail itself is smaller so that it doesnt take a ton of polish to swatch to see what it looks like, and its the creamy white color</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little smaller than I thought they would be, which is great because they fit perfectly in one of my little drawers of nail tools :) There are 18 practice tips on each wheel, and 10 wheels in the package.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to use them to show off nail polishes I receive for review without the constant pain of having to paint my own nails and remove the polish</li>
            <li>I got these super fast...</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>2 of the wheels had 3 wonky nails on them...not a huge deal for the good price.</li>
            <li>Very useful when trying new nail designs to see what they will look like</li>
            <li>Reasonable price!</li>
            <li>they are exactly what they say they are.  </li>
            <li>so you get full coverage in a normal amount of coats.  </li>
            <li>although slow to deliver, I think the quality for what was purchased was overall very good.  </li>
            <li>The way the nail is attached to the plate makes it better than other nail wheels because it has that line connecting the nail (won&#x27;t get polish on the nails next to it as easily).</li>
            <li>Well, the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>You really know what color it will be on your nails.</li>
            <li>they are so much cheaper buying them here.</li>
            <li>The stack of 10 wheels arrived fairly fast, well packaged with bubble wrap in a bubble envelope, from China.</li>
            <li>It has made her learning how to use Acrylic Tips much easier.</li>
            <li>Worked really well for me to put all my polishes in one place</li>
            <li>It really grossed me out.</li>
            <li>the only complaint I have is that with these kind of wheels the nails can bend off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>A lot better than other nail wheels that I have tried, and you can&#x27;t beat this price.  </li>
            <li>and I think it was too easy to make it loose on the wheel.</li>
            <li>I can also test and save how a color looks with a sparkle top coat, and match the little nails to clothing - or, another borrower&#x27;s skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the short wait for shipping.</li>
            <li>, I think it gives a better background for colors that may tend to be a little sheer.</li>
            <li>and they where clear.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind that they took a while to get here, but I have a lot of these nail wheels and these are by far the thinnest plastic ones I have.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problems with them so far.</li>
            <li>I ended up reciving wheels that had the nails attached directly to the wheel</li>
            <li>Deliver early.</li>
            <li>Upon seeing my order was from so far away, I wrote to the seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m horrified to finally realize how much nail polish I have, I thought I would maybe use 5-6</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m horrified to finally realize how much nail polish I have, I thought I would maybe use 5-6</li>
            <li> Super thin, cheap, weak plastic.</li>
            <li> It came in fast and it&#x27;s not cheaply made!</li>
            <li> Product took WAY TOO LONG to arrive!</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said these wheels are not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Shipping is much faster than what you would expect - just order them with plenty of time to spare and order extras, at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few other products with it and those all came, but not this one</li>
            <li> they are on the thin side, but the &amp;#34;nails&amp;#34; are square and shorter than all the other tacky long round ones out there...</li>
            <li> They get the job done for swatches, but I wouldn&#x27;t use these for nail art practice or stamping because they&#x27;re uneven (jagged) in spots and very thin plastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid the nail parts will start to fall off soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> I purchased these because I am a blogger and I wanted to use them to show off nail polishes I receive for review without the constant pain of having to paint my own nails and remove the polish and they are FANTASTIC! It took a while for them to arrive but for the price and the quality you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love these nail wheels for my practice nail art!! They&#x27;re just so cool I don&#x27;t want to use them!! They&#x27;re good quality and nice!!</li>
            <li> I like these. Makes it easy to see and choose nail polish colors.</li>
            <li> Love them, I would buy them again and again</li>
            <li> GREAT nail wheels! Very easy to practice on. I love the raised design! They also stack VERY nicely!  I have purchased more than 1 set of these because they are SO nice! The seller is quick to deliver too! Anyone who is into manicures or nail is MUST have these!!!</li>
            <li> I love these. I use them to test designs and I keep one in my bag so I can test the polishes at the store</li>
            <li> I got these super fast... they are on the thin side, but the &amp;#34;nails&amp;#34; are square and shorter than all the other tacky long round ones out there...so these are great for girls like me that wear their nails shorter and square...looks realistic when you place them over your own nails... I have already ordered 4 more sets from this seller ;)</li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars if I could considering that it never came. I ordered a few other products with it and those all came, but not this one</li>
            <li> Well, the delivery was fast. Now I can practice on my nail art design. Also, come nice package. So I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great way to keep track of your polishes!!</li>
            <li> although slow to deliver, I think the quality for what was purchased was overall very good.  I would purchase from them again.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It came in fast and it&#x27;s not cheaply made! I really like this product and i would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Luv them, they are great for finding the right polish for the day or just playing.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> These are great. Perfect for practicing and displaying my designs :D It is just a hobby for me so this price is great!</li>
            <li> I love to practice my nail designs on these. They are the perfect size and shape. Also there is enough room between each individual nail.</li>
            <li> very good product! I love it!! :-)</li>
            <li> This was a test order for me, just one set to see if they were of any quality. I didn&#x27;t mind that they took a while to get here, but I have a lot of these nail wheels and these are by far the thinnest plastic ones I have. They get the job done for swatches, but I wouldn&#x27;t use these for nail art practice or stamping because they&#x27;re uneven (jagged) in spots and very thin plastic. They all came bent inward and straightening them makes them weaker. I&#x27;m afraid the nail parts will start to fall off soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically OK, but I&#x27;ll probably try another seller.</li>
            <li> These arrived in nice condition. Perfect for doing my swatches with, and can&#x27;t beat the price versus what I would pay at my local beauty store. Worth the short wait for shipping.</li>
            <li> Product took WAY TOO LONG to arrive! Almost 4 months! Product as pictured.</li>
            <li> Good price and good quality. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with them so far. Great for practicing nail art!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for trying out new color combinations or designs. I like that they&#x27;re white, I think it gives a better background for colors that may tend to be a little sheer. They&#x27;re a little smaller than I thought they would be, which is great because they fit perfectly in one of my little drawers of nail tools :) There are 18 practice tips on each wheel, and 10 wheels in the package.</li>
            <li> Good for their price but some of them were chipped at the tips</li>
            <li> Came quick , packaged good , I love it I&#x27;ve used 3 so far but now I realized I don&#x27;t have that many nail polishes as I thought I did . Will be buying more once my 10 pack is filled</li>
            <li> As described. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These are great for testing out designs and whatever else you could use them for. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice very good for practicing nail designs on.</li>
            <li> Great for swatching your nail polish collection.</li>
            <li> The way the nail is attached to the plate makes it better than other nail wheels because it has that line connecting the nail (won&#x27;t get polish on the nails next to it as easily). Also great price</li>
            <li> came in before scheduled time ... which is great</li>
            <li> I got these so as to see what my nail polish will looks like. And to play around with combinations, and art. I am practicing to do nail art myself. Reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.  Good product</li>
            <li> Great purchase, cheaper than beauty supply stores. Good quality and free shipping</li>
            <li> Love that the nails are flesh toned. You really know what color it will be on your nails.</li>
            <li> Great quality and bigger than I thought. The only &#x27;upset&#x27; I have is that it took awhile to get here but I&#x27;m glad they did! Great for practicing didn&#x27;t techniques! Thank you!</li>
            <li> they are exactly what they say they are.  They are adequately sized and they are perfect for displaying your nail art :)</li>
            <li> 2 of the wheels had 3 wonky nails on them...not a huge deal for the good price. Good wheels for swatching colors.</li>
            <li> There nice if you wanna practice and if you dont mind a smell of strong plastic but its a good deal as well</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality. I recommend these better than the oval nails. They are more realistic and easier to paint on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received different ones. I wanted the ones in the picture and thought that&#x27;s what I was ordering. I ended up reciving wheels that had the nails attached directly to the wheel and they where clear. I don&#x27;t like them at all!!! I don&#x27;t like the shape of the nail and the way the nail is attached to the wheel. I will not be buying from the same person ever again. What can you expect for 99 cents. Very unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> i love these nail wheels! they are so much cheaper buying them here. at sallys they r like 6 bux! the only complaint I have is that with these kind of wheels the nails can bend off pretty easily. the ones at sallys do it too.</li>
            <li> Excellent deal for the price.  These are the type of nail wheels that stack together perfectly, the nail itself is smaller so that it doesnt take a ton of polish to swatch to see what it looks like, and its the creamy white color so you get full coverage in a normal amount of coats.  A lot better than other nail wheels that I have tried, and you can&#x27;t beat this price.  Shipping is much faster than what you would expect - just order them with plenty of time to spare and order extras, at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love these wheels very good to practice your designs and to experiment with nails. came on time very pleased</li>
            <li> Deliver early. Got this so my daughter and I could practice nail designs. Excellent choice. Easy to use even with gel polish.</li>
            <li> The stack of 10 wheels arrived fairly fast, well packaged with bubble wrap in a bubble envelope, from China. The efficiency impressed me. Upon seeing my order was from so far away, I wrote to the seller. I received a most prompt reply, reassuring me of this quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wheels are perfect for me to keep samples of each polish color. They often look different on than they do in the bottle. I can also test and save how a color looks with a sparkle top coat, and match the little nails to clothing - or, another borrower&#x27;s skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a very good buy with 10 wheels, so I was able to share 3. Another reviewer said these wheels are not strong enough. I respectfully disagree. I am happy with this purchase and the seller, Etop-Company.</li>
            <li> Great price.  My daughter and I use these to make samples of all the polishes we have.</li>
            <li> My daughter was so excited to receive this item. It has made her learning how to use Acrylic Tips much easier. I would order them again for her.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses these to practice her nail art.  They are perfect for this.  This is the only thing she uses them for.</li>
            <li> Perfect practice nail wheel.</li>
            <li> Nice product for practicing</li>
            <li> There are a lot in the package, which was nice. One of the nails is almost coming off and I think it was too easy to make it loose on the wheel.</li>
            <li> Very useful when trying new nail designs to see what they will look like</li>
            <li> Worked great for what I wanted. I&#x27;m horrified to finally realize how much nail polish I have, I thought I would maybe use 5-6 and then I used 9/10.  Worked really well for me to put all my polishes in one place so I can mix and match as I get more into nail art. Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to order any more for a while, but I&#x27;d get these again.</li>
            <li> Very nice to practice colors and designs so you don&#x27;t have to keep putting on and taking off on your own nails. The combo of the polish drying on these acrylic wheels smells a lot so have good ventilation and maybe be ready to leave the room, lol.</li>
            <li> Perfect for practicing on and a whole lot cheaper that purchasing locally.</li>
            <li> The nail wheels I got came coated in an unidentifiable oily yellow liquid. It really grossed me out. I ended up throwing them all out.</li>
            <li> This is a very cheap product. Both price wise and quality wise. The nails basically break off of the wheel with the littlest touch. Super thin, cheap, weak plastic. Definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing these again. You get what you pay for I guess...</li>
