    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Diaper Ointment is wonderful!!  </li>
            <li>Should have stuck with the best!  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed and immediately got a tube!</li>
            <li>Smells great and works even reater!</li>
            <li>Its wonderful.</li>
            <li>Best wishes.</li>
            <li>And it has a very good smell!</li>
            <li>I agree that this is a very effective product which also smells great!</li>
            <li>It smells great and works well.</li>
            <li>It is great for my son, since when he was born.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice scent as well.  </li>
            <li>It has very nice smell, does not disturb baby skin, but I would not say it makes wanders with diaper rush.</li>
            <li>and I loved the smell.</li>
            <li>So if you are undecided, add that to the list of good reasons to try.  </li>
            <li>I think I was jealous, the stuff was so good.  </li>
            <li>Even with the shipping charge it is so worth it, and the smell is awesome.</li>
            <li>It stays on through the night, so baby awakens with nothing a smooth, happy bottom.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really is amazing..</li>
            <li>Perfect for good old fashioned baby diaper rash.</li>
            <li>I used the Burt&#x27;s Bees ointment, and within 24 hours, his skin was healing nicely.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream - good consistency, nice scent, and works great.</li>
            <li>But, the most impressive thing about it is that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it very well.</li>
            <li>I have to say, though, that because it smells so good, I find myself using it even when baby&#x27;s skin is just fine.</li>
            <li>Listen, I have been using the Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee Diaper Ointment with my kids for over 12 years in spite of its price tag in stores, because it is by far the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s another elmosnaturals favorite.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay, because it just goes on working.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is easy to put on and spreads nicely, and is just as easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>Excellent conditions delivered as expected.</li>
            <li>thanks for everyone,it is good for my baby</li>
            <li>We love the fresh smell--minty, for lack of a better word.  </li>
            <li>Nothing but the best for my baby; that is why I use Burt&#x27;s Baby exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;These 7 oz tubes last a loooonnngg time, so the price is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It works ok to prevent it, but for healing we had to use old good stinky</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that until my darling daughter developed a reaction to the creme I loved it.</li>
            <li>Extremely effective, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value for the money, because it does last for a while.  </li>
            <li>It is worth it, worth it, worth it!</li>
            <li>I have given it as a baby shower gift to all my expectant friends because it is such an amazing, tried &amp; true product for us.  </li>
            <li>I (like many others), had tried just about every over the counter and/or prescription diaper cream on the market for my son&#x27;s very sensitive and tender skin.  </li>
            <li>One more thing, I just purchased cloth diapers for our son and some of the sites say BB diaper ointment is the best/only kind to use with cloth diapers because of the the chemicals and preservatives in the others that cause the diapers to be less absorbant even after washing.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>However, that is precisely why it is so effective, as it creates an excellent, thick, healing, naturally antibiotic moisture barrier that stays put, even overnight, or through a big soaking.  </li>
            <li>She has never had any kind of irritation for as long as we have used it (over 6 months).  </li>
            <li>so it was kind of strange.</li>
            <li>The scent is tame and the texture of it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees has a great, thick consistency that does not come off as soon as you put the diaper on.  </li>
            <li>I have three kids, and have tried many different brands of diaper care, until I tried this creme from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>One hint I can give to expectant parents to reduce the trauma of diaper rash occurrence is, if you are able to breastfeed (exclusively if possible at first), please do.  </li>
            <li>Of course you know all the amazing reasons it is absolutely the ultimate and healthiest feeding choice, but preventing diaper rash is yet another huge bonus, and I personally saw that was a fact!  </li>
            <li>It literally cleared it up overnight, and it has a nice fragrance, unlike other brands.  </li>
            <li>I kept my child clean and frequently changed.</li>
            <li>Has a lovely smell, and seems to cure diaper rash much, much faster than Desitin or any other brand I tried, and soothes the little ones more quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product but for the same price you can get a larger size in stores.</li>
            <li>where I put it and really holds up in a diaper.</li>
            <li>It coats really well</li>
            <li>But if you want something that really works every time, this is all you will need.</li>
            <li>And it should, considering it costs twice as much.  </li>
            <li>i like it,it is very good.it&#x27;s for me.i</li>
            <li>Additionally, it makes for a nice \\&quot;change in aroma\\&quot; around the changing table after a messy diaper and eliminates any residual smells on my babe.</li>
            <li>We took her to the doctor who surmised it was an allergic reaction probably to one of the oils which is a real shame because it seems to work really well for so many other babies.</li>
            <li>In my experience, I blew much more money on the other brands and they did not do as they claimed for my child.</li>
            <li>So what if Burt&#x27;s Bees costs a dollar or two more than the other ointments?  </li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Never a complaint.</li>
            <li>When my son was first born I had a whole tube of Desitin and a tiny sample of Baby Bee Diaper Ointment.</li>
            <li>The tube I bought was stolen by a day-care employee, but it had already lasted ages longer than normal brands.  </li>
            <li>I mean, it does take some effort, and you should try to keep it in a warm spot, like over the heater vent if you can.  </li>
            <li>It did well at protecting the area and preventing anything new from appearing, but as for getting rid of a rash, it did nothing.  </li>
            <li>you are cloth diapering, remember not to use this in direct contact with micro-fleece of products like FuzziBunz as it does stay in the cloth.</li>
            <li>I just started using this product on my 11 month old son who is teething.</li>
            <li>In fact, it has the consistency of soft clay.  </li>
            <li>Yes true it does cost a little more than some other ointments, but in the long run, I truly began saving money because this stuff lasts longer than the others and being as it works</li>
            <li>It not only calmed my baby down and made him comfortable but the rash was gone in under 24 hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee Diaper Ointment is like a slightly oily, zinc-based, white substance; it has a very thick, clay-like consistency that softens on warm fingers and begins to flow, melting onto baby&#x27;s warm skin; it smells refreshingly fragrant like rosemary; a little goes a very long way; and it has NEVER, and I mean NEVER, failed to instantly soothe and clear up a rash (usually in a matter of 24 hours), which makes it worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only thing that is not so appealing is the fact that it is almost too thick to squeeze out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>Fluffy; feels less like paste or glue (compared to some others), and does an outstanding job of clearing up the diaper rash.</li>
            <li>When we first tried it, our daughter&#x27;s bottom was red and irritated because we had run out of our other ointment.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it over both conventional and natural diaper creams.</li>

            <li> Really thick cream stays right</li>
            <li> My son is also allergic to several different soaps and detergents and has had no reaction to this product, although we haven&#x27;t had any problems with any other diaper rash treatments either.</li>
            <li> 2 oz tube for one baby has always lasted at least three to four months for me, but my babies didn&#x27;t suffer from diaper rash very often.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;quot;fluffier&amp;quot; than other brands (as I recall) and easier to apply, and seems to last a bit longer, too.  </li>
            <li> He had large open areas on his bottom within two hours of putting on the supposed sensitive skin cream, and was in so much pain from the rash that he was miserable (and so was I).  </li>
            <li> It cleared up my baby&#x27;s red bum in just a few applications.</li>
            <li> Also there was some separated oil which may leak and stain your clothes, so be careful.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I had tried Aveeno diaper rash cream, and it burned/broke his skin down within two hours.  </li>
            <li> so well you will have to use it less often.</li>
            <li> The Desitin didn&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick but this stuff cleared his rash in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Well I used Balmex and others and was always having trouble controling a rash once it started</li>
            <li> As soon as the Burt&#x27;s Bees touched her irritated area, she stopped crying.  </li>
            <li> My son had a really harsh case of diaper rash, when I applied this creme to his bottom.  </li>
            <li> I recieved a small gift bag of Burt Bees baby product from a neighbor when I was expecting my son.</li>
            <li> and I had a small tube of BB diaper ointment I received as a gift and had forgot about</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get it from the tube.</li>
            <li> However, my daughter&#x27;s poor bottom started getting an angry red, almost looked like a sunburn.</li>
            <li> Very thick ointment, smells like pine needles, and didn&#x27;t work too well at getting rid of a rash.  </li>
            <li> ointment is VERY thick</li>
            <li> I mean, you have to work a bit to get that stuff off!  </li>
            <li> Well, one day I ran out of ointment at the worst time</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I swear this product clears up diaper rash over night. Really thick cream stays right where I put it and really holds up in a diaper.</li>
            <li> Perfect for good old fashioned baby diaper rash. It cleared up my baby&#x27;s red bum in just a few applications.</li>
            <li> I recieved a small gift bag of Burt Bees baby product from a neighbor when I was expecting my son. I had never heard of it before and so kept it on the side \\&quot;Just in case\\&quot;. Well I used Balmex and others and was always having trouble controling a rash once it started eventhough I kept my child clean and frequently changed. Well, one day I ran out of ointment at the worst time and so I used the Burt Bees ointment. OH MY GOD!  It not only calmed my baby down and made him comfortable but the rash was gone in under 24 hours. I will now use nothing else for my child. Yes true it does cost a little more than some other ointments, but in the long run, I truly began saving money because this stuff lasts longer than the others and being as it works so well you will have to use it less often. In my experience, I blew much more money on the other brands and they did not do as they claimed for my child.</li>
            <li> Been protecting my kids tushies for over five years. Never a complaint. It works.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Diaper Ointment is wonderful!!  We have tried Desitin, Balmex, and Bordeaux&#x27;s Butt Paste, and we prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees to all of them.  When we first tried it, our daughter&#x27;s bottom was red and irritated because we had run out of our other ointment.  As soon as the Burt&#x27;s Bees touched her irritated area, she stopped crying.  She has never had any kind of irritation for as long as we have used it (over 6 months).  Burt&#x27;s Bees has a great, thick consistency that does not come off as soon as you put the diaper on.  It stays on through the night, so baby awakens with nothing a smooth, happy bottom.  We love the fresh smell--minty, for lack of a better word.  We ran out of it recently and tried Butt Paste only to find our daughter with a red bottom in the morning.  Should have stuck with the best!  So what if Burt&#x27;s Bees costs a dollar or two more than the other ointments?  It is worth it, worth it, worth it!</li>
            <li> Nothing but the best for my baby; that is why I use Burt&#x27;s Baby exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;These 7 oz tubes last a loooonnngg time, so the price is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My baby is 1 and she has not had any diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I have three kids, and have tried many different brands of diaper care, until I tried this creme from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  My son had a really harsh case of diaper rash, when I applied this creme to his bottom.  It literally cleared it up overnight, and it has a nice fragrance, unlike other brands.  It&#x27;s another elmosnaturals favorite.</li>
            <li> I agree that this is a very effective product which also smells great! It lasts forever because you don&#x27;t have to use it day after day to see the benefits. Therefore, it is worth the price. I have to say, though, that because it smells so good, I find myself using it even when baby&#x27;s skin is just fine. I haven&#x27;t had any problems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are cloth diapering, remember not to use this in direct contact with micro-fleece of products like FuzziBunz as it does stay in the cloth.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that until my darling daughter developed a reaction to the creme I loved it. It coats really well and I loved the smell. However, my daughter&#x27;s poor bottom started getting an angry red, almost looked like a sunburn. We took her to the doctor who surmised it was an allergic reaction probably to one of the oils which is a real shame because it seems to work really well for so many other babies. I just wanted to let folks know that as with any product, to be watchful.</li>
            <li> When my son was first born I had a whole tube of Desitin and a tiny sample of Baby Bee Diaper Ointment. The Desitin didn&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick but this stuff cleared his rash in less than 24 hours. I was very impressed and immediately got a tube! It has lasted for almost 2 years and would last longer but my husband stepped on it and it squirted all over the floor *sniff*. Now I&#x27;m expecting againg and this is my ointment of choice. Smells great and works even reater!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream - good consistency, nice scent, and works great. I highly recommend it over both conventional and natural diaper creams.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product on my 11 month old son who is teething. Rather than waiting for the rash, this time I decided to head it off and I had a small tube of BB diaper ointment I received as a gift and had forgot about so I tried it out. Its wonderful. It smells great and works well. Additionally, it makes for a nice \\&quot;change in aroma\\&quot; around the changing table after a messy diaper and eliminates any residual smells on my babe. My son is also allergic to several different soaps and detergents and has had no reaction to this product, although we haven&#x27;t had any problems with any other diaper rash treatments either. One more thing, I just purchased cloth diapers for our son and some of the sites say BB diaper ointment is the best/only kind to use with cloth diapers because of the the chemicals and preservatives in the others that cause the diapers to be less absorbant even after washing.</li>
            <li> Fluffy; feels less like paste or glue (compared to some others), and does an outstanding job of clearing up the diaper rash. This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this stuff has saved my son from severe diaper rash.. For wipes, I use a non-alcholic witch hazel and use cotton balls.. it&#x27;s really is amazing.. but i wish it came in a bigger tube!</li>
            <li> Listen, I have been using the Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee Diaper Ointment with my kids for over 12 years in spite of its price tag in stores, because it is by far the best I have found.  I tried all the Desitins, I tried the Butt Paste, I tried Vaseline, I tried A&amp;D Ointment, I tried Aquaphor, and I tried Caldesene Baby Care Powder!  But if you want something that really works every time, this is all you will need. Extremely effective, I highly recommend it.  I have given it as a baby shower gift to all my expectant friends because it is such an amazing, tried &amp; true product for us.  It works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is not so appealing is the fact that it is almost too thick to squeeze out of the tube.  I mean, it does take some effort, and you should try to keep it in a warm spot, like over the heater vent if you can.  In fact, it has the consistency of soft clay.  However, that is precisely why it is so effective, as it creates an excellent, thick, healing, naturally antibiotic moisture barrier that stays put, even overnight, or through a big soaking.  I mean, you have to work a bit to get that stuff off!  But that&#x27;s okay, because it just goes on working.  Also, it always seems to wash out if it gets on clothes, and it doesn&#x27;t stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee Diaper Ointment is like a slightly oily, zinc-based, white substance; it has a very thick, clay-like consistency that softens on warm fingers and begins to flow, melting onto baby&#x27;s warm skin; it smells refreshingly fragrant like rosemary; a little goes a very long way; and it has NEVER, and I mean NEVER, failed to instantly soothe and clear up a rash (usually in a matter of 24 hours), which makes it worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 2 oz tube for one baby has always lasted at least three to four months for me, but my babies didn&#x27;t suffer from diaper rash very often.  I apply it at even the slightest redness that begins to appear.  One hint I can give to expectant parents to reduce the trauma of diaper rash occurrence is, if you are able to breastfeed (exclusively if possible at first), please do.  Of course you know all the amazing reasons it is absolutely the ultimate and healthiest feeding choice, but preventing diaper rash is yet another huge bonus, and I personally saw that was a fact!  So if you are undecided, add that to the list of good reasons to try.  Best wishes.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every cream I could find and none of them work. Burt&#x27;s Bees works overnight and her rash is gone. I love this stuff and I can&#x27;t find it in any stores around here so I have to get it on Amazon. Even with the shipping charge it is so worth it, and the smell is awesome.</li>
            <li> Only buy this if you can&#x27;t find this at your local store. This is an amazing product but for the same price you can get a larger size in stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditions delivered as expected. 100% Recommended.</li>
            <li> I used this on my second one (and toward the end of our diaper era) and to this day wish there was some need for me to use it.  I think I was jealous, the stuff was so good.  Has a lovely smell, and seems to cure diaper rash much, much faster than Desitin or any other brand I tried, and soothes the little ones more quickly.  It&#x27;s &amp;quot;fluffier&amp;quot; than other brands (as I recall) and easier to apply, and seems to last a bit longer, too.  And it should, considering it costs twice as much.  The tube I bought was stolen by a day-care employee, but it had already lasted ages longer than normal brands.  This was the one concession I made toward spoiling my baby with &amp;quot;preppy&amp;quot; specialty stuff.  Just wish I had tried it on day one of my firstborn.</li>
            <li> Very thick ointment, smells like pine needles, and didn&#x27;t work too well at getting rid of a rash.  It did well at protecting the area and preventing anything new from appearing, but as for getting rid of a rash, it did nothing.  Plus your hands smelled like a forest afterwards so it was kind of strange.</li>
            <li> i like it,it is very good.it&#x27;s for me.i will buy it nest time. thanks for everyone,it is good for my baby</li>
            <li> It is great for my son, since when he was born. Never had a diaper rush. And it has a very good smell!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00063M1L2 Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee Diaper Ointment - 2oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  I (like many others), had tried just about every over the counter and/or prescription diaper cream on the market for my son&#x27;s very sensitive and tender skin.  I had tried Aveeno diaper rash cream, and it burned/broke his skin down within two hours.  He had large open areas on his bottom within two hours of putting on the supposed sensitive skin cream, and was in so much pain from the rash that he was miserable (and so was I).  I used the Burt&#x27;s Bees ointment, and within 24 hours, his skin was healing nicely.  This is the only cream, out of the dozen or so that we tried, that will cure his diaper rash.  It has a very nice scent as well.  I like that it is easy to put on and spreads nicely, and is just as easy to wash off.  I buy this stuff by the six pack now, just so we have it on hand for home, in his diaper bag, and for daycare.  It&#x27;s a good value for the money, because it does last for a while.  But, the most impressive thing about it is that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it very well.</li>
            <li> It has very nice smell, does not disturb baby skin, but I would not say it makes wanders with diaper rush. It works ok to prevent it, but for healing we had to use old good stinky Desitin.&lt;br /&gt;The ointment is VERY thick and it&#x27;s hard to get it from the tube. Also there was some separated oil which may leak and stain your clothes, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I give Burt&#x27;s Bees Diaper Cream to all my friend&#x27;s that have babies. A little goes a long way so it lasts FOREVER. The scent is tame and the texture of it nice and smooth.</li>
