            <li>i cant say how satisfied i am</li>
            <li>There were 3 duplicate plates, but that is ok.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more holiday or winter themed discs.</li>
            <li>For the price, I am definitely more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love these nail stamping plates.</li>
            <li>so many designs to choose from.</li>
            <li>a number of unusable plates and many duplicated.</li>
            <li>But even with those repeats, there are a ton of cute images to choose from.</li>
            <li>There are so many plates that I was able to give many away for gifts.</li>
            <li>There are so many designs to choose from and to make up.</li>
            <li>Everyone I have over to play nails love the variety, everyone can find one they like.</li>
            <li>and I just love these plates.</li>
            <li>I buffed the stamper before I used it and was able to transfer designs.</li>
            <li>The stamper in this set is ok ish for getting started.</li>
            <li>Way too many flower and vine designs.</li>
            <li>I received my item today and I love it.</li>
            <li>Many of the stamps were duplicates of others and there was no chevron, browning symbol, or fleur de le stamps</li>
            <li>I love this item</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted !!!</li>
            <li>The plates are great quality, and they have many of the same images as the popular Konad plates.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good now.</li>
            <li>and they work fine :)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a very good stamp with regular nail polish, if I got it to stamp at all.  </li>
            <li>Plus it arrived quicker than expected and the stamper and scraper work perfectly</li>
            <li>the designs are more detailed than anticipated.  </li>
            <li>Every plate I&#x27;ve tried so far works great.</li>
            <li>buy this product you will have fun with your kids or just doing your own nails.</li>
            <li>so I was VERY excited to score these so cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t use all of them in my lifetime!</li>
            <li>This will provide many fun mani options!</li>
            <li>and we received them very quickly.</li>
            <li>It was easy to transfer the patterns using a plastic card instead of the scraper, which was had a whop-sided blade.</li>
            <li>the stamper and scraper worked great for me, but I still ordered a seperate bigger stamper for better handling.</li>
            <li>included stamper is fine.</li>
            <li>So I ordered some stamping polish, and suddenly was much more successful.  </li>
            <li>But they do work just fine</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s turned out fine.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the many designs it has.</li>
            <li>I counted them and luckily they are all still there :)</li>
            <li>Luckily I had also purchased a stamping kit from another company and was able to use that for my stamping.</li>
            <li>This shipping was sooooo quick !</li>
            <li>Everything was in great condition and arrived quickly, I&#x27;ve used the feather and the butterfly so far</li>
            <li>haha, i got all kind of plates that i can think of.</li>
            <li>I ordered her 100 plates for cheap.</li>
            <li>plates are scratched but for as many as your getting its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t care as the price was amazing.  </li>
            <li>super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>But the discs are absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li>So worth the money!</li>
            <li>, now i don&#x27;t need any more plates, as i have all different kind of plates for each festival n diff themes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall these were a great deal and a fun way to start my nail art collection.</li>
            <li>It is easy to do and fun also.</li>
            <li>the polish/paint was wiped clean off the plates.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the rubber pad or the scraper that came with these - I use the real Konad ones that came with my original set as they work much better.  </li>
            <li>With this set I won&#x27;t need to buy any more large lots but can pick up a special plate here and there.  </li>
            <li>I received this product yesterday in the mail and was super excited about it.</li>
            <li>plates were full nail designs (four each) with one additional tip design</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>It is really cool to use.</li>
            <li>The stamper that comes with the set I am having really good luck with (I also ordered the Konad double ended stamper).  </li>
            <li>100 plates for $30 not bad deal at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to the whole stamping process, but the more you do it, the better you get.</li>
            <li>You have to be quick, but it works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this set to everyone, as you get the same image plate like konad and most important is they all give result with very fine details on images.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I even posted a design I just finished where I used brown nail polish with a black rose design in which I also post on instagram  :)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the reviews of others before purchase, and figured it was worth the risk.</li>
            <li>,fun  </li>
            <li>so it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Old credit card or drivers license works better.</li>
            <li>worth the money anyway</li>
            <li>and well I believe I have my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>, That didn&#x27;t stop them from working right.</li>
            <li>After then applying the wet nail polish on the design you want you must scrape lightly  and stamp the design fast so the design can be picked up from the rubber stamper, then gently place the stamper on the nails and you will have a really cute design without having to go to a nail salon :)  .</li>
            <li>Some plates were repeated and others are not indented enough for the polish to stay within the grooves but overall beautiful plates</li>
            <li>In the manufacturers defense, I have never used stamping plates before today and probably do not have the technique down yet, so I will update this review once I have more practice :)</li>
            <li>I suggest buying these plates as your first getting into stamping, as the listing doesn&#x27;t give exact details on what plates will be include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I think these are pretty fun.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>There is only one plate in the set that at first glance I would never use, and many I&#x27;d never thought about using, but will have fun playing with.  </li>
            <li>not sure the best way to organize them though, since there&#x27;s so many.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to find a little binder book to fit them nicely to be viewed individually, rather than stacking them altogether.</li>
            <li>the design was very nice but the design isn&#x27;t deep enough on plate</li>
            <li>french manicure image, full nail images, small images like all kind of flowers, hearts, diff butterfly shapes, star designs, snow flacks, diff kind of bows and sooooo on....</li>
            <li>Good quality product except the scraper was a little bowed.</li>
            <li>some animals, fruits, alphabets, numbers, cute animal faces,  cartoon characters, dance theme, some Chinese designs(which</li>
            <li>That was my first mistake.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried it, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>went with the bigger pack because it would be nicer to have more of the variety.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I only got 99 plates..</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that covers most of the categories &amp; the various notables</li>
            <li>Just make sure to take the blue protector tape off of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to make one design on one plate work...</li>
            <li>I truly love this nail art stamping kit, it comes with 100 plates and like 1,000 designs in total.</li>
            <li>plate C06, 69 M plates (I think these are the KONAD ones) m1-m85, and 7 S plates numbers 2-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are flowers and leafs, ocean animals and shells, bubbles, butterflies, most of the horoscopes, hearts, animals, tropical, lace, tips galore, designs like fluer de lis,  flames, Halloween, Christmas,  Asian style animals, a girl in a kimono, Asian characters/letters, umbrella, heels and belt, stripes, candy, all caps letters and numbers, snowflakes, animal print, fairies, bows, champagne, steaming mug, gambling stuff, ballerinas, cheer, fruit, fishnet, hounds tooth, plaid, instruments, necklaces, feathers, lips, eagles, birds, and more.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before purchasing this product and thought for a first time stamping kit it would work out.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you are trying out stamping for the first time.</li>
            <li>There are some EXACT duplicates to Konad plates in this set (of 100)</li>
            <li>This is my first stamping set</li>
            <li>I checked out how to videos first.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know where to stat first.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get more use out of them and you won&#x27;t have to worry about having 2 or 3 of the same designs.</li>
            <li>Love the designs, out of 100 plates, I received only one duplicate.  </li>
            <li>Love all the different images and the plates I have used have stamped well.</li>
            <li>I clean it for every impression to get crisp clear</li>
            <li>Well it turns out that you really do not have to use that certain kind of polish.</li>
            <li>The price is great, but the etchings are too shallow.</li>
            <li>The plain french tip plate still comes out too light, but it gives me a good template to just paint it on myself.  </li>
            <li>Without the protective blue plastic on them the plates can easily scratch.</li>
            <li>only upside is they came very quickly</li>
            <li>In all this was a very decent product/buy; I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>all in all, I think this is an ok purchase for a beginner set, but I would encourage you to invest in single plates that suite your taste.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for large plates, then these are not for you.</li>
            <li>Thank you for giving me this whole set of designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After reading and researching as much information as I could find on the internet, I felt ready to give it a go.  </li>
            <li>also shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>its a real at home item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now that its here, I&#x27;m having so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The name brand plates are much deeper.</li>
            <li>Now I can try them out and buy the real things of the  plates I really like.</li>
            <li>Allthe plates work very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the variety of the plates.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>One of the discs was bent so you can&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li>Cannot really rate as this is a Xmas gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Looks like cheaply made Chinese products that our country is bombarded with.</li>
            <li>They arrived fast.</li>
            <li>also a couple of the plates I received were really scratched up (see pictures).</li>
            <li>This set cost almost as much as the 4 Konad plates I bought when I started.  </li>
            <li>okay, although I do find the rubber area almost too small for some of the full nail designs.</li>
            <li>The package was damaged, so the plates were super cheap (about $16 for 89 plates--11 were missing).</li>
            <li>even though the price is cheap, consider the fact that you&#x27;re paying that much for (in my case) a single functional design.</li>
            <li>I only did a quick practice one with a single plate to see how they would do, and I am so far pleased.</li>
            <li>I tried more then half of the plates.</li>
            <li>I wonder if they&#x27;re rejects for slight quality flaws, though I don&#x27;t see many.  </li>
            <li>Love these, was short four discs but definitely</li>
            <li>I found this kit at a super discount store (Like a Big Lots).</li>
            <li>I was able to bend them back enough that the images still work.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is good as long as you have a different stamper to use.</li>
            <li>would say, this set has all kind of themes starting from Christmas, Halloween, 4th of july( not exactly</li>
            <li>But now i can say i have almost all famous konad plates even though they r not original.</li>
            <li>Lots of cute little patterns and images.</li>
            <li>and I got the same result, which was pretty much nothing or part of the design.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>but it looks like the plates cute though it ice tried a few</li>
            <li>Just started stamping, bought a few plates at a convention and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I am new to stamping, so I took a couple weeks to play with these and figure out if it was user error before I posted this review.  </li>
            <li>Esp if you are someone new to stamping.</li>
            <li>From New Years to Christmas, cheerleaders to ballerinas.</li>
            <li>The full nail plates are just wide enough for my thumbs, so I have to line them up just right, which takes some practice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a few replica plates, but honestly its no big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter received a small nail art set with 5 discs for Christmas and wanted more.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 100 plate set, and I ended up with one exact duplicate and a couple duplicate designs on different plates.  </li>
            <li>I now have so many ideas I am not sure where to start.</li>
            <li>once I get my licence and start doing nails professionally!</li>
            <li>arrived in good condition, although a few of the plates must have slide around enough to scratch through the protective blue plastic.</li>
            <li>They work as they are supposed to as long as you have the right equipment and skill level.</li>
            <li>image came off pretty clear but not totally.</li>
            <li>There were lots of verities in the set including, holiday (Halloween, Xmas,valentine, st Patrick , Fourth of July , tips, full nail, Asian (tho</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t get it right the first few times).  </li>
            <li>After giving up on using ( As Seen on TV&#x27;s Hollywood Nails All in One Nail Art System) I stopped using the whole device and  noticed that just by only using the soft rubber stamper and a hard card like (debit or business card) as a scraper it gives better clearer results for nail designs.</li>
            <li>every 2-3 impression to get the image to come out clearly.</li>
            <li>The parts that did come off clear look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The images transfer clear.</li>
            <li>The stamper works well and the scraper was put aside since we use an old credit card, which works well.</li>
            <li>I am using a old credit card.</li>
            <li>(and the 5duplicates)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the designsI&#x27;ve tried so far have worked well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far all the plates work well.</li>
            <li>So far, I have had no problems.</li>
            <li>I ruined a natural nail and roughed up three others unwrapping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am using an old plastic card.</li>
            <li>The old man asked me if I was buying bricks off Amazon.</li>
            <li>There is such a variety that I&#x27;ll definitely be inspired and have fun playing with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While the stamper is questionable the etching on these plates is good and the images stamp</li>
            <li>I thought only the konad special polish would work properly, so I ordered the white polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of the plates (along with my Konad stamper/scraper) already, and I found the quality of the image to be exactly the same as my official Konad plates.</li>
            <li>it comes with isn&#x27;t as useless as I feared, though it isn&#x27;t the best either &amp; is very firm.</li>
            <li>additional plates did contain either a tip or a full plate design among the other smaller</li>
            <li>They range from full nail designs, single tip and single images.</li>
            <li>I got 4 duplicates and one triplicate, so 6 extra, but I received 102 plates, so I still have 96 new plates.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to new nail stamping artists.</li>
            <li>I expected some duplicates, in a random lot for this price, and 5 is a number I can be happy about.</li>
            <li>several whole nail coverage stamps, nail tip stamps, and individual designs.  </li>
            <li>Delivered on time and product was exactly what I expected, Thank you!</li>
            <li>The plates ARE NOT backed and are pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li>The designs I got included a lot of flowers, scrolls, lace, bows, hearts, vegas, cowboy, cheer, dance, playing cards, numbers, alphabet, Chinese symbols, music notes, instruments, nail tips both plain and detailed (stripes, stars, zebra)</li>
            <li>Most plates have 7 designs (smaller)  but the least on one plate is 5 desgns (4 full nail &amp; 1 small).  </li>
            <li>I found the stamper provided did not transfer well until I ran a large file over it and made the surface rough.</li>
            <li>Just do NOT forget to remove the protective clear or blue film that is covering the stamping</li>
            <li>I also recommend removing the clear blue plastic which is on the plates before using them!</li>
            <li>Pure ice silver or other metallic color polish work for stamping.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have konad special polish but wet n wild white, black</li>
            <li>Right now I have a plate that had little Asian cartoon characters that I&#x27;m wearing now.</li>
            <li>I tried them out a little today after receiving them and the designs come out crisp.</li>
            <li>There are designs for little girls as well as mature designs for the older buyers.</li>
            <li>Use an old gift card or similar flat plastic piece as a scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that if you get these you also have a storage case because if these are sliding around together the sharp edges will etch your plates.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and the plates were in very good condition, but the plastic bag that the plates and stamper came in was torn and in bad condition and the stamper was dried out and hard and could not be used for stamping at all.</li>

            <li> i cant say how satisfied i am</li>
            <li> There were 3 duplicate plates, but that is ok.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more holiday or winter themed discs.</li>
            <li> For the price, I am definitely more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I love these nail stamping plates.</li>
            <li> so many designs to choose from.</li>
            <li> a number of unusable plates and many duplicated.</li>
            <li> But even with those repeats, there are a ton of cute images to choose from.</li>
            <li> There are so many plates that I was able to give many away for gifts.</li>
            <li> There are so many designs to choose from and to make up.</li>
            <li> Everyone I have over to play nails love the variety, everyone can find one they like.</li>
            <li> and I just love these plates.</li>
            <li> I buffed the stamper before I used it and was able to transfer designs.</li>
            <li> The stamper in this set is ok ish for getting started.</li>
            <li> Way too many flower and vine designs.</li>
            <li> I received my item today and I love it.</li>
            <li> Many of the stamps were duplicates of others and there was no chevron, browning symbol, or fleur de le stamps</li>
            <li> I love this item</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted !!!</li>
            <li> The plates are great quality, and they have many of the same images as the popular Konad plates.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good now.</li>
            <li> and they work fine :)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a very good stamp with regular nail polish, if I got it to stamp at all.  </li>
            <li> Plus it arrived quicker than expected and the stamper and scraper work perfectly</li>
            <li> the designs are more detailed than anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Every plate I&#x27;ve tried so far works great.</li>
            <li> buy this product you will have fun with your kids or just doing your own nails.</li>
            <li> so I was VERY excited to score these so cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t use all of them in my lifetime!</li>
            <li> This will provide many fun mani options!</li>
            <li> and we received them very quickly.</li>
            <li> It was easy to transfer the patterns using a plastic card instead of the scraper, which was had a whop-sided blade.</li>
            <li> the stamper and scraper worked great for me, but I still ordered a seperate bigger stamper for better handling.</li>
            <li> included stamper is fine.</li>
            <li> So I ordered some stamping polish, and suddenly was much more successful.  </li>
            <li> But they do work just fine</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s turned out fine.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the many designs it has.</li>
            <li> I counted them and luckily they are all still there :)</li>
            <li> Luckily I had also purchased a stamping kit from another company and was able to use that for my stamping.</li>
            <li> This shipping was sooooo quick !</li>
            <li> Everything was in great condition and arrived quickly, I&#x27;ve used the feather and the butterfly so far</li>
            <li> haha, i got all kind of plates that i can think of.</li>
            <li> I ordered her 100 plates for cheap.</li>
            <li> plates are scratched but for as many as your getting its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t care as the price was amazing.  </li>
            <li> super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But the discs are absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li> So worth the money!</li>
            <li> , now i don&#x27;t need any more plates, as i have all different kind of plates for each festival n diff themes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall these were a great deal and a fun way to start my nail art collection.</li>
            <li> It is easy to do and fun also.</li>
            <li> the polish/paint was wiped clean off the plates.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use the rubber pad or the scraper that came with these - I use the real Konad ones that came with my original set as they work much better.  </li>
            <li> With this set I won&#x27;t need to buy any more large lots but can pick up a special plate here and there.  </li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday in the mail and was super excited about it.</li>
            <li> plates were full nail designs (four each) with one additional tip design</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> It is really cool to use.</li>
            <li> The stamper that comes with the set I am having really good luck with (I also ordered the Konad double ended stamper).  </li>
            <li> 100 plates for $30 not bad deal at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to the whole stamping process, but the more you do it, the better you get.</li>
            <li> You have to be quick, but it works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this set to everyone, as you get the same image plate like konad and most important is they all give result with very fine details on images.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I even posted a design I just finished where I used brown nail polish with a black rose design in which I also post on instagram  :)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of others before purchase, and figured it was worth the risk.</li>
            <li> ,fun  </li>
            <li> so it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Old credit card or drivers license works better.</li>
            <li> worth the money anyway</li>
            <li> and well I believe I have my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> , That didn&#x27;t stop them from working right.</li>
            <li> After then applying the wet nail polish on the design you want you must scrape lightly  and stamp the design fast so the design can be picked up from the rubber stamper, then gently place the stamper on the nails and you will have a really cute design without having to go to a nail salon :)  .</li>
            <li> Some plates were repeated and others are not indented enough for the polish to stay within the grooves but overall beautiful plates</li>
            <li> In the manufacturers defense, I have never used stamping plates before today and probably do not have the technique down yet, so I will update this review once I have more practice :)</li>
            <li> I suggest buying these plates as your first getting into stamping, as the listing doesn&#x27;t give exact details on what plates will be include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I think these are pretty fun.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> There is only one plate in the set that at first glance I would never use, and many I&#x27;d never thought about using, but will have fun playing with.  </li>
            <li> not sure the best way to organize them though, since there&#x27;s so many.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to find a little binder book to fit them nicely to be viewed individually, rather than stacking them altogether.</li>
            <li> the design was very nice but the design isn&#x27;t deep enough on plate</li>
            <li> french manicure image, full nail images, small images like all kind of flowers, hearts, diff butterfly shapes, star designs, snow flacks, diff kind of bows and sooooo on....</li>
            <li> Good quality product except the scraper was a little bowed.</li>
            <li> some animals, fruits, alphabets, numbers, cute animal faces,  cartoon characters, dance theme, some Chinese designs(which</li>
            <li> That was my first mistake.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> went with the bigger pack because it would be nicer to have more of the variety.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure I only got 99 plates..</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that covers most of the categories &amp; the various notables</li>
            <li> Just make sure to take the blue protector tape off of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to make one design on one plate work...</li>
            <li> I truly love this nail art stamping kit, it comes with 100 plates and like 1,000 designs in total.</li>
            <li> plate C06, 69 M plates (I think these are the KONAD ones) m1-m85, and 7 S plates numbers 2-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are flowers and leafs, ocean animals and shells, bubbles, butterflies, most of the horoscopes, hearts, animals, tropical, lace, tips galore, designs like fluer de lis,  flames, Halloween, Christmas,  Asian style animals, a girl in a kimono, Asian characters/letters, umbrella, heels and belt, stripes, candy, all caps letters and numbers, snowflakes, animal print, fairies, bows, champagne, steaming mug, gambling stuff, ballerinas, cheer, fruit, fishnet, hounds tooth, plaid, instruments, necklaces, feathers, lips, eagles, birds, and more.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and thought for a first time stamping kit it would work out.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are trying out stamping for the first time.</li>
            <li> There are some EXACT duplicates to Konad plates in this set (of 100)</li>
            <li> This is my first stamping set</li>
            <li> I checked out how to videos first.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know where to stat first.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get more use out of them and you won&#x27;t have to worry about having 2 or 3 of the same designs.</li>
            <li> Love the designs, out of 100 plates, I received only one duplicate.  </li>
            <li> Love all the different images and the plates I have used have stamped well.</li>
            <li> I clean it for every impression to get crisp clear</li>
            <li> Well it turns out that you really do not have to use that certain kind of polish.</li>
            <li> The price is great, but the etchings are too shallow.</li>
            <li> The plain french tip plate still comes out too light, but it gives me a good template to just paint it on myself.  </li>
            <li> Without the protective blue plastic on them the plates can easily scratch.</li>
            <li> only upside is they came very quickly</li>
            <li> In all this was a very decent product/buy; I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> all in all, I think this is an ok purchase for a beginner set, but I would encourage you to invest in single plates that suite your taste.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for large plates, then these are not for you.</li>
            <li> Thank you for giving me this whole set of designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After reading and researching as much information as I could find on the internet, I felt ready to give it a go.  </li>
            <li> also shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> its a real at home item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now that its here, I&#x27;m having so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The name brand plates are much deeper.</li>
            <li> Now I can try them out and buy the real things of the  plates I really like.</li>
            <li> Allthe plates work very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the variety of the plates.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> One of the discs was bent so you can&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li> Cannot really rate as this is a Xmas gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Looks like cheaply made Chinese products that our country is bombarded with.</li>
            <li> They arrived fast.</li>
            <li> also a couple of the plates I received were really scratched up (see pictures).</li>
            <li> This set cost almost as much as the 4 Konad plates I bought when I started.  </li>
            <li> okay, although I do find the rubber area almost too small for some of the full nail designs.</li>
            <li> The package was damaged, so the plates were super cheap (about $16 for 89 plates--11 were missing).</li>
            <li> even though the price is cheap, consider the fact that you&#x27;re paying that much for (in my case) a single functional design.</li>
            <li> I only did a quick practice one with a single plate to see how they would do, and I am so far pleased.</li>
            <li> I tried more then half of the plates.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they&#x27;re rejects for slight quality flaws, though I don&#x27;t see many.  </li>
            <li> Love these, was short four discs but definitely</li>
            <li> I found this kit at a super discount store (Like a Big Lots).</li>
            <li> I was able to bend them back enough that the images still work.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is good as long as you have a different stamper to use.</li>
            <li> would say, this set has all kind of themes starting from Christmas, Halloween, 4th of july( not exactly</li>
            <li> But now i can say i have almost all famous konad plates even though they r not original.</li>
            <li> Lots of cute little patterns and images.</li>
            <li> and I got the same result, which was pretty much nothing or part of the design.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but it looks like the plates cute though it ice tried a few</li>
            <li> Just started stamping, bought a few plates at a convention and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> I am new to stamping, so I took a couple weeks to play with these and figure out if it was user error before I posted this review.  </li>
            <li> Esp if you are someone new to stamping.</li>
            <li> From New Years to Christmas, cheerleaders to ballerinas.</li>
            <li> The full nail plates are just wide enough for my thumbs, so I have to line them up just right, which takes some practice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few replica plates, but honestly its no big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter received a small nail art set with 5 discs for Christmas and wanted more.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 100 plate set, and I ended up with one exact duplicate and a couple duplicate designs on different plates.  </li>
            <li> I now have so many ideas I am not sure where to start.</li>
            <li> once I get my licence and start doing nails professionally!</li>
            <li> arrived in good condition, although a few of the plates must have slide around enough to scratch through the protective blue plastic.</li>
            <li> They work as they are supposed to as long as you have the right equipment and skill level.</li>
            <li> image came off pretty clear but not totally.</li>
            <li> There were lots of verities in the set including, holiday (Halloween, Xmas,valentine, st Patrick , Fourth of July , tips, full nail, Asian (tho</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t get it right the first few times).  </li>
            <li> After giving up on using ( As Seen on TV&#x27;s Hollywood Nails All in One Nail Art System) I stopped using the whole device and  noticed that just by only using the soft rubber stamper and a hard card like (debit or business card) as a scraper it gives better clearer results for nail designs.</li>
            <li> every 2-3 impression to get the image to come out clearly.</li>
            <li> The parts that did come off clear look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The images transfer clear.</li>
            <li> The stamper works well and the scraper was put aside since we use an old credit card, which works well.</li>
            <li> I am using a old credit card.</li>
            <li> (and the 5duplicates)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the designsI&#x27;ve tried so far have worked well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far all the plates work well.</li>
            <li> So far, I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I ruined a natural nail and roughed up three others unwrapping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am using an old plastic card.</li>
            <li> The old man asked me if I was buying bricks off Amazon.</li>
            <li> There is such a variety that I&#x27;ll definitely be inspired and have fun playing with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While the stamper is questionable the etching on these plates is good and the images stamp</li>
            <li> I thought only the konad special polish would work properly, so I ordered the white polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the plates (along with my Konad stamper/scraper) already, and I found the quality of the image to be exactly the same as my official Konad plates.</li>
            <li> it comes with isn&#x27;t as useless as I feared, though it isn&#x27;t the best either &amp; is very firm.</li>
            <li> additional plates did contain either a tip or a full plate design among the other smaller</li>
            <li> They range from full nail designs, single tip and single images.</li>
            <li> I got 4 duplicates and one triplicate, so 6 extra, but I received 102 plates, so I still have 96 new plates.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to new nail stamping artists.</li>
            <li> I expected some duplicates, in a random lot for this price, and 5 is a number I can be happy about.</li>
            <li> several whole nail coverage stamps, nail tip stamps, and individual designs.  </li>
            <li> Delivered on time and product was exactly what I expected, Thank you!</li>
            <li> The plates ARE NOT backed and are pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li> The designs I got included a lot of flowers, scrolls, lace, bows, hearts, vegas, cowboy, cheer, dance, playing cards, numbers, alphabet, Chinese symbols, music notes, instruments, nail tips both plain and detailed (stripes, stars, zebra)</li>
            <li> Most plates have 7 designs (smaller)  but the least on one plate is 5 desgns (4 full nail &amp; 1 small).  </li>
            <li> I found the stamper provided did not transfer well until I ran a large file over it and made the surface rough.</li>
            <li> Just do NOT forget to remove the protective clear or blue film that is covering the stamping</li>
            <li> I also recommend removing the clear blue plastic which is on the plates before using them!</li>
            <li> Pure ice silver or other metallic color polish work for stamping.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have konad special polish but wet n wild white, black</li>
            <li> Right now I have a plate that had little Asian cartoon characters that I&#x27;m wearing now.</li>
            <li> I tried them out a little today after receiving them and the designs come out crisp.</li>
            <li> There are designs for little girls as well as mature designs for the older buyers.</li>
            <li> Use an old gift card or similar flat plastic piece as a scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that if you get these you also have a storage case because if these are sliding around together the sharp edges will etch your plates.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and the plates were in very good condition, but the plastic bag that the plates and stamper came in was torn and in bad condition and the stamper was dried out and hard and could not be used for stamping at all.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and each plate would fit a little under the size of my palm, about 2 inches across.</li>
            <li> The edges are really rough but not sharp enough to cut myself on.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that I don&#x27;t think I could order it again without probably ending up with many of the same plates.</li>
            <li> A couple of them did look like the graving machine went a little too deep because you can clearly see bits of copper plating.</li>
            <li> Some of the edges were a little jagged, so I just took an old nail file and smoothed them out a bit.</li>
            <li> If you are having trouble getting the image to clearly transfer from the plate just roughen the stamper (not the plate) with a nail file and then rinse under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean the plate with q-tip and acetone</li>
            <li> so be careful and remove blue protective plastic before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know its long review but hope it helps for searching the plates that you want.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> The sides can be sharp and slice your finger open</li>
            <li> There are lots of flowers, but there are also a lot of other themes too such as a marine plate, letters, animals, and holidays.</li>
            <li> and the scraper is definitely too sharp like everyone else</li>
            <li> I do have several duplicate plates, so that is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> Another issue I have is the prints that are designed to cover the entire nail are not wide enough to cover the entire thumb nail which is incredibly frustrating.</li>
            <li> Some plates have small etchings far away from the designs.  </li>
            <li> but I would say out of 100 plates I would say this happened only around 4 times or less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results can be terrific, with just a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I gave the product two stars because it arrived fast, but I had multiple duplicates, and it is really difficult to get them to work.</li>
            <li> i saw few image same as konad.</li>
            <li> When one of her techs left their salon, she took quite a few of the stamp plates with her leaving us with only a few choices</li>
            <li> so when you scrape the nail polish jus smears across only a few design work</li>
            <li> You can choose one design or mix a few depending how big your nail bed is.</li>
            <li> Halloween, Christmas, geometric designs, slot machine, crown, snowflake, palm tree, Hawaii, skull &amp; cross bones, butterflies, klissy lips, 1 fruit plate-grapes, apple,  a few fish, roses.  </li>
            <li> The sticky blue covering was a little harder to get off than on other brands I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> The discs are sharp on the edges, so be careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time buyers, get this one and you wont need any other plates.</li>
            <li> I resolved that issue by using 2 stampers and transferring the image from one stamper to the other before I stamp it on my finger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;$35 / 100 plates vs other name brands</li>
            <li> I went with one of my other stampers.</li>
            <li> I think it was a little bit selfish of me, but she started screaming and dancing right there in her salon.</li>
            <li> seeing how easily the backs of them scratched just by being loose in the box, I&#x27;d hate to see the damage the scraper would do with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to mark down for the scraper, which is metal.</li>
            <li> The plates do not have a backing, so they can be a little sharp around the edges, and they can scratch each other a little bit in the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have a few plates from other companies and these work just as well.  </li>
            <li> also ordered a Konad stamp in anticipation for trouble with the stamp in this set, based on the other reviews.</li>
            <li> These plates cost less than .30c each.</li>
            <li> but thats half the</li>
            <li> Two of the discs were slightly bent.</li>
            <li> Makes this set a little sharp edged for the little ones to use.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed as the bag was ripped open so the plates were scattered in the box, thank god for the blue protective layer or else they would have been totally scratched.</li>
            <li> I filed it a little and washed it off.</li>
            <li> I scratched up the rubber stamper a little with an emory board to help pick up the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband fishes and there are little plastic dividers for his tackle boxes</li>
            <li> Some are very delicate and hard to see unless using black nail polish or white on a dark background.</li>
            <li> Another plate that had a few additional halloween designs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does need to be buffed firmly with a medium nail file before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a few times now</li>
            <li> it was missing 2 plates</li>
            <li> there were a few duplicates</li>
            <li> The stamper/scraper were also missing, so I cannot provide a review of those.</li>
            <li> There are a few designs that are repeated on a few plates</li>
            <li> A few repeats, but out of 100 plates, this girl isn&#x27;t complaining.</li>
            <li> No duplicate plates and a few duplicate designs.</li>
            <li> First I applied my desired nail polish which serves as a base for my nails, letting it dry for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> But, when it comes to applying them, the process is hard until you get it down pat.</li>
            <li> Im not pleased.</li>
            <li> I either get a small part of the design, or nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Scraper sucks but</li>
            <li> the stamper sucks &#x3D;/&lt;br</li>
            <li> no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very small</li>
            <li> there are a few that have some weird little designs on them!!</li>
            <li> Also, there were some weird ones in there, but that just means theres a little something for everyone.</li>
            <li> This is not good at all don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> I was disappointed as this product only works with some nail polish brands.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the stamp indent on the plates were on the wrong side or if I just got a defective batch</li>
            <li> It is very hard to stamp.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s close, but it still is a bit disappointing that I was told I was paying for 100 plates and received less.</li>
            <li> ohh i got tired...</li>
            <li> the plastic was broken, I lost the accessories and the discs were damaged</li>
            <li> I also found out that even if you do use a thin polish it will still work.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re almost as addicted as I am</li>
            <li> I just got into stamping and have both as seen on TV sets, as well as a couple random plates from miniinthebox.</li>
            <li> Once I removed the tape, they didn&#x27;t appear too bad, but some of the scratches go over some of the designs rendering them useless.</li>
            <li> I am so obsessed with this set!</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> Lots of duplicates :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have 11 duplicates of one of my plates :(</li>
            <li> Terrible!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed do not buy!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this plates bcoz i saw few image same as konad. I got 100 plates for $30. I am very very excited and happy. I tried more then half of the plates. So far all worked perfectly. Highly recommend this set to everyone, as you get the same image plate like konad and most important is they all give result with very fine details on images.&lt;br /&gt;I would say, this set has all kind of themes starting from Christmas, Halloween, 4th of july( not exactly but you can use for that), musical instruments, cheer leader, casino&#x27;s theme, all sun sign, Hawaii related, diff. Fish for under water scene, beach stuff like tree n some animals, fruits, alphabets, numbers, cute animal faces,  cartoon characters, dance theme, some Chinese designs(which i don&#x27;t understand), french manicure image, full nail images, small images like all kind of flowers, hearts, diff butterfly shapes, star designs, snow flacks, diff kind of bows and sooooo on....ohh i got tired...haha, i got all kind of plates that i can think of. Super excited and very happy. Thank you for giving me this whole set of designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always wanted to have konad plates bcoz of their designs but couldn&#x27;t buy it bcoz of their price. But now i can say i have almost all famous konad plates even though they r not original. With $30 if i go for konad, i could buy 5-6 plates and now i have 100 plates.&lt;br /&gt;Oh my god i cant say how satisfied i am, now i don&#x27;t need any more plates, as i have all different kind of plates for each festival n diff themes.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and i got scraper n stamper with this set. Scraper sucks but stamper is gud.&lt;br /&gt;No paper backing on the back of the plates so be careful and remove blue protective plastic before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time buyers, get this one and you wont need any other plates. And all this plates work fine.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have konad special polish but wet n wild white, black worked for me. Its not that opaque but it gives nice image n looks nice on nails that&#x27;s what we want right.!!! Pure ice silver or other metallic color polish work for stamping.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps to everyone. I know its long review but hope it helps for searching the plates that you want.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you once again for this product.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely amazing for the price. Best deal period. I got the 100 plate set. There were 3 duplicate plates, but that is ok. Since I will share them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips to make stamping easier with these plates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MUST remove the blue protective sheeting on the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use the included scraper. Metal scratches the plates. Use an old gift card or similar flat plastic piece as a scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included stamper is fine. If you are having trouble getting the image to clearly transfer from the plate just roughen the stamper (not the plate) with a nail file and then rinse under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean the plate with q-tip and acetone every 2-3 impression to get the image to come out clearly. I clean it for every impression to get crisp clear lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT store your plates all together in one big bag. Without the protective blue plastic on them the plates can easily scratch. Store them in separate Ziploc bags or in a CD holder or photo album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this set (the 100 set) is an amazing value. The plates are great quality, and they have many of the same images as the popular Konad plates. These plates cost less than .30c each. The Konad plates are almost 7 dollars on their website. I suggest buying these plates as your first getting into stamping, as the listing doesn&#x27;t give exact details on what plates will be include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Lots of duplicates :(&lt;br /&gt; I have 11 duplicates of one of my plates :(</li>
            <li> Just do NOT forget to remove the protective clear or blue film that is covering the stamping images!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t give up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results can be terrific, with just a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try watching tutorials on YouTube, search nail stamping to get started.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed as this product only works with some nail polish brands. When you do find a brand it works well with the results are great! I found the stamper provided did not transfer well until I ran a large file over it and made the surface rough.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift to my nail tech. I think it was a little bit selfish of me, but she started screaming and dancing right there in her salon. When one of her techs left their salon, she took quite a few of the stamp plates with her leaving us with only a few choices and I missed them. I ordered her 100 plates for cheap. I only put 4 stars because despite the claim of no duplicates, there were a couple. So I got 98 plates. I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t use all of them in my lifetime! Also, there were some weird ones in there, but that just means theres a little something for everyone. Not everyone likes flowers and scrollwork like me! I also gave her an organizer designed to hold these plates. She was in nail tech heaven!</li>
            <li> I am having issues getting the image to be picked up from the plate. Yes I took off the blue skin, I &amp;#34;prepared&amp;#34; the stamper. I also bought a different stamper and I got the same result, which was pretty much nothing or part of the design.&lt;br /&gt;The only upside is they came very quickly</li>
            <li> 100 plates and only 1 duplicate the package was opened when I got it but it looks like the plates cute though it ice tried a few and they work fine :)</li>
            <li> My daughter received a small nail art set with 5 discs for Christmas and wanted more. I purchased the 100 piece set. There were 6 duplicates in the pack and the discs with writing on them are not in mirrored image so that when they are transferred they can&#x27;t be read. I resolved that issue by using 2 stampers and transferring the image from one stamper to the other before I stamp it on my finger. You have to be quick, but it works. The discs are sharp on the edges, so be careful. I have them stored in the Pueen leather case. I use a credit card to help pull them out and push them in so my daughter or I don&#x27;t get any cuts. There is a nice assortment of images. Some are very delicate and hard to see unless using black nail polish or white on a dark background. I wish there were more holiday or winter themed discs. There are a lot of flowers, hearts and butterflies. We are happy with the assortment for the price and we received them very quickly. The stamper works well and the scraper was put aside since we use an old credit card, which works well.</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping, so I took a couple weeks to play with these and figure out if it was user error before I posted this review.  After reading and researching as much information as I could find on the internet, I felt ready to give it a go.  I had read that you could use regular nail polish for stamping, so I didn&#x27;t order any stamping polish when I ordered these.  That was my first mistake.  I couldn&#x27;t get a very good stamp with regular nail polish, if I got it to stamp at all.  So I ordered some stamping polish, and suddenly was much more successful.  The plain french tip plate still comes out too light, but it gives me a good template to just paint it on myself.  The full nail plates are just wide enough for my thumbs, so I have to line them up just right, which takes some practice.  I ordered the 100 plate set, and I ended up with one exact duplicate and a couple duplicate designs on different plates.  For the price, I am definitely more than satisfied.  They work as they are supposed to as long as you have the right equipment and skill level.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with this.</li>
            <li> Package was ripped open upon receipt and plates were all over the place.  It was for my daughters BDAY on 24 December &amp; no time to return.  Plates were all scratched as if they had been used.  Reaffirms buying from the store where you can see the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further -- I just threw them on the counter and the kids tried to make them work, they don&#x27;t.  Maybe because the ones I have are scratched to pieces.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got them in the mail I opened them. I was a bit disappointed as the bag was ripped open so the plates were scattered in the box, thank god for the blue protective layer or else they would have been totally scratched. I counted them and luckily they are all still there :) I only did a quick practice one with a single plate to see how they would do, and I am so far pleased. I will agree wholeheartedly to not using the included scraper...seeing how easily the backs of them scratched just by being loose in the box, I&#x27;d hate to see the damage the scraper would do with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image came off pretty clear but not totally. In the manufacturers defense, I have never used stamping plates before today and probably do not have the technique down yet, so I will update this review once I have more practice :) The parts that did come off clear look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love these nail stamping plates. I only had 2 that were duplicates. Some of them were actual konad plates. The variety is amazing. I have christmas designs and Halloween ones too. Now, about the stamper. When I first tried it, it didn&#x27;t work at all. I filed it a little and washed it off. It works pretty good now. And the scraper. I don&#x27;t recomend using the provided one. It does scratch the plate. I am using a old credit card. It works perfect. Now lets get to the polish. I thought only the konad special polish would work properly, so I ordered the white polish. Well it turns out that you really do not have to use that certain kind of polish. I have used sinful colors, and a couple from the dollar store and they work just as well. All in all, it is just a try it and see what happens. I&#x27;m still new to the whole stamping process, but the more you do it, the better you get.</li>
            <li> the plastic was broken, I lost the accessories and the discs were damaged</li>
            <li> price was great! item is wonderful. went with the bigger pack because it would be nicer to have more of the variety. I had a few plates that were repeats but not enough to really make a difference. so many designs to choose from. also shipping was fast. great product and great service.</li>
            <li> Fantastic plates, they work great, but I did have multiples of about 10 plates.</li>
            <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. its a real at home item. a number of unusable plates and many duplicated. but a great price. i trade the duplicates with others that have different duplicates</li>
            <li> Good for the value, the plates are very nice. the stamper sucks &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;Some plates are scratched but for as many as your getting its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I also had 4 plates with repeats and I&#x27;m pretty sure I only got 99 plates.. Unless I lost one somewhere while counting them.</li>
            <li> I give this a 3 star because theres a lot of duplicates. But they do work just fine</li>
            <li> buy this product you will have fun with your kids or just doing your own nails. this is a must buy</li>
            <li> I gave 1 star cause the design was very nice but the design isn&#x27;t deep enough on plate so when you scrape the nail polish jus smears across only a few design work</li>
            <li> Took Amazon forever to ship, though it arrived when predicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that its here, I&#x27;m having so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 100 plate set. Of the 100 plates, only 5 were duplicates! I expected some duplicates, in a random lot for this price, and 5 is a number I can be happy about. I&#x27;ll pass them on to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived in good condition, although a few of the plates must have slide around enough to scratch through the protective blue plastic. None of the designs seem to have been effected however &amp; it was only 3 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a good variety of designs. Each plate contains 5-8 designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 plates were French Tip designs.&lt;br /&gt;8 plates were full nail designs (four each) with one additional tip design&lt;br /&gt;Some additional plates did contain either a tip or a full plate design among the other smaller designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got lots of different types of flowers.&lt;br /&gt;Some fish/shells/water designs.&lt;br /&gt;Two plates of astrological designs.&lt;br /&gt;Two plates with the letters of the alphabets. One with numbers.&lt;br /&gt;I got a Christmas &amp; a Halloween plate. Another plate that had a few additional halloween designs.&lt;br /&gt;Butterflies, bows, animals, some cartoons.&lt;br /&gt;A plate of Chinese symbols.&lt;br /&gt;Some hello kitty style designs.&lt;br /&gt;A geisha girl&lt;br /&gt;And  umbrella&lt;br /&gt;Dance/music designs&lt;br /&gt;Fashion designs (buttons, purse, shoes, belt)&lt;br /&gt;Fruit&lt;br /&gt;A California themed plate&lt;br /&gt;A Hawaii themed plate&lt;br /&gt;The cards/gambling style plate you can see in the picture. (in fact, both the visible plates).&lt;br /&gt;A cheerleading plate (I&#x27;ll be giving that away)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that covers most of the categories &amp; the various notables I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;If it helps, I received plates labeled; AT02-AT12, B24, B26, B31, B56, B86, B89, B91, B99, B115, B117, S2, S4, S6-S10, C06, M1-M10, M12-M42, M44- M45, M48, M50, M51, M53-M59, M62-M65, M67-M69, M73, M75, M77, M80, M82, M84-M85. (and the 5duplicates)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the designsI&#x27;ve tried so far have worked well.&lt;br /&gt;The stamper it comes with isn&#x27;t as useless as I feared, though it isn&#x27;t the best either &amp; is very firm. It does need to be buffed firmly with a medium nail file before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These plates were a great deal &amp; I&#x27;m quite happy. My only disappointment is that I don&#x27;t think I could order it again without probably ending up with many of the same plates.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;There are a few replica plates, but honestly its no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;They can be used as a gift package for someone who likes to do their own nails.&lt;br /&gt;$35 / 100 plates vs other name brands $5 / plate &#x3D; no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very small so they don&#x27;t take up a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the best way to organize them though, since there&#x27;s so many.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to find a little binder book to fit them nicely to be viewed individually, rather than stacking them altogether.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and product was exactly what I expected, Thank you!</li>
            <li> Thanks, because the plates are excellent.</li>
            <li> Lots of cute little patterns and images. Just make sure to take the blue protector tape off of them. I didn&#x27;t  know that the blue stuff came off and was wondering how they were going to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and it&#x27;s turned out fine. I scratched up the rubber stamper a little with an emory board to help pick up the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gets a 4 out of 5 stars because the stamper arrived cracked.</li>
            <li> So far all the plates work well. It does depend on the polish used for stamping, but the majority of my regular nail polish collection work. The stamper works for me okay, although I do find the rubber area almost too small for some of the full nail designs. I received 101 plates, but two were duplicates and a couple of the plates had similar individual designs. Overall these were a great deal and a fun way to start my nail art collection.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this set for the price! I read the reviews of others before purchase, and figured it was worth the risk. I did have about 6 dupes, and one that repeated thrice. But even with those repeats, there are a ton of cute images to choose from. There are so many plates that I was able to give many away for gifts. Some of the edges were a little jagged, so I just took an old nail file and smoothed them out a bit. This will provide many fun mani options!</li>
            <li> nice easy to use, not all nailpolish works great with it but thats half the,fun  WARNING !!! The sides can be sharp and slice your finger open so be carefull</li>
            <li> The price is great, but the etchings are too shallow. I ordered some name brand plates to compare with these and the difference is obvious. The name brand plates are much deeper. I&#x27;ve only been able to make one design on one plate work...even though the price is cheap, consider the fact that you&#x27;re paying that much for (in my case) a single functional design.</li>
            <li> AMAZING DEAL!!! Only received 5 plates that were duplicates to others in the pack. Can&#x27;t beat the price though so it was definitely worth it. Plus it arrived quicker than expected and the stamper and scraper work perfectly</li>
            <li> I truly love this nail art stamping kit, it comes with 100 plates and like 1,000 designs in total. I will have designs here for the rest of my life. It is easy to do and fun also. There are so many designs to choose from and to make up. You can choose one design or mix a few depending how big your nail bed is.</li>
            <li> I bought the 100 plate set. I am not disappointed.  I have a few plates from other companies and these work just as well.  The designs I got included a lot of flowers, scrolls, lace, bows, hearts, vegas, cowboy, cheer, dance, playing cards, numbers, alphabet, Chinese symbols, music notes, instruments, nail tips both plain and detailed (stripes, stars, zebra) Halloween, Christmas, geometric designs, slot machine, crown, snowflake, palm tree, Hawaii, skull &amp; cross bones, butterflies, klissy lips, 1 fruit plate-grapes, apple,  a few fish, roses.  Most plates have 7 designs (smaller)  but the least on one plate is 5 desgns (4 full nail &amp; 1 small).  I did not have any repeats.  I bought an open package for 28.00 it was missing 2 plates but I am thrilled!</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and the plates were in very good condition, but the plastic bag that the plates and stamper came in was torn and in bad condition and the stamper was dried out and hard and could not be used for stamping at all. Luckily I had also purchased a stamping kit from another company and was able to use that for my stamping. Overall this product is good as long as you have a different stamper to use.</li>
            <li> This set was awesome!!!!! I got the 100 set, no duplicates! All the plates were in good condition (no scratches or dings) all had the blue film on them and were handled and shipped promptly(thanx Reno amazon crew!) the designs are more detailed than anticipated.  There were lots of verities in the set including, holiday (Halloween, Xmas,valentine, st Patrick , Fourth of July , tips, full nail, Asian (tho I have no clue what they say) alphabet (2 plates), numbers, zodiac (2 plates), animals, flowers,  knock off sponge bob, hearts, bows, Vegas, Hawaii, California, butterflies, see animals, fruit, music, dance, cheerleading, sewing, shoes, and then some! The plates stamp awesome and the included stamp work well, tho like others I don&#x27;t use a metal scraper on mine. I just got into stamping and have both as seen on TV sets, as well as a couple random plates from miniinthebox. With this set I won&#x27;t need to buy any more large lots but can pick up a special plate here and there.  Everyone I have over to play nails love the variety, everyone can find one they like. For the price this is the best deal out there.  I am tempted to buy another set and take my chances on doubles. I can not say enough good things about it. I am so obsessed with this set!</li>
            <li> there were a few duplicates but overall the product was as described. Good quality product except the scraper was a little bowed. Old credit card or drivers license works better.</li>
            <li> I bought the 100 plate set and only had 3 repeats. The plates have gorgeous designs. There are lots of flowers, but there are also a lot of other themes too such as a marine plate, letters, animals, and holidays. Since my kit just came 3 days ago, I haven&#x27;t gotten around to using all the plates but I&#x27;ve had no problems with the ones that I have used. I did not use the scraper that came with the set because I want to avoid scratching the plates. However, a plastic gift card works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered a Konad stamp in anticipation for trouble with the stamp in this set, based on the other reviews. However, my Konad stamp hasn&#x27;t arrived yet so I&#x27;ve been using this stamp. So far, I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Love these, was short four discs but definitely worth the money anyway</li>
            <li> these are good plates. Esp if you are someone new to stamping. All of these plates are dupes of the great konad. I bought 100 plates and only had six duplicates. Now I can try them out and buy the real things of the  plates I really like. Allthe plates work very well. Now four had come with no blue coating and where scratched, That didn&#x27;t stop them from working right. I had to mark down for the scraper, which is metal. Throw it away and use a gift card as a scraper.</li>
            <li> I bought the 100 set.  I got 4 duplicates and one triplicate, so 6 extra, but I received 102 plates, so I still have 96 new plates.  The plates ARE NOT backed and are pretty sharp.  The sticky blue covering was a little harder to get off than on other brands I&#x27;ve bought.  I highly recommend that if you get these you also have a storage case because if these are sliding around together the sharp edges will etch your plates. I ruined a natural nail and roughed up three others unwrapping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stamping quality is perfect.  I didn&#x27;t use the included stamp and I don&#x27;t think I will after messing with it and the scraper is definitely too sharp like everyone else says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of these are very similar to the KONAD plates.  I wonder if they&#x27;re rejects for slight quality flaws, though I don&#x27;t see many.  Some plates have small etchings far away from the designs.  There is only one plate in the set that at first glance I would never use, and many I&#x27;d never thought about using, but will have fun playing with.  There is such a variety that I&#x27;ll definitely be inspired and have fun playing with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it varies a lot from set to set, but here&#x27;s what I got.  The two designs I was hoping for but didn&#x27;t get were a mustache and chevron pattern.  I received 10 AT plates numbers 02-12, 9 B plates numbers 24-117, plate C06, 69 M plates (I think these are the KONAD ones) m1-m85, and 7 S plates numbers 2-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are flowers and leafs, ocean animals and shells, bubbles, butterflies, most of the horoscopes, hearts, animals, tropical, lace, tips galore, designs like fluer de lis,  flames, Halloween, Christmas,  Asian style animals, a girl in a kimono, Asian characters/letters, umbrella, heels and belt, stripes, candy, all caps letters and numbers, snowflakes, animal print, fairies, bows, champagne, steaming mug, gambling stuff, ballerinas, cheer, fruit, fishnet, hounds tooth, plaid, instruments, necklaces, feathers, lips, eagles, birds, and more.</li>
            <li> It is really cool to use. This pack has everything you could ever want. I recommend buying this instead of individual plates in smaller packs because this pack has everything you could think of.</li>
            <li> Great set for the price! The plastic package the plates come in was ripped when it arrived but thats no big deal, you have to get into it somehow! I really like the variety of the plates. Really good value.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, very happy buyer! (:</li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday in the mail and was super excited about it. I read the reviews before purchasing this product and thought for a first time stamping kit it would work out. So I ended up purchasing the 100 stamp plate set. It came with 101 plates and only 4 of them were duplicates. Not too bad. A couple of them did look like the graving machine went a little too deep because you can clearly see bits of copper plating. I don&#x27;t think any was through the design thought. I would recommend this product if you are trying out stamping for the first time. There is a lot of different designs on each plate. Majority of the ones I received I would use. Right now I have a plate that had little Asian cartoon characters that I&#x27;m wearing now. I also found out that even if you do use a thin polish it will still work. It was easy to transfer the patterns using a plastic card instead of the scraper, which was had a whop-sided blade. If you are looking for large plates, then these are not for you. I have small hands and each plate would fit a little under the size of my palm, about 2 inches across. In all this was a very decent product/buy; I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I did however, have 8 doubles and 2 triple plates. The stamper worked perfectly, I was worried about it, from reading the reviews, but I had no issue with it and used it right out of the package. The images came out beautifully on my nails. I cannot stop looking at them &amp;#60;3 . Thank you!</li>
            <li> I found this kit at a super discount store (Like a Big Lots). The package was damaged, so the plates were super cheap (about $16 for 89 plates--11 were missing). The stamper/scraper were also missing, so I cannot provide a review of those. The plates do not have a backing, so they can be a little sharp around the edges, and they can scratch each other a little bit in the packaging. There are some EXACT duplicates to Konad plates in this set (of 100) so I was VERY excited to score these so cheap. I&#x27;ve used several of the plates (along with my Konad stamper/scraper) already, and I found the quality of the image to be exactly the same as my official Konad plates. I do have several duplicate plates, so that is kind of annoying. Still, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat these!</li>
            <li> Terrible!! I got mine scratched and used!!! Disappointed do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the many designs it has. From New Years to Christmas, cheerleaders to ballerinas. The stamper works great, the scraper seems great but I do not want to scratch the plates so I am using an old plastic card. There are designs for little girls as well as mature designs for the older buyers. I dont seem to have a complain. There was 100 plates and well I believe I have my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetology student and I just love these plates. I got my friends some and they&#x27;re almost as addicted as I am</li>
            <li> So I only got 99 discs and two or three of them were duplicates but I really don&#x27;t care as the price was amazing.  One of the discs was bent so you can&#x27;t really use it but it was a duplicate so again - I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the rubber pad or the scraper that came with these - I use the real Konad ones that came with my original set as they work much better.  But the discs are absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I got the 100 piece set. They sent me 102 and of those 5 were duplicates, that leaves me 97. The edges are really rough but not sharp enough to cut myself on. I was worried about that. Two of the discs were slightly bent. I was able to bend them back enough that the images still work. I buffed the stamper before I used it and was able to transfer designs. I did go ahead and ordered the konad stamper. Every plate I&#x27;ve tried so far works great. I don&#x27;t use the scraper I don&#x27;t want to scratch my plates. The credit card was too flimsy...so, I looked around the house for an alternative. My husband fishes and there are little plastic dividers for his tackle boxes, those worked perfectly! This is my first stamping set and I was surprised at how easy it was to use. I checked out how to videos first. That seemed to help.</li>
            <li> This package weighs a ton! The old man asked me if I was buying bricks off Amazon. The stamper in this set is ok ish for getting started. It isn&#x27;t the best but will do in a pinch. I went with one of my other stampers. The scraper in this kit should never be used!!!! its metal and will damage the plates. The plates themselves offer so many designs it had me giddy! I didn&#x27;t know where to stat first. There are a few designs that are repeated on a few plates but I would say out of 100 plates I would say this happened only around 4 times or less. While the stamper is questionable the etching on these plates is good and the images stamp well. Great for beginning a collection or adding to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for a discounted price in exchange for review.</li>
            <li> Recieved this item in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great set. A few repeats, but out of 100 plates, this girl isn&#x27;t complaining. Everything was in great condition and arrived quickly, I&#x27;ve used the feather and the butterfly so far and they both came out perfectly!</li>
            <li> 100 plates for $30 not bad deal at all.  Has several designs to choose.  several whole nail coverage stamps, nail tip stamps, and individual designs.  it takes a bit to work it.  but once you have the practice it works great.  I also purchased the stamping plate leather holder that holds up to 168 plates.  great way to store all together.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted !!! This shipping was sooooo quick ! It was perfect !</li>
            <li> It says that there are 100 different plates in this set and I got a lot of the same plates. Way too many flower and vine designs. They just weren&#x27;t different. Im not pleased.</li>
            <li> I received my item today and I love it. The images transfer clear. I didn&#x27;t use the stamper and scraper provided. I use my own XL stamper and a credit card and it works fine. I received out of the 100 plates, 4 that were repeated... I contact customer service and they help me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great purchase!!!</li>
            <li> After giving up on using ( As Seen on TV&#x27;s Hollywood Nails All in One Nail Art System) I stopped using the whole device and  noticed that just by only using the soft rubber stamper and a hard card like (debit or business card) as a scraper it gives better clearer results for nail designs. I&#x27;m really happy to discover that this option is waaaaaay easier and faster to do your nails. First I applied my desired nail polish which serves as a base for my nails, letting it dry for 20 minutes. After then applying the wet nail polish on the design you want you must scrape lightly  and stamp the design fast so the design can be picked up from the rubber stamper, then gently place the stamper on the nails and you will have a really cute design without having to go to a nail salon :)  . I also recommend removing the clear blue plastic which is on the plates before using them! I even posted a design I just finished where I used brown nail polish with a black rose design in which I also post on instagram  :)</li>
            <li> Cannot really rate as this is a Xmas gift for my daughter. Looks like cheaply made Chinese products that our country is bombarded with.</li>
            <li> Only 4 duplicate plates out of 100!  They work well!  Reminder to remove the blue plastic protective covers from the plates before using.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Some plates were repeated and others are not indented enough for the polish to stay within the grooves but overall beautiful plates</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase. I tried them out a little today after receiving them and the designs come out crisp. I was happy to find that I did not receive one duplicate out of the 100 that I purchased. I now have so many ideas I am not sure where to start. This is a great addition to my nail art supplies, and will be awesome to have once I get my licence and start doing nails professionally!</li>
            <li> I think these are pretty fun. I got the 100 plate set and I was happy to find that I did not get any duplicate plates. They range from full nail designs, single tip and single images. Big variety.</li>
            <li> This is not good at all don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> I got this just for the plates. It was a great starter set to play with.</li>
            <li> Good quality designs on the stamp plates.  No duplicate plates and a few duplicate designs.</li>
            <li> It has some good designs but I have duplicate of some plates</li>
            <li> I ordered the 100 plate set and only got 9 duplicates!  The stamper that comes with the set I am having really good luck with (I also ordered the Konad double ended stamper).  It just takes some practice (I didn&#x27;t get it right the first few times).  I don&#x27;t use the scrapers but instead a credit card.  The Pueen Super slim stamping plate case works awesome with this set.  I definitely recommend this to new nail stamping artists.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to stamp. The plates themselves are awesome! They arrived fast. There is a nice variety of images. But, when it comes to applying them, the process is hard until you get it down pat. Obviously I still need to practice.</li>
            <li> The package advertises 100 plates. I only got 93. I know it&#x27;s close, but it still is a bit disappointing that I was told I was paying for 100 plates and received less. Of the 93 plates I got, I would say that I would use 80 of them...there are a few that have some weird little designs on them!!</li>
            <li> I gave the product two stars because it arrived fast, but I had multiple duplicates, and it is really difficult to get them to work. I&#x27;ve tried several different polish brands and different stamps to pick up the design. I either get a small part of the design, or nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Many of the stamps were duplicates of others and there was no chevron, browning symbol, or fleur de le stamps</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the stamp indent on the plates were on the wrong side or if I just got a defective batch but when I tried, on multiple plates multiple times, the polish did not soak into the plate so that I could stamp. I used the scraper provided and a credit card and each time the polish/paint was wiped clean off the plates. I returned with no problem and got a refund.</li>
            <li> Excellent stamping plates.  Lots of motifs to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love this item I was so happy to receive this.</li>
            <li> You get alot of plates for your money, but I got several duplicate plates. also a couple of the plates I received were really scratched up (see pictures). Once I removed the tape, they didn&#x27;t appear too bad, but some of the scratches go over some of the designs rendering them useless. Another issue I have is the prints that are designed to cover the entire nail are not wide enough to cover the entire thumb nail which is incredibly frustrating. the stamper and scraper worked great for me, but I still ordered a seperate bigger stamper for better handling. all in all, I think this is an ok purchase for a beginner set, but I would encourage you to invest in single plates that suite your taste. You&#x27;ll get more use out of them and you won&#x27;t have to worry about having 2 or 3 of the same designs.</li>
            <li> Just started stamping, bought a few plates at a convention and fell in love.  This set cost almost as much as the 4 Konad plates I bought when I started.  Love the designs, out of 100 plates, I received only one duplicate.  So worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love all the different images and the plates I have used have stamped well. What kept tis set from five stars was no backer papers. Makes this set a little sharp edged for the little ones to use.</li>
