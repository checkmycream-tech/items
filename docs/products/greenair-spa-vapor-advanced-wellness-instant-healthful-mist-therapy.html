            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Fantastic!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and produces a great vapor stream.</li>
            <li>They diffused my oils really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice machine.</li>
            <li>It works nicely.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, excellent product.  </li>
            <li>For a person who relies on these oils to make them feel &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;well&#x27;, you would think he output would be better.  </li>
            <li>Nice workn machine</li>
            <li>The shipping time was fast and the product was in excellent condition when we received it.</li>
            <li>Great product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite diffuser!!!</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully, diffuses a large area with scent easily.</li>
            <li>WORKS PERFECTLY AND IS NICE AND QUIET!</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made I do not suggest this product</li>
            <li>it gives very light puffs.  </li>
            <li>It feels very cheaply made and there are 3 pieces to put on after you put the oils and water inside.</li>
            <li>so seems to be something occurring more than I thought.</li>
            <li>and I love having it in the bedroom while sleeping.</li>
            <li>This is the best diffuser for essential oils that I have found.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that if I was using oil that was inexpensive the unit would clog quicker.</li>
            <li>All in all they are to be as advertised and what more can we expect.</li>
            <li>Love this...works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and the color lighting option is perfect for nighttime ambiance.  </li>
            <li>(the dome just sits on the top)</li>
            <li>I have 4 of these, and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer the vapor would be &#x27;more&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>and I just love them.  </li>
            <li>Have enjoyed our diffuser.  </li>
            <li>They love them.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to diffuse my essential oils and it works perfect for what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser-there are many on the market to choose from and this one is so reasonably priced and works great.</li>
            <li>and they do not work as well as these do I will be buying more</li>
            <li>so I can have one in every room of my house :)</li>
            <li>I love the ambiance this product creates with the lighting and the oils.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive my diffuser.</li>
            <li>I loved these when I first received them .</li>
            <li>I love the option of being able to turn off the night light.</li>
            <li>Working great so far.</li>
            <li>THAT IS TRUE CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
            <li>I received both very quickly .</li>
            <li>and I make sure to clean it after each use.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought 2 more to give as gifts with my oils.</li>
            <li>Immediately it was diffusing a strong mist.</li>
            <li>I notice with both brand diffusers we are using that the oil smell is very strong the first hour, but then becomes almost unnoticable after a while.  </li>
            <li>The oil is an important factor in the operation of the unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great for diffusing essential oils!</li>
            <li>Lasts longer when the led light is off.</li>
            <li>Looked cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice gentle mist and runs for hours.</li>
            <li>I had 2 of another brand that were a pain to keep clean, and both broke.  </li>
            <li>The power adapter does not have a good connection so the unit cannot work properly.</li>
            <li>I love them so much.  </li>
            <li>Colors are cool, but it doesn&#x27;t do what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li>I like that it is able to go all night long and that the light is able to turn off or on.</li>
            <li>Received the product quickly.</li>
            <li>After following the directions, my diffuser misted for just under two hours (without the light on) before it shut off on its own.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and just as advertised.</li>
            <li>Very nice, runs longer than the other model I have.</li>
            <li>The oil sits on top of the water, so it seems to get dispursed when it is first turned on, rather than being dispursed more evenly through the entire run time.  </li>
            <li>I bought two, one works great, the other didn&#x27;t work after the first week...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and effective.</li>
            <li>There are 2 tops to replace each time you replace the water, which gets old, but it makes it easy to clean, so definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I wish the company would make it right.</li>
            <li>One unit seems to work fine although the mist is not as strong as the first day even after cleaning and run time is only about 4-5 hrs.</li>
            <li>Very Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It begins working immediately when you turn it on and diffuses a nice steady stream for several hours.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my first diffuser</li>
            <li>I really like that you can use the light separate from the diffuser if you just need a night light for a short time.</li>
            <li>At this point I am pleased with the product, but I have only had it about a week.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I plan on buying several more for gifts.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought lasted over a year before it needed to be replaced, and that one was run every night at bedtime, and often two or three times a week during the day.</li>
            <li>These keep going strong, and I don&#x27;t have to baby them with the constant cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It is a work horse, really shooting out a large mist.</li>
            <li>Works well and is fast.</li>
            <li>A very NOTEWORTHY fact...</li>
            <li>I was weary when they finally showed because they do seen to be cheaply made</li>
            <li>My husband loves it and wants one in our room.</li>
            <li>My son loves his so much he was trying to turn it on before I got home from work and put too much water in it and no oil.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need the lights, that could be eliminated and could improve the output of the mist.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li>ONE OF THE ONLY DIFFUSERS I COULD FIND THAT GIVES YOU THE OPTION TO HAVE THE LIGHT ON OR OFF.</li>
            <li>They last almost all night filled up.</li>
            <li>( &amp; I really appreciate the Prime shipping )</li>
            <li>Has really helped with allergies.</li>
            <li>You do have to clean it with equal parts vinegar and water after each use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>I alsohave 2 other brands of diffusers and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Citrus oils will not harm it, and the little ball at the top can be aimed in any direction.  </li>
            <li>So far the diffuser has been working well and really puts out the mist.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I have it running everyday and by my bed at night.</li>
            <li>Great diffuser but did not last more than about a month which was really disappointing!</li>
            <li>I contacted Greenair company directly and within days I have received my new AC Adapter cord!  </li>
            <li>The first one quit but after two years of constant use.</li>
            <li>I ordered the oils (Eden&#x27;s Garden First Aid Set) and had them an entire week before the diffuser&#x27;s came.</li>
            <li>It works ok in a small space.</li>
            <li>Most we&#x27;ve purchased in the past only comes out the top and half</li>
            <li>I spent this much to have one break in the first 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 4 diffusers 3 months ago, one of them does not work properly (it makes a lot of noise, very little steam comes out) while the other 3 works great.</li>
            <li>I only use oil that is distilled purely.</li>
            <li>the time would just fall all over itself and not go completely through the air.  </li>
            <li>I decided on Greenair Spa vapor because I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much without knowing about essential oil diffusing.  </li>
            <li>Mine is still alive and kicking.  </li>
            <li>It has a &amp;#34;hot small&amp;#34; and makes a loud noise when it is on.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced for a diffuser and definitely does the job!</li>
            <li>and they have really been holding up to our daily use!</li>
            <li>The selling point on this particular product is the solid mist it releases and it allows you to direct it where to go.  </li>
            <li>Most of these items are too small and do not hold enough water,(this one included).</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this item a few months ago, it worked really well, putting out a lot of mist.  </li>
            <li>This was money very very well spent.</li>
            <li>I have a different brand that feels much sturdier and only has a lid to take off.  </li>
            <li>The piece that plugs into the diffuser does spark when first plugged in if the other end is plugged into an electrical outlet already.</li>
            <li>I bought a 2 pack - one for me and one for a gift and now I think I&#x27;ll buy a few more for other rooms in my home.</li>
            <li>Two hours still isn&#x27;t too bad, so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Several friends had it, so I had seen it in action as well.</li>
            <li>I got a pack of 2 and have only tried one so far.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get to UPS to return the broken one</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and was told I could only return the product; one of the diffusers worked and I only needed a new power cord.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews which said this diffuser was a great alternative to the ones sold by DoTerra, as this one was a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li>I love this product I have purchased other oil diffusers in the past</li>
            <li>The other unit worked for one day but the on/off switch had to be pressed many times to get unit to come on and the hole for the power adapter is not right and too loose</li>
            <li>AS IT&#x27;S NOT GOOD FOR YOU TO SLEEP WITH ANY LIGHT ON</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but it&#x27;s my first diffuser</li>
            <li> I really like that you can use the light separate from the diffuser if you just need a night light for a short time.</li>
            <li> At this point I am pleased with the product, but I have only had it about a week.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I plan on buying several more for gifts.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought lasted over a year before it needed to be replaced, and that one was run every night at bedtime, and often two or three times a week during the day.</li>
            <li> These keep going strong, and I don&#x27;t have to baby them with the constant cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It is a work horse, really shooting out a large mist.</li>
            <li> Works well and is fast.</li>
            <li> A very NOTEWORTHY fact...</li>
            <li> I was weary when they finally showed because they do seen to be cheaply made</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and wants one in our room.</li>
            <li> My son loves his so much he was trying to turn it on before I got home from work and put too much water in it and no oil.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really need the lights, that could be eliminated and could improve the output of the mist.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE ONLY DIFFUSERS I COULD FIND THAT GIVES YOU THE OPTION TO HAVE THE LIGHT ON OR OFF.</li>
            <li> They last almost all night filled up.</li>
            <li> ( &amp; I really appreciate the Prime shipping )</li>
            <li> Has really helped with allergies.</li>
            <li> You do have to clean it with equal parts vinegar and water after each use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I alsohave 2 other brands of diffusers and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Citrus oils will not harm it, and the little ball at the top can be aimed in any direction.  </li>
            <li> So far the diffuser has been working well and really puts out the mist.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have it running everyday and by my bed at night.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser but did not last more than about a month which was really disappointing!</li>
            <li> I contacted Greenair company directly and within days I have received my new AC Adapter cord!  </li>
            <li> The first one quit but after two years of constant use.</li>
            <li> I ordered the oils (Eden&#x27;s Garden First Aid Set) and had them an entire week before the diffuser&#x27;s came.</li>
            <li> It works ok in a small space.</li>
            <li> Most we&#x27;ve purchased in the past only comes out the top and half</li>
            <li> I spent this much to have one break in the first 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 4 diffusers 3 months ago, one of them does not work properly (it makes a lot of noise, very little steam comes out) while the other 3 works great.</li>
            <li> I only use oil that is distilled purely.</li>
            <li> the time would just fall all over itself and not go completely through the air.  </li>
            <li> I decided on Greenair Spa vapor because I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much without knowing about essential oil diffusing.  </li>
            <li> Mine is still alive and kicking.  </li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;hot small&amp;#34; and makes a loud noise when it is on.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced for a diffuser and definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> and they have really been holding up to our daily use!</li>
            <li> The selling point on this particular product is the solid mist it releases and it allows you to direct it where to go.  </li>
            <li> Most of these items are too small and do not hold enough water,(this one included).</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this item a few months ago, it worked really well, putting out a lot of mist.  </li>
            <li> This was money very very well spent.</li>
            <li> I have a different brand that feels much sturdier and only has a lid to take off.  </li>
            <li> The piece that plugs into the diffuser does spark when first plugged in if the other end is plugged into an electrical outlet already.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2 pack - one for me and one for a gift and now I think I&#x27;ll buy a few more for other rooms in my home.</li>
            <li> Two hours still isn&#x27;t too bad, so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Several friends had it, so I had seen it in action as well.</li>
            <li> I got a pack of 2 and have only tried one so far.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get to UPS to return the broken one</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and was told I could only return the product; one of the diffusers worked and I only needed a new power cord.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews which said this diffuser was a great alternative to the ones sold by DoTerra, as this one was a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have purchased other oil diffusers in the past</li>
            <li> The other unit worked for one day but the on/off switch had to be pressed many times to get unit to come on and the hole for the power adapter is not right and too loose</li>
            <li> AS IT&#x27;S NOT GOOD FOR YOU TO SLEEP WITH ANY LIGHT ON</li>
            <li> The other diffuser (since two came in a pack) so far is working well.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a cap that allows me to point the air in a specific direction instead of straight up, and the colors are calming, although I usually keep them turned off.</li>
            <li> Barely mists at all, can only fill half way</li>
            <li> It can go all night long on one filling.</li>
            <li> (I tried the other AC adapter but same issue</li>
            <li> AND I haven&#x27;t lit a single candle today.</li>
            <li> Tip: Do not fill past the halfway line marked as a plastic ridge inside.</li>
            <li> I am trying different things people have said, like holding down the buttons for 10 to 20 seconds if needed.</li>
            <li> so be careful where you sit it.</li>
            <li> The diffuser itself is not very substantial but it works.</li>
            <li> We never had a chance to return it due to moving.</li>
            <li> The other one works well.</li>
            <li> It may be small and only lasts 4.5-5 hrs</li>
            <li> It is small and very quiet.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive compared to others of it&#x27;s size, this vaporizer has held up well under my excessive use of essential oils.</li>
            <li> The lights can be turned off if you prefer the room to stay dark.</li>
            <li> Output is rather slow but definitely lasts all night.  </li>
            <li> I am most disappointed to have spent hard earned money on something that is not working.</li>
            <li> Purchased a two pack and the power button broke on both units in less than a month.</li>
            <li> but it tends to leak a little</li>
            <li> even the little motor noise is comforting.  </li>
            <li> bought two of these a few weeks ago - one for my classroom at school and one for home.</li>
            <li> I researched quite a few.  </li>
            <li> the other one didn&#x27;t sense the water level going down one night and stayed on all day without us realizing and now is broken.</li>
            <li> I know they are not that expensive but seems like they should last a little longer than that ...</li>
            <li> It uses very little water and will run between 4 and 6 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what that was about</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t give a product that quit working after a small period of time any points.</li>
            <li> but he is usually restless at night) ...</li>
            <li> I usually burn candles all weekend.  </li>
            <li> It was past the return date for the product, so it ended up in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Depending on the moisture of my room, the diffuser lasts past 4 hours!</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate is the tank is small.</li>
            <li> They are not excellent by any means but there are not many choices out there.</li>
            <li> A little disappointing but decided to be patient.  </li>
            <li> It runs for approximately 2.5-4 hours before running out or water and shutting off.  </li>
            <li> It serves its purpose, but I&#x27;m not happy</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sick daughter and it broke a few weeks after use.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to share to anyone expecting 6-8 hours of misting that you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I brought two of the Spa Vapor with Essential Oils that are allowing the lavender mist to give me serenity!</li>
            <li> Great product but I wish it ran for a longer time.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is quiet. It lasts about 3-4 hours and shuts off automatically. You do have to clean it with equal parts vinegar and water after each use. The piece that plugs into the diffuser does spark when first plugged in if the other end is plugged into an electrical outlet already. I did observe water leaking out of the bottom one day when I used it. I&#x27;m not sure what that was about so I will be watching to see if it does it again! Also, it works best when you fill it with water just under the fill line mark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset with this product. I bought it for my sick daughter and it broke a few weeks after use. We are still trying to get it to work but to no avail. We never had a chance to return it due to moving. I wish the company would make it right. The colored lights are beautiful but I can&#x27;t give a product that quit working after a small period of time any points. We followed all the directions.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the dual pack so I could have one in my bedroom and one in the living room. One unit seems to work fine although the mist is not as strong as the first day even after cleaning and run time is only about 4-5 hrs. The other unit worked for one day but the on/off switch had to be pressed many times to get unit to come on and the hole for the power adapter is not right and too loose (I tried the other AC adapter but same issue so the unit is faulty).  The power adapter does not have a good connection so the unit cannot work properly. I have now read reviews of others having problems with the on/off and power adapter so seems to be something occurring more than I thought. I would not purchase again and have returned mine.</li>
            <li> Received the product quickly. It is very easy to use and I love having it in the bedroom while sleeping. It&#x27;s quiet and effective. The lights can be turned off if you prefer the room to stay dark.</li>
            <li> They diffused my oils really nice.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Bought a bunch for home and the office.  The selling point on this particular product is the solid mist it releases and it allows you to direct it where to go.  Most we&#x27;ve purchased in the past only comes out the top and half the time would just fall all over itself and not go completely through the air.  This one is different and we will continue to purchase these in the future!</li>
            <li> 1/31/15&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these a few weeks ago - one for my classroom at school and one for home. I decided on this one based on price, reviews, and the amount of time it would stay on. Several friends had it, so I had seen it in action as well. It uses very little water and will run between 4 and 6 hours. I like that it has a cap that allows me to point the air in a specific direction instead of straight up, and the colors are calming, although I usually keep them turned off. There are 2 tops to replace each time you replace the water, which gets old, but it makes it easy to clean, so definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice machine. I purchased it for my son, who loves the colored lights. He is 9 and we use it at night.  It works nicely.</li>
            <li> This is great would order more.</li>
            <li> Love the product! So pleased with the service!</li>
            <li> I bought two, one works great, the other didn&#x27;t work after the first week...after I recycled the box.  Save the box people!</li>
            <li> This is the best diffuser for essential oils that I have found.  Works well and is fast.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2  works great</li>
            <li> I have now bought three of these and have given one of them as a gift. The first one quit but after two years of constant use. They are not excellent by any means but there are not many choices out there. Most of these items are too small and do not hold enough water,(this one included). The oil is an important factor in the operation of the unit. I only use oil that is distilled purely. I&#x27;m sure that if I was using oil that was inexpensive the unit would clog quicker. All in all they are to be as advertised and what more can we expect.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite diffuser!!! Citrus oils will not harm it, and the little ball at the top can be aimed in any direction.  It is a work horse, really shooting out a large mist.</li>
            <li> Love this...works well.</li>
            <li> Very, very happy with my diffuser. It&#x27;s simple and the color lighting option is perfect for nighttime ambiance.  A very NOTEWORTHY fact...my twin pack of diffusers arrived and one of the AC adapter cords did not work...I contacted Amazon and was told I could only return the product; one of the diffusers worked and I only needed a new power cord. I contacted Greenair company directly and within days I have received my new AC Adapter cord!  THAT IS TRUE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I definitely will do business with Greenair again.</li>
            <li> Purchased a two pack and the power button broke on both units in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I received both very quickly . Both worked initially. Within about 7 days of use, one has quit working. The other one works well. I am most disappointed to have spent hard earned money on something that is not working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started looking into essential oils. I decided on Greenair Spa vapor because I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much without knowing about essential oil diffusing.  I researched quite a few.  I read mixed reviews but decided to take my chances.  I ordered the oils (Eden&#x27;s Garden First Aid Set) and had them an entire week before the diffuser&#x27;s came. A little disappointing but decided to be patient.  I was weary when they finally showed because they do seen to be cheaply made (the dome just sits on the top) BUT IT DOES THE JOB. I added tap water to fill line, added my oil and plugged it in... Voila... Immediately it was diffusing a strong mist. My husband loves it and wants one in our room. My son loves his so much he was trying to turn it on before I got home from work and put too much water in it and no oil. He said it wasn&#x27;t working. I poured the water out to the fill line, added the oil and he was in business! I&#x27;ve read it diffuses longer with the lights off but I&#x27;ve tested and it seems to run about the same. The lights don&#x27;t bother me and my husband and son prefer them. Some oil and oil blends are stronger than others. I can smell some and others I can&#x27;t. Our living room is 500+ square feet and of course you can smell in my son&#x27;s room all the time because it is smaller. The only thing I hate is the tank is small. Lasts about 4.5-5 hrs... So I set up in the morning and it goes off at lunch, then I refill when I get home and goes off about the time we are going to bed. Sometimes I refill my son&#x27;s again since it&#x27;s in his room.  Yesterday I had stress relief and lemon in the diffuser and my husband said he &amp;#34;slept so good&amp;#34; (don&#x27;t know if it was the oils or not but he is usually restless at night) ...AND I haven&#x27;t lit a single candle today. I usually burn candles all weekend.  I will definitely be looking for a bigger diffuser to place in our living room and move the Greenair Spa Vapor to our bedroom.  It may be small and only lasts 4.5-5 hrs but it&#x27;s my first diffuser and I got 2... So I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser but did not last more than about a month which was really disappointing!</li>
            <li> These work great and at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great for diffusing essential oils!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent product.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I had to return them after a week. They stopped working. Very unhappy!</li>
            <li> This item was used four times before it broke and stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have 4 of these, and I love them.  I had 2 of another brand that were a pain to keep clean, and both broke.  These keep going strong, and I don&#x27;t have to baby them with the constant cleaning.  They last about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made I do not suggest this product</li>
            <li> The best diffusseer for the price</li>
            <li> I been using this diffuser for about a month. It does the job but it tends to leak a little so be careful where you sit it. Only use filtered water.</li>
            <li> I got a pack of 2 and have only tried one so far. Very nice, runs longer than the other model I have. I really like that you can use the light separate from the diffuser if you just need a night light for a short time.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive my diffuser. I read the reviews which said this diffuser was a great alternative to the ones sold by DoTerra, as this one was a lot less expensive. However, the reviews claim the mist lasts anywhere from 6-8 hours. I did not find that to be the case. After following the directions, my diffuser misted for just under two hours (without the light on) before it shut off on its own. Two hours still isn&#x27;t too bad, so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. Just wanted to share to anyone expecting 6-8 hours of misting that you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would prefer the vapor would be &#x27;more&#x27;.  it gives very light puffs.  For a person who relies on these oils to make them feel &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;well&#x27;, you would think he output would be better.  It&#x27;s simple to use. Don&#x27;t really need the lights, that could be eliminated and could improve the output of the mist.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as it was recommended by a friend. This was used regularly for about a month; cleaning after each use and it just stopped working. Period. So disappointed. Does any user have suggestions?</li>
            <li> So far the diffuser has been working well and really puts out the mist. The diffuser itself is not very substantial but it works. It does not seem to hold much water but it last for a few hours. At this point I am pleased with the product, but I have only had it about a week.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser. It brings a peace of mind when I use it.</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered this ages ago!  It is great!</li>
            <li> Mine diffuser worked for about two months, then just quit!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these. One worked and one did not.  I wasn&#x27;t able to get to UPS to return the broken one so now I just have it sitting in a box.  It feels very cheaply made and there are 3 pieces to put on after you put the oils and water inside. I have a different brand that feels much sturdier and only has a lid to take off.  Ye one that works is doing its job.  It works ok in a small space.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this item a few months ago, it worked really well, putting out a lot of mist.  Both buttons (the on/off, and the one for colors or no colors) worked.  Today I rinsed it out, and it works.  However, now I cannot turn it off and I cannot turn off the color buttons.  I am trying different things people have said, like holding down the buttons for 10 to 20 seconds if needed. So, at this point, I have to unplug it.  However, thankfully, it is stuck in the on position.  But, I have to unplug it to stop it.</li>
            <li> WORKS PERFECTLY AND IS NICE AND QUIET! ONE OF THE ONLY DIFFUSERS I COULD FIND THAT GIVES YOU THE OPTION TO HAVE THE LIGHT ON OR OFF. AS IT&#x27;S NOT GOOD FOR YOU TO SLEEP WITH ANY LIGHT ON, THIS WAS A BIG DEAL FOR ME. COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER WITH IT! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I got the 2 pack and I just love them.  I alsohave 2 other brands of diffusers and these are by far my favorite. I would order these again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> My diffusers are my most favorite things just about ever!!!  I bought two, one for home and one for my office.  I love them so much.  The color changes are wonderful.  They are so soothing and even the little motor noise is comforting.  They turn off automatically.  I can&#x27;t help but think they have to be good for your skin too...all that moisture and essential oil in the air.  I wish I&#x27;d have bought one years ago and I can&#x27;t imagine being without one now...I&#x27;ve been using them a week. ❤️ This was money very very well spent. 😊</li>
            <li> This is a good unit. I like that it is able to go all night long and that the light is able to turn off or on.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed our diffuser.  Arrived quickly and just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with my purchase. It is a workhorse. I have had no issues with this item and I make sure to clean it after each use.</li>
            <li> This was the 3rd one that I&#x27;ve purchased for my family.  They love them.  Came quickly and in perfect condition.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser with a sizeable water resevouir.  Output is rather slow but definitely lasts all night.  Lasts longer when the led light is off.</li>
            <li> Great - Love the product. Very Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 pack in December for my office.  I placed one in my office and one in my co-worker&#x27;s office.  Within 2 weeks, my co-worker&#x27;s difuser began leaking water out the bottom and stopped working.  The water got into the motor and fried it.  It was past the return date for the product, so it ended up in the trash.  She replaced it with a different brand she got from Hi-Health and loves it.  Mine is still alive and kicking.  It runs for approximately 2.5-4 hours before running out or water and shutting off.  I notice with both brand diffusers we are using that the oil smell is very strong the first hour, but then becomes almost unnoticable after a while.  I thought it was because we were getting used to the smell, but others that came in said the same thing.  The oil sits on top of the water, so it seems to get dispursed when it is first turned on, rather than being dispursed more evenly through the entire run time.  It serves its purpose, but I&#x27;m not happy I spent this much to have one break in the first 2 weeks.  If I had to buy another one, I wouldn&#x27;t gamble on this brand.</li>
            <li> did not put off any mist. Looked cheap. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!  These are great.</li>
            <li> It is small and very quiet. I bought it to diffuse my essential oils and it works perfect for what I needed.  It begins working immediately when you turn it on and diffuses a nice steady stream for several hours. I also like that it shuts off automatically when the water level gets low.  I bought a 2 pack - one for me and one for a gift and now I think I&#x27;ll buy a few more for other rooms in my home.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser-there are many on the market to choose from and this one is so reasonably priced and works great. I plan on buying several more for gifts.</li>
            <li> great value for the money!</li>
            <li> One of the diffuser is not working properly. It has a &amp;#34;hot small&amp;#34; and makes a loud noise when it is on. The other diffuser (since two came in a pack) so far is working well.</li>
            <li> Second time I used it, it quit.</li>
            <li> one for work, one for home.</li>
            <li> Love this! I bought 3 and they all work amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this product I have purchased other oil diffusers in the past and they do not work as well as these do I will be buying more so I can have one in every room of my house :)</li>
            <li> Like it but my concern is when I unplug/plug it sparks at the connection...thinking I may need to return.</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 diffusers 3 months ago, one of them does not work properly (it makes a lot of noise, very little steam comes out) while the other 3 works great.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced for a diffuser and definitely does the job! Depending on the moisture of my room, the diffuser lasts past 4 hours! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I bought for my peace. Gorgeous and affordable. Working great so far.</li>
            <li> This last through the night and last longer than another one I bought for twice the price.  I like this.</li>
            <li> Bought two. One works well the other one didn&#x27;t sense the water level going down one night and stayed on all day without us realizing and now is broken. Only worked about 2-3 weeks using approx 5 nights a week without refilling. Was looking for a cheaper diffuser and I guess I got what I paid for this time.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, diffuses a large area with scent easily.</li>
            <li> Barely mists at all, can only fill half way it you want any vapor. Colors are cool, but it doesn&#x27;t do what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive compared to others of it&#x27;s size, this vaporizer has held up well under my excessive use of essential oils. I love the option of being able to turn off the night light. I liked it so much that I bought 2 more to give as gifts with my oils. Tip: Do not fill past the halfway line marked as a plastic ridge inside. Overfilling inhibits the ultrasonic mist.</li>
            <li> I had these 3 weeks and they stopped working. Very disappointing. I will be returning.</li>
            <li> I have three of these now, one in each of our bedrooms. They last almost all night filled up. The first one I bought lasted over a year before it needed to be replaced, and that one was run every night at bedtime, and often two or three times a week during the day.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly with my YLEO oils....thank you! ( &amp; I really appreciate the Prime shipping )</li>
            <li> I loved these when I first received them . Now I believe about 5 months later they are no longer working. I know they are not that expensive but seems like they should last a little longer than that ...</li>
            <li> I use it every night.  Nice gentle mist and runs for hours.</li>
            <li> I love the ambiance this product creates with the lighting and the oils. Fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Nice workn machine</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife and she loves it. The shipping time was fast and the product was in excellent condition when we received it. I bought the two pack so we would have one at the house and one for her work. Great product and great service.</li>
            <li> Works like as described. It can go all night long on one filling. Easy to use and produces a great vapor stream. Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. I bought two and keep one in the bedroom and one in the kitchen. No issues - runs about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these and we have been using them for about a month now and they have really been holding up to our daily use! Good quality for the money.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have it running everyday and by my bed at night. Has really helped with allergies.</li>
            <li> Great product and quick delivery.</li>
