            <li> so it is necessary and this keeps me from having really flat hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely have to use bother product with this one to keep your hair from looking dry.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair fluffy with soft curls.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m outside in the wind and other weather conditions a lot, so that may have something to do with it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that tends to be very messy and stringy.</li>
            <li> spray this stuff when my hair is wet</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or crunchy wet look.</li>
            <li> but after an hour or so it falls flat because it&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
            <li> at least, initially.</li>
            <li> I spray my hair down, then use the diffuser again.</li>
            <li> I noticed after a few hours that my curls would get a little tangled and slightly tacky or sticky.</li>
            <li> It is a little crunchy</li>
            <li> My curls get frizzy and straighten out a little overnight.</li>
            <li> I spritz some of this on my head in the morning and follow with just a little bit of water.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve air dried it and used it with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> But it leaves your hair a bit heavy with product</li>
            <li> This product is not sticky or leaves hair stiff.</li>
            <li> On my hair, at least, the shine deteriorates after awhile, leaving behind a dry, goopy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curls are hard to the touch, but I leave them alone while I finish my makeup.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no good if your hair is prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I was so used to having stiff, crunchy hair, and I hated for it to touch me.</li>

            <li> Great stuff ! I have naturally straight hair and with this product,  I can have the best of both worlds!  Straight/Curly!  Luv it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> Great spray for bouncing back my perm</li>
            <li> this is a good product</li>
            <li> This is just great! I have wavy and curly hair. This product is not sticky or leaves hair stiff. I get a great curl when I scrunch and it smells divine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it really does the job.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product for curling my rather straight hair. It did make it soft, but didn&#x27;t help my curls. My hair is very stubborn though, and this may help someone else moreso.</li>
            <li> If you like to use a scrunch spray, this is the best I&#x27;ve tried. I have naturally wavy hair that tends to be very messy and stringy. Some days it will not curl up as much as I&#x27;d like, even after mousse and a diffuser. On those days, this saves my hair. I spray my hair down, then use the diffuser again. The curls are hard to the touch, but I leave them alone while I finish my makeup. After I get dressed, I come back and scrunch the curls with my hands, and all the crunchy feeling disappears, but the curls stay. I was so used to having stiff, crunchy hair, and I hated for it to touch me. This makes my hair feel and look great!</li>
            <li> Have always liked this for my hair.  It is a little crunchy but I shake my curls out.  I live in high humidity so it is necessary and this keeps me from having really flat hair.</li>
            <li> For over a decade I&#x27;ve been straightening my 3a/3b hair. Recently, I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of wearing it curly. Since I love all of the other KMS products I use, I was sure this would be just as effective. I&#x27;ve been using it on my second-day curls and have to say it does work...at least, initially. My curls get frizzy and straighten out a little overnight. I spritz some of this on my head in the morning and follow with just a little bit of water. Then, I flip my head over and scrunch my curls. When I stand back upright, my curls are bouncy and shiny again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is a downfall. I noticed after a few hours that my curls would get a little tangled and slightly tacky or sticky. So I looked at the list of ingredients. Alcohol is the first ingredient. Thus, it is very drying. On my hair, at least, the shine deteriorates after awhile, leaving behind a dry, goopy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m outside in the wind and other weather conditions a lot, so that may have something to do with it. If I were in a climate-controlled environment all day, possibly I would get a different result. I wanted to love this product, and I really thought I would. But I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just discovered the Curly Girl method and am going to give that a try.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that has a lot of natural wave. I have tried every product out there to enhance my curl. Everything I&#x27;ve tried left my hair either crunchy, stringy, greasy, not at all curly. This product worked fantastic from first use. I swear by it. Love my hair finally!</li>
            <li> Neither my girlfriend nor I liked this product.  It seems to work at first but after an hour or so it falls flat because it&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well. Also not heavy and leaves no residue. Perfect light hold product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only products that gives me a natural curl without the crunchiness!! i brush my fingers through my hair, spray curl up in it, and scrunch. It turns out perfect every time!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and it gets out of control.  This product is great at enhancing waves and curls and keeping the style I want!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy, smells great, and provides just enough power and hold to create a little more than your natural curl.</li>
            <li> Happy with service and product</li>
            <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve used it alone and with the curl up creme and I&#x27;ve air dried it and used it with a diffuser. I love this!!! Makes my hair bouncy and still holds the curl without frizz. This is all you need! A few quick sprays, scrunch with your hands and walk out the door! Saves so much time. Love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m buying more!</li>
            <li> Excellent for thin curly  hair prone to frizzing.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of curl products and this has remained what works for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair fluffy with soft curls.  Perfect for long hair, worn naturally.</li>
            <li> Works for me.  But it leaves your hair a bit heavy with product so washing the next day is a must for me.  It did not dry my hair out as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I have semi wave hair &amp; I spray this stuff when my hair is wet &amp; I leave it &amp; go. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or crunchy wet look. It dries nice...waves look natural. I&#x27;ve used this product for years.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for defining curls.  I have used it for years without finding anything that works as well.  Would recommend it.</li>
