            <li>Smells awesome like starburst or fruity candy but refreshing.</li>
            <li>This has a pleasant scent and has a tendency to raise my mood.</li>
            <li>It seems to elevate my mood and has a pleasant smell that fades soon and doesn&#x27;t conflict with anything else you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li>it does smell good.....</li>
            <li>I get lots of comments on how good I smell.</li>

            <li>Good smell, good effects.</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>It does smell good out of the bottle, but the thing about pheromone colognes is that your body chemistry changes it, so the trick is, get a girlfriend, both put it on, wait around 10 minutes and smell each others wrists.</li>
            <li>it smells REALLY good, however.</li>
            <li>When I told him about the oil, he told me that was why he smelled my hair because he wanted to know what smelled good.</li>
            <li>When I told him about the oil, he told me that was why he smelled my hair because he wanted to know what smelled good.</li>
            <li>It puts me in a good mood whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li>i chosed this rating because i was expecting something that when you smelled the aroma you would be like DAMN that smells soo good</li>
            <li>Even if the pheromones didn&#x27;t work it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>Loved it but couldn&#x27;t afford it..</li>
            <li>However the oil does smell good, this is some sort of oily substance.</li>
            <li>it just smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but not like AXE spray for men.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like everybody&#x27;s your puppet when you smell so good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
            <li>This product has a good smell but doesn&#x27;t do anything of what it says.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good and DOESN&#x27;T work.</li>
            <li>it smells really good</li>
            <li>And the self effects are good too.</li>
            <li>mmm it smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>This sent makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>Smelt good but don&#x27;t think the pheromone thing in it is very potent.</li>
            <li>This honestly does smell really amazing on my skin!</li>
            <li>The seller I ordered from is exceptional.</li>
            <li>I give this product 2 stars because it smells good, it&#x27;s really very pleasant but fades fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest the formulators add more of the attractive scent.    </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not like Love Potion #9 lol) but people always ask what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>Very interesting....</li>
            <li>Great product with a smell that I love.</li>
            <li>It gives you more confidence as well; you wll approach women so attractive that you were having been leary about before.  </li>
            <li>Very light scent, gets compliments!</li>
            <li>And I did notice a one day when I was wearing it that I seemed more happy &amp; confident when I had it on!</li>
            <li>great stuff, works fine, easy to use as explained, and very good for its price, I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li>I work in a salon and always worked for tips and let me tell you- wear this stuff for a month and see the huge difference it makes!!</li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THAT!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>

            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of this!</li>
            <li>with this stuff I got more than I payed for, in my job I got about $40 in tips!</li>
            <li>First applied it smells like a delicious fruity grape bubblegum.</li>
            <li>I love the scent!</li>
            <li>I attract customers a lot easier :) can&#x27;t work without this!</li>
            <li>but this stuff smells great, just wanted some good cheap cologne and this did the trick, kind of fruity</li>
            <li>And I love the smell !...</li>
            <li>Love how this smells on me, I just found this scent again after years of searching and it smells just like I remember!</li>
            <li>But hey, if you guys out there love to smell sweet and delicious by all means buy it!</li>
            <li>This smells amazing....</li>
            <li>this IS AMAZING,</li>
            <li>If it lasted longer I would give it 5 stars but whatever, it smells amazing and makes me feel</li>
            <li>This scent is not girly, so don&#x27;t worry about you smelling like a girl, it&#x27;s a unisex scent that smells amazing for both genders.</li>
            <li>and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>Which I find amazing that it brings out your own scent</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>and I think the smell is nice to have on.</li>
            <li>I just like any woman like to go in bed with nice smell around me.</li>
            <li>So each person has their own smell-</li>
            <li>it kind of has a bubble gummy fruity smell.</li>
            <li>I never thought it will be so effective</li>
            <li>I can see the difference in how people approach me and how kind they get.</li>
            <li>I wear this almost every day, sometimes with perfume and sometimes on its own.  </li>
            <li>It has kind of a fruity scent.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but it does not work.</li>
            <li>I say if you dont want him connected to you at the hip then dont put this on with your favorite smell good perfume.</li>
            <li>Now it doesn&#x27;t work as pheromones or whatever they are promoting the product, the smell is really nice and thats the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>all my bitches love me, all my, all my bitches love, lol</li>
            <li>It smells nice and changes it smell based on the person it is on.</li>
            <li>This product has me loving to touch myself.  </li>
            <li>( I don&#x27;t know what kind of fruit</li>
            <li>and I found myself smelling my wrists to try and decipher and solve the puzzle of my own scent that the oil gave out.</li>
            <li>I am in a janitorial kind of job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but guys liked it</li>
            <li>It was as if I didn&#x27;t have it own.</li>
            <li>Smells Nice.  </li>
            <li>Woman seem to react great, more strangers striking up conversation.</li>
            <li>, this oil can be fused with others to come up with your own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
            <li>My bf thinks it smells good guys love any smell of food my boyfriend prefers fruity and citrusy smells</li>
            <li>so he liked this one</li>
            <li>Try it on your own risk.</li>
            <li>The idea is nice, but I just didn&#x27;t have any luck with it.</li>
            <li>Honestly smells a bit like those urinal deodorants in mens toilets.</li>
            <li>And I honestly think it works.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work just has a nice smell</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting any to be honest</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear perfume at work, but this is amazing, light scented and makes me feel great wearing it.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it on, I get this warm, fuzzy feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for becoming composed.</li>
            <li>Ordering this product was very easy to order.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled this in the bottle, I LOVED it!</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference in men they starred and smiled more.</li>
            <li>I honestly think this product is better.</li>
            <li>Although this product has a nice smell, I think it to be more of a comfidence booster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and so cheap!</li>
            <li>It is not alcoholy or overwhelming but pleasant and sweet and fruity.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, it worked great.</li>
            <li>And the bottle is very easy to lose so make sure you put it somewhere safe.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>nice and discreet.not strong...</li>
            <li>My wife doesn&#x27;t seem to be anymore attracted to me when I wear it. :-)</li>
            <li>I cute and petite</li>
            <li>But I did find that they are more chatty.</li>
            <li>If my hubby would be a mechanic he maybe would like this greasy smell :).</li>
            <li>My boss even treated me better.  </li>
            <li>I feel more confident.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could bottle up MY smell, as it develops from this product, and spray that on me all the time!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>no clue if it works more or not for my sexual appeal.</li>
            <li>I would test this on my husband though when he gets here bc that would be interesting to see...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this to attract people or make people more pleasant/friendly around you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of an oil than a perfume.</li>
            <li>The pheromones seem to affect some people more than others.</li>
            <li>but I received many compliments while wearing this.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my boyfriend and it had more of a musky scent than when it was on me.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to smell this one.</li>
            <li>I am on my way to ordering two more</li>
            <li>bottles.&lt;br /&gt; :-)</li>
            <li>I became so in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have become more confident while wearing this product, which helps too.</li>
            <li>and i swear people are more attracted and nicer when i wear it.</li>
            <li>i love wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li>AD makes better scents of pheromones</li>
            <li>I love how it smelled on me from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Something in it works, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>I found a magic potion.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>In the end, I bought some more from this site for my sister, friends and, of course, myself.  </li>
            <li>and I hung out with a girl that I thought for sure I would never have a chance with.  </li>
            <li>I found that when I started to wear this product, guys around me started to look more, some guys in my college classes were talking to me more, wanting to talk to me.</li>
            <li>I found that some men react more to it than others.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume.</li>
            <li>The smell is fabulous and fruity, I just wish it lasted longer!</li>
            <li>I have seen this product in stores go for a lot more.</li>
            <li>Four more words required.</li>
            <li>If you need more confidence, by all means try the pheremones.</li>
            <li>lol .. not for adults at all .. good for teenage girls.</li>
            <li>, most of them don&#x27;t even notice they are doing it.</li>
            <li>okay let me google it and</li>
            <li>But I must say I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more into sophisticated or musky scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just wear my favorite perfume over it.</li>
            <li>I love it, will be reordering.</li>
            <li>i bought this before from a pleasure party for more than $20.</li>
            <li>Works Well under most Colognes.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more potent, and you get a lot more of it.</li>
            <li>I would have to say this is more of a product for a women, unless you were going to wear it under another cologne as a man.</li>
            <li>You rub it in your warmer places and pressure points for better results.</li>
            <li>but most of the guys huddled around me)  </li>
            <li>but this pheromone seemed to attract more Caucasian/European men and Latin men.</li>
            <li>I found my favorite avon perfume faraway on amazon.</li>
            <li>I read it worked for most of the ppl that bought it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It smells feminine, sexy, and fruity.</li>
            <li>But, this oil literally made all of these better, quicker,</li>
            <li>This was a Love Potion #9 situation IRL.</li>
            <li>but I feel as if it made my mood much better.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful smell (completely different on every person).</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>The smell makes me happy and there&#x27;s not enough happiness in the world.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I already have ordered more and will again when I get close to using it all up.</li>
            <li>Plus it seems to always make me feel more confident when I wear it...</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re sure to get a headache...</li>
            <li>But...If you want it to do more in the attraction department add a dab of Scent of Eros for women or PCC.</li>
            <li>I must say it does make me feel confident .</li>
            <li>smells ok, doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on men.</li>
            <li>[Disclaimer-This scent is more for women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into getting hit on (so I&#x27;m sure that vibe comes off of me)</li>
            <li>however I have noticed I defiantly get checked out more when I wear it and at the gym</li>
            <li>seem more appealing in whatever situation</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time when I go to parties and way more confidence.</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite perfume ever</li>
            <li>I get more compliments, conversation and friendliness.</li>
            <li>It has a flowery smell on me and more of a fruity&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li>Better to just think of it as a perfume and nothing more.</li>
            <li>The scent is so sexy.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My scent smells like Victoria&#x27;s Secrets&#x27; Love Spell.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>PLEASED  </li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this product, it smells fa-nominal.</li>
            <li>Okay, so maybe not...  </li>
            <li>I pair this with my signature fragrance, which I have noticed more compliments when paired together.</li>
            <li>So what starts happening is you&#x27;ll notice guys will start to be more buddy buddy around you</li>
            <li>so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>I seam to get more if a response when i&#x27;m dint</li>
            <li>I loved it right away.  </li>
            <li>Very unique smell</li>
            <li>The bottle states that everyone will get their own unique smell</li>
            <li>own unique scent</li>
            <li>In 15-20 minutes it settles into your own fragrance which I also love because it makes this fragrance oil so very special and unique.</li>
            <li>And he went on and on about how he thinks I&#x27;m pretty, cute, gorgeous and that he missed me and loves me.</li>
            <li>And he went on and on about how he thinks I&#x27;m pretty, cute, gorgeous and that he missed me and loves me.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it smelled but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $22 for it.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and effective!</li>
            <li>This items have a nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use something too strong, just something light and pretty, seems to compliment the oil great.  </li>
            <li>That seems fun.... !!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;success&amp;#34; of others is probably just new found confidence, which is attractive to everybody.</li>
            <li>It was amazing to find that people were much more calm and trusting when they were in close proximity to the smell and scent.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because the reviews were good and the price was more than reasonable.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll sure enjoy trying it out more.</li>
            <li>I feel very special wearing this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good smell and its pretty strong yet oily.</li>
            <li>Very sweet and fruity, not overpowering, and you can smell an underlying scent that you cant quite put your finger on (the pheromones).</li>
            <li>It smells very sweet.</li>
            <li>This mixed well with my favorite perfum and wasn&#x27;t overwhelming, great size to keep in a make up bag or purse</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad to have found it so cheap on here.</li>
            <li>product was delivered fast and saved myself money also like the way it enhances the smell of my perfume or it can also be worn alone either way its good</li>
            <li>But imma buy more right now for sure &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>think this product works best when applied in areas where you might sweat more, because your sweat aka your natural pheromones, mix with this product to produce more of your natural smell--- or something like that.</li>
            <li>Sweet!  </li>
            <li>Sweet and fruity!</li>
            <li>and I liked the light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>but my boyfriend loves it, it smells great and it definitely makes more people notice me</li>
            <li>stills smells too strong for me</li>
            <li>the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell though, and as a perfume</li>
            <li>But this is a great smelling attention attractant, because i have noticed a major change in how women approach me.</li>
            <li>I would like to think that as time went on the aroma did not leave me quickly like it said others did, rather it changed to a more refreshing clean smell, like rain.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it, I applied this on every day, and it had a nice aroma</li>
            <li>I went on here and found this one, tried it, just as good plus you get a vial full instead of a roll on like pure romances type.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t know if the pheromones are given more hype than they deserve or if I&#x27;m just highly oblivious to the effect they have.</li>
            <li>It just brought more attention than usual, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>gay one day...</li>
            <li>For starters, if you are a guy looking for a magic get laid quick potion this is not it.</li>
            <li>I can’t be certain, but I think this magic, witch, alternate universe, spell, sex oil actually made me more physically attractive, intelligent and humorous.  </li>
            <li>smells great, slightly more feminine than a true non gender specific.</li>
            <li>Remember using this and the Pure Romance kind in college.</li>
            <li>Mostly, honestly.... I bought Pure Instinct in hopes it might help me in my job hunt.</li>
            <li>, im totally over pleased with this product and for sure will buy more!</li>
            <li>It smells great, I got compliments all last night and it arrived so quickly!  </li>
            <li>and I know I&#x27;m an attractive and alluring human being, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;So overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Combination of lycoric candy and cheap musk cologne.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I also will sometimes layer it with a light perfume or a perfumy type lotion like creamy coconut that I had from a store at the mall.  </li>
            <li>I like wearing it alone when I go out because its so light and unassuming.</li>
            <li>Overall, GREAT product.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy wearing this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really like this in a nice roller ball.</li>
            <li>I keep it in stock at home and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Similar smell, gives you a calming, happy feeling when inhaled.</li>
            <li>Do not base your review on what it smells like out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>, this one did not try to offer free sample-for-review.  </li>
            <li>On a side note, perfume oils are seriously cheap</li>
            <li>However, it should be noted that he did smell my hair and asked if I showered ( I know so romantic, lol ).</li>
            <li>However, it should be noted that he did smell my hair and asked if I showered ( I know so romantic, lol ).</li>
            <li>I doubt it does anything for &amp;#34;attraction&amp;#34; but it really does smell nice.</li>
            <li>Scent enjoy</li>
            <li>Nice scent, just don&#x27;t usw too much because it smells musky if you do.</li>
            <li>It also DOES uplift my mood and make me smile a bit more.</li>
            <li>Worth it :)</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful product and has a very gentle,light scent that does not aggravate any asthma or allergies in me or others.  </li>
            <li>Not just for a sexual encounter, but is hope of meeting Mr. Right.</li>
            <li>but it has a very fresh fruity smell like a gummy bear or something.</li>
            <li>It was very nice to see a different side to him.</li>
            <li>It was very nice to see a different side to him.</li>
            <li>I love Pure Instinct!  </li>
            <li>i just received it today(which was very fast&#x3D;]) and thought maybe i wouldn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>I love the smell very much.</li>
            <li>I noticed it makes girls fall in love with me very fast with a hint of lust thrown in there.</li>
            <li>Women did not throw themselves at me but were friendly</li>
            <li>As for gender friendly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a perfume but its too fruity for a guy to wear every day.</li>
            <li>this will not make all the guys want you, but you will get some friendly treatment here and there.</li>
            <li>I originally found this product at a party.</li>
            <li>So yea, Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Well, I used this stuff to make my husband more aware and, I suppose you could say, turned on without me doing anything.</li>
            <li>, you gotta go where people are friendly</li>
            <li>I really honestly love the smell of this...and i believe it works pretty damn well...</li>
            <li>Worth trying, even if it doesn&#x27;t have quite the effects you were hoping for!</li>
            <li>So I had to go out and buy a bottle RIGHT AWAY, because he said later that it smelt so good on me, so we&#x27;ll have to see what happens :)    </li>
            <li>The fragrance was a clean ultra soap and pheromone explosion.</li>
            <li>Oil has a pleasant scent and simple glass applicator.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any special attention or friendly behavior from any people that I&#x27;ve been around.</li>
            <li>Its a soft oil with a delicious sweet scent that last hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a spicy but sweet and rich grape/fruity scent.</li>
            <li>Eeee dnt look nothing special</li>
            <li>At certain points it was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Well it certainly provides that boost and women love it.  </li>
            <li>What to feel special too?  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something a bit different and when I tried it at first the scent was pleasant, but very quickly turned on me.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected a lot of girls said it wasn&#x27;t too great</li>
            <li>Love how fast it</li>
            <li>Smells like sweet grapes, maybe?)</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good, but that&#x27;s the only reason you should buy it.  </li>
            <li>I think people are friendlier to me when I have it on, which could either be a placebo effect or possibly that it smells good.</li>
            <li>Have yet to find a man that can resist the sweet smell of this.</li>
            <li>not even wealthy or drive a fast car</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that when I wear this pheromone they give me more eye contact, flirt more and ask me out at a much higher rate than normal.</li>
            <li>It has a very fruity smell which is ok for a chick but not for a dude.</li>
            <li>They say if you believe in the product, it becomes true, maybe in a placebo sort of way.</li>
            <li>A bit too sweet for a man, I would assume, even though it is designed as unisex.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had a couple of comments from friends that I smell good.</li>
            <li>I would buy again but keep it in a cool place to see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and would buy from the seller again! :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;s not a bad buy</li>
            <li>its not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Hey not bad for the price</li>
            <li>This is a second order and it was as good as the first!</li>
            <li>gave this 4 stars because your smell fades so quickly.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered quickly and as promised.  </li>
            <li>As for the seller, they&#x27;re quick with shipping, I&#x27;ve had no complaints, and they sell this bottle cheaper than anywhere else I&#x27;ve searched.</li>
            <li>I carry it around with me so that I can reapply it through out the day because it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>The good things I did not waste too much money on this.</li>
            <li>I have also heard that if your scent smells like playdough you might be pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if this works, but it really smells nice and since it doesn&#x27;t cost much, what&#x27;s the harm?  </li>
            <li>It has a hint of guava (not the super stinky variety...</li>
            <li>The oil will absorb quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, I would and simply because the smell is nice and completely unique, it is really special.</li>
            <li>Yes, I would and simply because the smell is nice and completely unique, it is really special.</li>
            <li>but you may be able to get something larger or more worth the 9 bucks if you can find something that smells like the bubble gum.</li>
            <li>Now that I remember it, it was very funny.</li>
            <li>Now that I remember it, it was very funny.</li>
            <li>However men if you&#x27;re comfortable with something that first goes on feminine smelling go for</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle of pure instinct, and I love the smell .</li>
            <li>Also the seller Steve&#x27;s ships fast and ads some cool coupons!</li>
            <li>So to find it for less than $8 a bottle was great.  </li>
            <li>but when i put it on it actually smelt pretty good.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s goal is to get guys to be more sexual, or passionate</li>
            <li>But after a while of wearing it, as the floral, sweet notes wore off, it got a musty smell that kind of &#x27;catch&#x27; in the back of my throat when I would get a whiff of it.</li>
            <li>the self confidence, how people is so much nicer to you!!</li>
            <li>And the Nights I Did NOT wear it, he wasnt interested in doing anything except getting sleep!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s packed pretty well!</li>
            <li>After that incident I decided to try to experiment more with just this pheromone and was happily surprised by the outcome!  </li>
            <li>Same product as at the toy partys but for a better price !</li>
            <li>I just wore it on a first date!</li>
            <li>Smell a bit fruity and sweet at first, but scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell amazing and personal then this is for you, but if you just want to attract mates try a stronger scent.</li>
            <li>Maybe better than old spice.</li>
            <li>but when you put it on your skin it kind of smells different, though it may just be my skin.</li>
            <li>I did try a hair product that was said to contain phermones and it had a distinct odor.</li>
            <li>So, from the various reactions I have gotten, I would have to say this stuff really works--it also seems to make you feel better and more relaxed as well.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they find as much fun wearing it as I did.  </li>
            <li>But even then, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>so I guess it is someone useful.</li>
            <li>A fun option to have as a fragrance.</li>
            <li>For a woman that likes to smell feminine, I definitely recommend it to smell nice for yourself/partner.</li>
            <li>people are the same nice to me</li>
            <li>effects are too much fun to discontinue.</li>
            <li>Overall im loving the experience, but it depends on the culture you are living too</li>
            <li>Or just fun to ponder the role of instinct.</li>
            <li>The sweet scent alone is very alluring!</li>
            <li>Overall nice smell</li>
            <li>Over all, smells great, very unique and at the very least</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and like it really well!</li>
            <li>and while no, I did not smell like cake, I have my own special scent, so mysterious and different, a mixture of many things</li>
            <li>People in general are more likely to warm up and talk to me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, the smell is unique and lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li>I wear it right when I get out the shower.</li>
            <li>For right now, this is my sometimes signature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now.</li>
            <li>What I LOVE about this is that initially this oil based perfume/pheromone has a sweet smell (I don&#x27;t like THAT smell.</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering a new bottle just because I love the smell so much.</li>
            <li>On a friend of mine it smells like a slightly floral kind of light Musk scent.</li>
            <li>After that initial introduction, I quickly fell in love with this.</li>
            <li>I can see all of this as being the result of the well known placebo effect; and on the other hand the product seems designed to elicit comments owing to it&#x27;s aroma; women like more fruity scents in their perfumes so surely a man wearing something that smells, um, fruity, is more likely to get \\&quot;looks\\&quot; and \\&quot;comments\\&quot; from women.</li>
            <li>I work in a hospital where you aren&#x27;t really supposed to wear perfumes, but this is light enough to pass and be okay.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice fragrance, is oil based, but, I do not know how long the fragrance lasts on me.</li>
            <li>I tried it once, seems to have nice light scent, but even with cap on tight it leaked all over my purse</li>
            <li>I do notice a difference when wearing Pure Instinct!</li>
            <li>I looove the smell of Pure Instinct!</li>
            <li>and I liked this so much that I have ordered a second bottle of it.</li>
            <li>aw okay lets see if the smell gets better or something&amp;#34;.. A WASTE OF MONEY,</li>
            <li>perhaps the scent will give the wearer more courage, it seems to do absolutely nothing for anyone else you are near.</li>
            <li>Just buy a good perfume like black orchid by Tom ford instead.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile I&#x27;m catching some of my guy buddies paying a little bit more attention to me than normal</li>
            <li>Perhaps this is not a long time for most people but to me it is.</li>
            <li>so it was very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Strangely enough I do find people in general do seem more polite, kinder, more interested in whatever it is</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I am not a shy person</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I instantly felt confident and sexier.</li>
            <li>I did get some friendly hellos and glances from some of the guys I talk too, even the quiet ones were more open and friendly with me.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I had lasted me for well over 4 months.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I first bought this product at Ambiance.</li>
            <li>I thought at first it must be coincidence</li>
            <li>Make some chocolate chip cookies while wearing the oil and just an apron (and only an apron) for your favorite man.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pheromones are sexually dimorphic, which means that they effect each sex differently.</li>
            <li>I actually use this in a lotion and love how it smells alone.  </li>
            <li>because I was interested in the topic sinces somebody had mentioned it ,I was like</li>
            <li>Hopefully I can find another product that is similar that is given more care in packaging.</li>
            <li>My friend at work brought some in for me to try and my boyfriend came in on my lunch break and the first thing he said was \\&quot;</li>
            <li>I had ordered this before from another company and they charged twice as much!  </li>
            <li>This scent is one of my favorite all time scents to wear daily!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m noticing more stares from men and getting hit on ALOT more than usual.</li>
            <li>That sounds about as logical a concept as an attractant potion so why not?  </li>
            <li>Also a very sensual aroma!</li>
            <li>So maybe this one has no fake reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>About the pheromone and attraction thing im not 100% sure on this because I have only used it at university</li>
            <li>Very obvious flirting and touching  </li>
            <li>This happened the first day I wore the pheromone a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than snakeoil, but as long as you know that going into it, it can be a fun gag gift.  </li>
            <li>will only love me because they’re under a witchy</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells, but it does not last at all.</li>
            <li>a more technically note, I ordered this on 7/23/2014 and got it on 7/29/2014.</li>
            <li>a more technically note, I ordered this on 7/23/2014 and got it on 7/29/2014.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too overpowering and smells pretty gender neutral.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hilarious because the next week when I came bck to work for him he had on gym shoes!!</li>
            <li>I love it, just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li>Basically, it is a bottle of essential oils that smell ok.</li>
            <li>This is where it may work for some men but at first it does smell very girly and fresh.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I think that sometimes this stuff has a placebo effect that makes peoples confidence level higher when they wear it.</li>
            <li>Give it a shot ;)  </li>
            <li>First off, the smell is way to fruity and feminine.</li>
            <li>It basically puts them in an addictive love trance.</li>
            <li>I wanted something new and different, and would be my own</li>
            <li>I wanted something new and different, and would be my own</li>
            <li>My first impression right from the bottle was that it was very fruity.</li>
            <li>At work everyone seemed more friendly when i wore it, especially those working near me.</li>
            <li>but oddly I do feel very confident when wearing.</li>
            <li>Men look me more in the eye and encourage conversation and do flirty touching  Men that I&#x27;ve just met want to hug me multiple times (and inhale the scent from my neck and collarbone very obviously and intensely)  </li>
            <li>but as it blends with your own personal chemistry, it changes to YOUR smell and the initial sweet smell of the product is gone.</li>
            <li>It has a unique, soft, scent.</li>
            <li>I cover with other cologne, Kind of smells musky.</li>
            <li>The only problem I could see with this product is that it may be too sweet to layer with some perfumes unless they have a fruity or flowery sweet scent as it is.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t happen - I had to wash my neck and arms again, and put my old \\&quot;friend\\&quot; lotion - sweet pea - with smell that was never wrong.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fruity scent, but as far as attracting the opposite sex...</li>
            <li>now i see female reviewers are having good results, I&#x27;m starting to think it&#x27;s the pheromone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I go out to a club I have at least TEN to TWELVE very attractive guys try to arrange dates or give me their numbers.</li>
            <li>Even just constantly having the men want to hug me and inhaling the scent and then telling me how good I smell and then asking me out is enough proof for me that it works!  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to it for such a reasonable price!!  </li>
            <li>, I could not speak to the positive of any effects of using it.</li>
            <li>It smells like fruits and pretty but wears off too fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it actually attracts the opposite sex, but it does make for good perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells like fruity and sweet but yet soft...</li>
            <li>The smell itself isn&#x27;t bad, and it does change overtime when it interacts with your body, but there&#x27;s nothing magical in this that makes people more attractive or desirable to the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>but the odor isnt strong or obvious</li>
            <li>pure relaxation in a bottle wish I had some now...</li>
            <li>I bought this instead of the Pure Romance Pheremones...wish I wouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>Pure Instinct exceeded my expectations by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my hubby is reciprocating like never before!&lt;br /&gt;Hurray for pure instinct.</li>
            <li>Every time I wear Pure Instincts</li>
            <li>THAT  PURE ROMANCE SELLS FOR LIKE 28.00</li>
            <li>I certainly feel feminine when wearing it.</li>
            <li>I am the only person I know who uses this, and somehow that&#x27;s pretty special.  </li>
            <li>I notice other people seem to notice me more and respond positively.</li>
            <li>You cant really tell if there&#x27;s pheromones in it (they kinda smell like a human skin or light must)</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t magical or anything, but it&#x27;s got a nice smell, and isn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice anything.</li>
            <li>Smells really feminine</li>
            <li>Since I started wearing this product, everyone wants to hug me, both men and women.  </li>
            <li>I like to say that that&#x27;s what I really truly smell like,</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>: It smells very feminine, but claims to be unisex.</li>
            <li>He became very affectionate with me on the nights I had this on.</li>
            <li>this stuf relaxes you fast no matter</li>
            <li>I gave it a 1 star because the intended use didn&#x27;t work and it disappears too fast on the skin.</li>
            <li>And the seller, Mommy&#x27;s Closet, shipped very promptly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a straight guy and this stuff smells like straight up women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>its not the real thing.i would not recommend this.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was lite, airy and very sensual.</li>
            <li>I dont really think it makes a difference in &#x27;attraction&#x27; towards you</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fruity</li>
            <li>Ironic.  </li>
            <li>, united states is very antisocial they dont look at you in the face and just don&#x27;t care</li>
            <li>Fast delivery 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Very fruity smell and scent it to die for.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it really works as a pheromone...</li>
            <li>bummer, because I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>To me 6 days is really fast</li>
            <li>To me 6 days is really fast</li>
            <li>For $10 what do you have to lose really?</li>
            <li>I drenched my whole body with this stuff and no one noticed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>just dont put too much on...</li>
            <li>but thats with any perfume really...</li>
            <li>Apply too much of it, though, and it&#x27;s overpoweringly fruity.</li>
            <li>Smell is light enough to wear another nothing or add Cologne.</li>
            <li>I wanted to really put this stuff to the test.</li>
            <li>It really smells amazing which is a big factor in why I bought the 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li>I AM VERY  </li>
            <li>I like it thanks.</li>
            <li>I really would buy it again tho.</li>
            <li>but ultimately it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Oxytocin is known to wear off fast.</li>
            <li>Same product as I purchased at and adult toy party, but at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>But, it was cheap and I&#x27;m smart enough to know that there is no &#x27;magical potion&#x27; to attract anyone but because it was so cheap, and because the idea that people actually sell this stuff with such grand claims is hilarious to me, I had to try it.  </li>
            <li>but it is definitely the real stuff and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>When I got home I checked Amazon and found the exact same product, same brand, bottle and everything, for a quarter of the price and free shipping, so I decided it was worth the gamble.  </li>
            <li>This version has a fruitier smell than the other one, but I love it.</li>
            <li>There are other products that are much better</li>
            <li>Had better luck with other Pheromones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>mixed it with another oil to create a unique scent and will definately buy it again.</li>
            <li>Smell good also, but the same problem - gone so fast, I have never had a perfume with such a short \\&quot;life-time\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>To me the smell never changes much; it&#x27;s a bit like watermelon at first, then changes subtly &#x27;til it has a kind of musky scent like dragon&#x27;s blood.</li>
            <li>After trying Pure Instinct for only a couple of weeks now, being an attractant, has not gotten me any compliments, but, I have noticed female co-workers walking by a lot more than they have been.</li>
            <li>Also--please note that I&#x27;ve tried this product in many different social situations (at work, the club, coffee shops, in class, at the beach, restaurants etc.)</li>
            <li>Customers are more open, friendly, and less defensive towards me.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does have very nice smell, that last .... for a few minutes!</li>
            <li>I think a person&#x27;s look and attitude is going to be just as, if not more, effective than this product.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a while, my husband loves when i wear it, its sweet and floral and i cant get enough!</li>
            <li>good thing all you need is a dab, this little bottle will last me forever!</li>
            <li>But it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also! Came in brand new condition!</li>
            <li>Then again he is usually crazy about me, but I found it nice that he was more tender loving with me than usual.</li>
            <li>Then again he is usually crazy about me, but I found it nice that he was more tender loving with me than usual.</li>
            <li>Simply put, if you sweat in the same area where you applied this, you can smell YOU more.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this more for a female though than a male.</li>
            <li>It makes your perfume more personal and no one smells the same with it on.</li>
            <li>So for the most part, in the end, this stuff actually has the opposite effect that a guy would want.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Originally I ordered this looking for a boost during a busy day, as I had tried (poppers) way back in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>(and I was wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans and there were many other HOT girls there</li>
            <li>If you have ever been to a Pure Romance party you have tried the &amp;#34;Basic Instinct&amp;#34; it is exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>To be honest the whole pheromone story behind this pure instinct bottle is a bunch of boloni.</li>
            <li>Really, I did not notice any difference so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dental professional and sit very close to my patients .</li>
            <li>It has a light musky scent that compliments my perfume very well, I only use it occasionally because it does work for me</li>
            <li>I wear it on my wrist everyday and its refreshing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a female to wear this over perfume actually, but as for me and other guys its ok to use for maybe going to a store or family friendly place where your not trying to pick up woman.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading a few reviews of how it used pheromones to lure people to the wearer, thinking I could use it at my job (which is mostly a hustling gig).</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s when the hormones fully mix with your normal scent or something?</li>
            <li>Normally they just flirt and we talk...</li>
            <li>Normally I have about THREE guys approach me when I go out to the club.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered 2 bottles on amazon for a few cents more than i paid for this.</li>
            <li>I like to put this on before I apply my normal cologne</li>
            <li>Maybe, if I keep using it more, like everyday, they might come out and say something rather than stand around you.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting magic, but I was expecting maybe a few heads to turn.....</li>
            <li>This product is good, but not great.</li>
            <li>not really certain if this is really working or not because when I wear it out i rarely get that much response</li>
            <li>i live with someone who has bad allergies to perfume so this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long, at most 2 or 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Three men throughout the night approached the friend on my right, skipped me, and moved on to the 2 friends on my left to ask them to dance and, not to sound conceited, but I&#x27;ve been told (by people other than my mother)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent is light not overpowering, I wear this with my other perfume</li>
            <li>MY natural smell which I LOVE, didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The smell is more old lady until it wears off a little.</li>
            <li>but I am worried the new horde of ladies soon to be in my life</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>the other male doc that I work with was also checking me out and talking to me more than normal .im</li>
            <li>The problem is, whatever male pheromones are in this wear off very fast.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t show any more attention than usual.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get hit on by males any more than usual</li>
            <li>After the club incident my female roommates acknowledged that my pheromones really seem to work and started to ask to try some themselves!  </li>
            <li>and my opinion is that the same fruity original scent did not change and it only lasted maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>and my opinion is that the same fruity original scent did not change and it only lasted maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Yes it was Christmas but let&#x27;s not forget that usually never happens.</li>
            <li>First , my boss is male and i decide to wear it to see what type of reaction I&#x27;d get .</li>
            <li>This is the first pheromone product I&#x27;ve tried that actually works.</li>
            <li>The aroma is so pleasant and for the little that you need it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>think that my personal scent has notes of both fruity and floral, an overall sweet smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a soft light fruity smell...but not sweet at all.</li>
            <li>I must say that this is not a strong scent, but the pheromones have a strong effect on the women around me.</li>
            <li>Received large tips/bonuses several times while wearing this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I went to a \\&quot;pleasure party\\&quot; last week and the woman selling us products swore by Pure Instinct, claiming that she&#x27;s practically swatting guys away when she has it on.</li>
            <li>this is NOT a 100% pure essential oil.</li>
            <li>I went to a pure romance party where they had a pheromone perfume oil similar to this one</li>
            <li>When a friend got married, I advised her that sometimes in her married life, she would need just a little edge, and gave her a bottle.</li>
            <li>Mind you this is a UNISEX pheromones, it&#x27;s for everyone, and even better it smells a little different on each person.</li>
            <li>I like the mild smell and it can be worn with my other perfumes.</li>
            <li>I have read a few reviews on pheromones that they noticed a HUGE difference when tested with their spouse.</li>
            <li>It matches me completely, -and</li>
            <li>wow.....</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be surprised of how it affects people.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO then it is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>I use real perfume for when I go out in public.</li>
            <li>and i see no change, like someone approaching me like unusual.</li>
            <li>what a save and this smells so beatiful and natural.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the old wives tail.</li>
            <li>This product is BY FAR the winner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised my husband didn&#x27;t ask what I put on bc</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of this purchase.</li>
            <li>but it has been at least a 10-15 dollar increase:)</li>
            <li>The smell made me think that it probably contains guava pheromones (guavas naturally give off pheromones).</li>
            <li>And completely beats all of my colognes, so I combine it with one</li>
            <li>but people don&#x27;t seem to notice anymore, not even if I tell them to directly smell the area I applied it.</li>
            <li>This oil was the most expensive at 10 dollars but to find something that is based off of you, it was so worth it in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am so exited to start wearing this due to my husband coming back home from a 6 month deployment next week. :)</li>
            <li>I was sitting in the auto shop the other day, minding my own business, reading a magazine while I waited for a service on my car, a guy going out, just stopped dead in his tracks, and spoke to me.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it has a mildly sweet, slightly musky, smell to it.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was on here for a lot less.</li>
            <li>In the past, I have only been able to find this product at home sales.  </li>
            <li>Maybe even made me feel sexy but not sure it actually does anything.</li>
            <li>The scent is fruity and flowery, and is strong at first but calms down after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spent altogether maybe 30 dollars on those instead of buying half a bottle of one not so famous singer.</li>
            <li>I bought this product wondering if the pheromones actually were strong enough to attract other people.  </li>
            <li>Positive does not attract positive, only positive and negative do.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t notice and he didn&#x27;t act any different than normal.</li>
            <li>All it does is smell a little funky and leave super greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Normally I only use pure %100 organic oils if possible.</li>
            <li>I definitely would not recommend this for a straight male.</li>
            <li>Single women, friends, married women, local celebrity rockstars, etc.</li>
            <li>Found it the first time many years ago at an adult party, it was expensive!  </li>
            <li>I have no clue if it actually works, or if it simply boosts my self confidence when I wear it, but I like it, and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>The scent is light enough for everyday wear to wear alone or with another cologne which it will enhance!  </li>
            <li>I’m pretty much average in every way; attractiveness, intelligence, wit, penis size.</li>
            <li>( I read so far back that someone even smelt like cake )</li>
            <li>but I have only worn it for one day so far.</li>
            <li>For example, normally if I go to the grocery store I will get hit on by African American men sometimes and the Caucasian men will avoid eye contact and carry on with their chores/grocery shopping.</li>
            <li>Even in jeans and a t-shirt I&#x27;ve worn this product and gotten hit on (sometimes BLATANTLY and RELENTLESSLY) by a minimum of 4 to 5 guys  when I&#x27;m sure that normally I&#x27;d get around 2 or 3 guys or so at the maximum without wearing it.  </li>
            <li>He has no idea I purchased this potent secret sex when I want it weapon.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, however I can&#x27;t see any difference when I&#x27;m wearing this or any random perfume.</li>
            <li>While with my boyfriend, there isn&#x27;t much affect other than he loves the scent.</li>
            <li>Men that I work with have displayed intense jealousy whenever I get attention from other coworkers  </li>
            <li>It smells really fruity, like all the other reviews.</li>
            <li>No straight male wants to smell like watermelons.</li>
            <li>Around parties, and social gatherings all the time, didnt see a difference.</li>
            <li>but I do feel a secret sense of extra security for some reason wearing a product nobody would be able to pinpoint.  </li>
            <li>You can put some on a child&#x27;s pillow and it helps them calm down after a long day.</li>
            <li>did notice more men are starting random conversations with me, but I thought it was my natural charm...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not scared of polite conversation and throwing a joke or two at a complete strange during day to day life.</li>
            <li>This sickly sweet smelling product is very thin, smell fades quickly, and to add insult to injury, attracts absolutely no one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure who I&#x27;d recommend this to, but if you want something that is more of a luxury than necessity and have a few extra bucks to toss into the wind, then why not?  </li>
            <li>This product is a pure sham.</li>
            <li>I have been doing lots of research on this little bottle for quite a while and without even knowing what i was really purchasing i decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>Im 54 and women as young as 20 like to converse with me although Ive never pursued anyone in a serious way; Im happily married.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s very curious to note that normally I receive male attention from men of color (African American men, Latin men etc.)</li>

            <li> This has a pleasant scent and has a tendency to raise my mood.</li>
            <li> It seems to elevate my mood and has a pleasant smell that fades soon and doesn&#x27;t conflict with anything else you&#x27;re wearing.</li>

            <li> I get lots of comments on how good I smell.</li>

            <li> Good smell, good effects.</li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> It does smell good out of the bottle, but the thing about pheromone colognes is that your body chemistry changes it, so the trick is, get a girlfriend, both put it on, wait around 10 minutes and smell each others wrists.</li>
            <li> it smells REALLY good, however.</li>
            <li> When I told him about the oil, he told me that was why he smelled my hair because he wanted to know what smelled good.</li>
            <li> When I told him about the oil, he told me that was why he smelled my hair because he wanted to know what smelled good.</li>
            <li> It puts me in a good mood whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> i chosed this rating because i was expecting something that when you smelled the aroma you would be like DAMN that smells soo good</li>
            <li> Even if the pheromones didn&#x27;t work it smells really good.  </li>
            <li> Loved it but couldn&#x27;t afford it..</li>
            <li> However the oil does smell good, this is some sort of oily substance.</li>
            <li> it just smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not like AXE spray for men.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like everybody&#x27;s your puppet when you smell so good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
            <li> This product has a good smell but doesn&#x27;t do anything of what it says.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good and DOESN&#x27;T work.</li>
            <li> it smells really good</li>
            <li> And the self effects are good too.</li>
            <li> mmm it smells sooo good.</li>
            <li> This sent makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> Smelt good but don&#x27;t think the pheromone thing in it is very potent.</li>
            <li> This honestly does smell really amazing on my skin!</li>
            <li> The seller I ordered from is exceptional.</li>
            <li> I give this product 2 stars because it smells good, it&#x27;s really very pleasant but fades fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest the formulators add more of the attractive scent.    </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not like Love Potion #9 lol) but people always ask what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> Very interesting....</li>
            <li> Great product with a smell that I love.</li>
            <li> It gives you more confidence as well; you wll approach women so attractive that you were having been leary about before.  </li>
            <li> Very light scent, gets compliments!</li>
            <li> And I did notice a one day when I was wearing it that I seemed more happy &amp; confident when I had it on!</li>
            <li> great stuff, works fine, easy to use as explained, and very good for its price, I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I work in a salon and always worked for tips and let me tell you- wear this stuff for a month and see the huge difference it makes!!</li>

            <li> LOVE the smell of this!</li>
            <li> with this stuff I got more than I payed for, in my job I got about $40 in tips!</li>
            <li> First applied it smells like a delicious fruity grape bubblegum.</li>
            <li> I love the scent!</li>
            <li> I attract customers a lot easier :) can&#x27;t work without this!</li>
            <li> but this stuff smells great, just wanted some good cheap cologne and this did the trick, kind of fruity</li>
            <li> And I love the smell !...</li>
            <li> Love how this smells on me, I just found this scent again after years of searching and it smells just like I remember!</li>
            <li> But hey, if you guys out there love to smell sweet and delicious by all means buy it!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing....</li>
            <li> this IS AMAZING,</li>
            <li> If it lasted longer I would give it 5 stars but whatever, it smells amazing and makes me feel</li>
            <li> This scent is not girly, so don&#x27;t worry about you smelling like a girl, it&#x27;s a unisex scent that smells amazing for both genders.</li>
            <li> and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> Which I find amazing that it brings out your own scent</li>
            <li> It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> and I think the smell is nice to have on.</li>
            <li> I just like any woman like to go in bed with nice smell around me.</li>
            <li> So each person has their own smell-</li>
            <li> it kind of has a bubble gummy fruity smell.</li>
            <li> I never thought it will be so effective</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in how people approach me and how kind they get.</li>
            <li> I wear this almost every day, sometimes with perfume and sometimes on its own.  </li>
            <li> It has kind of a fruity scent.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but it does not work.</li>
            <li> I say if you dont want him connected to you at the hip then dont put this on with your favorite smell good perfume.</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t work as pheromones or whatever they are promoting the product, the smell is really nice and thats the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> all my bitches love me, all my, all my bitches love, lol</li>
            <li> It smells nice and changes it smell based on the person it is on.</li>
            <li> This product has me loving to touch myself.  </li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t know what kind of fruit</li>
            <li> and I found myself smelling my wrists to try and decipher and solve the puzzle of my own scent that the oil gave out.</li>
            <li> I am in a janitorial kind of job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but guys liked it</li>
            <li> It was as if I didn&#x27;t have it own.</li>
            <li> Smells Nice.  </li>
            <li> Woman seem to react great, more strangers striking up conversation.</li>
            <li> , this oil can be fused with others to come up with your own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
            <li> My bf thinks it smells good guys love any smell of food my boyfriend prefers fruity and citrusy smells</li>
            <li> so he liked this one</li>
            <li> Try it on your own risk.</li>
            <li> The idea is nice, but I just didn&#x27;t have any luck with it.</li>
            <li> Honestly smells a bit like those urinal deodorants in mens toilets.</li>
            <li> And I honestly think it works.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work just has a nice smell</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting any to be honest</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear perfume at work, but this is amazing, light scented and makes me feel great wearing it.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on, I get this warm, fuzzy feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for becoming composed.</li>
            <li> Ordering this product was very easy to order.</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this in the bottle, I LOVED it!</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference in men they starred and smiled more.</li>
            <li> I honestly think this product is better.</li>
            <li> Although this product has a nice smell, I think it to be more of a comfidence booster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and so cheap!</li>
            <li> It is not alcoholy or overwhelming but pleasant and sweet and fruity.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it worked great.</li>
            <li> And the bottle is very easy to lose so make sure you put it somewhere safe.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> nice and discreet.not strong...</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t seem to be anymore attracted to me when I wear it. :-)</li>
            <li> I cute and petite</li>
            <li> But I did find that they are more chatty.</li>
            <li> If my hubby would be a mechanic he maybe would like this greasy smell :).</li>
            <li> My boss even treated me better.  </li>
            <li> I feel more confident.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could bottle up MY smell, as it develops from this product, and spray that on me all the time!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> no clue if it works more or not for my sexual appeal.</li>
            <li> I would test this on my husband though when he gets here bc that would be interesting to see...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this to attract people or make people more pleasant/friendly around you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of an oil than a perfume.</li>
            <li> The pheromones seem to affect some people more than others.</li>
            <li> but I received many compliments while wearing this.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my boyfriend and it had more of a musky scent than when it was on me.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to smell this one.</li>
            <li> I am on my way to ordering two more</li>
            <li> bottles.&lt;br /&gt; :-)</li>
            <li> I became so in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have become more confident while wearing this product, which helps too.</li>
            <li> and i swear people are more attracted and nicer when i wear it.</li>
            <li> i love wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li> AD makes better scents of pheromones</li>
            <li> I love how it smelled on me from the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Something in it works, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> I found a magic potion.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> In the end, I bought some more from this site for my sister, friends and, of course, myself.  </li>
            <li> and I hung out with a girl that I thought for sure I would never have a chance with.  </li>
            <li> I found that when I started to wear this product, guys around me started to look more, some guys in my college classes were talking to me more, wanting to talk to me.</li>
            <li> I found that some men react more to it than others.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume.</li>
            <li> The smell is fabulous and fruity, I just wish it lasted longer!</li>
            <li> I have seen this product in stores go for a lot more.</li>
            <li> Four more words required.</li>
            <li> If you need more confidence, by all means try the pheremones.</li>
            <li> lol .. not for adults at all .. good for teenage girls.</li>
            <li> , most of them don&#x27;t even notice they are doing it.</li>
            <li> okay let me google it and</li>
            <li> But I must say I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more into sophisticated or musky scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just wear my favorite perfume over it.</li>
            <li> I love it, will be reordering.</li>
            <li> i bought this before from a pleasure party for more than $20.</li>
            <li> Works Well under most Colognes.</li>
            <li> It seems to be more potent, and you get a lot more of it.</li>
            <li> I would have to say this is more of a product for a women, unless you were going to wear it under another cologne as a man.</li>
            <li> You rub it in your warmer places and pressure points for better results.</li>
            <li> but most of the guys huddled around me)  </li>
            <li> but this pheromone seemed to attract more Caucasian/European men and Latin men.</li>
            <li> I found my favorite avon perfume faraway on amazon.</li>
            <li> I read it worked for most of the ppl that bought it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It smells feminine, sexy, and fruity.</li>
            <li> But, this oil literally made all of these better, quicker,</li>
            <li> This was a Love Potion #9 situation IRL.</li>
            <li> but I feel as if it made my mood much better.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful smell (completely different on every person).</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> The smell makes me happy and there&#x27;s not enough happiness in the world.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I already have ordered more and will again when I get close to using it all up.</li>
            <li> Plus it seems to always make me feel more confident when I wear it...</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re sure to get a headache...</li>
            <li> But...If you want it to do more in the attraction department add a dab of Scent of Eros for women or PCC.</li>
            <li> I must say it does make me feel confident .</li>
            <li> smells ok, doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on men.</li>
            <li> [Disclaimer-This scent is more for women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into getting hit on (so I&#x27;m sure that vibe comes off of me)</li>
            <li> however I have noticed I defiantly get checked out more when I wear it and at the gym</li>
            <li> seem more appealing in whatever situation</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time when I go to parties and way more confidence.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite perfume ever</li>
            <li> I get more compliments, conversation and friendliness.</li>
            <li> It has a flowery smell on me and more of a fruity&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li> Better to just think of it as a perfume and nothing more.</li>
            <li> The scent is so sexy.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My scent smells like Victoria&#x27;s Secrets&#x27; Love Spell.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> PLEASED  </li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product, it smells fa-nominal.</li>
            <li> Okay, so maybe not...  </li>
            <li> I pair this with my signature fragrance, which I have noticed more compliments when paired together.</li>
            <li> So what starts happening is you&#x27;ll notice guys will start to be more buddy buddy around you</li>
            <li> so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> I seam to get more if a response when i&#x27;m dint</li>
            <li> I loved it right away.  </li>
            <li> Very unique smell</li>
            <li> The bottle states that everyone will get their own unique smell</li>
            <li> own unique scent</li>
            <li> In 15-20 minutes it settles into your own fragrance which I also love because it makes this fragrance oil so very special and unique.</li>
            <li> And he went on and on about how he thinks I&#x27;m pretty, cute, gorgeous and that he missed me and loves me.</li>
            <li> And he went on and on about how he thinks I&#x27;m pretty, cute, gorgeous and that he missed me and loves me.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it smelled but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $22 for it.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and effective!</li>
            <li> This items have a nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use something too strong, just something light and pretty, seems to compliment the oil great.  </li>
            <li> That seems fun.... !!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;success&amp;#34; of others is probably just new found confidence, which is attractive to everybody.</li>
            <li> It was amazing to find that people were much more calm and trusting when they were in close proximity to the smell and scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because the reviews were good and the price was more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll sure enjoy trying it out more.</li>
            <li> I feel very special wearing this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good smell and its pretty strong yet oily.</li>
            <li> Very sweet and fruity, not overpowering, and you can smell an underlying scent that you cant quite put your finger on (the pheromones).</li>
            <li> It smells very sweet.</li>
            <li> This mixed well with my favorite perfum and wasn&#x27;t overwhelming, great size to keep in a make up bag or purse</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad to have found it so cheap on here.</li>
            <li> product was delivered fast and saved myself money also like the way it enhances the smell of my perfume or it can also be worn alone either way its good</li>
            <li> But imma buy more right now for sure &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> think this product works best when applied in areas where you might sweat more, because your sweat aka your natural pheromones, mix with this product to produce more of your natural smell--- or something like that.</li>
            <li> Sweet!  </li>
            <li> Sweet and fruity!</li>
            <li> and I liked the light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> but my boyfriend loves it, it smells great and it definitely makes more people notice me</li>
            <li> stills smells too strong for me</li>
            <li> the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell though, and as a perfume</li>
            <li> But this is a great smelling attention attractant, because i have noticed a major change in how women approach me.</li>
            <li> I would like to think that as time went on the aroma did not leave me quickly like it said others did, rather it changed to a more refreshing clean smell, like rain.</li>
            <li> When I first bought it, I applied this on every day, and it had a nice aroma</li>
            <li> I went on here and found this one, tried it, just as good plus you get a vial full instead of a roll on like pure romances type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know if the pheromones are given more hype than they deserve or if I&#x27;m just highly oblivious to the effect they have.</li>
            <li> It just brought more attention than usual, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> gay one day...</li>
            <li> For starters, if you are a guy looking for a magic get laid quick potion this is not it.</li>
            <li> I can’t be certain, but I think this magic, witch, alternate universe, spell, sex oil actually made me more physically attractive, intelligent and humorous.  </li>
            <li> smells great, slightly more feminine than a true non gender specific.</li>
            <li> Remember using this and the Pure Romance kind in college.</li>
            <li> Mostly, honestly.... I bought Pure Instinct in hopes it might help me in my job hunt.</li>
            <li> , im totally over pleased with this product and for sure will buy more!</li>
            <li> It smells great, I got compliments all last night and it arrived so quickly!  </li>
            <li> and I know I&#x27;m an attractive and alluring human being, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;So overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Combination of lycoric candy and cheap musk cologne.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I also will sometimes layer it with a light perfume or a perfumy type lotion like creamy coconut that I had from a store at the mall.  </li>
            <li> I like wearing it alone when I go out because its so light and unassuming.</li>
            <li> Overall, GREAT product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy wearing this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really like this in a nice roller ball.</li>
            <li> I keep it in stock at home and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Similar smell, gives you a calming, happy feeling when inhaled.</li>
            <li> Do not base your review on what it smells like out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> , this one did not try to offer free sample-for-review.  </li>
            <li> On a side note, perfume oils are seriously cheap</li>
            <li> However, it should be noted that he did smell my hair and asked if I showered ( I know so romantic, lol ).</li>
            <li> However, it should be noted that he did smell my hair and asked if I showered ( I know so romantic, lol ).</li>
            <li> I doubt it does anything for &amp;#34;attraction&amp;#34; but it really does smell nice.</li>
            <li> Scent enjoy</li>
            <li> Nice scent, just don&#x27;t usw too much because it smells musky if you do.</li>
            <li> It also DOES uplift my mood and make me smile a bit more.</li>
            <li> Worth it :)</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product and has a very gentle,light scent that does not aggravate any asthma or allergies in me or others.  </li>
            <li> Not just for a sexual encounter, but is hope of meeting Mr. Right.</li>
            <li> but it has a very fresh fruity smell like a gummy bear or something.</li>
            <li> It was very nice to see a different side to him.</li>
            <li> It was very nice to see a different side to him.</li>
            <li> I love Pure Instinct!  </li>
            <li> i just received it today(which was very fast&#x3D;]) and thought maybe i wouldn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> I love the smell very much.</li>
            <li> I noticed it makes girls fall in love with me very fast with a hint of lust thrown in there.</li>
            <li> Women did not throw themselves at me but were friendly</li>
            <li> As for gender friendly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a perfume but its too fruity for a guy to wear every day.</li>
            <li> this will not make all the guys want you, but you will get some friendly treatment here and there.</li>
            <li> I originally found this product at a party.</li>
            <li> So yea, Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Well, I used this stuff to make my husband more aware and, I suppose you could say, turned on without me doing anything.</li>
            <li> , you gotta go where people are friendly</li>
            <li> I really honestly love the smell of this...and i believe it works pretty damn well...</li>
            <li> Worth trying, even if it doesn&#x27;t have quite the effects you were hoping for!</li>
            <li> So I had to go out and buy a bottle RIGHT AWAY, because he said later that it smelt so good on me, so we&#x27;ll have to see what happens :)    </li>
            <li> The fragrance was a clean ultra soap and pheromone explosion.</li>
            <li> Oil has a pleasant scent and simple glass applicator.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any special attention or friendly behavior from any people that I&#x27;ve been around.</li>
            <li> Its a soft oil with a delicious sweet scent that last hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a spicy but sweet and rich grape/fruity scent.</li>
            <li> Eeee dnt look nothing special</li>
            <li> At certain points it was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Well it certainly provides that boost and women love it.  </li>
            <li> What to feel special too?  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something a bit different and when I tried it at first the scent was pleasant, but very quickly turned on me.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected a lot of girls said it wasn&#x27;t too great</li>
            <li> Love how fast it</li>
            <li> Smells like sweet grapes, maybe?)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good, but that&#x27;s the only reason you should buy it.  </li>
            <li> I think people are friendlier to me when I have it on, which could either be a placebo effect or possibly that it smells good.</li>
            <li> Have yet to find a man that can resist the sweet smell of this.</li>
            <li> not even wealthy or drive a fast car</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that when I wear this pheromone they give me more eye contact, flirt more and ask me out at a much higher rate than normal.</li>
            <li> It has a very fruity smell which is ok for a chick but not for a dude.</li>
            <li> They say if you believe in the product, it becomes true, maybe in a placebo sort of way.</li>
            <li> A bit too sweet for a man, I would assume, even though it is designed as unisex.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had a couple of comments from friends that I smell good.</li>
            <li> I would buy again but keep it in a cool place to see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and would buy from the seller again! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s not a bad buy</li>
            <li> its not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Hey not bad for the price</li>
            <li> This is a second order and it was as good as the first!</li>
            <li> gave this 4 stars because your smell fades so quickly.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and as promised.  </li>
            <li> As for the seller, they&#x27;re quick with shipping, I&#x27;ve had no complaints, and they sell this bottle cheaper than anywhere else I&#x27;ve searched.</li>
            <li> I carry it around with me so that I can reapply it through out the day because it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> The good things I did not waste too much money on this.</li>
            <li> I have also heard that if your scent smells like playdough you might be pregnant.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this works, but it really smells nice and since it doesn&#x27;t cost much, what&#x27;s the harm?  </li>
            <li> It has a hint of guava (not the super stinky variety...</li>
            <li> The oil will absorb quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would and simply because the smell is nice and completely unique, it is really special.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would and simply because the smell is nice and completely unique, it is really special.</li>
            <li> but you may be able to get something larger or more worth the 9 bucks if you can find something that smells like the bubble gum.</li>
            <li> Now that I remember it, it was very funny.</li>
            <li> Now that I remember it, it was very funny.</li>
            <li> However men if you&#x27;re comfortable with something that first goes on feminine smelling go for</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of pure instinct, and I love the smell .</li>
            <li> Also the seller Steve&#x27;s ships fast and ads some cool coupons!</li>
            <li> So to find it for less than $8 a bottle was great.  </li>
            <li> but when i put it on it actually smelt pretty good.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s goal is to get guys to be more sexual, or passionate</li>
            <li> But after a while of wearing it, as the floral, sweet notes wore off, it got a musty smell that kind of &#x27;catch&#x27; in the back of my throat when I would get a whiff of it.</li>
            <li> the self confidence, how people is so much nicer to you!!</li>
            <li> And the Nights I Did NOT wear it, he wasnt interested in doing anything except getting sleep!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s packed pretty well!</li>
            <li> After that incident I decided to try to experiment more with just this pheromone and was happily surprised by the outcome!  </li>
            <li> Same product as at the toy partys but for a better price !</li>
            <li> I just wore it on a first date!</li>
            <li> Smell a bit fruity and sweet at first, but scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell amazing and personal then this is for you, but if you just want to attract mates try a stronger scent.</li>
            <li> Maybe better than old spice.</li>
            <li> but when you put it on your skin it kind of smells different, though it may just be my skin.</li>
            <li> I did try a hair product that was said to contain phermones and it had a distinct odor.</li>
            <li> So, from the various reactions I have gotten, I would have to say this stuff really works--it also seems to make you feel better and more relaxed as well.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they find as much fun wearing it as I did.  </li>
            <li> But even then, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> so I guess it is someone useful.</li>
            <li> A fun option to have as a fragrance.</li>
            <li> For a woman that likes to smell feminine, I definitely recommend it to smell nice for yourself/partner.</li>
            <li> people are the same nice to me</li>
            <li> effects are too much fun to discontinue.</li>
            <li> Overall im loving the experience, but it depends on the culture you are living too</li>
            <li> Or just fun to ponder the role of instinct.</li>
            <li> The sweet scent alone is very alluring!</li>
            <li> Overall nice smell</li>
            <li> Over all, smells great, very unique and at the very least</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and like it really well!</li>
            <li> and while no, I did not smell like cake, I have my own special scent, so mysterious and different, a mixture of many things</li>
            <li> People in general are more likely to warm up and talk to me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, the smell is unique and lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li> I wear it right when I get out the shower.</li>
            <li> For right now, this is my sometimes signature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now.</li>
            <li> What I LOVE about this is that initially this oil based perfume/pheromone has a sweet smell (I don&#x27;t like THAT smell.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering a new bottle just because I love the smell so much.</li>
            <li> On a friend of mine it smells like a slightly floral kind of light Musk scent.</li>
            <li> After that initial introduction, I quickly fell in love with this.</li>
            <li> I can see all of this as being the result of the well known placebo effect; and on the other hand the product seems designed to elicit comments owing to it&#x27;s aroma; women like more fruity scents in their perfumes so surely a man wearing something that smells, um, fruity, is more likely to get \\&quot;looks\\&quot; and \\&quot;comments\\&quot; from women.</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital where you aren&#x27;t really supposed to wear perfumes, but this is light enough to pass and be okay.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice fragrance, is oil based, but, I do not know how long the fragrance lasts on me.</li>
            <li> I tried it once, seems to have nice light scent, but even with cap on tight it leaked all over my purse</li>
            <li> I do notice a difference when wearing Pure Instinct!</li>
            <li> I looove the smell of Pure Instinct!</li>
            <li> and I liked this so much that I have ordered a second bottle of it.</li>
            <li> aw okay lets see if the smell gets better or something&amp;#34;.. A WASTE OF MONEY,</li>
            <li> perhaps the scent will give the wearer more courage, it seems to do absolutely nothing for anyone else you are near.</li>
            <li> Just buy a good perfume like black orchid by Tom ford instead.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile I&#x27;m catching some of my guy buddies paying a little bit more attention to me than normal</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is not a long time for most people but to me it is.</li>
            <li> so it was very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Strangely enough I do find people in general do seem more polite, kinder, more interested in whatever it is</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I am not a shy person</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I instantly felt confident and sexier.</li>
            <li> I did get some friendly hellos and glances from some of the guys I talk too, even the quiet ones were more open and friendly with me.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I had lasted me for well over 4 months.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at Ambiance.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it must be coincidence</li>
            <li> Make some chocolate chip cookies while wearing the oil and just an apron (and only an apron) for your favorite man.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pheromones are sexually dimorphic, which means that they effect each sex differently.</li>
            <li> I actually use this in a lotion and love how it smells alone.  </li>
            <li> because I was interested in the topic sinces somebody had mentioned it ,I was like</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can find another product that is similar that is given more care in packaging.</li>
            <li> My friend at work brought some in for me to try and my boyfriend came in on my lunch break and the first thing he said was \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had ordered this before from another company and they charged twice as much!  </li>
            <li> This scent is one of my favorite all time scents to wear daily!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing more stares from men and getting hit on ALOT more than usual.</li>
            <li> That sounds about as logical a concept as an attractant potion so why not?  </li>
            <li> Also a very sensual aroma!</li>
            <li> So maybe this one has no fake reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> About the pheromone and attraction thing im not 100% sure on this because I have only used it at university</li>
            <li> Very obvious flirting and touching  </li>
            <li> This happened the first day I wore the pheromone a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than snakeoil, but as long as you know that going into it, it can be a fun gag gift.  </li>
            <li> will only love me because they’re under a witchy</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells, but it does not last at all.</li>
            <li> a more technically note, I ordered this on 7/23/2014 and got it on 7/29/2014.</li>
            <li> a more technically note, I ordered this on 7/23/2014 and got it on 7/29/2014.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too overpowering and smells pretty gender neutral.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hilarious because the next week when I came bck to work for him he had on gym shoes!!</li>
            <li> I love it, just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Basically, it is a bottle of essential oils that smell ok.</li>
            <li> This is where it may work for some men but at first it does smell very girly and fresh.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I think that sometimes this stuff has a placebo effect that makes peoples confidence level higher when they wear it.</li>
            <li> Give it a shot ;)  </li>
            <li> First off, the smell is way to fruity and feminine.</li>
            <li> It basically puts them in an addictive love trance.</li>
            <li> I wanted something new and different, and would be my own</li>
            <li> I wanted something new and different, and would be my own</li>
            <li> My first impression right from the bottle was that it was very fruity.</li>
            <li> At work everyone seemed more friendly when i wore it, especially those working near me.</li>
            <li> but oddly I do feel very confident when wearing.</li>
            <li> Men look me more in the eye and encourage conversation and do flirty touching  Men that I&#x27;ve just met want to hug me multiple times (and inhale the scent from my neck and collarbone very obviously and intensely)  </li>
            <li> but as it blends with your own personal chemistry, it changes to YOUR smell and the initial sweet smell of the product is gone.</li>
            <li> It has a unique, soft, scent.</li>
            <li> I cover with other cologne, Kind of smells musky.</li>
            <li> The only problem I could see with this product is that it may be too sweet to layer with some perfumes unless they have a fruity or flowery sweet scent as it is.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t happen - I had to wash my neck and arms again, and put my old \\&quot;friend\\&quot; lotion - sweet pea - with smell that was never wrong.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fruity scent, but as far as attracting the opposite sex...</li>
            <li> now i see female reviewers are having good results, I&#x27;m starting to think it&#x27;s the pheromone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I go out to a club I have at least TEN to TWELVE very attractive guys try to arrange dates or give me their numbers.</li>
            <li> Even just constantly having the men want to hug me and inhaling the scent and then telling me how good I smell and then asking me out is enough proof for me that it works!  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to it for such a reasonable price!!  </li>
            <li> , I could not speak to the positive of any effects of using it.</li>
            <li> It smells like fruits and pretty but wears off too fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it actually attracts the opposite sex, but it does make for good perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells like fruity and sweet but yet soft...</li>
            <li> The smell itself isn&#x27;t bad, and it does change overtime when it interacts with your body, but there&#x27;s nothing magical in this that makes people more attractive or desirable to the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> but the odor isnt strong or obvious</li>
            <li> pure relaxation in a bottle wish I had some now...</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the Pure Romance Pheremones...wish I wouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> Pure Instinct exceeded my expectations by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hubby is reciprocating like never before!&lt;br /&gt;Hurray for pure instinct.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear Pure Instincts</li>
            <li> THAT  PURE ROMANCE SELLS FOR LIKE 28.00</li>
            <li> I certainly feel feminine when wearing it.</li>
            <li> I am the only person I know who uses this, and somehow that&#x27;s pretty special.  </li>
            <li> I notice other people seem to notice me more and respond positively.</li>
            <li> You cant really tell if there&#x27;s pheromones in it (they kinda smell like a human skin or light must)</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t magical or anything, but it&#x27;s got a nice smell, and isn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice anything.</li>
            <li> Smells really feminine</li>
            <li> Since I started wearing this product, everyone wants to hug me, both men and women.  </li>
            <li> I like to say that that&#x27;s what I really truly smell like,</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> : It smells very feminine, but claims to be unisex.</li>
            <li> He became very affectionate with me on the nights I had this on.</li>
            <li> this stuf relaxes you fast no matter</li>
            <li> I gave it a 1 star because the intended use didn&#x27;t work and it disappears too fast on the skin.</li>
            <li> And the seller, Mommy&#x27;s Closet, shipped very promptly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a straight guy and this stuff smells like straight up women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> its not the real thing.i would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was lite, airy and very sensual.</li>
            <li> I dont really think it makes a difference in &#x27;attraction&#x27; towards you</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fruity</li>
            <li> Ironic.  </li>
            <li> , united states is very antisocial they dont look at you in the face and just don&#x27;t care</li>
            <li> Fast delivery 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very fruity smell and scent it to die for.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it really works as a pheromone...</li>
            <li> bummer, because I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> To me 6 days is really fast</li>
            <li> To me 6 days is really fast</li>
            <li> For $10 what do you have to lose really?</li>
            <li> I drenched my whole body with this stuff and no one noticed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li> just dont put too much on...</li>
            <li> but thats with any perfume really...</li>
            <li> Apply too much of it, though, and it&#x27;s overpoweringly fruity.</li>
            <li> Smell is light enough to wear another nothing or add Cologne.</li>
            <li> I wanted to really put this stuff to the test.</li>
            <li> It really smells amazing which is a big factor in why I bought the 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY  </li>
            <li> I like it thanks.</li>
            <li> I really would buy it again tho.</li>
            <li> but ultimately it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Oxytocin is known to wear off fast.</li>
            <li> Same product as I purchased at and adult toy party, but at a much better price.  </li>
            <li> But, it was cheap and I&#x27;m smart enough to know that there is no &#x27;magical potion&#x27; to attract anyone but because it was so cheap, and because the idea that people actually sell this stuff with such grand claims is hilarious to me, I had to try it.  </li>
            <li> but it is definitely the real stuff and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> When I got home I checked Amazon and found the exact same product, same brand, bottle and everything, for a quarter of the price and free shipping, so I decided it was worth the gamble.  </li>
            <li> This version has a fruitier smell than the other one, but I love it.</li>
            <li> There are other products that are much better</li>
            <li> Had better luck with other Pheromones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> mixed it with another oil to create a unique scent and will definately buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smell good also, but the same problem - gone so fast, I have never had a perfume with such a short \\&quot;life-time\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> To me the smell never changes much; it&#x27;s a bit like watermelon at first, then changes subtly &#x27;til it has a kind of musky scent like dragon&#x27;s blood.</li>
            <li> After trying Pure Instinct for only a couple of weeks now, being an attractant, has not gotten me any compliments, but, I have noticed female co-workers walking by a lot more than they have been.</li>
            <li> Also--please note that I&#x27;ve tried this product in many different social situations (at work, the club, coffee shops, in class, at the beach, restaurants etc.)</li>
            <li> Customers are more open, friendly, and less defensive towards me.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have very nice smell, that last .... for a few minutes!</li>
            <li> I think a person&#x27;s look and attitude is going to be just as, if not more, effective than this product.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a while, my husband loves when i wear it, its sweet and floral and i cant get enough!</li>
            <li> good thing all you need is a dab, this little bottle will last me forever!</li>
            <li> But it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also! Came in brand new condition!</li>
            <li> Then again he is usually crazy about me, but I found it nice that he was more tender loving with me than usual.</li>
            <li> Then again he is usually crazy about me, but I found it nice that he was more tender loving with me than usual.</li>
            <li> Simply put, if you sweat in the same area where you applied this, you can smell YOU more.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this more for a female though than a male.</li>
            <li> It makes your perfume more personal and no one smells the same with it on.</li>
            <li> So for the most part, in the end, this stuff actually has the opposite effect that a guy would want.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Originally I ordered this looking for a boost during a busy day, as I had tried (poppers) way back in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> (and I was wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans and there were many other HOT girls there</li>
            <li> If you have ever been to a Pure Romance party you have tried the &amp;#34;Basic Instinct&amp;#34; it is exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> To be honest the whole pheromone story behind this pure instinct bottle is a bunch of boloni.</li>
            <li> Really, I did not notice any difference so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental professional and sit very close to my patients .</li>
            <li> It has a light musky scent that compliments my perfume very well, I only use it occasionally because it does work for me</li>
            <li> I wear it on my wrist everyday and its refreshing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a female to wear this over perfume actually, but as for me and other guys its ok to use for maybe going to a store or family friendly place where your not trying to pick up woman.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a few reviews of how it used pheromones to lure people to the wearer, thinking I could use it at my job (which is mostly a hustling gig).</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s when the hormones fully mix with your normal scent or something?</li>
            <li> Normally they just flirt and we talk...</li>
            <li> Normally I have about THREE guys approach me when I go out to the club.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered 2 bottles on amazon for a few cents more than i paid for this.</li>
            <li> I like to put this on before I apply my normal cologne</li>
            <li> Maybe, if I keep using it more, like everyday, they might come out and say something rather than stand around you.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting magic, but I was expecting maybe a few heads to turn.....</li>
            <li> This product is good, but not great.</li>
            <li> not really certain if this is really working or not because when I wear it out i rarely get that much response</li>
            <li> i live with someone who has bad allergies to perfume so this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, at most 2 or 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Three men throughout the night approached the friend on my right, skipped me, and moved on to the 2 friends on my left to ask them to dance and, not to sound conceited, but I&#x27;ve been told (by people other than my mother)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent is light not overpowering, I wear this with my other perfume</li>
            <li> MY natural smell which I LOVE, didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The smell is more old lady until it wears off a little.</li>
            <li> but I am worried the new horde of ladies soon to be in my life</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> the other male doc that I work with was also checking me out and talking to me more than normal .im</li>
            <li> The problem is, whatever male pheromones are in this wear off very fast.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t show any more attention than usual.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get hit on by males any more than usual</li>
            <li> After the club incident my female roommates acknowledged that my pheromones really seem to work and started to ask to try some themselves!  </li>
            <li> and my opinion is that the same fruity original scent did not change and it only lasted maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> and my opinion is that the same fruity original scent did not change and it only lasted maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Yes it was Christmas but let&#x27;s not forget that usually never happens.</li>
            <li> First , my boss is male and i decide to wear it to see what type of reaction I&#x27;d get .</li>
            <li> This is the first pheromone product I&#x27;ve tried that actually works.</li>
            <li> The aroma is so pleasant and for the little that you need it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> think that my personal scent has notes of both fruity and floral, an overall sweet smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a soft light fruity smell...but not sweet at all.</li>
            <li> I must say that this is not a strong scent, but the pheromones have a strong effect on the women around me.</li>
            <li> Received large tips/bonuses several times while wearing this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I went to a \\&quot;pleasure party\\&quot; last week and the woman selling us products swore by Pure Instinct, claiming that she&#x27;s practically swatting guys away when she has it on.</li>
            <li> this is NOT a 100% pure essential oil.</li>
            <li> I went to a pure romance party where they had a pheromone perfume oil similar to this one</li>
            <li> When a friend got married, I advised her that sometimes in her married life, she would need just a little edge, and gave her a bottle.</li>
            <li> Mind you this is a UNISEX pheromones, it&#x27;s for everyone, and even better it smells a little different on each person.</li>
            <li> I like the mild smell and it can be worn with my other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have read a few reviews on pheromones that they noticed a HUGE difference when tested with their spouse.</li>
            <li> It matches me completely, -and</li>
            <li> wow.....</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be surprised of how it affects people.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO then it is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> I use real perfume for when I go out in public.</li>
            <li> and i see no change, like someone approaching me like unusual.</li>
            <li> what a save and this smells so beatiful and natural.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the old wives tail.</li>
            <li> This product is BY FAR the winner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised my husband didn&#x27;t ask what I put on bc</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of this purchase.</li>
            <li> but it has been at least a 10-15 dollar increase:)</li>
            <li> The smell made me think that it probably contains guava pheromones (guavas naturally give off pheromones).</li>
            <li> And completely beats all of my colognes, so I combine it with one</li>
            <li> but people don&#x27;t seem to notice anymore, not even if I tell them to directly smell the area I applied it.</li>
            <li> This oil was the most expensive at 10 dollars but to find something that is based off of you, it was so worth it in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am so exited to start wearing this due to my husband coming back home from a 6 month deployment next week. :)</li>
            <li> I was sitting in the auto shop the other day, minding my own business, reading a magazine while I waited for a service on my car, a guy going out, just stopped dead in his tracks, and spoke to me.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it has a mildly sweet, slightly musky, smell to it.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was on here for a lot less.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have only been able to find this product at home sales.  </li>
            <li> Maybe even made me feel sexy but not sure it actually does anything.</li>
            <li> The scent is fruity and flowery, and is strong at first but calms down after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent altogether maybe 30 dollars on those instead of buying half a bottle of one not so famous singer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product wondering if the pheromones actually were strong enough to attract other people.  </li>
            <li> Positive does not attract positive, only positive and negative do.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t notice and he didn&#x27;t act any different than normal.</li>
            <li> All it does is smell a little funky and leave super greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Normally I only use pure %100 organic oils if possible.</li>
            <li> I definitely would not recommend this for a straight male.</li>
            <li> Single women, friends, married women, local celebrity rockstars, etc.</li>
            <li> Found it the first time many years ago at an adult party, it was expensive!  </li>
            <li> I have no clue if it actually works, or if it simply boosts my self confidence when I wear it, but I like it, and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The scent is light enough for everyday wear to wear alone or with another cologne which it will enhance!  </li>
            <li> I’m pretty much average in every way; attractiveness, intelligence, wit, penis size.</li>
            <li> ( I read so far back that someone even smelt like cake )</li>
            <li> but I have only worn it for one day so far.</li>
            <li> For example, normally if I go to the grocery store I will get hit on by African American men sometimes and the Caucasian men will avoid eye contact and carry on with their chores/grocery shopping.</li>
            <li> Even in jeans and a t-shirt I&#x27;ve worn this product and gotten hit on (sometimes BLATANTLY and RELENTLESSLY) by a minimum of 4 to 5 guys  when I&#x27;m sure that normally I&#x27;d get around 2 or 3 guys or so at the maximum without wearing it.  </li>
            <li> He has no idea I purchased this potent secret sex when I want it weapon.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, however I can&#x27;t see any difference when I&#x27;m wearing this or any random perfume.</li>
            <li> While with my boyfriend, there isn&#x27;t much affect other than he loves the scent.</li>
            <li> Men that I work with have displayed intense jealousy whenever I get attention from other coworkers  </li>
            <li> It smells really fruity, like all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> No straight male wants to smell like watermelons.</li>
            <li> Around parties, and social gatherings all the time, didnt see a difference.</li>
            <li> but I do feel a secret sense of extra security for some reason wearing a product nobody would be able to pinpoint.  </li>
            <li> You can put some on a child&#x27;s pillow and it helps them calm down after a long day.</li>
            <li> did notice more men are starting random conversations with me, but I thought it was my natural charm...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not scared of polite conversation and throwing a joke or two at a complete strange during day to day life.</li>
            <li> This sickly sweet smelling product is very thin, smell fades quickly, and to add insult to injury, attracts absolutely no one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who I&#x27;d recommend this to, but if you want something that is more of a luxury than necessity and have a few extra bucks to toss into the wind, then why not?  </li>
            <li> This product is a pure sham.</li>
            <li> I have been doing lots of research on this little bottle for quite a while and without even knowing what i was really purchasing i decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> Im 54 and women as young as 20 like to converse with me although Ive never pursued anyone in a serious way; Im happily married.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s very curious to note that normally I receive male attention from men of color (African American men, Latin men etc.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed much change, but I am not pregnant, and I&#x27;m a man!  </li>
            <li> The pheromones don&#x27;t seem to have too much of an effect on African American men and only seemed to work on 2 or 3 of them over the past month.</li>
            <li> of the thousands of entries for this pure instant pheromone cologne - I&#x27;m still not sure, is this like JJ or Rush?</li>
            <li> I waited to do a review for at least a month since I first purchased.</li>
            <li> Smell goes away after like 2 hours and last for a long time</li>
            <li> but it last for a long time!</li>
            <li> Your scent will not last very long maybe 30 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> And as others have stated you can add this oil with other perfumes or body oils to make it last longer and create a different smell.</li>
            <li> The little glass wand applicator doesn&#x27;t give me enough product, so you have to dip it back in the bottle multiple times.</li>
            <li> The scent was still on my wrist for a long time ( 2 to 3 hours ).</li>
            <li> So male pheromones typically affect women and female pheromones affect</li>
            <li> Other mall employees who haven&#x27;t noticed me before are starting to come up to me for conversation.</li>
            <li> It was me and three other women of various ages ranging between 30-60</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strange, but for some reason, I like it!  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Total garbage... not a SINGLE person I know noticed it except for the occasional negative reaction.</li>
            <li> It does not live up to what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> At work I&#x27;ve been asked out by almost every single man at my job.</li>
            <li> Here are the results that I&#x27;ve seen from using this product (and please keep in mind that I&#x27;m in my late 20s and am African American female):  </li>
            <li> But, not really worth the money unless you don&#x27;t mind applying the product on several times.</li>
            <li> The smell is faint and sweet.</li>
            <li> occasionally men sometimes find an excuse to say a little something to me.</li>
            <li> Because of the fruity smell I would not say this is &#x27;Unisex\\&quot; because it is not particularly manly.</li>
            <li> but it definitely does make those around you feel more upbeat and less aggravated or aggressive if they are in a bad mood.</li>
            <li> The only reason it got 4/5 stars from me is because I feel it&#x27;s a little misleading with the pheromone/sex attractant label.    </li>
            <li> When it came in the mail it was obviously leaking a little bit, the inside of envelope was moist.</li>
            <li> Each day it tends to smell a little different</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lonely, this is not going to be your miracle cure.  </li>
            <li> As part of an ad hoc, pseudo-scientific trial, the product has shown a better-than-average active life span beyond application and subsequent subject testing.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was my timing, or it&#x27;s something about this stuff, but it&#x27;s def worth the money and worth a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed even for just using it as cologne.</li>
            <li> Some say phermones are not real.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really wearing a pheremone colgne that does it..</li>
            <li> , I wear it with my regular perfume I wear everyday or when I go out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an unattractive woman by no means, so with this fragrance I saw absolutely no difference on how males would respond to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to know why that is.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if you actually think it will do what it claims it will.  </li>
            <li> but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is very soft and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never noticed a huge difference in the smells when it&#x27;s applied to other people, but I&#x27;m not good at picking up subtle differences.</li>
            <li> On me it smells a little fruity but different than any other fragrances i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> you smell great!\\&quot; and during my only half an hour lunch break it was weird, he was being very close and touchy feely.</li>
            <li> A little bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle of trying to get refund because wasn&#x27;t very expensive and would be to much more of a mess to return.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes water and was extremely overpowering.</li>
            <li> I think it mixes well with other fragrances that I already have.</li>
            <li> at first i was skeptical about it</li>
            <li> Do not fool yourself and purchase it for any other reason.</li>
            <li> he backs away saying, \\&quot;You&#x27;re wearing that stuff again!\\&quot; because it affects him extremely.</li>
            <li> This will not attract females due to</li>
            <li> It did not have the effect that the other product I purchased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other pheromones I bought on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to pair it with other pheromones and/or perfume but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  </li>
            <li> I think the birds were chirping a little louder and the sun was a little brighter the next morning.</li>
            <li> It took 6 days and I ordered a lot of things, like 5 other items, so that could be another factor too.</li>
            <li> It took 6 days and I ordered a lot of things, like 5 other items, so that could be another factor too.</li>
            <li> Can be worn alone or with other scents.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this is not a magic potion.  </li>
            <li> But the possiblities are endless.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, didn&#x27;t notice any benefits that pheromones are supposed to provide.</li>
            <li> As a guy you will have to mask this with some other scent.</li>
            <li> When I saw this, I was very curious and had to order it.  </li>
            <li> Overall not happy, but can&#x27;t knock actual product because of inability to use.</li>
            <li> My Only Complaint is that its all gone now.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It boils down to how you interpret the stares I guess.</li>
            <li> On me it dries down to a fruity(but not too fruity) floral sort of smell that defiantly is not overbearing or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I even pair it with other perfumes!</li>
            <li> Also maaaaybe I kinda left my first bottle in the heat of my vehicle and was afraid some of the delicate oils got harmed by the heat.</li>
            <li> I can tell you it does smell at least a little different from person to person.</li>
            <li> and I can say they half ass work....</li>
            <li> I spray on my regular perfume after applying this product, because it&#x27;s so subtle.  </li>
            <li> less star bc</li>
            <li> I ended up leaving with a friend who I assume, previously, had no desire to smooch me.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a slight mood lifting effect.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will put a little on my fingertips and touch it through the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I just mix a little in my hand along with my perfume or scented lotion and put it on in all the places he loves to kiss...(smile)</li>
            <li> have shared a little with a friend.</li>
            <li> I think the scent can be driven by my mood which is why the smell differs a little bit from day to day.</li>
            <li> I put a little on each side of my neck before I leave for the day.  </li>
            <li> And you&#x27;ll also start to feel a little emasculated..</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle, it&#x27;s hard for me to get the correct amount out of it.</li>
            <li> musky, fruity, deep and sensual, wide and complicated, smokey, etc.</li>
            <li> If you turn the bottle over on your skin, its just awkward you end up getting too much out.</li>
            <li> I have try a few like this</li>
            <li> Was not a light and sensual smell.</li>
            <li> Waste of time, does not work, just scented liquid.    </li>
            <li> I tried it out, and liked the scent, but the price they were asking seemed outrageous.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Ive had this for a few years now and...</li>
            <li> ( that is if you don&#x27;t wear it everyday)</li>
            <li> This is what I felt after my witch roommate put this on me at a holiday party a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Will never order again because it does not stay on longer than few minutes...</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$$ on this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I used it everyday for a month then periodially afterwards.</li>
            <li> I would ware it everyday,</li>
            <li> mind you not huge</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it effected those around me, but it may have helped me a few times on a &amp;#34;pure instinct&amp;#34; level.</li>
            <li> Ok, product description is not classifying it as male-attractant or female-attractant.&lt;br /&gt;Being a hero-male, I&#x27;m very disappointed with the lack of results.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, a lot!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have purchased two items with different names from the same vendor.</li>
            <li> No more than usual.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the placebo effect or whatever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never able to smell any perfumes when I spray them on my neck</li>
            <li> I was so exited and as i opened the bottle and dabbed a small amount on my wrist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about it being a sex attractant with pheromones though.</li>
            <li> not sure if I will use it.  </li>
            <li> Over the past Christmas I had worked at the mall making chocolate chip cookies by Santa.  </li>
            <li> , I usually layer it under my perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle</li>
            <li> Nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just wasted [...]!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this does anything or if this is just a placebo.</li>
            <li> its small bottle</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for the &amp;#34;Pheromones&amp;#34; so I&#x27;m not sure if it works for that or not.</li>
            <li> My husband definitely does not need those anyways, SCARY...</li>
            <li> you sent instructions that all, but I noticed a small difference</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Granted, the three men looked like alcoholic tweakers, but still.  </li>
            <li> He kept coming in my room to ask me random questions just starting a conversation .</li>
            <li> well considering it&#x27;s a small glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Can apply small amount or a lot without a problem.</li>
            <li> so im not sure of the phermones</li>
            <li> Not sure if it makes women notice you anymore</li>
            <li> so you just put some on the wrists, neck, behind ears, and any other place your will sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> i have a hard time not sniffing my wrists.</li>
            <li> When I smelt the same product on another guy I stopped using it as I thought it made him seem desperate.</li>
            <li> I do like this smell, it kinda reminds me of grape flavored bubblegum, or at least that&#x27;s what I think it smells like in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I can smell it on myself for at least a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> At least not for me.</li>
            <li> Its oil based not alcohol based so its a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> And my list doesn&#x27;t even mention the other weird encounters I&#x27;ve had while wearing this pheromone.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount to my wrist , neck , and behind my ears.</li>
            <li> If you want to pick up hotties get Primal Instinct phermones or Gucci Guilty black label.</li>
            <li> Seriously, he talks to no one and ignores everyone in the office.</li>
            <li> I’m shallow.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle fruit.</li>
            <li> Cuz my fiance works hard so doesnt feel affectionate at the end of the day, just tired...</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t complained yet!</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say, I am disappointed about my purchase.</li>
            <li> But I think I&#x27;m addicted to the smell/</li>
            <li> People have told me it smells like something from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, coconut, or like I came from the beach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d secretly wear it around him sometimes to see if there was a difference...</li>
            <li> And I think I have stumbled on the secret to making women swoon...</li>
            <li> and I feel there should be some merit behind the idea of t</li>
            <li> not happy with it</li>
            <li> On me, the scent is a very subtle citrus.</li>
            <li> Either way, it is very subtle, but you do get reactions to it, when some people walk by you.</li>
            <li> This bottle may be small, but it&#x27;s lasted me 5 months!!!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on (for starters this stuff smells like expensive cologne, so it&#x27;s a plus)</li>
            <li> (I got used to expensive perfumes and cannot stand this one).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about pheromones and bought a couple of items in order to test them out (Scent of Eros, this product, Primal Instinct and Arouse Rx).</li>
            <li> And when I told my other coworkers about how he&#x27;d started a convo with me, everyone was shocked and amazed!</li>
            <li> It also has a nasty odor to it that is totally non-masculine,  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Each time I wear it, I am amazed at the response I received from random guys at the gas station, the grocery store, the mall, etc.</li>
            <li> Was nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Ill purchase for that again.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> but girls will start to shy away.</li>
            <li> I gave the product 4 stars because I&#x27;m not 100% crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> For instance, you know the crazy guy at your job that everyone is afraid of?</li>
            <li> , genie sex spell which is a bit depressing but also</li>
            <li> you were wondering, did it make him all GaGa Crazy over me?</li>
            <li> you were wondering, did it make him all GaGa Crazy over me?</li>
            <li> BUT, call me crazy, I think they DO work.  </li>
            <li> Unhappy with the product</li>
            <li> My bf went crazy when he smelled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> LOL,it&#x27;s ridiculous and it smells awful</li>
            <li> Just smells like bad candy.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked that he was talking to me</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Severe headache :-(</li>
            <li> Yes I&#x27;m desperate!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product, it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was doubtful when purchasing, I&#x27;ll admit, but when I wear it my husband can&#x27;t resist me.</li>
            <li> You make yourself feel how ever you want to feel,no need to put on crap on yourself</li>
            <li> Nothing was bad!</li>
            <li> I put it on and my boyfriends hated the smell.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Smells awful.</li>
            <li> The smell of this one is horrible to me</li>
            <li> My husband has the WORST allergies, I think this smells like candy and doesn&#x27;t bother his allergies one bit!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an insanely outgoing person</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> SMELL OF A WOMAN, PHEROMONES</li>
            <li> Women did not throw themselves at me but were friendly and I think the smell is nice to have on. Maybe better than old spice.</li>
            <li> it does smell good.....as for if it works or not .....um ya I would have to say no...I have try a few like this and I can say they half ass work....but this one ...get nothing</li>
            <li> Smelt good but don&#x27;t think the pheromone thing in it is very potent. Seen no difference with or without it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice anything. My wife doesn&#x27;t seem to be anymore attracted to me when I wear it. :-)</li>
            <li> This smells amazing....I wear it on my wrist everyday and its refreshing and I get tons of compliments from friends/family.&lt;br /&gt;It has a soft light fruity smell...but not sweet at all.</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference in men they starred and smiled more. I cute and petite, I get attention anyway. But I did find that they are more chatty. I carry it in my purse and touch it up through out the day. I get lots of comments on how good I smell. When women ask what I&#x27;m wearing I just tell them a melon oil from the health food store! LoL I don&#x27;t wanna share this stuff! I will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews i decided to try this product. I got it in the mail only 2-3 days after I placed my order so it was very fast shipping. As soon as I opened it I loooooved the smell. Very sweet and fruity, not overpowering, and you can smell an underlying scent that you cant quite put your finger on (the pheromones). I immediately thought it smelled divine and after I had my bf smell it he immediately \\&quot;rose\\&quot; to the occasion lol. The only problem I could see with this product is that it may be too sweet to layer with some perfumes unless they have a fruity or flowery sweet scent as it is.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have very nice smell, that last .... for a few minutes! I just took shower, put the perfume on my neck and wrist. Smelled so nice! 10 minutes later, after I put my rope and came in a living room to my hubby - smell was gone! Only oil on my skin with some oil-grease-like smell, not even close what was in the beginning. If my hubby would be a mechanic he maybe would like this greasy smell :). I was not using it for a seduction purpose. I just like any woman like to go in bed with nice smell around me. And it didn&#x27;t happen - I had to wash my neck and arms again, and put my old \\&quot;friend\\&quot; lotion - sweet pea - with smell that was never wrong. I am disappointed, a lot!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have purchased two items with different names from the same vendor. I have received the same item. Why then name it differently, if you sell the same product? Smell good also, but the same problem - gone so fast, I have never had a perfume with such a short \\&quot;life-time\\&quot;. That&#x27;s why I am using the same post on another product (copy-paste).</li>
            <li> not my preference others may like it though</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant scent and has a tendency to raise my mood. DD has worked as a waitress and when I gave her a bottle, she said that tips from guys went way up! So I suppose her bottle paid for itself. When a friend got married, I advised her that sometimes in her married life, she would need just a little edge, and gave her a bottle. She hasn&#x27;t complained yet!</li>
            <li> ..........if the cologne smells like watermelons.  No straight male wants to smell like watermelons. I had purchased a similar product in the same bottle and everything before but forgot who I bought it from. Loved it.  The fragrance was a clean ultra soap and pheromone explosion. Not this product.</li>
            <li> I got this product and couldnt wait to use it, within minutes my  husband could not keep his hand off me. He has no idea I purchased this potent secret sex when I want it weapon.</li>
            <li> Was not a light and sensual smell. Made my eyes water and was extremely overpowering. Smells really feminine so I don&#x27;t suggest this to anybody.</li>
            <li> If you want to know how it smells before you buy it check out fruit sensations watermelon bubblegum, smells exaclty like it. It&#x27;s a good smell and its pretty strong yet oily. You cant really tell if there&#x27;s pheromones in it (they kinda smell like a human skin or light must) but when you put it on your skin it kind of smells different, though it may just be my skin. As for gender friendly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a perfume but its too fruity for a guy to wear every day. I&#x27;d prefer a female to wear this over perfume actually, but as for me and other guys its ok to use for maybe going to a store or family friendly place where your not trying to pick up woman. I&#x27;s not a bad buy but you may be able to get something larger or more worth the 9 bucks if you can find something that smells like the bubble gum.</li>
            <li> I can see all of this as being the result of the well known placebo effect; and on the other hand the product seems designed to elicit comments owing to it&#x27;s aroma; women like more fruity scents in their perfumes so surely a man wearing something that smells, um, fruity, is more likely to get \\&quot;looks\\&quot; and \\&quot;comments\\&quot; from women. It boils down to how you interpret the stares I guess. That said, I haven&#x27;t tried this product. I did try a hair product that was said to contain phermones and it had a distinct odor. When I smelt the same product on another guy I stopped using it as I thought it made him seem desperate.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent value.  Same product as I purchased at and adult toy party, but at a much better price.  Smells the same and works the same.  Since I started wearing this product, everyone wants to hug me, both men and women.  My boss even treated me better.  I spray on my regular perfume after applying this product, because it&#x27;s so subtle.  Men and women tell me I smell good.  I feel more confident.  I will definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> Waste of time, does not work, just scented liquid.    Around parties, and social gatherings all the time, didnt see a difference.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
            <li> As part of an ad hoc, pseudo-scientific trial, the product has shown a better-than-average active life span beyond application and subsequent subject testing.  I would suggest the formulators add more of the attractive scent.    The product does embolden the male wearer to make some gestures of interest, to a noticeable degree in attempts to attract a female, but whether or not that has had a complementary effect on a targeted female is somewhat uncertain.</li>
            <li> I tried the product and I don&#x27;t think it works. It just gives you the feeling that it smells like pheromones but doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Love how fast it arrived!&lt;br /&gt;.... But I think I&#x27;m addicted to the smell/: lol</li>
            <li> What I LOVE about this is that initially this oil based perfume/pheromone has a sweet smell (I don&#x27;t like THAT smell. Smells like sweet grapes, maybe?) but as it blends with your own personal chemistry, it changes to YOUR smell and the initial sweet smell of the product is gone. I LOVE THAT! So each person has their own smell- musky, fruity, deep and sensual, wide and complicated, smokey, etc. I like to say that that&#x27;s what I really truly smell like, the smell I have when I use this product on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4 stars because your smell fades so quickly. BUMMER! I wish I could bottle up MY smell, as it develops from this product, and spray that on me all the time!! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product works best when applied in areas where you might sweat more, because your sweat aka your natural pheromones, mix with this product to produce more of your natural smell--- or something like that. Simply put, if you sweat in the same area where you applied this, you can smell YOU more. ;) So areas like the back of your neck, the crease in your elbow, and maybe for those who have boob cleavage (and who sweat in there?), THERE! lol! That would work best for the sexual enhancement this is, as well as a perfect place to draw men towards. hahahaha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, about the pheromones themselves-- no clue if it works more or not for my sexual appeal. I am not a shy person and I know I&#x27;m an attractive and alluring human being, so whether or not the pheromones are working, I would not know (nor does it make a difference to me personally). I would test this on my husband though when he gets here bc that would be interesting to see... but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to yet. I have read a few reviews on pheromones that they noticed a HUGE difference when tested with their spouse. That seems fun.... !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, great product. One less star bc MY natural smell which I LOVE, didn&#x27;t last long. &#x3D;/ doh.&lt;br /&gt;BUT I will purchase again! LOVE!</li>
            <li> Smells awful. Combination of lycoric candy and cheap musk cologne. If you want to pick up hotties get Primal Instinct phermones or Gucci Guilty black label.</li>
            <li> I give this product 2 stars because it smells good, it&#x27;s really very pleasant but fades fairly quickly.  If I&#x27;m wearing it just as a fragrance it&#x27;s ok.  But I purchased this as a pheromone product hoping to see results.  I&#x27;ve worn this for 5 days, 3 days around someone who I know likes me.  He didn&#x27;t show any more attention than usual.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any special attention or friendly behavior from any people that I&#x27;ve been around. No more than usual.  I can&#x27;t recommend this to attract people or make people more pleasant/friendly around you.</li>
            <li> This smells great. It&#x27;s like a spicy but sweet and rich grape/fruity scent. It&#x27;s more of an oil than a perfume. I think it mixes well with other fragrances that I already have. When I first tried it, I instantly felt confident and sexier. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the placebo effect or whatever but I&#x27;m not complaining . I notice other people seem to notice me more and respond positively. I like it</li>
            <li> I really like this. On me, the scent is a very subtle citrus. Some days the scent is flowery. Either way, it is very subtle, but you do get reactions to it, when some people walk by you. The pheromones seem to affect some people more than others. Since I have been using this, I have had total strangers, both men and women,start a conversation with me, that will sometimes last over 10 minutes. I was sitting in the auto shop the other day, minding my own business, reading a magazine while I waited for a service on my car, a guy going out, just stopped dead in his tracks, and spoke to me.&lt;br /&gt; So, from the various reactions I have gotten, I would have to say this stuff really works--it also seems to make you feel better and more relaxed as well. I will definitely order it again, when my current bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay.. several months later and I liked this so much that I have ordered a second bottle of it. It is fantastic. The seller I ordered from is exceptional.If they state it will arrive on a specific day..you can count on it arriving then. An excellent product from a seller that is focused on customer satisfaction!!!</li>
            <li> iam happy i made this purchase. at first i was skeptical about it but i thought oh what the heck and bought it. i just received it today(which was very fast&#x3D;]) and thought maybe i wouldn&#x27;t like the smell but when i put it on it actually smelt pretty good. it kind of has a bubble gummy fruity smell. its not bad at all. i am happy with my purchase and would buy from the seller again. thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance! I am in a sales job and decided to try this to boost sales...let&#x27;s just say it worked! Received large tips/bonuses several times while wearing this fragrance. Might be a coincidence but I received many compliments while wearing this. My boyfriend wore it and it had the same effect. Women told him he smelled good and asked what fragrance he was wearing.</li>
            <li> Prior my buy I read all the reviews and i though people over rated this product but after i used for about a week let me tell u this IS AMAZING, the self confidence, how people is so much nicer to you!!, im totally over pleased with this product and for sure will buy more!</li>
            <li> I do like this smell, it kinda reminds me of grape flavored bubblegum, or at least that&#x27;s what I think it smells like in my opinion.  when I wore this(with some Inner Realm) I did get some friendly hellos and glances from some of the guys I talk too, even the quiet ones were more open and friendly with me. this will not make all the guys want you, but you will get some friendly treatment here and there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attracted a lot of men with this, no husband yet</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t buy it at a Passion Party where it cost $22!    It smells great. It doesn&#x27;t attract people like I thought it would (it&#x27;s not like Love Potion #9 lol) but people always ask what I&#x27;m wearing. To me, it can smell like a variety of things, since it smells different on everyone, like cotton candy, fruit punch, or a musky scent. People have told me it smells like something from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, coconut, or like I came from the beach. I tried it on my boyfriend and it had more of a musky scent than when it was on me.    It doesn&#x27;t last very long, at most 2 or 3 hours. I&#x27;m never able to smell any perfumes when I spray them on my neck but if I sweat, the fragrance smells stronger and I&#x27;m able to smell this one.</li>
            <li> I originally found this product at a party. I loved the way it smelled but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $22 for it. Luckily it was on here for a lot less. This version has a fruitier smell than the other one, but I love it. I don&#x27;t really think it actually attracts the opposite sex, but it does make for good perfume.</li>
            <li> For starters, if you are a guy looking for a magic get laid quick potion this is not it. But this is a great smelling attention attractant, because i have noticed a major change in how women approach me. I must say that this is not a strong scent, but the pheromones have a strong effect on the women around me. I work retail and i have notice a increase in my sales when i comes to the female customers. So i will say this definitely works and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This honestly does smell really amazing on my skin! In my opinion, it has a mildly sweet, slightly musky, smell to it. It matches me completely, -and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE GREAT BARGAIN!!!!! It definitely would not hurt to give this a try! I am on my way to ordering two more bottles.&lt;br /&gt; :-)</li>
            <li> I have been doing lots of research on this little bottle for quite a while and without even knowing what i was really purchasing i decided to buy it. I have been patient to get this in the mail and it only took 3 days to get delivered. I was so exited and as i opened the bottle and dabbed a small amount on my wrist I became so in love with it. It smells like fruity and sweet but yet soft... its just an irresistible smell. I will definitely buy this product over and over again. I am so exited to start wearing this due to my husband coming back home from a 6 month deployment next week. :)</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and as promised.  No problems and wrapped well.  Product doesn&#x27;t work though.  I have worn it several days without any changes in attraction</li>
            <li> I ordered this because the reviews were good and the price was more than reasonable. The first bottle I had lasted me for well over 4 months. I ended up ordering a new bottle just because I love the smell so much. I&#x27;m not sure about it being a sex attractant with pheromones though. I will wear it out clubbing and some nights I have guys all over me and some nights I don&#x27;t. However, I&#x27;ll keep buying it because it smells great and I always get a lot of compliments when wearing it. The only reason it got 4/5 stars from me is because I feel it&#x27;s a little misleading with the pheromone/sex attractant label.    As for the seller, they&#x27;re quick with shipping, I&#x27;ve had no complaints, and they sell this bottle cheaper than anywhere else I&#x27;ve searched. No problems makes me a happy shopper and will continue to buy from DSC.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. I was doubtful when purchasing, I&#x27;ll admit, but when I wear it my husband can&#x27;t resist me. People in general are more likely to warm up and talk to me. I have become more confident while wearing this product, which helps too. The scent is fruity and flowery, and is strong at first but calms down after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It smells very feminine, but claims to be unisex.</li>
            <li> This really works! It was amazing to find that people were much more calm and trusting when they were in close proximity to the smell and scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good, but that&#x27;s the only reason you should buy it.  If you&#x27;re lonely, this is not going to be your miracle cure.  Only purchase this for the smell.  Do not fool yourself and purchase it for any other reason.</li>
            <li> put it on several times and she didnt react to it.trying again to see if the third times the charm.&lt;br /&gt;smells nice and discreet.not strong...</li>
            <li> smells good and i swear people are more attracted and nicer when i wear it. i would recommend.</li>
            <li> i love wearing this stuff. i live with someone who has bad allergies to perfume so this works perfectly. and guys are always telling me how good i smell. ill probably order more once im out.</li>
            <li> Smells kinda fruity... not sure if I will use it.  AD makes better scents of pheromones</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at Ambiance. Double the cost if I remember.  So to find it for less than $8 a bottle was great.  I loved it right away.  They say it can smell floral or like vanilla. On me, it was vanilla.  Sweet!  I love how it smelled on me from the beginning.  Something in it works, that&#x27;s for sure.  I thought at first it must be coincidence but I had several compliments while wearing it.  I also will sometimes layer it with a light perfume or a perfumy type lotion like creamy coconut that I had from a store at the mall.  Don&#x27;t use something too strong, just something light and pretty, seems to compliment the oil great.  Play around with it until you find a good layer or wear alone.  Sometimes I will put a little on my fingertips and touch it through the ends of my hair. I went out with my friend for dinner once and had it layered with the creamy coconut lotion, she said I smelled so good that if she was a man she would be all over me.  LOL  I guess husbands work differently.  Over the past Christmas I had worked at the mall making chocolate chip cookies by Santa.  I had this oil on.  Let me tell you, between the smell of the oil and the smell of chocolate chip cookies on my skin, I had to beat the men off.  They were all coming up saying how incredible I smelled. Even the woman I worked with said she&#x27;s never seen anything like that.  Even makes you feel sexier wearing it.  I found a magic potion. :)  In the end, I bought some more from this site for my sister, friends and, of course, myself.  Hopefully they find as much fun wearing it as I did.  P.S.  Make some chocolate chip cookies while wearing the oil and just an apron (and only an apron) for your favorite man.  You won&#x27;t be sorry. ;)</li>
            <li> I never wear perfume but I decided to try this and I liked the light fresh scent.  Haven&#x27;t noticed men falling all over me but I like it anyway.</li>
            <li> I like wearing it alone when I go out because its so light and unassuming. It makes me feel sexy and attractive without being overpowering!</li>
            <li> I never thought it will be so effective i use it on  and wow.....</li>
            <li> I have to say that this stuff definitely works.  I think I&#x27;m a good looking guy but I&#x27;ve always been shy and haven&#x27;t been able to go up to girls with confidence.  I put this stuff on (for starters this stuff smells like expensive cologne, so it&#x27;s a plus) and I hung out with a girl that I thought for sure I would never have a chance with.  As soon as I got a hug from her, she said I smelled amazing and her attitude changed towards me, and it&#x27;s the best night I&#x27;ve EVER had.  Not sure if it was my timing, or it&#x27;s something about this stuff, but it&#x27;s def worth the money and worth a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed even for just using it as cologne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 years now and have nothing but good things to say about it! I can see the difference in how people approach me and how kind they get. I work in a salon and always worked for tips and let me tell you- wear this stuff for a month and see the huge difference it makes!! And it smells good but the odor isnt strong or obvious, I usually layer it under my perfume.</li>
            <li> I found that when I started to wear this product, guys around me started to look more, some guys in my college classes were talking to me more, wanting to talk to me. At work everyone seemed more friendly when i wore it, especially those working near me. I found that some men react more to it than others. one of my friends, when he goes to give me a hug and he smells it he backs away saying, \\&quot;You&#x27;re wearing that stuff again!\\&quot; because it affects him extremely. While with my boyfriend, there isn&#x27;t much affect other than he loves the scent. If it&#x27;s goal is to get guys to be more sexual, or passionate, I can&#x27;t see it making a difference in him. :P    Overall, GREAT product. It&#x27;s a small bottle but it last for a long time! I got it almost a month ago and haven&#x27;t even used a quarter of it yet.</li>
            <li> This bottle may be small, but it&#x27;s lasted me 5 months!!! I Didnt use it daily tho, but still, it lasts! It Smells Great! I Got Complements On It&#x27;s Scent All The Time. And I NEVER Told My Fiance I Bought It... I&#x27;d secretly wear it around him sometimes to see if there was a difference... Cuz my fiance works hard so doesnt feel affectionate at the end of the day, just tired... And OH MY, YES THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE!!! He became very affectionate with me on the nights I had this on. And the Nights I Did NOT wear it, he wasnt interested in doing anything except getting sleep! So for over 5 months of it being like that I know it works! And I did notice a one day when I was wearing it that I seemed more happy &amp; confident when I had it on! So yea, Worth the buy! My Only Complaint is that its all gone now. lol. But imma buy more right now for sure &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume. The smell is fabulous and fruity, I just wish it lasted longer! I carry it around with me so that I can reapply it through out the day because it dissipates quickly. I probably have to reapply 3-4x a day to keep the smell going. If it lasted longer I would give it 5 stars but whatever, it smells amazing and makes me feel sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say if this is a sex-attract perfume because in all honesty I am a lesbian and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a difference in my sex life if I wear it and I don&#x27;t get hit on by males any more than usual so...yeah. Because of the fruity smell I would not say this is &#x27;Unisex\\&quot; because it is not particularly manly. But hey, if you guys out there love to smell sweet and delicious by all means buy it! I love it!</li>
            <li> Smells good but I don&#x27;t know about the attractant claim lol I didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> pure relaxation in a bottle wish I had some now...lol..this stuf relaxes you fast no matter how stressed out you are anybody can use this after work and just tryn to unwind!!!!</li>
            <li> I tested it on my hubs to see if it worked and nope. Nothing out of the ordinary. It smells like fruits and pretty but wears off too fast. Within the hour for me. I gave it a 1 star because the intended use didn&#x27;t work and it disappears too fast on the skin.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fruity scent, but as far as attracting the opposite sex...well it doesn&#x27;t lol, just nice perfume is all</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I was really excited to it for such a reasonable price!!  I wear this almost every day, sometimes with perfume and sometimes on its own.  You&#x27;d be surprised of how it affects people. I&#x27;ll walk by people and they&#x27;ll say \\&quot;What smells so good?\\&quot;  It&#x27;s ME!!  And they don&#x27;t even know it because it&#x27;s not a perfume... it&#x27;s all in the pheromones!!  A great add is that it has a calming effect on children.  My daughter can smell it from a mile away so she loves the scent.  You can put some on a child&#x27;s pillow and it helps them calm down after a long day.</li>
            <li> Smells good. It smells very sweet. Good price. I have seen this product in stores go for a lot more.</li>
            <li> I had bought this product before from a different seller and was charged 4 times the cost. But even then, it was worth it. The smell is wonderful, and I love the way I feel when I am wearing it. I haven&#x27;t noticed any different behavior from the men around me, or anyone for that matter. But I feel good when I am wearing it. Besides the intoxicating smell, the price here cannot be beat. And the seller, Mommy&#x27;s Closet, shipped very promptly and their communication was great. I just bought this product again, only I bought the 2 pack. I know I will be buying this again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is a pure sham. I&#x27;m a straight guy and this stuff smells like straight up women&#x27;s perfume. There is no way the stuff that attracts men will attract women. Positive does not attract positive, only positive and negative do.The company claims that it is uni-sex, but I was smarter than that and I got my answer from pherone science:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones are sexually dimorphic, which means that they effect each sex differently. So male pheromones typically affect women and female pheromones affect men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference, then, is that they are entirely different chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO then it is completely ineffective. If you are a male wanting to attract a female this is not for you. I&#x27;ve just wasted [...]! This will not attract females due to it being uni-sex, and smelling like a chick perfume. I&#x27;ve got to say though it could work for the ladies. Till then its just gross that they even label it for the both sexes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking to attract one sex. Not both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t work well, i tried one at a pleasure party and this one looks like it but its not the real thing.i would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Ordering this product was very easy to order. Received product in allotted time. The fragrance was lite, airy and very sensual. Very impressed.  I will definitely order this fragrance again.</li>
            <li> I dont really think it makes a difference in &#x27;attraction&#x27; towards you but it definitely does make those around you feel more upbeat and less aggravated or aggressive if they are in a bad mood.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy wearing this. I work in a hospital where you aren&#x27;t really supposed to wear perfumes, but this is light enough to pass and be okay. You really only smell it if you get up close.  I think it smells different on everyone. On me it smells a little fruity but different than any other fragrances i&#x27;ve tried. My only complaint is the bottle, it&#x27;s hard for me to get the correct amount out of it. The little glass wand applicator doesn&#x27;t give me enough product, so you have to dip it back in the bottle multiple times. If you turn the bottle over on your skin, its just awkward you end up getting too much out. I&#x27;ve really like this in a nice roller ball.</li>
            <li> I went to a \\&quot;pleasure party\\&quot; last week and the woman selling us products swore by Pure Instinct, claiming that she&#x27;s practically swatting guys away when she has it on. I tried it out, and liked the scent, but the price they were asking seemed outrageous. When I got home I checked Amazon and found the exact same product, same brand, bottle and everything, for a quarter of the price and free shipping, so I decided it was worth the gamble.  I ordered it last Wednesday, the estimated delivery was a week, but I got it in two days. It smells great, I got compliments all last night and it arrived so quickly!  I have no clue if it actually works, or if it simply boosts my self confidence when I wear it, but I like it, and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t magical or anything, but it&#x27;s got a nice smell, and isn&#x27;t that expensive. I think people are friendlier to me when I have it on, which could either be a placebo effect or possibly that it smells good. Either way, I&#x27;m not complaining. I would recommend this more for a female though than a male. It has kind of a fruity scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews. Save your money, do not buy this. It smells nice, but it does not work.</li>
            <li> Total garbage... not a SINGLE person I know noticed it except for the occasional negative reaction. Four more words required.</li>
            <li> Some say phermones are not real. I say if you dont want him connected to you at the hip then dont put this on with your favorite smell good perfume. I just mix a little in my hand along with my perfume or scented lotion and put it on in all the places he loves to kiss...(smile) Now there will be two of you very happy!</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this in the bottle, I LOVED it! But after a while of wearing it, as the floral, sweet notes wore off, it got a musty smell that kind of &#x27;catch&#x27; in the back of my throat when I would get a whiff of it. It did not have the effect that the other product I purchased.</li>
            <li> I put it on and my boyfriends hated the smell. It&#x27;s oily and smells like a hair product I&#x27;ve used before. No effect.</li>
            <li> I know some commented on the possiblilty of a feminine tone in this cologne. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;  And I think I have stumbled on the secret to making women swoon...It&#x27;s not really wearing a pheremone colgne that does it..its just wearing ANY cologne! Women are impresssed with the simple fact that the guy care about how he smells....the guy they are out with doesn&#x27;t smell like a sweat factory!  pheremones or not!&lt;br /&gt;  I personally prefer the lighter fragrance of THIS cologne and another one called YES!. And that is why I am a repeat customer.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is to shop by fragrance that you like and not worry about whether it has the pheremone additive or not.&lt;br /&gt;  If you need more confidence, by all means try the pheremones.</li>
            <li> It seems to get noticed but has no real lasting affect.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect so I guess it is someone useful.</li>
            <li> I like this product, the smell of flowers is great. Now it doesn&#x27;t work as pheromones or whatever they are promoting the product, the smell is really nice and thats the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I actually use this in a lotion and love how it smells alone.  It has a very light scent. I love it!</li>
            <li> It smells good but it Doesn&#x27;t work what so ever ! Don&#x27;t waste your money. There are other products that are much better</li>
            <li> Not sure if this does anything or if this is just a placebo. It seems to elevate my mood and has a pleasant smell that fades soon and doesn&#x27;t conflict with anything else you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a few reviews of how it used pheromones to lure people to the wearer, thinking I could use it at my job (which is mostly a hustling gig). The smell itself isn&#x27;t bad, and it does change overtime when it interacts with your body, but there&#x27;s nothing magical in this that makes people more attractive or desirable to the opposite sex. The &amp;#34;success&amp;#34; of others is probably just new found confidence, which is attractive to everybody.</li>
            <li> I luv this stuff, I wear it with my regular perfume I wear everyday or when I go out. It makes your perfume more personal and no one smells the same with it on. Great staetment, and always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Smells like mix fruit. I smell like a baby .. lol .. not for adults at all .. good for teenage girls.</li>
            <li> Ive had this for a few years now and...all my bitches love me, all my, all my bitches love, lol</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a very long time. It really does work. I love this stuff! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My Wife like the Fruity smell but it doesn&#x27;t work like a magnet to metal, rather once she is there, it is a booster.</li>
            <li> It was not in the bottle it was a roll on thing and not what I thought it would be at all when I got it</li>
            <li> guys. men need to smell like men, not flowers. the ladies in my life inform me that such a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; scent should not be coming from a man. Meanwhile I&#x27;m catching some of my guy buddies paying a little bit more attention to me than normal, most of them don&#x27;t even notice they are doing it.</li>
            <li> its small bottle but i tell you smells really good i love it!! get it you will too smells great</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was interested in the topic sinces somebody had mentioned it ,I was like okay let me google it and this came up...You make yourself feel how ever you want to feel,no need to put on crap on yourself LOL,it&#x27;s ridiculous and it smells awful,ew I threw it out in a couple of days after I bought it thinking&amp;#34; aw okay lets see if the smell gets better or something&amp;#34;.. A WASTE OF MONEY,</li>
            <li> Good smell, good effects. I love the smell very much. It&#x27;s good for becoming composed. And it&#x27;s packed pretty well!</li>
            <li> When it came in the mail it was obviously leaking a little bit, the inside of envelope was moist. I tried it once, seems to have nice light scent, but even with cap on tight it leaked all over my purse and I had to throw it out. What a mess! Can&#x27;t say that I would recommend this to anyone unless they change the packaging and the way that this is shipped. Not worth the hassle of trying to get refund because wasn&#x27;t very expensive and would be to much more of a mess to return. Hopefully I can find another product that is similar that is given more care in packaging. Overall not happy, but can&#x27;t knock actual product because of inability to use.</li>
            <li> This sickly sweet smelling product is very thin, smell fades quickly, and to add insult to injury, attracts absolutely no one.</li>
            <li> A little bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Have yet to find a man that can resist the sweet smell of this. One of my all time favorites.</li>
            <li> Buen Producto.  Good Product.</li>
            <li> Smells like grape candy. Don&#x27;t know if it works, but may have potential for a placebo effect. A fun option to have as a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Normally I only use pure %100 organic oils if possible. So not to confuse anyone this is NOT a 100% pure essential oil. But I must say I love it. I use it for myself daily if I&#x27;m just staying at home. I use real perfume for when I go out in public. The aroma is so pleasant and for the little that you need it will last a long time. It comes with a glass tube insert so your fingers never touch the fragrance. So convenient! This has a flowery odor that is not over powering. I can smell it on myself for at least a couple of hours. I definitely would not recommend this for a straight male. For a woman that likes to smell feminine, I definitely recommend it to smell nice for yourself/partner. I didn&#x27;t buy this for the &amp;#34;Pheromones&amp;#34; so I&#x27;m not sure if it works for that or not. My husband definitely does not need those anyways, SCARY... lol</li>
            <li> it smells way too fruity for me.  even putting a tiny bit of it stills smells too strong for me</li>
            <li> I like the scent, work well with me.&lt;br /&gt;Wish you sent instructions that all, but I noticed a small difference</li>
            <li> I must be doing something wrong but its not a science the places where you wear this oil, and the fact you can use it alone, with your favorite  perfume or in a bath. But i did my research and i follow all the instructions... people are the same nice to me and i see no change, like someone approaching me like unusual. Not sure.</li>
            <li> Mind you this is a UNISEX pheromones, it&#x27;s for everyone, and even better it smells a little different on each person. My friend at work brought some in for me to try and my boyfriend came in on my lunch break and the first thing he said was \\&quot; you smell great!\\&quot; and during my only half an hour lunch break it was weird, he was being very close and touchy feely. So I had to go out and buy a bottle RIGHT AWAY, because he said later that it smelt so good on me, so we&#x27;ll have to see what happens :)    ( and, it does smell great!)</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product and has a very gentle,light scent that does not aggravate any asthma or allergies in me or others.  I keep it in stock at home and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> it gives me headache. Severe headache :-(</li>
            <li> cant keep the women off me .im not even wealthy or drive a fast car</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work at all. Kinda disappointing to be honest. Wish it did work but it doesn&#x27;t so .-P</li>
            <li> I love Pure Instinct!  I had ordered this before from another company and they charged twice as much!  The scent is light enough for everyday wear to wear alone or with another cologne which it will enhance!  This scent is one of my favorite all time scents to wear daily!</li>
            <li> product was delivered fast and saved myself money also like the way it enhances the smell of my perfume or it can also be worn alone either way its good</li>
            <li> This really works. As a woman it sparks my arousal.</li>
            <li> I never used pheromones before, this is why I decided to try. The smell of this one is horrible to me (I got used to expensive perfumes and cannot stand this one).  Really, I did not notice any difference so far. Overall, I would say, I am disappointed about my purchase. The good things I did not waste too much money on this.</li>
            <li> I work a retail sales job in a mall, where I interact with people on a regular basis. I do notice a difference when wearing Pure Instinct! Customers are more open, friendly, and less defensive towards me. Other mall employees who haven&#x27;t noticed me before are starting to come up to me for conversation. I&#x27;m noticing more stares from men and getting hit on ALOT more than usual. I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with \\&quot;uplifting confidence and mood\\&quot; because it did not do anything for me in that area. It just brought more attention than usual, which is awesome. I gave the product 4 stars because I&#x27;m not 100% crazy about the scent. It&#x27;s really fruity and I&#x27;m more into sophisticated or musky scents. I&#x27;ll just wear my favorite perfume over it. Great stuff! Reasonably priced and effective!</li>
            <li> To test out the legitimacy of this product, I never told my boyfriend when I was wearing it. Whenever I had it on, he couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off of me. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it, but to my surprise, this product works. I have no doubts about it. The trick is that it doesn&#x27;t actually go into affect until 15 or 20 minutes after you put it on, when the noticeable smell of the product (A yummy, sort of grape-y scent) fades. I guess that&#x27;s when the hormones fully mix with your normal scent or something? However it works, I&#x27;m buying this after it runs out- it&#x27;s effects are too much fun to discontinue.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, however I can&#x27;t see any difference when I&#x27;m wearing this or any random perfume. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> All it does is smell a little funky and leave super greasy residue. No sign of hormonal attraction. Not recommended!</li>
            <li> I love it, will be reordering.</li>
            <li> i bought this before from a pleasure party for more than $20. what a save and this smells so beatiful and natural. i have a hard time not sniffing my wrists. and my cat loves it too and he hates all my perfumes.</li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t appeal to me at all.  It smells like watermelon.  But, it was cheap and I&#x27;m smart enough to know that there is no &#x27;magical potion&#x27; to attract anyone but because it was so cheap, and because the idea that people actually sell this stuff with such grand claims is hilarious to me, I had to try it.  Last night I wore it out to listen to a band play (the smell fades within 15 minutes).  It was me and three other women of various ages ranging between 30-60 (I&#x27;m 35).  The four of us were standing in a line listening to the band.  Three men throughout the night approached the friend on my right, skipped me, and moved on to the 2 friends on my left to ask them to dance and, not to sound conceited, but I&#x27;ve been told (by people other than my mother) that I&#x27;m a beautiful girl.  Granted, the three men looked like alcoholic tweakers, but still.  Ironic.  So maybe this stuff repels men that you wouldn&#x27;t consider anyways?  That sounds about as logical a concept as an attractant potion so why not?  That&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m stickin&#x27; to it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, complimented all the time on how wonderful I smell!</li>
            <li> Works Well under most Colognes. I have used this for years because it  works</li>
            <li> Remember using this and the Pure Romance kind in college. Similar smell, gives you a calming, happy feeling when inhaled. Also a very sensual aroma! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t count on it. I&#x27;m not an unattractive woman by no means, so with this fragrance I saw absolutely no difference on how males would respond to me, even my husband didn&#x27;t even notice I was wearing something different.</li>
            <li> If you have ever been to a Pure Romance party you have tried the &amp;#34;Basic Instinct&amp;#34; it is exactly the same thing. It even smells the same. The PR version runs around 20 bucks a bottle. I honestly think this product is better. It seems to be more potent, and you get a lot more of it. Do not base your review on what it smells like out of the bottle. It does smell good out of the bottle, but the thing about pheromone colognes is that your body chemistry changes it, so the trick is, get a girlfriend, both put it on, wait around 10 minutes and smell each others wrists. It will smell different on everyone. It may even smell different on you day to day. I would have to say this is more of a product for a women, unless you were going to wear it under another cologne as a man. I have also heard that if your scent smells like playdough you might be pregnant. That&#x27;s the old wives tail.</li>
            <li> I like this oil. It smells nice and changes it smell based on the person it is on. Works too!</li>
            <li> Well, I used this stuff to make my husband more aware and, I suppose you could say, turned on without me doing anything. I smothered myself in it twice. He didn&#x27;t notice and he didn&#x27;t act any different than normal. It was like I never put it on. it smells REALLY good, however. I just wish it worked.</li>
            <li> Eeee dnt look nothing special</li>
            <li> smells great, slightly more feminine than a true non gender specific. got it for my girlfriend and we both like it a lot. noticeable stimulating effect.</li>
            <li> Ok, product description is not classifying it as male-attractant or female-attractant.&lt;br /&gt;Being a hero-male, I&#x27;m very disappointed with the lack of results. Had better luck with other Pheromones.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice more men are starting random conversations with me, but I thought it was my natural charm... now i see female reviewers are having good results, I&#x27;m starting to think it&#x27;s the pheromone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other pheromones I bought on Amazon, this one did not try to offer free sample-for-review.  So maybe this one has no fake reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $10, I&#x27;ll just keep it around, in case I wakeup gay one day...</li>
            <li> The smell of this cologne is one very different from regular perfume. It is not alcoholy or overwhelming but pleasant and sweet and fruity. When I put it on I instantly begin giggling or laughing because it has an uplifting effect on me. It actually smells like a person so to say and it blends with your smell. About the pheromone and attraction thing im not 100% sure on this because I have only used it at university but I did notice some reactions around me and people looking at me weird, but I can&#x27;t tell for sure that this is just the perfume as I dress up with dresses and skirts and with makeup, still I believe something does happens. You rub it in your warmer places and pressure points for better results. Smell goes away after like 2 hours and last for a long time ( that is if you don&#x27;t wear it everyday) If you want to smell amazing and personal then this is for you, but if you just want to attract mates try a stronger scent. Overall im loving the experience, but it depends on the culture you are living too, united states is very antisocial they dont look at you in the face and just don&#x27;t care, you gotta go where people are friendly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about pheromones and bought a couple of items in order to test them out (Scent of Eros, this product, Primal Instinct and Arouse Rx). This is the only product that actually works with my body chemistry. Over the last couple of weeks I&#x27;ve tracked the dosage amounts and which cover scents I&#x27;ve used and what hits I&#x27;ve gotten (men that seem to be affected by the pheromone) and when. This product is BY FAR the winner. It seems to work well just by itself. I&#x27;ve tried to pair it with other pheromones and/or perfume but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  Here are the results that I&#x27;ve seen from using this product (and please keep in mind that I&#x27;m in my late 20s and am African American female):  Men whistle and stare  Men look me more in the eye and encourage conversation and do flirty touching  Men that I&#x27;ve just met want to hug me multiple times (and inhale the scent from my neck and collarbone very obviously and intensely)  Very obvious flirting and touching  Once I went to a party and got FOUR dates lined up for the next week (and I was wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans and there were many other HOT girls there but most of the guys huddled around me)  At work I&#x27;ve been asked out by almost every single man at my job. Normally they just flirt and we talk...now all of a sudden after I wear this pheromone they actually started to ask me out on dates.  Men that I work with have displayed intense jealousy whenever I get attention from other coworkers  Male coworkers have called me and confessed deep attraction to me over the phone/and in person  When I go out to a club I have at least TEN to TWELVE very attractive guys try to arrange dates or give me their numbers. Normally I have about THREE guys approach me when I go out to the club.  After the club incident my female roommates acknowledged that my pheromones really seem to work and started to ask to try some themselves!  And my list doesn&#x27;t even mention the other weird encounters I&#x27;ve had while wearing this pheromone. For instance, you know the crazy guy at your job that everyone is afraid of? Well, the one at my work (and keep in mind in the three years that we&#x27;ve worked together he&#x27;s only looked at me a handful of times and spoken to me voluntarily twice) actually started a conversation with me, asked my opinion about a work matter and told a joke! I was so shocked that he was talking to me I almost dropped my coffee mug! And when I told my other coworkers about how he&#x27;d started a convo with me, everyone was shocked and amazed! Seriously, he talks to no one and ignores everyone in the office. This happened the first day I wore the pheromone a couple of weeks ago. After that incident I decided to try to experiment more with just this pheromone and was happily surprised by the outcome!  I think it&#x27;s very curious to note that normally I receive male attention from men of color (African American men, Latin men etc.) but this pheromone seemed to attract more Caucasian/European men and Latin men. For example, normally if I go to the grocery store I will get hit on by African American men sometimes and the Caucasian men will avoid eye contact and carry on with their chores/grocery shopping. I&#x27;ve noticed that when I wear this pheromone they give me more eye contact, flirt more and ask me out at a much higher rate than normal. The pheromones don&#x27;t seem to have too much of an effect on African American men and only seemed to work on 2 or 3 of them over the past month. Very interesting....I&#x27;m curious to know why that is.  Also--please note that I&#x27;ve tried this product in many different social situations (at work, the club, coffee shops, in class, at the beach, restaurants etc.) and with different outfits (dresses, jeans and t-shirts etc) and with and without makeup-and the results are all the same. Even in jeans and a t-shirt I&#x27;ve worn this product and gotten hit on (sometimes BLATANTLY and RELENTLESSLY) by a minimum of 4 to 5 guys  when I&#x27;m sure that normally I&#x27;d get around 2 or 3 guys or so at the maximum without wearing it.  Even just constantly having the men want to hug me and inhaling the scent and then telling me how good I smell and then asking me out is enough proof for me that it works!  In fact I&#x27;m about to order another bottle because mine is running low already. This product has made me and my friends a believer in pheromones...I wouldn&#x27;t even believe it if I hadn&#x27;t experienced it myself for a month.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if you actually think it will do what it claims it will.  This is nothing more than snakeoil, but as long as you know that going into it, it can be a fun gag gift.  Or just fun to ponder the role of instinct.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything for the women I come into contact with, anywhere.  It also has a nasty odor to it that is totally non-masculine,  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I found my favorite avon perfume faraway on amazon. It seems to attract men and women when i wear it. Just ordered 2 bottles on amazon for a few cents more than i paid for this. Men just want to eat u up. That&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve been told. I read it worked for most of the ppl that bought it. Just not for me. I&#x27;ll use it in my oil warmer mixed with my fav perfume. Different strokes for different folks. Try it for urself. Fast delivery 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product has me loving to touch myself.  Works great.  Very fruity smell and scent it to die for.  Love it</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this! I wouldn&#x27;t say it really works as a pheromone... but it has a very fresh fruity smell like a gummy bear or something. It smells feminine, sexy, and fruity. Plus for the price it beats buying it at any &amp;#34;specialty&amp;#34; shops.</li>
            <li> Confidence, power, desire. This is what I felt after my witch roommate put this on me at a holiday party a few days ago. I can’t be certain, but I think this magic, witch, alternate universe, spell, sex oil actually made me more physically attractive, intelligent and humorous.  I’m pretty much average in every way; attractiveness, intelligence, wit, penis size. But, this oil literally made all of these better, quicker, bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I felt was great, but did this product work? In short; yes. Women at this holiday party who had never looked twice at me seemed to be flocking my way. Single women, friends, married women, local celebrity rockstars, etc. At certain points it was overwhelming. This was a Love Potion #9 situation IRL. I ended up leaving with a friend who I assume, previously, had no desire to smooch me. Thank you, sex oil. I stayed at her house and we smooched until the wee hours of the morning.  Thank you, sex oil. I think the birds were chirping a little louder and the sun was a little brighter the next morning. Also, I tried to drive a tractor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give a perfect rating but I am worried the new horde of ladies soon to be in my life will only love me because they’re under a witchy, genie sex spell which is a bit depressing but also, I don’t care. I’m shallow.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and like it really well!</li>
            <li> It smells fruity.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells, but it does not last at all. It has not done any wonders either. Will never order again because it does not stay on longer than few minutes... bummer, because I really like the smell. If anyone knows another scent oil/perfume like this please let me know.</li>
            <li> This is definitely for females. It has a very fruity smell which is ok for a chick but not for a dude. Pheromones aside, I could see myself liking this smell on a girl.</li>
            <li> My first impression right from the bottle was that it was very fruity. ( I don&#x27;t know what kind of fruit but it smelled like a fruit ) After that initial introduction, I quickly fell in love with this. I don&#x27;t care if it is all in my head but I feel as if it made my mood much better. They say if you believe in the product, it becomes true, maybe in a placebo sort of way. The scent was still on my wrist for a long time ( 2 to 3 hours ). Perhaps this is not a long time for most people but to me it is. Maybe it also has something to do with body chemistry, everyone is different and the effects would vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that my personal scent has notes of both fruity and floral, an overall sweet smell. I feel very special wearing this. The bottle states that everyone will get their own unique smell ( I read so far back that someone even smelt like cake ) and while no, I did not smell like cake, I have my own special scent, so mysterious and different, a mixture of many things and I found myself smelling my wrists to try and decipher and solve the puzzle of my own scent that the oil gave out. I would like to think that as time went on the aroma did not leave me quickly like it said others did, rather it changed to a more refreshing clean smell, like rain. And as others have stated you can add this oil with other perfumes or body oils to make it last longer and create a different smell. I went on a shopping spree online and bought 57 different types of perfume oils, so I will be doing a lot of experimentation with all of them. On a side note, perfume oils are seriously cheap I spent altogether maybe 30 dollars on those instead of buying half a bottle of one not so famous singer. This oil was the most expensive at 10 dollars but to find something that is based off of you, it was so worth it in my eyes. As my Aunt would say \\&quot;This is a repeat!\\&quot; It also is Pheromone Infused, which is suppose to make you and others not only in a nicer mood but make you smell nicer to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, I tried this on my boyfriend. Now that I remember it, it was very funny. I kept asking him \\&quot;What do you think about me, what do you like about me?\\&quot; And he went on and on about how he thinks I&#x27;m pretty, cute, gorgeous and that he missed me and loves me. Which if you can think about it, based on this product was not the reaction I was hoping for. However, it should be noted that he did smell my hair and asked if I showered ( I know so romantic, lol ). When I told him about the oil, he told me that was why he smelled my hair because he wanted to know what smelled good. I tried this on my boyfriend to see how the oil affected him and my opinion is that the same fruity original scent did not change and it only lasted maybe 10 minutes. Again this probably has something to do with the body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were wondering, did it make him all GaGa Crazy over me? I don&#x27;t know. Then again he is usually crazy about me, but I found it nice that he was more tender loving with me than usual. He wanted me to hold him and lay on my arm while I played with his hair. So I think it did work but as stated before everyone is different so his reaction was different too. It was very nice to see a different side to him. Would I buy this again. Yes, I would and simply because the smell is nice and completely unique, it is really special. I didn&#x27;t buy this to have guys tear their shirts off to get a piece of me. I wanted something new and different, and would be my own and this did that for me. If you want something like that, then Yes, I recommend you to buy this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more technically note, I ordered this on 7/23/2014 and got it on 7/29/2014. It took 6 days and I ordered a lot of things, like 5 other items, so that could be another factor too. To me 6 days is really fast but maybe you don&#x27;t think the same.rs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, I tried this on my boyfriend. Now that I remember it, it was very funny. I kept asking him \\&quot;What do you think about me, what do you like about me?\\&quot; And he went on and on about how he thinks I&#x27;m pretty, cute, gorgeous and that he missed me and loves me.

            <li> Although this product has a nice smell, I think it to be more of a comfidence booster.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it with another oil to create a unique scent and will definately buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on for years. It has a wonderful smell (completely different on every person). I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. It&#x27;s not too overpowering and smells pretty gender neutral. It also had the desired effect with my husband. ;)</li>
            <li> Same product as at the toy partys but for a better price !Stocked up on this insteas of buying at a toy party</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! It puts me in a good mood whenever I wear it. Would definitely recommend it. Can be worn alone or with other scents.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is very soft and subtle.  I don&#x27;t like overbearing scents.  This is a scent where you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on it but you know that you like it.  A person thought it was the soap that I used. LOL</li>
            <li> just smells fruity.....ths it</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this works, but it really smells nice and since it doesn&#x27;t cost much, what&#x27;s the harm?  The smell makes me happy and there&#x27;s not enough happiness in the world.  :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything different. The smell is more old lady until it wears off a little. I&#x27;m really surprised my husband didn&#x27;t ask what I put on bc the smell is strong. I got it just to test to see if it works and after using it for 2 weeks I didn&#x27;t notice anything different.</li>
            <li> This is a second order and it was as good as the first! I already have ordered more and will again when I get close to using it all up. I like the mild smell and it can be worn with my other perfumes. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I guess the saying goes like you get what you pay for?&lt;br /&gt;Well with this stuff I got more than I payed for, in my job I got about $40 in tips! Yes it was Christmas but let&#x27;s not forget that usually never happens. I am in a janitorial kind of job.&lt;br /&gt;I have shared a little with a friend. We are both guys in our 20&#x27;s and we like the idea that we can use this as an edge. For $10 what do you have to lose really?</li>
            <li> It smells really fruity, like all the other reviews. I doubt it does anything for &amp;#34;attraction&amp;#34; but it really does smell nice. I use it when I want to get compliments that day for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> great stuff, works fine, easy to use as explained, and very good for its price, I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> i chosed this rating because i was expecting something that when you smelled the aroma you would be like DAMN that smells soo good</li>
            <li> Gracias lo recibí en tiempo y estaba en perfectas condiciones. Estaré pendiente en el futuro de Uds. Cuando decida comprar algo de nuevo.</li>
            <li> I drenched my whole body with this stuff and no one noticed. Yucky!</li>
            <li> My husband has the WORST allergies, I think this smells like candy and doesn&#x27;t bother his allergies one bit!  Plus it seems to always make me feel more confident when I wear it... I even wore it to my job interview (and YEA they offered me the job) .. Even if the pheromones didn&#x27;t work it smells really good.  BUT, call me crazy, I think they DO work.  It seems like people are just kinder to you even if not attracted to you.. I love it.. I wear it everyday.  Found it the first time many years ago at an adult party, it was expensive!  Loved it but couldn&#x27;t afford it.. I have no idea how they are selling this for this low a price but it is definitely the real stuff and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected a lot of girls said it wasn&#x27;t too great but guys liked it I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li> I really honestly love the smell of this...and i believe it works pretty damn well...just dont put too much on...you&#x27;re sure to get a headache...but thats with any perfume really...</li>
            <li> It smells soo mice and I noticed a slight mood lifting effect. I ordered a second bottle. But...If you want it to do more in the attraction department add a dab of Scent of Eros for women or PCC. Hey not bad for the price</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of pure instinct, and I love the smell . I apply a small amount to my wrist , neck , and behind my ears. I must say it does make me feel confident . I wear it on the job I&#x27;m a dental professional and sit very close to my patients . First , my boss is male and i decide to wear it to see what type of reaction I&#x27;d get . Lol. He kept coming in my room to ask me random questions just starting a conversation . It&#x27;s hilarious because the next week when I came bck to work for him he had on gym shoes!! (Hasn&#x27;t worn them in like 10 years on the job) the other male doc that I work with was also checking me out and talking to me more than normal .im not really certain if this is really working or not because when I wear it out i rarely get that much response, however it seems to be making a difference on my job. I&#x27;m gonna try others to compare.</li>
            <li> To be honest the whole pheromone story behind this pure instinct bottle is a bunch of boloni. However the oil does smell good, this is some sort of oily substance.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but not great. Your scent will not last very long maybe 30 minutes tops. And the bottle is very easy to lose so make sure you put it somewhere safe. Received package on time. But, not really worth the money unless you don&#x27;t mind applying the product on several times.</li>
            <li> This mixed well with my favorite perfum and wasn&#x27;t overwhelming, great size to keep in a make up bag or purse</li>
            <li> The sweet scent alone is very alluring! Each time I wear it, I am amazed at the response I received from random guys at the gas station, the grocery store, the mall, etc. It also boosts my confidence!!! I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle! I&#x27;m truly a believer!</li>
            <li> Just smells like bad candy. Tossed it!</li>
            <li> it just smells good. used in making lotion. dont expect a flock of attention, lol.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, the smell is unique and lasts for awhile. I also saw this product in a Temptations Party catalog for over double what I paid here (Same size and all!)</li>
            <li> Obviously, this is not a magic potion.  I don&#x27;t actually believe it will make people treat you differently, and it won&#x27;t land you a date with the person of your dreams.  I&#x27;m not thoroughly sold on the idea of human pheromones, and it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me, but my partner loves it, and I like the way it smells.  Apply too much of it, though, and it&#x27;s overpoweringly fruity.</li>
            <li> After about 3 days of using this product I noticed a rise in my confidence level and I even became friendlier. The smell is nice and subtle. I&#x27;m not sure how it effected those around me, but it may have helped me a few times on a &amp;#34;pure instinct&amp;#34; level.</li>
            <li> I love it, just wish it would last longer. Very unique smell and there is nothing else that smells like that.</li>
            <li> I bought the product hoping to gain some attention from the opposite sex. Not just for a sexual encounter, but is hope of meeting Mr. Right. It was as if I didn&#x27;t have it own. Noone noticed any difference. It does not live up to what it says it will do. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Smells Nice.  I can&#x27;t say if it works or not because nothing out of the norm has happened.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference... The smell is faint and sweet. A bit too sweet for a man, I would assume, even though it is designed as unisex. Basically, it is a bottle of essential oils that smell ok.</li>
            <li> Great service. Unhappy with the product</li>
            <li> Smell is nice! Sweet and fruity!</li>
            <li> In the past, I have only been able to find this product at home sales.  I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of this purchase.</li>
            <li> Smell is light enough to wear another nothing or add Cologne. I wear it right when I get out the shower. I was wash with a pheromone body wash as well.  Woman seem to react great, more strangers striking up conversation.</li>
            <li> It has a light musky scent that compliments my perfume very well, I only use it occasionally because it does work for me and I do notice an increase in attention. But when I&#x27;m not in the mood to be bothered I won&#x27;t put it on.</li>
            <li> I wore this for a week and i had 3 people ask what i was wearing and where it was from! ans i reall did see an increase in my tips from work too! mind you not huge but it has been at least a 10-15 dollar increase:)</li>
            <li> of the thousands of entries for this pure instant pheromone cologne - I&#x27;m still not sure, is this like JJ or Rush? or Just similar because their in beauty/sexual wellness?</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the Pure Romance Pheremones...wish I wouldn&#x27;t have. It smells good...very fruity. but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This items have a nice sweet smell. but dose not work. I have try it for the pass two weeks. I went back to my regular perfume.</li>
            <li> Great product with a smell that I love. Each day it tends to smell a little different and I like this fact. I think the scent can be driven by my mood which is why the smell differs a little bit from day to day. The smell is one that everyone loves and always asks about, I do share, but not with everyone.</li>
            <li> perhaps the scent will give the wearer more courage, it seems to do absolutely nothing for anyone else you are near. I wouldn&#x27;t waist me money on this - or similar - products. Great idea, and I feel there should be some merit behind the idea of t, I could not speak to the positive of any effects of using it.</li>
            <li> Needed cologne with it&amp;#34;s own unique scent, this oil can be fused with others to come up with your own. Scent enjoy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this actually contains human pheromones. However, it smells fruity, and I like it as a perfume for summer. It has a hint of guava (not the super stinky variety...the milder one). The smell made me think that it probably contains guava pheromones (guavas naturally give off pheromones). Either way, I&#x27;ll be wearing it as perfume for the summer.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, just don&#x27;t usw too much because it smells musky if you do.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not like AXE spray for men. No chicks attacked my penis.</li>
            <li> smells ok, doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on men.</li>
            <li> [Disclaimer-This scent is more for women. However men if you&#x27;re comfortable with something that first goes on feminine smelling go for it!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I waited to do a review for at least a month since I first purchased. I wanted to really put this stuff to the test. Does it attract? Uplift your mood? I&#x27;m not an insanely outgoing person but I&#x27;m not scared of polite conversation and throwing a joke or two at a complete strange during day to day life. Mostly, honestly.... I bought Pure Instinct in hopes it might help me in my job hunt. Yes I&#x27;m desperate! I&#x27;m not into getting hit on (so I&#x27;m sure that vibe comes off of me) however I have noticed I defiantly get checked out more when I wear it and at the gym occasionally men sometimes find an excuse to say a little something to me. Strangely enough I do find people in general do seem more polite, kinder, more interested in whatever it is I have to say when I wear it. It also DOES uplift my mood and make me smile a bit more. I&#x27;m chipper when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It really smells amazing which is a big factor in why I bought the 2nd bottle. Also maaaaybe I kinda left my first bottle in the heat of my vehicle and was afraid some of the delicate oils got harmed by the heat. First applied it smells like a delicious fruity grape bubblegum. *Droooool* I looove the smell of Pure Instinct! It&#x27;s just mouth watering! In 15-20 minutes it settles into your own fragrance which I also love because it makes this fragrance oil so very special and unique. It won&#x27;t smell the same on you as it does as someone else. This is where it may work for some men but at first it does smell very girly and fresh. On me it dries down to a fruity(but not too fruity) floral sort of smell that defiantly is not overbearing or overpowering. Over all, smells great, very unique and at the very least seems to boost the mood which makes you by default seem more appealing in whatever situation you want to be. For right now, this is my sometimes signature. If Icould afford the 3rd bottle whenever I wanted to I&#x27;d be my all the time signature scent! Pure Instinct exceeded my expectations by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also the seller Steve&#x27;s ships fast and ads some cool coupons! Packaged well considering it&#x27;s a small glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Originally I ordered this looking for a boost during a busy day, as I had tried (poppers) way back in the 80&#x27;s.  Well it certainly provides that boost and women love it.  It gives you more confidence as well; you wll approach women so attractive that you were having been leary about before.  Women will go out of their way to help you out when you wear it.  One lady even invited me to lunch in the presence of my wife, then invited her too as an afterthought.  Im 54 and women as young as 20 like to converse with me although Ive never pursued anyone in a serious way; Im happily married.  But the possiblities are endless.  Try it, guys, youll see.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I wore it around my friends and they all complimented me (even guys) on how it smelt. This scent is not girly, so don&#x27;t worry about you smelling like a girl, it&#x27;s a unisex scent that smells amazing for both genders. Nobody will complain when wearing this. It&#x27;s like everybody&#x27;s your puppet when you smell so good. I like to put this on before I apply my normal cologne and it works amazingly. I get compliments all the time when I go to parties and way more confidence. This is great for working out or doing stuff that&#x27;s going to make you sweat and you don&#x27;t want to smell so you just put some on the wrists, neck, behind ears, and any other place your will sweat a lot. This will defuse the scent into the air and sending out the pheromones. This stuff is amazing and so cheap! And completely beats all of my colognes, so I combine it with one and it&#x27;s like I smell like a God. Seriously great! But it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also! Came in brand new condition! Nothing was bad!</li>
            <li> Oil has a pleasant scent and simple glass applicator. Can apply small amount or a lot without a problem. Some notice immediately others not at all.</li>
            <li> WORKS!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL BE AMAZED&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and my hubby is reciprocating like never before!&lt;br /&gt;Hurray for pure instinct.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite perfume ever and I&#x27;m so glad to have found it so cheap on here. Thank you. Took 2 weeks on standard to get here. Was nothing wrong with it. I&#x27;m wearing it right now. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear Pure Instincts I get more compliments, conversation and friendliness. Thats why I keep using the product.</li>
            <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve  EVER USED!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it&#x27;s quite nice. Honestly I don&#x27;t know if the pheromones are given more hype than they deserve or if I&#x27;m just highly oblivious to the effect they have. I think a person&#x27;s look and attitude is going to be just as, if not more, effective than this product. It does have a strong smell though, and as a perfume it&#x27;s a good one. To me the smell never changes much; it&#x27;s a bit like watermelon at first, then changes subtly &#x27;til it has a kind of musky scent like dragon&#x27;s blood. I&#x27;ve never noticed a huge difference in the smells when it&#x27;s applied to other people, but I&#x27;m not good at picking up subtle differences. I can tell you it does smell at least a little different from person to person. Worth trying, even if it doesn&#x27;t have quite the effects you were hoping for!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome like starburst or fruity candy but refreshing. My bf thinks it smells good guys love any smell of food my boyfriend prefers fruity and citrusy smells so he liked this one but I did have to ask him to smell it on me he wasnt like drawn to me all of a sudden so im not sure of the phermones lol</li>
            <li> I love the scent! My sister and I both have this and it smells completely different on each of us. It has a flowery smell on me and more of a fruity&lt;br /&gt;smell on her. I haven&#x27;t noticed it being an attractant, but who knows. I just bought it for the scent.</li>
            <li> Did not see any effect on me, but I guess we are all different. Try it on your own risk.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product, it&#x27;s simply doesn&#x27;t work. Just buy a good perfume like black orchid by Tom ford instead.</li>
            <li> After trying Pure Instinct for only a couple of weeks now, being an attractant, has not gotten me any compliments, but, I have noticed female co-workers walking by a lot more than they have been. This product has a nice fragrance, is oil based, but, I do not know how long the fragrance lasts on me. Maybe, if I keep using it more, like everyday, they might come out and say something rather than stand around you.</li>
            <li> I have tried using this two different ways and neither way seems to work. When I first bought it, I applied this on every day, and it had a nice aroma but it didn&#x27;t have any noticeable affect on people around me. Then later on, I tried it on and off every once in a while and still seemed like it wasn&#x27;t doing anything. The idea is nice, but I just didn&#x27;t have any luck with it.</li>
            <li> This product has a good smell but doesn&#x27;t do anything of what it says. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a week now. Better to just think of it as a perfume and nothing more.</li>
            <li> Got this thinking, well maybe this might work.  WRONG!  Don&#x27;t waste your $$$ on this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t smell good and DOESN&#x27;T work.</li>
            <li> Honestly smells a bit like those urinal deodorants in mens toilets. No effect on people around me however.</li>
            <li> Smell a bit fruity and sweet at first, but scent fades quickly. Other than that, didn&#x27;t notice any benefits that pheromones are supposed to provide.</li>
            <li> Since I been wearing my tips have increased! I attract customers a lot easier :) can&#x27;t work without this! Worth it :)</li>
            <li> I used for three weeks and one time i use too see the girl that i like and she just say like you smell so wear  and she say she dont like at all this disappoint it</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of honeydew melons. I bought this product wondering if the pheromones actually were strong enough to attract other people.  I still have no idea but I have only worn it for one day so far.</li>
            <li> The scent is so sexy.  This is the first pheromone product I&#x27;ve tried that actually works. Every time I wear it, I get tons of attention.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a bit different and when I tried it at first the scent was pleasant, but very quickly turned on me.</li>
            <li> no, its not a miracle perfume but my boyfriend loves it, it smells great and it definitely makes more people notice me</li>
            <li> Dunno about the sex attractant thing but this stuff smells great, just wanted some good cheap cologne and this did the trick, kind of fruity but I like it.</li>
            <li> my husband loves the smell of it, and so do I. I recommend it to anyone who loves to smell delicious!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It has a unique, soft, scent. And I honestly think it works. ;)</li>
            <li> I went to a pure romance party where they had a pheromone perfume oil similar to this one but it was $24. I went on here and found this one, tried it, just as good plus you get a vial full instead of a roll on like pure romances type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pheromones do work. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. My bf went crazy when he smelled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this oil I noticed every woman has a different scent. My scent smells like Victoria&#x27;s Secrets&#x27; Love Spell. On a friend of mine it smells like a slightly floral kind of light Musk scent. Which I find amazing that it brings out your own scent so it&#x27;s unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is light not overpowering, I wear this with my other perfume but it smells just the same alone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent lasts for 3 to 4 hours</li>
            <li> Not sure if it makes women notice you anymore but oddly I do feel very confident when wearing. I cover with other cologne, Kind of smells musky. Over all I would but again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work just has a nice smell</li>
            <li> Like the smell, has a tropical scent to it almost like coconut, I can see how some people say it smells similar to cotton candy but its definitely tropical. Its oil based not alcohol based so its a thick consistency. I put a generous amount on and hit the bars and didn&#x27;t see any results. I wasn&#x27;t expecting any to be honest I think that sometimes this stuff has a placebo effect that makes peoples confidence level higher when they wear it. Overall nice smell but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear perfume at work, but this is amazing, light scented and makes me feel great wearing it. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the pheromones attract anyone. At least not for me. I give it three stars, because it does smell okay. I&#x27;ve actually had a couple of comments from friends that I smell good.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and when I wear it, it sticks with me all day.  Very light scent, gets compliments!</li>
            <li> I AM VERY  PLEASED  AT THIS ITEM . IT SMELLS  ESQUISITE . MUCH SIMILAR TO  A ITEM CALLED  BASIC INSTINCT THAT  PURE ROMANCE SELLS FOR LIKE 28.00$ . I DROP  ONE  DROP INTO ANY BODY SPRAY OR  LOTION OR  PERFUME BOTTLE TO ENHANCE  MY APPEAL  ..</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product, it smells fa-nominal. It lasts for a while, my husband loves when i wear it, its sweet and floral and i cant get enough!</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on, I get this warm, fuzzy feeling. And I love the smell !...so does everyone else.</li>
            <li> When I saw this, I was very curious and had to order it.  The scent is a bit strange, but for some reason, I like it!  I put a little on each side of my neck before I leave for the day.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed much change, but I am not pregnant, and I&#x27;m a man!  Okay, so maybe not...  but I do feel a secret sense of extra security for some reason wearing a product nobody would be able to pinpoint.  I&#x27;m not sure who I&#x27;d recommend this to, but if you want something that is more of a luxury than necessity and have a few extra bucks to toss into the wind, then why not?  I am the only person I know who uses this, and somehow that&#x27;s pretty special.  What to feel special too?  Give it a shot ;)  lol</li>
            <li> Didnt do what the description says it does. But it makes a great oil to burn. Ill purchase for that again.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle fruit. I certainly feel feminine when wearing it. I pair this with my signature fragrance, which I have noticed more compliments when paired together. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot. The oil will absorb quickly into your skin. This is not a perfume. The scent will not linger. However, the effects do!</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it worked great. People couldn&#x27;t get enough of me. People at work kept hugging me, people lingered around longer to talk to me, I got asked out on 2 dates by coworkers who have known me for a year. But it sat in the car in the sun for a day or two, and suddenly it wasn&#x27;t working. I think it still smells great but people don&#x27;t seem to notice anymore, not even if I tell them to directly smell the area I applied it. I used it everyday for a month then periodially afterwards. I would buy again but keep it in a cool place to see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I like it thanks. I would buy this product again. it smells really good I luv it. wonderful product.  Sorry but that is about all I have to say about this product. I really would buy it again tho.</li>
            <li> not happy with it i thought it was popers !!!!</li>
            <li> I know it says this is Uni-Sex and it is...but ultimately it really isn&#x27;t. First off, the smell is way to fruity and feminine. As a guy you will have to mask this with some other scent. Now..this stuff actually does work. I noticed it makes girls fall in love with me very fast with a hint of lust thrown in there. It basically puts them in an addictive love trance. And the self effects are good too. Definite boost in confidence and overall mood. The problem is, whatever male pheromones are in this wear off very fast. Maybe it&#x27;s not male mones though, maybe it&#x27;s the oxytocin? Oxytocin is known to wear off fast. I don&#x27;t know for sure though because theres no ingredient list!!! How are they even getting away with this?! Anyway, I&#x27;d say about a week after opening it is when it wears off. And so all your left with is the female pheromones. And there are definitely female mones in this without a doubt. So what starts happening is you&#x27;ll notice guys will start to be more buddy buddy around you but girls will start to shy away. And you&#x27;ll also start to feel a little emasculated..kinda cranky, a sense of a need to constantly complain, and just beechy in general...like a chic.  So for the most part, in the end, this stuff actually has the opposite effect that a guy would want. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> mmm it smells sooo good. Im so glad i bought this. Its a soft oil with a delicious sweet scent that last hours. I just wore it on a first date!</li>
            <li> I dont notice nothing when I wear this. I am very disappointed in this product. I was not expecting magic, but I was expecting maybe a few heads to turn.....</li>
            <li> Love how this smells on me, I just found this scent again after years of searching and it smells just like I remember!</li>
            <li> This sent makes me feel good. It smells amazing. I would ware it everyday, good thing all you need is a dab, this little bottle will last me forever!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with the smell. It lasts almost all day for me! As for those who reviewed and said that it smelled greasy??? Not all all… everyone&#x27;s nose is different but i don&#x27;t see how you a get grease and oil smell out of the candy aroma! Sometimes I even pair it with other perfumes! Highly recommend and would buy from the seller again! :-)</li>
            <li> Maybe even made me feel sexy but not sure it actually does anything. I seam to get more if a response when i&#x27;m dint wear any perfumes. But I&#x27;ll sure enjoy trying it out more.</li>
