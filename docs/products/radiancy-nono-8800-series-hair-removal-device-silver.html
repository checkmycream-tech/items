    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>Great for women maybe!</li>
            <li>Awesome product!  </li>
            <li>Excellent!  </li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>But, it makes her happy, so ...&lt;</li>
            <li>A great Idea, every thing looked great on TV.</li>
            <li>And, works great.</li>
            <li>Good luck, I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li>Works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>If the company was fair, they should refund the consumers money when asked.  </li>
            <li>LOVE no peach fuzz on my cheeks!  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Kind of.</li>
            <li>I work as it would describe, great packaging, and fast shipment, but I need to buy the refill since it describe as used!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>This happened for every replacement blade but not the original that came with the no!no!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product at first, but I tried to be more consistent with it (using it weekly) on my arms and after about a month</li>
            <li>Pain free :)</li>
            <li>and I expect a full refund plus my shipping!</li>
            <li>We have the latest and most powerful model, the NO-NO 5.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;fine print\\&quot; indicates that for them to pay the return postage, you MUST use it for the full 60 days!  </li>
            <li>The company does not recommend the use of the large blade on the face so you have to make your own decision.  </li>
            <li>I was excited because it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and I was charged full price.</li>
            <li>and they told me that they cannot replace it and when I asked about getting it fixed (even at my OWN expense)</li>
            <li>It looked so simple, easy and effective.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I also tried it on my fine, light colored arm hair for the same length of time and haven&#x27;t seen much results there either.  </li>
            <li>They quickly sent us 3 replacement blade packages.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We got it quickly and the hype surrounding</li>
            <li>The hair is clean and the right length, but the product just does not work.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing).</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriends and he&#x27;s in love with his new toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time for everything I guess!</li>
            <li>otherwise it worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>this product is not effective and causes more and more hair growth and makes  it more thicker.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful and excited.  </li>
            <li>No No is right ...</li>
            <li>It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway.</li>
            <li>However, that offer is only good if you buy direct from the company.  </li>
            <li>It does not remove hair in any effective manner no matter how long or consistently it is used.  </li>
            <li>They are very reluctant to issue you a return authorization!  </li>
            <li>TV commercial was so convincing.</li>
            <li>She just ignored the red light and turned off and on the no!no! and continued until the red light came on again and would reset it again and repeat.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy way to remove unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used the large \\&quot;blade\\&quot; on my face and had no problems.</li>
            <li>My hair is not too fine or coarse.</li>
            <li>I am really liking this product.  </li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary, but I get really close.  </li>
            <li>It gets 90% and as she&#x27;s fair-haired it doesn&#x27;t look straggly, but it doesn&#x27;t really do a 100% job.  </li>
            <li>Save your money on something like the Remington or real lazer treatment instead.</li>
            <li>so the the blue light stays on and the unit operates (burning the hair) With Our attempts</li>
            <li>and I am very dissatisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem to work well on the light hairs, and not at all on the coarse hairs.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>You have to really be pushy and even threaten to take legal action!!  </li>
            <li>bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial.</li>
            <li>I got a unit with the small area attachment, but I honestly don&#x27;t see the need for it.  </li>
            <li>I use it 2-3x/wk and am thinking I&#x27;ll probably be able to go to weekly or even less in 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Most people will probably find that they don&#x27;t have the time to waste trying to finesse this product to perform as advertised.  </li>
            <li>When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming.</li>
            <li>This was sold to me and advertised as NEW</li>
            <li>I bought a No-No 8800 brand new in January 2013.  </li>
            <li>Great alternative to the expensive professional laser treatments I was having done.</li>
            <li>I tried it on some other areas where the hair was not coarse and I had to go over the area MANY times before it would remove the hair.</li>
            <li>, we could not move the device at the proper speed for more than a few seconds before the blue light went off and on and chattered, thus going from low power to level 5 -- the hottest setting.  </li>
            <li>I bought her a Silk&#x27;n for Christmas and it seems to be working, but it is still too early to tell.    </li>
            <li>I bought this off the nono website, direct.  </li>
            <li>they said they will do nothing to help since it wasn&#x27;t bought with a warranty (i.e. through them or authorized seller directly).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended as long as you don&#x27;t expect it to completely remove all the hair without some extra effort at first.  </li>
            <li>If you have very dark and course hair don&#x27;t expect true results.</li>
            <li>My girl friend recommended to remove them with her old hair pulling device, which was quite painful but the results where great.</li>
            <li>The whole device is reliance on a single rubber band that controls the thermicon tip head movement.  </li>
            <li>Most of my facial hair is very blonde with a few coarse hairs.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, these replacement blades would have the red light (time for replacement) turn on during their first use.</li>
            <li>Overall I would reccomend it, but not sure if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much money for little results.</li>
            <li>No No owners have a moral obligation to tell customers their product will not work on heavy chin and face hair, they have blocked unsatisfied customer responses from web research with very clever captioning.</li>

            <li> I have dark brown hair (not real coarse, but not fine either) and used it on my upper lip &amp; chin consistently for 5 months, and haven&#x27;t seen any results.  </li>
            <li> It really gets rid of the hair after a few treatments!  </li>
            <li> If your face is flat like pancake, may then it would work.  </li>
            <li> The areas where it worked (two square inches maximum) took numerous attempts and time to only partially burn off the hair!  </li>
            <li> I read numerous other complaints of the same issue - one would think they would make a change given the issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped through Amazon a long time now and never had any problems...</li>
            <li> The brunt smell from the hair didn&#x27;t bother me, as long as I thought it could work.  </li>
            <li> did not remove one single hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time on a no no product,i have tried two different models and neither one works,customer service is non existent after the sale from the company(the no no company) and all you&#x27;ll get from them is the run around.</li>
            <li> Be Careful.</li>
            <li> But it does make a noticable diference with regular use over a few weeks</li>
            <li> I expected the Nono to get the hair off closer and for it to stay off longer.  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result.</li>
            <li> That one worked faster, but the result was still not perfect, 1-day old stub, and not in the least reducing new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> This really is the worst kind of false advertising.</li>
            <li> Galvanic Electrolysis which desolves hair cells along hair shaft all the way to the root is the only solution to heavy hair, especially white wirey ones that come with age, lazar methods are useless for this.</li>
            <li> and I was shocked that the contents inside very much appeared to be \\&quot;used\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> At first I thought maybe I am doing it wrong, or my hair is fire-resistant!</li>
            <li> I feel bad that my mom spent so much money on it.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money ever.</li>
            <li> The smaller blade had a broken wire when it arrived, and I reported this to them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this unit a few weeks ago for my daughter to try.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my time, money, and efforts.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a few burn marks around the chin</li>
            <li> You waste your time stinking up the house with burnt hair smell, and expecting results that never show.</li>
            <li> and I would not suggest purchashing this item for anyone, it is a waste of your time and money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.  </li>
            <li> It took me about 2 hours to scrub one leg with NoNo, and the result was looking like 2 days-old stub, uneven.</li>
            <li> After wrestling with it for few weeks, I gave up and called the company.</li>
            <li> The hair on my lip  is blonde and thin so there should be no excuses.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in a poorly packaged beat-up looking box (very BIG box) with this small box inside.</li>
            <li> Clearly they don&#x27;t want to put in writing that their product is deficient and that they refuse to stand behind it.  </li>
            <li> Time to use (hours at a time for a small patch), time to talk to the reps to get a return authorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> given how false the other claims were.</li>
            <li> This rubber band came loose and now the device is useless.  </li>
            <li> she has a hard time reaching (like the backs of her arms)</li>
            <li> Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews, so I knew the</li>
            <li> At least I did...  </li>
            <li> I used to have thick hair on my arms that I would use Nair on.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed it was not strong enough to do the job on my hand nothing like I was expecting,it is not a 100% for men.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> This is false advertising at</li>
            <li> The manufacturers of this product should be prosecuted for false advertising.  </li>
            <li> $300 dollars gone to waste!!!!  </li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to move the device at the correct speed over</li>
            <li> If you believe this device will work if you just follow directions and remain patient, you are wrong.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Return process was difficult</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I figured it would be a bad investment.</li>
            <li> I really, really, really hate the smell of burnt hair.  </li>
            <li> After ALL the advertising I had seen on this product I was and am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> We are very disappointed with this &amp; would like to return it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> No! No! Don&#x27;t buy it.  Biggest waste of money ever. If I could return it I would.</li>
            <li> Bought this off HSN because of the split payment option.  I am really liking this product.  I should qualify this by saying that I do not have a problem with coarse body hair.  However, I have had this for about two weeks and am already seeing a slowdown in hair growth.  I got a unit with the small area attachment, but I honestly don&#x27;t see the need for it.  I have used the large \\&quot;blade\\&quot; on my face and had no problems. LOVE no peach fuzz on my cheeks!  The company does not recommend the use of the large blade on the face so you have to make your own decision.  But I have had no problems with burning, etc.  I use it 2-3x/wk and am thinking I&#x27;ll probably be able to go to weekly or even less in 4 weeks.  One thing, though:  it does smell like burning hair (which, in fact, it is doing!) and my husband didn&#x27;t like it.  The solution was to go in the bathroom and turn on the fan.  Worked like a charm.  Highly recommended as long as you don&#x27;t expect it to completely remove all the hair without some extra effort at first.  Your mileage may vary, but I get really close.  I also use a glass file instead of the buffers and this works well too.</li>
            <li> After ALL the advertising I had seen on this product I was and am very disappointed.  It does not work for me as advertised.  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife back in September. She used it for 3 months 3 times a week and it did not show any results. She is of Italian heritage and has very coarse hair. So your millage may vary. I bought her a Silk&#x27;n for Christmas and it seems to be working, but it is still too early to tell.    Note, we bought this through the no!no! store via Amazon. The smaller blade had a broken wire when it arrived, and I reported this to them. They quickly sent us 3 replacement blade packages. I was very impressed. Unfortunately, these replacement blades would have the red light (time for replacement) turn on during their first use. This happened for every replacement blade but not the original that came with the no!no! She just ignored the red light and turned off and on the no!no! and continued until the red light came on again and would reset it again and repeat.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time on a no no product,i have tried two different models and neither one works,customer service is non existent after the sale from the company(the no no company) and all you&#x27;ll get from them is the run around.This is false advertising at it&#x27;s finest.</li>
            <li> My hair is not too fine or coarse. This product works well for me. I am seeing reduced hair growth. It did not work well on my husband&#x27;s neck hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. Just ordered the newer model.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product at first, but I tried to be more consistent with it (using it weekly) on my arms and after about a month I saw progress.  It doesn&#x27;t work so well everywhere... I have burned my face and don&#x27;t think it works to well on my legs.  But for arms, it did wonders.  I used to have thick hair on my arms that I would use Nair on.  Overall I would reccomend it, but not sure if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews, so I knew the No No might not work for me. As an experiment, I used it on only my left leg and bikini area.  After 6 weeks there was no reduction in hair growth compared to the untreated side.  I returned it and am going to try Tria next.</li>
            <li> I ordered this unit a few weeks ago for my daughter to try. The package arrived in a poorly packaged beat-up looking box (very BIG box) with this small box inside. We finally opened it last night to try out and I was shocked that the contents inside very much appeared to be \\&quot;used\\&quot;! everything was thrown together inside the box and the instruction sheet or \\&quot;booklet\\&quot; was even creased and crinkled up....the \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; disc-thing looked worn also. I am not opposed to purchasing a like-new or lightly-used item, but I would expect to be told that at the time I purchased it! This was sold to me and advertised as NEW and I was charged full price. I&#x27;ve shopped through Amazon a long time now and never had any problems...first time for everything I guess! This is on it&#x27;s way back and I expect a full refund plus my shipping!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dear spouse.  She loves it as it&#x27;s a lot easier than shaving or waxing off the hair.  It gets 90% and as she&#x27;s fair-haired it doesn&#x27;t look straggly, but it doesn&#x27;t really do a 100% job.  There are some part of her she has a hard time reaching (like the backs of her arms) so I do them for her.  I really, really, really hate the smell of burnt hair.  Yuck.  But, it makes her happy, so ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got it quickly and the hype surrounding it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this off the nono website, direct.  I was hopeful that it would work, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I have dark brown hair (not real coarse, but not fine either) and used it on my upper lip &amp; chin consistently for 5 months, and haven&#x27;t seen any results.  It just does not work.  To be fair, I also tried it on my fine, light colored arm hair for the same length of time and haven&#x27;t seen much results there either.  I wish I could get my money back.  It was a waste of my time, money, and efforts.  Maybe it works for some people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and I used it over my face almost every day . NOTHING has changed I am planing to return it .</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful and excited.  I watched infomercials and researched on the net about how to use it and what to expect. The hair is clean and the right length, but the product just does not work.  I have course white facial hair which it does not burn up.  It does leave a few burn marks around the chin but I wouldn&#x27;t care if it did the job.  Perhaps it works on darker thinner hair.  Good luck, I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> I got this item for Christmas and have been using it for about 2 months now. I feel bad that my mom spent so much money on it. After reading all the reviews, I figured it would be a bad investment. Does it work? Kind of. It works for people that have peach fuzz basically. If you have very dark and course hair don&#x27;t expect true results. I&#x27;m guessing this is why they only show it used on arm hair in infomercials. Save your money on something like the Remington or real lazer treatment instead. It&#x27;s too much money for little results. You waste your time stinking up the house with burnt hair smell, and expecting results that never show. Only worked on the face and arm hair for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking there was a 60-day guarantee.  However, that offer is only good if you buy direct from the company.  I didn&#x27;t realize this until I wanted to return the product.  I have coarse facial hair and it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair.  I tried it on some other areas where the hair was not coarse and I had to go over the area MANY times before it would remove the hair.</li>
            <li> No No owners have a moral obligation to tell customers their product will not work on heavy chin and face hair, they have blocked unsatisfied customer responses from web research with very clever captioning. Be Careful. Galvanic Electrolysis which desolves hair cells along hair shaft all the way to the root is the only solution to heavy hair, especially white wirey ones that come with age, lazar methods are useless for this.</li>
            <li> All models of the No-No work the same way.  They burn the hair off. We have the latest and most powerful model, the NO-NO 5.  We have watched their videos on their web pages and read all about the techniques to use the product.  It is extremely difficult to move the device at the correct speed over you skin so the the blue light stays on and the unit operates (burning the hair) With Our attempts, we could not move the device at the proper speed for more than a few seconds before the blue light went off and on and chattered, thus going from low power to level 5 -- the hottest setting.  The areas where it worked (two square inches maximum) took numerous attempts and time to only partially burn off the hair!  There was still stubble.  The No-No never fully removed the hair as close as a blade would or as a depilatory would!!  We decided to request a refund.  That can only be done over the phone.  You are then interrogated as to why you want to return it and are referred to watching their videos, re-reading the instructions, etc.  They are very reluctant to issue you a return authorization!  You have to really be pushy and even threaten to take legal action!!  At least I did...  The \\&quot;fine print\\&quot; indicates that for them to pay the return postage, you MUST use it for the full 60 days!  If you go under or over the 60 days, YOU pay for the return postage!  They are weasels!!  Most people will probably find that they don&#x27;t have the time to waste trying to finesse this product to perform as advertised.  Anyway:  Just be advised as to what may happen to you!!</li>
            <li> Works fairly well.  Need to repeat treatment over same surface again and again before hair singes away.  Use it with a permanent home laser hair removal tool (name?) for areas that the laser tool won&#x27;t work on...light/thin hairs</li>
            <li> I work as it would describe, great packaging, and fast shipment, but I need to buy the refill since it describe as used! otherwise it worth the purchase. It has everything that I needed, for that price! would recommended to anyone!</li>
            <li> Actually bought for a gift Afro-American lady and she Loves it!!!  Her husband wanted to get one but did not know what so I researched some and did this one.</li>
            <li> it didnt do what it said it will do . i still have hair on my legs. i am so dissapointed.</li>
            <li> My Dear Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;Since I have a hairy hands My girl friend recommended to remove them with her old hair pulling device, which was quite painful but the results where great. That&#x27;s why I but the NO NO. A great Idea, every thing looked great on TV. Until I tried it on my hand. I was so disappointed it was not strong enough to do the job on my hand nothing like I was expecting,it is not a 100% for men. Great for women maybe!</li>
            <li> No No is right ... it didn&#x27;t work as specified in its advertising and I would not suggest purchashing this item for anyone, it is a waste of your time and money.</li>
            <li> All you have to remember is be patient. It does not work overnight. But it does make a noticable diference with regular use over a few weeks</li>
            <li> did not like it.....charging device was defective!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I have found no undesired effects. It is easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t take allot of time. And, works great.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom and she told me it doesn,t work like it should it din,t get rid of any hair on her</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT work!!!  I was excited because it&#x27;s so easy to use.  The brunt smell from the hair didn&#x27;t bother me, as long as I thought it could work.  I thought I had two months to return it, but I had only one month so I got stuck with it.  $300 dollars gone to waste!!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.  Now I&#x27;m using Remington (also laser) and I LOVE it!  It really gets rid of the hair after a few treatments!  Awesome product!  Great alternative to the expensive professional laser treatments I was having done. Read the reviews!  Good luck!</li>
            <li> If you believe this device will work if you just follow directions and remain patient, you are wrong. This really is the worst kind of false advertising. This product has a persuasive infomercial and is enthusiastically endorsed by a daytime soap star, but it does NOT work. Don&#x27;t fall for it. What a scam!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to 3 months and I am very dissatisfied with the results.  Most of my facial hair is very blonde with a few coarse hairs.  It does not seem to work well on the light hairs, and not at all on the coarse hairs. The hairs grow back within 2 days, even though I use it 3 times per week.  I also tried it on my legs, and it did not remove any of the coarse hairs. I feel like I have been ripped-off![[ASIN:B0037LNR9A Radiancy No!no! 8800 Series, Hair Removal Device - Silver]]</li>
            <li> The manufacturers of this product should be prosecuted for false advertising.  Do not buy this product.  It does not remove hair in any effective manner no matter how long or consistently it is used.  I am sorry I bought it.  If the company was fair, they should refund the consumers money when asked.  They know they are selling an inferior product that does not do what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> At first I thought maybe I am doing it wrong, or my hair is fire-resistant! It took me about 2 hours to scrub one leg with NoNo, and the result was looking like 2 days-old stub, uneven. After wrestling with it for few weeks, I gave up and called the company. They sent me another device. That one worked faster, but the result was still not perfect, 1-day old stub, and not in the least reducing new hair growth.  I have to shave after NoNo every time. THEY HAVE TO PAY ME FOR THE TIME I INVESTED IN THIS CRAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not even try to remove facial hair with NoNo. If your face is flat like pancake, may then it would work.  But my face is 3D, and it just burned my face on curves, and skipped all hair completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe they still talk about this \\&quot;product\\&quot; on TV! All they say is a lie.</li>
            <li> TV commercial was so convincing. It looked so simple, easy and effective. Return policy sounded generous. What do I have to lose by trying it?&lt;br /&gt;Answer: time! Time to use (hours at a time for a small patch), time to talk to the reps to get a return authorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is nothing like it claims. First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing). When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming. I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result. To treat an area sized 2-3 inches you would need to spend several hours. It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway. The product claims that it will not grow back over time, but the hair does grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial. I was worried about getting my money back given how false the other claims were. It took some aggressive screaming over the phone to get them to give me a refund, but they never refunded the cost of shipping the No!no! unit back even though in their advertising they promise it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2) Did not work on all hair&lt;br /&gt;3) Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4) Hair grew back&lt;br /&gt;5) Return process was difficult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Commercial. (Sigh....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No! NO! NO! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! AND TIME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> Excellent!  It&#x27;s not often that a product lives up to the advertising hype surrounding it.  No! No!  delivers.  Simple and easy way to remove unwanted hair.  Pain free :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriends and he&#x27;s in love with his new toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this series because it&#x27;s cheaper but doesn&#x27;t come with all the stuff of tv advertisments</li>
            <li> this product is not effective and causes more and more hair growth and makes  it more thicker. was of my money.</li>
            <li> We are very disappointed with this &amp; would like to return it. Please tell us how to do this. thanks</li>
            <li> did not remove one single hair.</li>
            <li> I expected the Nono to get the hair off closer and for it to stay off longer.  But  after several attempts, I give up.  I will just go back to waxing.  The hair on my lip  is blonde and thin so there should be no excuses.</li>
            <li> I bought a No-No 8800 brand new in January 2013.  It broke in May 2013!  The whole device is reliance on a single rubber band that controls the thermicon tip head movement.  This rubber band came loose and now the device is useless.  I read numerous other complaints of the same issue - one would think they would make a change given the issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the manufacturer and they told me I had to call to speak to someone.  Clearly they don&#x27;t want to put in writing that their product is deficient and that they refuse to stand behind it.  I did call and they told me that they cannot replace it and when I asked about getting it fixed (even at my OWN expense) they said they will do nothing to help since it wasn&#x27;t bought with a warranty (i.e. through them or authorized seller directly).  I paid about $250 for a piece of junk held together by a rubber band..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
