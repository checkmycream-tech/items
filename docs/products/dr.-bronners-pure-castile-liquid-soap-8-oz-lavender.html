            <li>Very happy with this soap !</li>
            <li>Oh, and 1 drop is sufficient to wash your hands, very impressive stuff !</li>
            <li>KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!</li>
            <li>It gave an excellent scalp and oil treatment</li>
            <li>Using as a face wash was best b/c it toned out my combination skin on my face.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the best tasting but got the job done, could have been a lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>feels very good after using.</li>
            <li>It is a good soap for body or hands, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to see my online purchase was, in fact, a good deal.</li>
            <li>This is a great smelling castile soap.</li>
            <li>Great for a bedtime bath.</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>great, works great, and goes</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>The strongest point of this product is how good your skin feels after using it, and</li>
            <li>This is a good soap.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think this product is good for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using as a body wash - Loved it all the way around.</li>
            <li>Using on the body is also good.</li>
            <li>Good soap though even though it is kind of pricey...</li>
            <li>Its biodegradeable, so its the perfect soap, shampoo, laundry liquid &amp; dishwashing agent for travel or outdoors, and I hear you can even brush your teeth with it, but it tastes a bit funny to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>used it as laundry detergent as well when I ran out of that too, and worked fine, smelled great</li>
            <li>People raved that this cleared up their acne amazingly</li>
            <li>Great Product -- Smells good, feels great, lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li>The porduct is runny and light like scented water which I find somewhat charming.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and nice.</li>
            <li>but I know there are all natural ingredients in this product so all of it on your skin or even counters for cleaning are very good.</li>
            <li>There are too many better organic soaps out there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, most of the profits go to charities and benefit the planet, and I would rather spend my money and support a company who does good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is OK.</li>
            <li>but I love it as a body wash.</li>
            <li>I love dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps.  </li>
            <li>most users of the beauty blender say their sponges are marred with makeup stains.</li>
            <li>Love the size.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s now my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see all of the ingredients used are all natural.</li>
            <li>The foam is easy to be washed away ,I think it because no mineral oil</li>
            <li>the positive side, it does smell nice.</li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic</li>
            <li>always feel so fresh after using this soap!</li>
            <li>Love this, will definitely be buying more !  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel clean after using.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like it washes clean away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been making my own natural household cleaners this past year and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are wonderful.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li>CLEAN &amp; CRISP SOAP---NO RESIDUE FROM CHEMICALS.  </li>
            <li>LIGHT, PURE LAVENDAER ESSENCE.  </li>
            <li>so wanted something a bit more natural.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to ensure their skin is absolutely fresh and clean after they bathe or shower.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is wonderful and I feel great that it&#x27;s natural, but I hate this soap.  </li>
            <li>It is easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But for my specific acne type (very mild but obviously none would be nice)</li>
            <li>I bought this at a recommendation off makeupalley to clean my new beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more as the need arises.</li>
            <li>But still .... I had higher hopes.</li>
            <li>First, it does not lather, no matter how much you use or rub.  </li>
            <li>It has a bit of a funky hippy smell to it, and doesn&#x27;t lather really great, but when we&#x27;re trying to save water we soap up the kids with this soap and out they coming, smelling as sweet as any little freshly showered Dead Head.</li>
            <li>If it were a little more economical to just use for everything I probably would.</li>
            <li>very relaxing smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very efficient soap, as well.</li>
            <li>There are more ingredients in it than I expected but they are all that I was looking for in a wash product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using as a shampoo - I bought this for that reason</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, Dr. Bonner&#x27;s cleans better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THIS ORGANIC LIQUID SOAP &amp; MANY OF THE OTHER SCENTS/SELCETION</li>
            <li>I have very short hair, but like the squeaky clean feel I get on my head when using this product.</li>
            <li>It literally left my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It is too strong but kind of fake smelling.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such mild acne</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis, and this soap is mild enough that I can use it without skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Also very gentle on skin, definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Most other soaps I have used, feel like they have left a film, while Dr. Bonner&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It cuts through dirt and oils even better than Dawn dish soap which is what I usually reach for when my hands have some type of oily dirt on them.</li>
            <li>It does make my face feel really soft</li>
            <li>sometimes use it as a pre-cleaner, and finish off with a more common shampoo, like Herbal Essence, or if my scalp is flaking, Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>from natural ingredients, not harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it for a couple other basic cleaning jobs and it&#x27;s always worked fine.</li>
            <li>#34;suds up&amp;#34; as much as other soaps, it does well enough to be comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Only a few drops, can product rich foam and skin</li>
            <li>Though I do not really care for the smell too much.</li>
            <li>but I think my chest is actually more broken out after than before, but</li>
            <li>There is only castile oil and natural essential essence.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the natural oils on your body without stripping, so it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, and it last forever because you can dilute the liquid to about 1/4 and it will still do the trick.  </li>
            <li>Second, it is so liquid that you can&#x27;t really use it in a pump because when you pump it will spray out and make a mess.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the fact this soap does not have chemicals in it, I can double the amount by mixing it half and half with water, I wash my fruits and veggies in it(no soapy flavor), and you only need a few drops, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the smell-not artificial or overpowering.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as toothpaste when I ran out.</li>
            <li> to what this soap isn&#x27;t: its not soapy, it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or fake, it doesn&#x27;t lather well</li>
            <li> Service as described and as expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way,.and while it doesn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
            <li> I never tried the other options for Dr. Bonner, so perhaps it&#x27;s just lavendar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this product as well as the other scents available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went to a health store and found this product on the shelf and saw that I paid LESS online than in the store, shipping included.</li>
            <li> Dr Bronner makes completely natural soaps, no toxins, no synthetic agents, no carcinogenic lathering additives (probably why it doesn&#x27;t lather like you might be accustomed to with other fake soaps)  </li>
            <li> I would just wash, then rinse immediately after, but still felt the burn even if for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> However, I started using it on my hair and the residue is hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> LUV IT FOR THOSE SOOTHING RELAIXING BATHS &amp; SHOWERS WHEN MY WORK OUTS ARE TOUGH!  </li>
            <li> I use them for a base in some of the skin care products that I make.  </li>

            <li> The fragrance is wonderful and I feel great that it&#x27;s natural, but I hate this soap.  First, it does not lather, no matter how much you use or rub.  Second, it is so liquid that you can&#x27;t really use it in a pump because when you pump it will spray out and make a mess. I just don&#x27;t feel clean after using.  There are too many better organic soaps out there.  I never tried the other options for Dr. Bonner, so perhaps it&#x27;s just lavendar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it does smell nice.</li>
            <li> People raved that this cleared up their acne amazingly but I didn&#x27;t have such luck with this soap. It does make my face feel really soft but I think my chest is actually more broken out after than before, but it&#x27;s such mild acne it&#x27;s hard to tell. It is a good soap for body or hands, and smells wonderful. But for my specific acne type (very mild but obviously none would be nice) it didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li> Dr Bronner makes completely natural soaps, no toxins, no synthetic agents, no carcinogenic lathering additives (probably why it doesn&#x27;t lather like you might be accustomed to with other fake soaps)  There is only castile oil and natural essential essence.  It leaves the natural oils on your body without stripping, so it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, and it last forever because you can dilute the liquid to about 1/4 and it will still do the trick.  Its biodegradeable, so its the perfect soap, shampoo, laundry liquid &amp; dishwashing agent for travel or outdoors, and I hear you can even brush your teeth with it, but it tastes a bit funny to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to what this soap isn&#x27;t: its not soapy, it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or fake, it doesn&#x27;t lather well, it can leak, it doesn&#x27;t work on a loofah, its heavier to carry than a bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, most of the profits go to charities and benefit the planet, and I would rather spend my money and support a company who does good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this soap and nothing else.</li>
            <li> very relaxing smell. always feel so fresh after using this soap!</li>
            <li> This stuff is OK. We got it because we&#x27;re trying to use our graywater for the garden so wanted something a bit more natural. It has a bit of a funky hippy smell to it, and doesn&#x27;t lather really great, but when we&#x27;re trying to save water we soap up the kids with this soap and out they coming, smelling as sweet as any little freshly showered Dead Head.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! However, I started using it on my hair and the residue is hard to wash out. I can tell it is not meant for hair but I love it as a body wash.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling castile soap. It is easy on sensitive skin. The smell is strong and nice. Great for a bedtime bath.</li>
            <li> I have very short hair, but like the squeaky clean feel I get on my head when using this product. I also use it as a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes use it as a pre-cleaner, and finish off with a more common shampoo, like Herbal Essence, or if my scalp is flaking, Head and Shoulders. Without a doubt, Dr. Bonner&#x27;s cleans better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very efficient soap, as well. A little goes a long way,.and while it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; as much as other soaps, it does well enough to be comfortable to use. The strongest point of this product is how good your skin feels after using it, and how &amp;#34;clean&#x27; you feel. Most other soaps I have used, feel like they have left a film, while Dr. Bonner&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps.  I use them for a base in some of the skin care products that I make.  The lavender fragrance smells just like the flowers!</li>
            <li> This is a good soap. It literally left my skin squeaky clean. However, ladies, it does burn profusely if you wash your downstairs (private part) with it. I would just wash, then rinse immediately after, but still felt the burn even if for a few seconds. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to ensure their skin is absolutely fresh and clean after they bathe or shower.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this soap ! It cuts through dirt and oils even better than Dawn dish soap which is what I usually reach for when my hands have some type of oily dirt on them. Now I grab this because it leaves my hands feeling cleaner than anything else !  Love this, will definitely be buying more !  It also smells fantastic (I bought the Lavender). Oh, and 1 drop is sufficient to wash your hands, very impressive stuff !</li>
            <li> It worked as it is suppose to. I realize now that I don&#x27;t like lavender. I also dont like the texture, but as I said in another review, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> LUV IT FOR THOSE SOOTHING RELAIXING BATHS &amp; SHOWERS WHEN MY WORK OUTS ARE TOUGH!  LIGHT, PURE LAVENDAER ESSENCE.  CLEAN &amp; CRISP SOAP---NO RESIDUE FROM CHEMICALS.  LUV THIS ORGANIC LIQUID SOAP &amp; MANY OF THE OTHER SCENTS/SELCETION THAT DR BONNER PRODUCES.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own natural household cleaners this past year and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are wonderful. They are&lt;br /&gt;made from natural ingredients, not harsh chemicals.  I recently found that our local health food store is now carrying&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps and I will definitely purchase more as the need arises.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a recommendation off makeupalley to clean my new beauty blender. The porduct is runny and light like scented water which I find somewhat charming. Smells great (I bought lavender scent) but there was still makeup on the sponge, supposedly this isn&#x27;t the soaps fault - most users of the beauty blender say their sponges are marred with makeup stains. But still .... I had higher hopes.</li>
            <li> Love the smell-not artificial or overpowering. Love the size. I would buy this again from this seller. Service as described and as expected.</li>
            <li> Great Product -- Smells good, feels great, lasts a LONG time. Also very gentle on skin, definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see all of the ingredients used are all natural. There are more ingredients in it than I expected but they are all that I was looking for in a wash product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using as a shampoo - I bought this for that reason but I don&#x27;t think this product is good for it. Maybe use the spearmint over lavender. It gave an excellent scalp and oil treatment but I ultimately had to wash with regular shampoo to get all of the oil out. Would only use this once a week or month for hair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using as a body wash - Loved it all the way around. Using as a face wash was best b/c it toned out my combination skin on my face. I didn&#x27;t think I would like using it on my face but that&#x27;s now my favorite. Using on the body is also good. It&#x27;s not over drying so you can skip the lotion afterwards. And it doesn&#x27;t leave oily skin feeling oily or dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like it washes clean away but I know there are all natural ingredients in this product so all of it on your skin or even counters for cleaning are very good. I was hoping for a stronger lavender scent but that scent lingers on your skin after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product as well as the other scents available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I went to a health store and found this product on the shelf and saw that I paid LESS online than in the store, shipping included. I was very happy to see my online purchase was, in fact, a good deal.</li>
            <li> I alternate between lavender and peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, works great, and goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as toothpaste when I ran out. It wasn&#x27;t the best tasting but got the job done, could have been a lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it as laundry detergent as well when I ran out of that too, and worked fine, smelled great (during the wash, I did not notice lavender smelling clothes later on, but then again I don&#x27;t have the worlds strongest sense of smell) and didn&#x27;t leave any spots or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it for a couple other basic cleaning jobs and it&#x27;s always worked fine. If it were a little more economical to just use for everything I probably would.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis, and this soap is mild enough that I can use it without skin irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!  Only a few drops, can product rich foam and skin feels very good after using. The foam is easy to be washed away ,I think it because no mineral oil</li>
            <li> I like this. Though I do not really care for the smell too much. It is too strong but kind of fake smelling. Good soap though even though it is kind of pricey...</li>
            <li> I love the fact this soap does not have chemicals in it, I can double the amount by mixing it half and half with water, I wash my fruits and veggies in it(no soapy flavor), and you only need a few drops, so it lasts a long time. This is a product I keep buying.</li>
