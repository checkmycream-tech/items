            <li>The smell is not that good</li>
            <li>Worked great with my own body chemistry and perfume.</li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using a dab on its own and could not handle that as well.</li>
            <li>I have had so many people tell me that i smell nice when i wear this</li>
            <li>I am a pretty attractive girl</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a sexy perfume.</li>
            <li>I like the product, however, I do which there were more instructions on how to use it.  </li>
            <li>I even notice that I&#x27;m more spunky when I use it.</li>
            <li>I do get more attention wearing it.</li>
            <li>Item is perfect and as expected.</li>
            <li>No bad smells!</li>

            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in how men react to me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>, I believe he was not smelling my own natural scent anymore</li>
            <li>all it really managed to do was to attract insects more, when using this product becareful not to use around bees</li>
            <li>I have a health condition which may have been compromising my body&#x27;s own natural production of these compounds.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten more attention from the object of my desires than ever before, thanks.</li>
            <li>This really works!!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been getting into using essential oils and making my own perfumes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other perfumes with pheromones mixed in, loved them, and honestly swear I can tell a difference in the amount of attention I gain from men when wearing pheromones</li>
            <li>Pheromones are just one kind of the many different things that affect human exchange, along with physical appearance, attitude, economics, personal charm, politics, and many more.  </li>
            <li>OK so I have tried this product on several occasions and have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>first time I tried it</li>
            <li>Could really work!</li>
            <li>I felt like a hot mama again.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a good clinical trial that I can present, but all I can say is that no one has said, \\&quot;What is that stink?\\&quot; Other than that, it does seem people react better to me, but how much of that is real</li>
            <li>Well, he actually said he liked the way I smelled and was extremely aroused.</li>
            <li>This product was not totally honest with their description, no it did not increase attraction from spouse but managed to increase attraction from insects and some men that were strangers and their attraction was not desired, Pherone Formula W-1 does not have a scent like other brands and so is not detected easily as being a pheromone it does however increase the scent of your favorite perfume and will increase the scents staying power much longer than perfume normally last, much like wearing perfume on top of vaseline to hold it staying power longer, it did however make my spouse a little more interested in me as if we had just met and I have been married for thirty years but wore off after so many applications, this is what I originally purchased it for to increase his interest in me at the time</li>
            <li>I just thought why not,see if I could get a little more attention at home and dang!</li>
            <li>I was really sceptical at first because I didn&#x27;t have much experience with pheromones, but it has made me a believer.  </li>
            <li>It certainly does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>It might help as a booster from time to time but not ongoing as they get use to the scent like they do your own scent, it&#x27;s only good to peak his interest with this method only ocassionally no more than that.to the scent like they do your own scent, it&#x27;s only good to peak his interest with this method only ocassionally no more than that.</li>
            <li>so I get looks regardless and this doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>So much so that men are nicer to me wherever I go...</li>
            <li>And from what I hear, the Pherones really smells nice.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Now I know for sure what the problem was, because while using this product and replacing those natural chemicals, things are back to normal.    </li>
            <li>I almost felt sorry for the men who could not resist the attractive qualities of nature scents that it contains.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price to get that old spark back</li>
            <li>far, the company has been helpful, but we shall see</li>
            <li>The company.quickly processed my order, and I was happily surprised how soon it arrived at my door.</li>
            <li>It gives me an extra edge and it draws men to me more than usual.</li>
            <li>Everything went back to normal when I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>my husband has kept his attention alive and it&#x27;s like dating again so in that respect it did help but don&#x27;t expect big changes or miracles</li>

            <li> OK so I have tried this product on several occasions and have not noticed any difference. It has a horrible urine smell. I mainly bought it to drive my current bf crazy for me every now and then but it seems to have the opposite effect on him!!! I also haven&#x27;t seen any changes in other people. I am a pretty attractive girl so I get looks regardless and this doesn&#x27;t do much for me. Will not be wasting my money on this ever again.</li>
            <li> This product has worked well for me.  It certainly does what it says it does.  I was really sceptical at first because I didn&#x27;t have much experience with pheromones, but it has made me a believer.  It is not a magic potion or anything like that, it simply enhances whats already there.  It gives me an extra edge and it draws men to me more than usual. After that, the rest is a peice of cake.</li>
            <li> This product was not totally honest with their description, no it did not increase attraction from spouse but managed to increase attraction from insects and some men that were strangers and their attraction was not desired, Pherone Formula W-1 does not have a scent like other brands and so is not detected easily as being a pheromone it does however increase the scent of your favorite perfume and will increase the scents staying power much longer than perfume normally last, much like wearing perfume on top of vaseline to hold it staying power longer, it did however make my spouse a little more interested in me as if we had just met and I have been married for thirty years but wore off after so many applications, this is what I originally purchased it for to increase his interest in me at the time, I believe he was not smelling my own natural scent anymore so this is why I purchased this product to help enhance my own which it did not really provide, so I am was not very happy with purchase and this is why I only rated it three stars, all it really managed to do was to attract insects more, when using this product becareful not to use around bees they were attracted to it and I found myself running from the bees and only provided a few days of interest from my husband, I would not really recommend you waste your money on this product and instead find other ways to interest your mate or boyfriend, one thing that does get their attention is a sense of humor and if your man likes blondes that would be something a little extra to add is blonde hair color to increase their attention if you think you are getting less attention, after I used up all the liquid I find my husband has kept his attention alive and it&#x27;s like dating again so in that respect it did help but don&#x27;t expect big changes or miracles, it won&#x27;t happen as much as you wanted but will only help a small amount of his interest in you.

            <li> [[ASIN:B0002UFC56 Pherone Formula W-1 Pheromone Cologne for Women to Attract Men, with Human Copulins and 4mg of Human Pheromones]]    Product DOES NOT WORK!!</li>
            <li> Ladies,  This just does not work, I used it for a couple of weeks, and if anything, it did the opposite of what it was supposed to do and I got less attention that before.  Everything went back to normal when I stopped using it.  Save your money and buy a sexy perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know if this really works, but it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting. I will keep using it and see. There really isn&#x27;t a good clinical trial that I can present, but all I can say is that no one has said, \\&quot;What is that stink?\\&quot; Other than that, it does seem people react better to me, but how much of that is real I just can&#x27;t quantify.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and works!! ;D I have had so many people tell me that i smell nice when i wear this</li>
            <li> The smell is not that good but the results are just GREAT!! This really works!! I loved it!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I like the product, however, I do which there were more instructions on how to use it.  I purchased it for incorporating this product into my soy candles.  I&#x27;ve yet to establish the percentage I should use.&lt;br /&gt;~anita</li>
            <li> I have a health condition which may have been compromising my body&#x27;s own natural production of these compounds.  I have been wondering for awhile what was wrong, because my social interactions have been noticeably different.    Now I know for sure what the problem was, because while using this product and replacing those natural chemicals, things are back to normal.    Pheromones are just one kind of the many different things that affect human exchange, along with physical appearance, attitude, economics, personal charm, politics, and many more.  So of course, there&#x27;s things that they cannot do, and things that they cannot fix.    For me, this was just the thing.</li>
            <li> OMG! I don&#x27;t know if it was bc we hadn&#x27;t seen each other in a while or it was the phenomenons but he&#x27;s never been like that before. I&#x27;ve never felt so attractive in my life!!! Thank u!</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money. Tried it just for kicks and see if stuff like this actually worked but as i figured, it didnt.  Dont waste the money!</li>
            <li> Garbage - Arrived damaged - be wary.  Such a hassle to return this or I would.  Bottle lid broken, contents leaked out.  Garbage - be wary.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of trying to return this product.  It made me smell like I had TERRIBLE body odor, and did not do as it claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the company has been helpful, but we shall see</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Im not a fan, It smells more like a repellent than an attractant</li>
            <li> This product has exceeded any expectations I had when I purchased it. I almost felt sorry for the men who could not resist the attractive qualities of nature scents that it contains. I have gotten more attention from the object of my desires than ever before, thanks. The company.quickly processed my order, and I was happily surprised how soon it arrived at my door.</li>
            <li> great product, and very happy with purchase. Item is perfect and as expected. thank you</li>
            <li> I have tried it several time and I have no result. I&#x27;m still waiting because I know that one day might work</li>
            <li> it was a present for a beautiful woman,she does&#x27;t like it it not work even on a beautiful people ,not to say about</li>
            <li> This really works! I&#x27;ve been using it for maybe a year now. I have noticed a huge difference in how men react to me.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it I wore it under a perfume which my then boyfriend didn&#x27;t like. In fact, he has expressed his dislike for&lt;br /&gt;it several times. Well, he actually said he liked the way I smelled and was extremely aroused. I was SOLD! hahaha&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how men respond when I&#x27;m wearing it...I wont leave home without it...</li>
            <li> Have no idea if it works,  Guys always Flirt with Me. No extra attention.</li>
            <li> It smell like I covered myself in urine.</li>
            <li> This product did not work and actually smelled VERY BAD... I even initiated an experiment with a few of my friends and it did not work for them either... We are not unattractive females either...</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference when I wear this.  So much so that men are nicer to me wherever I go...I even notice that I&#x27;m more spunky when I use it.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, it was well packed but the bottle itself leaked a little.  The results well was not able to measure if it makes any difference,</li>
            <li> You only have a few drops so the product lasts a long time. I think is very effective and don´t have smell you can use with your perfums.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. And from what I hear, the Pherones really smells nice.&lt;br /&gt; This product is recommended for any women who is looking to grab any man&#x27;s attention!&lt;br /&gt; My mom is delighted with her purchase!</li>
            <li> Had to return. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying! &amp;#34;Yuck! Smells like cat pee and anal glands&amp;#34; but once you cover it with your perfume voila! No bad smells! I do get more attention wearing it. My husband was overly loving and kept telling me &amp;#34;I am beautiful&amp;#34; I&#x27;d say give it a shot! Could really work!</li>
            <li> I just thought why not,see if I could get a little more attention at home and dang! I felt like a hot mama again.Worked great with my own body chemistry and perfume. Well worth the price to get that old spark back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other perfumes with pheromones mixed in, loved them, and honestly swear I can tell a difference in the amount of attention I gain from men when wearing pheromones and when I&#x27;m not. . However, I&#x27;ve been getting into using essential oils and making my own perfumes. I wanted to add the pheromones to the mix. Mind you these are mixed daily and applied daily. The scents always turn out, but when I mix in this product immediately it stinks. It stinks on it&#x27;s own. I&#x27;ve tried using a dab on its own and could not handle that as well.This product didn&#x27;t attract anyone because it stunk so bad I wouldn&#x27;t wear it out of the house and had to shower it off.</li>
