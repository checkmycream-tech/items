            <li>Good taste, and I love the dispenser.  </li>
            <li>It also does a nice job on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Recieved all good great service thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;The included toothpastes in the variant are refreshing, and we would choose them on their own.</li>
            <li>This was a great price and was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>with Amazon we are able to get exactly what we need and at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I just love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I try to go fluoride free, but darn it!</li>
            <li>favorite is the pump design.</li>
            <li>Using it for many years</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s&#x27; favorite tooth paste and dispenser.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the teeth nice and tator free.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s refreshing and the taste is pleasing.</li>
            <li>Glad I can still purchase this product!&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>Love the pump design.  </li>
            <li>Favorite Toothpaste...</li>
            <li>Love this pump.</li>
            <li>I love Mentadent.</li>
            <li>We have used it for years and are most grateful Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li>I had to buy more of the product to get the dispenser online.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love mentadent toothpast for the container as well as the product.  </li>
            <li>Methadent is my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love this tooth paste.</li>
            <li>so enjoying my Mentadent, looked everywhere for it..</li>
            <li>They claim the flavor to be Refreshing Mint, but I couldn&#x27;t taste the lightest bit of mint.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on switching up my tooth paste any more.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t just purchase the refills.</li>
            <li>Glad we found it here and will be using it as often as needed.</li>
            <li>Great Item, recommend highly.</li>
            <li>excellent...feeling very clean</li>
            <li>Keeping my teeth and smile nice and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dispensing is easy, and our days of dealing with how/when to roll the toothpaste tube are over.</li>
            <li>But the toothpaste not only tastes great and cleans and whitens, as most toothpastes do, but I found that it has an added benefit.  </li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>The advanced whitening formula is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>The taste and cleaning benefits are also fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser system is easy and clean to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately Amazon comes through, and it is always available through them.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, my husband can continue to use it, so not a bad purchase for him.</li>
            <li>Great for stroke patient who is partially paralyzed.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>We love this product and when we could no longer buy this in the department stores or other place, we were so pleased to find it available at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste and HAVE to HAVE IT!!  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a happy camper now after being without Mentadent for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Although we each have our own as she likes to keep the cap open</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t seem to get a lot for for your money, and you waste quite a bit of toothpaste trying to get a perfect ratio of blue to white(especially in the beginning).</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Never fails.  </li>
            <li>I had had to quit using it, just brushing my teeth with hot water.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much all one can expect, no?</li>
            <li>left with a fresh, clean mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this tooth paste to help me prevent further gum disease because of the hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes great, gums are less tender</li>
            <li>The dispenser has a much neater appearance than rolled tubes also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its toothpaste - how much can one say...  </li>
            <li>Much neater than tubes.</li>
            <li>really like this brand of toothpaste</li>
            <li>Thanks goodness for Amazon...</li>
            <li>I love not having to mess with a toothpaste tube.</li>
            <li>I was attracted to this toothpaste when searching for a new one online because it didn&#x27;t have triclosan in it and people seemed to like the taste(big factor for me).</li>
            <li>Like I have with other products that are no longer available locally or our priced too high.</li>
            <li>great toothpaste however difficult to find on the market in different stores</li>
            <li>My lips were swollen, I had a rash in my mouth, and I lost my sense of taste for nearly 6 months.  </li>
            <li>As far cleaning your teeth, this toothpaste works as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes the pump starts shooting one side out than the other, it is because you are applying more pressure to one side than the other.  </li>
            <li>By the time we arrived home a month later after a two week Holland America Panama Canal cruise from San Diego to Ft. Lauderdale and then a nearly two week stay at Walt Disney World, I was having severe problems with my tongue, mouth, and lips.</li>
            <li>Since there&#x27;s a good amount of play when depressing the pump</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only toothpaste I have used in the past 20 years but recently started using fluoride free.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you will hit an air bubble and end up wasting that much of the other side of the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend it after trying several other brands and returning to Mentadent..</li>

            <li> highly recommend it after trying several other brands and returning to Mentadent..</li>
            <li> Just the same old gooey tubes we&#x27;ve been using since the dark ages.</li>
            <li> Not as tasty as my usual brand, but a whole lot neater on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The product both whitens teeth, and freshens breath for a long period.  </li>
            <li> If a toothpaste cannot give you fresh breath for at least the next few minutes, then what&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li> My Mouth would always seemed to feel strange, like stuff never rinsed out correctly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single sore in years</li>
            <li> I love Mentadent, and at times it become impossible to find.  </li>
            <li> and I closed</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste and we needed a new base and we were not able to locate one from any store.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a loss in whiteness due to the change :</li>
            <li> Mentadent dispensers are not stocked everywhere (perhaps due to display space?); in our house we stock up when they are available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other toothpastes that have peroxide in them don&#x27;t do this as well.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for delivering well before the due date.</li>
            <li> How can you hold a toothbrush in one hand and squeeze a tube with the other.  </li>
            <li> I am able to get refills on the military base, but I can&#x27;t find any place that sells the bottom part.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find in regular stores.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found out last week that my dentist recommends that I NOT use Mentadent as my teeth and gums are super-duper sensitive and this toothpaste is too harsh and is part of the problem</li>
            <li> This is a really good tasting toothpaste and one of the few brands that I do not find to be disgusting.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just in my area, or maybe the packaging makes too much waste.  </li>
            <li> Within a few minutes of brushing my teeth with this, any freshness I may have felt was gone.</li>
            <li> This new base will hopefully last a while.</li>
            <li> No more squeezing a tube or figuring out where to store it.</li>
            <li> The store I usually bought this from discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week after reading all the positive reviews, but have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Mentadent is so hard to find on the shelf in drug or grocery stores.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> is hard to find on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I have occasional cancre sores which are painful and last at least a week, making eating painful.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive, but it keeps me out of the dentist chair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two-part plastic containers (refill with toothpaste and base) are recyclable, so I don&#x27;t have major concerns about the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is difficult to find in some stores here</li>
            <li> Mentadent has become difficult to find in drugstores or chains in our area.  </li>
            <li> It can be difficult to locate in the stores at times but</li>
            <li> For some reason, it is difficult to find now.</li>
            <li> Walmart and CVS do not appear to carry this any longer because it is an expensive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to find in Florida.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid Mentadent will disappear from the market.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is practically tasteless.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find in drugstores.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it came with the base.</li>

            <li> Item as described.  This is difficult to find in some stores here</li>
            <li> a great mentadent produce!</li>
            <li> I just love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I try to go fluoride free, but darn it! Mentadent is just so good!!! It&#x27;s the only toothpaste I have used in the past 20 years but recently started using fluoride free. I have noticed a loss in whiteness due to the change :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the pump design. I wish they didn&#x27;t own the patent for that apparatus since it&#x27;s a great way to apply your toothpaste and also keep it on the counter top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 20 years. I miss the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Using it for many years</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this toothpaste in the stores it seems these days, so when I found that I could order from Amazon, we were very pleased.  Unfortunately, I found out last week that my dentist recommends that I NOT use Mentadent as my teeth and gums are super-duper sensitive and this toothpaste is too harsh and is part of the problem (we&#x27;ve used it for years)!!.  BUMMER!!!  Fortunately, my husband can continue to use it, so not a bad purchase for him.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever!</li>
            <li> I like the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;The taste is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Your left with a fresh, clean mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great Item, recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Great for my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste and we needed a new base and we were not able to locate one from any store. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s&#x27; favorite tooth paste and dispenser.  She&#x27;s a happy camper now after being without Mentadent for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Keeps the teeth nice and tator free. My dentist says I have no build up (even after two years) it must be the great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This was a great price and was exactly what I wanted.  The local grocery stores and drug stores in my area stopped carrying the product so I went on line and found it at Amazon Like I have with other products that are no longer available locally or our priced too high.</li>
            <li> We love this product and when we could no longer buy this in the department stores or other place, we were so pleased to find it available at Amazon.  we hope Mentadent stay in business ... it&#x27;s refreshing and the taste is pleasing.</li>
            <li> Glad I can still purchase this product!&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for about 20 years.</li>
            <li> Awesome utility.  Love the pump design.  The taste and cleaning benefits are also fantastic.  Keeping my teeth and smile nice and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the pump starts shooting one side out than the other, it is because you are applying more pressure to one side than the other.  Just a tip.</li>
            <li> Mentadent dispensers are not stocked everywhere (perhaps due to display space?); in our house we stock up when they are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-part plastic containers (refill with toothpaste and base) are recyclable, so I don&#x27;t have major concerns about the packaging. Dispensing is easy, and our days of dealing with how/when to roll the toothpaste tube are over. The dispenser has a much neater appearance than rolled tubes also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included toothpastes in the variant are refreshing, and we would choose them on their own. The improved packaging and dispensing is a plus.</li>
            <li> best toothpaste I&#x27;ve studied.</li>
            <li> Favorite Toothpaste...</li>
            <li> Like the toothpase and its dispenser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Mentadent is so hard to find on the shelf in drug or grocery stores.  Maybe it&#x27;s just in my area, or maybe the packaging makes too much waste.  But the toothpaste not only tastes great and cleans and whitens, as most toothpastes do, but I found that it has an added benefit.  I have occasional cancre sores which are painful and last at least a week, making eating painful.  By brushing daily with Mentadent, if I feel one coming on, I just give the toothpaste an extra couple of swishes on the spot and it never actually develops into a sore.  Other toothpastes that have peroxide in them don&#x27;t do this as well.  I haven&#x27;t had a single sore in years and I&#x27;m afraid Mentadent will disappear from the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Love this pump. No more squeezing a tube or figuring out where to store it. Great flavor and whitening too.</li>
            <li> Awesome item, great price, excellent and rapid delivery&lt;br /&gt;Great value&lt;br /&gt;Would recomend it and I will purchase again in the  future</li>
            <li> So much better than tubes!</li>
            <li> I love Mentadent. I don&#x27;t know why the stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. I love not having to mess with a toothpaste tube.</li>
            <li> Mentadent has become difficult to find in drugstores or chains in our area.  We have used it for years and are most grateful Amazon sells it. The advanced whitening formula is gentle, yet effective. The dispenser system is easy and clean to use.&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend it after trying several other brands and returning to Mentadent..</li>
            <li> Only brand I&#x27;ll use, although there are similar compounds out there now, they don&#x27;t have the neat dispenser. Just the same old gooey tubes we&#x27;ve been using since the dark ages.</li>
            <li> Its toothpaste - how much can one say...  Good taste, and I love the dispenser.  Much neater than tubes.</li>
            <li> really like this brand of toothpaste</li>
            <li> I was attracted to this toothpaste when searching for a new one online because it didn&#x27;t have triclosan in it and people seemed to like the taste(big factor for me). I haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening effects, but it does taste good. The only flaw for me is the packaging. You don&#x27;t seem to get a lot for for your money, and you waste quite a bit of toothpaste trying to get a perfect ratio of blue to white(especially in the beginning). Since there&#x27;s a good amount of play when depressing the pump you don&#x27;t always get the same amount of each color. Then there&#x27;s the bubbles. Sometimes you will hit an air bubble and end up wasting that much of the other side of the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After experiencing this product I think I will not but this again and find something else.</li>
            <li> Finally it has arrived, been searching for this forever. Taste just as I remember, looking forward to continue ordering.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product both whitens teeth, and freshens breath for a long period.  It does what it claims it&#x27;s supposed to do very effectively</li>
            <li> Great product but can no longer find the dispenser in stores. I had to buy more of the product to get the dispenser online.</li>
            <li> Great deal and the best dentist-recommended toothpaste.  Will buy again when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> Loved it for years and years!</li>
            <li> Like the way it cleans</li>
            <li> ALL RCVD AS ADVERTISED</li>
            <li> What can I say about toothpaste?</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste! Thank you for delivering well before the due date.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love mentadent toothpast for the container as well as the product.  Although we each have our own as she likes to keep the cap open and I closed we are both fans.  It can be difficult to locate in the stores at times but with Amazon we are able to get exactly what we need and at a great price.  Pluse Amazon Prime Rocks!</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised, just one day after.</li>
            <li> Methadent is my favorite toothpaste. For some reason, it is difficult to find now. I am able to get refills on the military base, but I can&#x27;t find any place that sells the bottom part. This is a really good tasting toothpaste and one of the few brands that I do not find to be disgusting. This new base will hopefully last a while.</li>
            <li> Best on the market. easy to use &amp; I will buy again. Try it, you will like it.  I did.</li>
            <li> excellent...feeling very clean</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Never fails.  We&#x27;ll be using this supplier again</li>
            <li> I love Mentadent, and at times it become impossible to find.  Fortunately Amazon comes through, and it is always available through them.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste and HAVE to HAVE IT!!  It is so hard to find in regular stores.  In 2011, I forgot to pack it for our vacation.  When we arrived in Southern California, our cousin took us to store after store and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. So, I bought another brand with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda.  By the time we arrived home a month later after a two week Holland America Panama Canal cruise from San Diego to Ft. Lauderdale and then a nearly two week stay at Walt Disney World, I was having severe problems with my tongue, mouth, and lips. I had had to quit using it, just brushing my teeth with hot water. My lips were swollen, I had a rash in my mouth, and I lost my sense of taste for nearly 6 months.  The mouth rash and the swollen lips cleared up the minute I got home and started using my Mentadent again. My sense of taste finally came back. I&#x27;m so happy that I have found it on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Great for stroke patient who is partially paralyzed.  How can you hold a toothbrush in one hand and squeeze a tube with the other.  Not easy.&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is very good and the applicator is great</li>
            <li> I like that it sits on the counter and you can close it and it looks good even leaving it out.  It also does a nice job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> so enjoying my Mentadent, looked everywhere for it..Thanks goodness for Amazon...</li>
            <li> great toothpaste however difficult to find on the market in different stores sometimescleans well makes the tooth surface enamel very smooth and my dentist says it is doing a good job on preventing might cavities from appearing</li>
            <li> Wonderful toothpaste. Very difficult to find in drugstores. Walmart and CVS do not appear to carry this any longer because it is an expensive toothpaste. This is the only toothpaste my husband will use. He likes the pump and the taste of the paste. That&#x27;s pretty much all one can expect, no?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week after reading all the positive reviews, but have been disappointed. As far cleaning your teeth, this toothpaste works as advertised. The multi-action formula definitely cleans your teeth well. However, it does nothing for your breath. They claim the flavor to be Refreshing Mint, but I couldn&#x27;t taste the lightest bit of mint. The toothpaste is practically tasteless. Within a few minutes of brushing my teeth with this, any freshness I may have felt was gone. If a toothpaste cannot give you fresh breath for at least the next few minutes, then what&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li> Been buying for years. Hard to find. A little expensive, but it keeps me out of the dentist chair. I just cant find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I recently didn&#x27;t like the colgate total care tooth paste I was using. My Mouth would always seemed to feel strange, like stuff never rinsed out correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mentadent works well. My mouth feels is clean and fresh. I don&#x27;t plan on switching up my tooth paste any more. I couldn&#x27;t find this in any stores so amazon it is! I bought this one because it came with the base. Make sure you don&#x27;t just purchase the refills.</li>
            <li> Recieved all good great service thanks</li>
            <li> Not as tasty as my usual brand, but a whole lot neater on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The store I usually bought this from discontinued. Would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE! Been using since 1993. I have never had a cavity since then.&lt;br /&gt;This is hard to find on the shelf. For a couple years now I&#x27;ve been buying it in Amazon.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this tooth paste to help me prevent further gum disease because of the hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes great, gums are less tender</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to find in Florida. Glad we found it here and will be using it as often as needed.</li>
