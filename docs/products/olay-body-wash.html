            <li> My skin is super dry, even worse as the days get colder; and this wash is a big help in my moisturizing routine.</li>

            <li> just disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t more like coconut.</li>
            <li> This is nothing at all like the thick, creamy consistency that this brand is known for.</li>
            <li> Not too fragrant and too thin and runny for my taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin when it comes out</li>

            <li> My favorite new body wash! Smells AMAZING, does not overdry, and you feel extremely clean and moisturized. Perfect for a guy or girl.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the coconut smell nor the softness of OLay.</li>
            <li> I really like the Shea butter that olay makes. This is nothing at all like the thick, creamy consistency that this brand is known for. It is very runny, and I hardly smelled the coconut. I&#x27;m mad I purchased more than one bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy this Olay body wash is now available on Amazon!  Wish it was in stock more, but a little bit definitely lasts the entire shower. This wash is creamy and suds up like a dream. The scent is light, and isn&#x27;t at all cloying like others (absolutely no Olay moisturizer smell). My skin is super dry, even worse as the days get colder; and this wash is a big help in my moisturizing routine. Hopefully Amazon will keep this in stock more regularly, and keep the price on par with other retailers. :)</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated</li>
            <li> This body wash is great - smells good and leaves me feeling clean and fresh. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay products - great moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Not too fragrant and too thin and runny for my taste.</li>
            <li> I change shampoo, conditioner and soaps every 3 months! For soaps I keep Play, Dove, Axe and Nivea in stock at my house all the time!</li>
            <li> It has a mild coconut fragrance and it is creamy.</li>
            <li> Very moisturing and has a pleasant mild scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Olay girl and this one smells delightful!! I purchased two as an add-on for $2 and change/per.</li>
            <li> Great scent!  Creamy.</li>
            <li> Smells great...you&#x27;ll have to fight them off :)</li>
            <li> regular olay bodywash</li>
            <li> Loved product, very timely delivery. Great product for dry skin suffers.</li>
            <li> Bought for grand daughter and she really like it. Loved fragrance and how her skin feels after shower.</li>
            <li> I love both the scent and the texture of this body wash. It is creamy and moisturizing, with a wonderful coconut fragrance. I also use it as a bubble bath, since it foams up so well. Great product.</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of coconut, this body wash is great!  Lathers well, rinses clean, and leaves your skin smelling great.</li>
            <li> Arrived damaged and leaking.</li>
            <li> gave me a rash! i had to give it away. nice smell, but a little strong.</li>
            <li> The body wash lathers very well however I found it had more of a fruity scent than a coconut scent but the scent is still great just disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t more like coconut.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash. Not only does it smell good, but it goes on smooth and makes my skin feel silky. A must have for females who use body wash instead of soap.</li>
            <li> I wanted to LOVE this. It is a great price and a really great smell. But, it doesn&#x27;t really lather up. It&#x27;s very thin when it comes out and I find that I have to add more to my loofah mid-way though the shower.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING OF OLAY I LIKE. SMELLS GOOD.</li>
