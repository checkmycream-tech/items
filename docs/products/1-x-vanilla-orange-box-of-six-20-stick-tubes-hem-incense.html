            <li>its great</li>

            <li>This item is good</li>
            <li>This incense smells so good.  </li>
            <li>It was a surprising how good those two scents go together.</li>
            <li>Wonderful unique aroma.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Even my kids liked this sent.</li>
            <li>I did feel even though this was nice...</li>
            <li>You kind of need to try them for yourself....</li>
            <li>I also know of a number of people who love this scent (which is good because I had someone to give it to).  </li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t as strong as some of the others but there is a nice pleasant scent to them and for the price</li>
            <li>but I also bought the india temple incense and that one by far is the best!</li>
            <li>SWEET ORANGE AND CINNAMON VANILLA SCENT THAT IS PLEASANT TO THE NOSE.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer stated, it smells better when you burn it.</li>
            <li>It smells alright in the box, but better when it&#x27;s lit.</li>
            <li>I did notice however, that it has more of an orange scent than vanilla.</li>
            <li>You would think with that title, it would have more of a vanilla scent, and the orange would be more like an &#x27;undertone&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I did use all of them , however raspberry, coconut, vanilla, seem to suit me better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sure some of you would love the Orange-vanilla.</li>
            <li>as I find some I love that others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure you will too.</li>
            <li>and i love the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be giving it to someone else who may appreciate it more.</li>
            <li>Way better than any plugin or candle.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>Smells more like washing detergent</li>
            <li>I love indenses</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;ve bought most.</li>
            <li>Like the dog and the moon, you will feel right and understand the peace that comes from the good karma that is blessed with this mystery of life.</li>
            <li>scent is not as good as the regular vanilla or the bergomont, but still good</li>
            <li>Has a light refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>Lingers in the air giving a nice fresh scent&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of orange scents that smell like orange, without being too strong, you&#x27;ll like this.</li>
            <li>Some incense is just too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too sweet, or too strong, or too floral and seems to appeal in some way to most everybody.</li>
            <li>In general HEM incense is great.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell that I would mostly identify as citrus (not so much of the vanilla).  </li>
            <li>Fabulous scent.  </li>
            <li>We all are unique, just as our taste in fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet.</li>
            <li>i took a chance on this incense and this brand and it smells so good, you definately smell the vanilla with a hint of orange and it fills the entire room</li>
            <li>my first box of this incense I purchased in Los Angeles, I love the scent , it is my total fresh favorite from HEM, vanilla orange----------yum !</li>
            <li>I own several scents and each is unique.  </li>
            <li>Normally this would be ok</li>
            <li>Distinctly citrus smell that isnt over powering or particularly sweet.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to call these a high quality incense as some sticks are better than others (some can be a bit smoky or unscented), but overall it&#x27;s a lovely scent, a pretty safe bet,  and you will get your money&#x27;s worth out of them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>You can easily burn two sticks at a time in a decent sized living room without it over powering you.</li>
            <li>I enjoy other fragrances better.</li>
            <li>at first I thought I wasnt going to like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t judge on first impressions</li>
            <li>I admit at first</li>
            <li>This is the first product from HEM that I did not care for.  </li>
            <li>It always has a strong scent without the general chemical smell of some incenses.  </li>
            <li>Unlit, and out of the box, these are certainly favoring a citrus scent, but once lit, the vanilla really steps up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the inititail smell is very pungent and almost like moth balls</li>
            <li>This product is packaged VERY well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Something to be admired about this scent is that absolutely nobody in my house dislikes it.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and is not one you would typically associate with orange/citrus.</li>
            <li>not too light not too heavy but just right.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Quick to light, slow to burn.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts a bit, but at the same time it dissipates fast.</li>
            <li>This is the only scent that has caused that reaction (and I donâ€™t normally have allergies)</li>

            <li> Odd, seeing as how it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Vanilla-Orange\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had it lit for less than 5 minutes before I had to put it out.</li>
            <li> but whatever is done to make create the citrus smell caused a small allergic reaction for me.  </li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIN INCENSE!</li>
            <li> Smells like nasty perfume</li>
            <li> Nothing terrible, but</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not the best incense. It doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasant. Smells like burning wood with a hint or vanilla and orange zest.</li>
            <li> at first I thought I wasnt going to like this stuff.  the inititail smell is very pungent and almost like moth balls but when you burn it it does release a pleasent orange vanilla smell. so don&#x27;t judge on first impressions</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Smells sweet. Even my kids liked this sent. Was relaxing lasts about 15 mins each stick. I would but these again.</li>
            <li> smells great-burns well and evenly</li>
            <li> Like the dog and the moon, you will feel right and understand the peace that comes from the good karma that is blessed with this mystery of life.</li>
            <li> I thought these smelled like a urinal cake but my husband thought they smelled like a laundromat in which you are allowed to smoke.  So we decided that they smell like a bathroom at a laundromat in which you are still allowed to smoke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered other scents and wanted to try these. they aren&#x27;t as strong as some of the others but there is a nice pleasant scent to them and for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This item is good but I also bought the india temple incense and that one by far is the best!</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, it smells better when you burn it. It smells alright in the box, but better when it&#x27;s lit. I did notice however, that it has more of an orange scent than vanilla. Odd, seeing as how it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Vanilla-Orange\\&quot;. You would think with that title, it would have more of a vanilla scent, and the orange would be more like an &#x27;undertone&#x27;. I guess they should name it \\&quot;Orange-Vanilla\\&quot;. Oh, well. That&#x27;s just a minor quibble. The vanilla seems to &#x27;mellow it out&#x27; so it&#x27;s not too strong. If you&#x27;re a fan of orange scents that smell like orange, without being too strong, you&#x27;ll like this. All in all, it smells very nice, and a scent I would recommend, as well as re-order!</li>
            <li> awesome.. smell so wonderful</li>
            <li> This product smells great! The package is a box, with 6 tubes of 20 or so sticks. The scent lasts a bit, but at the same time it dissipates fast. You can easily burn two sticks at a time in a decent sized living room without it over powering you. Ive only burned them in well ventilated rooms, and have yet to try it in my new house; which has little air circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering again, when i run out. Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of citrus</li>
            <li> Smells like nasty perfume</li>
            <li> HEM INCENSE is the best....I did feel even though this was nice...I enjoy other fragrances better. This was a touch smokey....I did use all of them , however raspberry, coconut, vanilla, seem to suit me better. I&#x27;m quite sure some of you would love the Orange-vanilla. You kind of need to try them for yourself....as I find some I love that others don&#x27;t. We all are unique, just as our taste in fragrance.</li>
            <li> In general HEM incense is great.  It always has a strong scent without the general chemical smell of some incenses.  I own several scents and each is unique.  I also know of a number of people who love this scent (which is good because I had someone to give it to).  It has a very strong smell that I would mostly identify as citrus (not so much of the vanilla).  Normally this would be ok but whatever is done to make create the citrus smell caused a small allergic reaction for me.  Nothing terrible, but I just could not stop sneezing.  This is the only scent that has caused that reaction (and I donâ€™t normally have allergies) but it was concerning enough that I thought is should be said.</li>
            <li> This product is packaged VERY well.  The scent is very nice, the incense burn well, puts out a lot of smoke.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for use outdoors or in a well ventilated area.  Great to fight Mosquitos.</li>
            <li> Received this package today and they smell great! lit one up in our kitchen and instantly knew this was something permanent.</li>
            <li> As usual with all the incense I&#x27;ve ordered, a lot of the sticks came to small to where it didn&#x27;t stay in the hole, I have three different incensed holders and none of them will hold the tiny width without using another stick to keep it in the hole....</li>
            <li> I admit at first I thought it may smell like a cream sickle, I am convinced otherwise. Its a very pleasant scent of which I&#x27;ve come to expect from HEM. Distinctly citrus smell that isnt over powering or particularly sweet. not too light not too heavy but just right. Two thumbs way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;a friend of mine who hates both citrus and vanilla with a passion has fallen inlove with this stick. If your like him i&#x27;m sure you will too. I gave this 5 stars 4 months ago and yet somehow that doesnt seem enough.</li>
            <li> ive lite some of them and i love the smell. clears up the room and i would definitely buy them again!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent.  Very pleased.  Packaged well.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a sweeter smell, but this just smells a bit too soapy to me. I couldn&#x27;t smell any essence of orange. I had it lit for less than 5 minutes before I had to put it out. I&#x27;ll be giving it to someone else who may appreciate it more.</li>
            <li> my first box of this incense I purchased in Los Angeles, I love the scent , it is my total fresh favorite from HEM, vanilla orange----------yum !</li>
            <li> i took a chance on this incense and this brand and it smells so good, you definately smell the vanilla with a hint of orange and it fills the entire room</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Each has a thick end to stand up in my new Tibetan incense holder. Wonderful unique aroma. Way better than any plugin or candle.</li>
            <li> Unlit, and out of the box, these are certainly favoring a citrus scent, but once lit, the vanilla really steps up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to be admired about this scent is that absolutely nobody in my house dislikes it. It&#x27;s not too sweet, or too strong, or too floral and seems to appeal in some way to most everybody. I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to call these a high quality incense as some sticks are better than others (some can be a bit smoky or unscented), but overall it&#x27;s a lovely scent, a pretty safe bet,  and you will get your money&#x27;s worth out of them.</li>
            <li> Some incense is just too strong. This was really pleasant with a very nice citrus. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> SWEET ORANGE AND CINNAMON VANILLA SCENT THAT IS PLEASANT TO THE NOSE.  I RECOMMEND THIN INCENSE! YOU MAY LIKE IT AS I DO!</li>
            <li> My friends take my word for it.  This incense smells so good.  The orange and vanilla together are AWESOME. You will love it.</li>
            <li> This is the first product from HEM that I did not care for.  The smell is very strong and is not one you would typically associate with orange/citrus.</li>
            <li> its great they could burn longer</li>
            <li> Smells more like washing detergent</li>
            <li> Delightful smell.  Was nervous they wouldn&#x27;t smell tru to its name, it does and they are great.  I love indenses</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Has a light refreshing scent. I like to burn this scent with HEM lotus</li>
            <li> scent is not as good as the regular vanilla or the bergomont, but still good</li>
            <li> It was a surprising how good those two scents go together. It&#x27;s one of my favorites and I think I&#x27;ve bought most.</li>
            <li> Quick to light, slow to burn.  Lingers in the air giving a nice fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely reccomend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> scentless-all smoke and a lot of it-heading to the burn barrel with this one-would not recommend-couldn&#x27;t even keep the mosquittos away</li>
