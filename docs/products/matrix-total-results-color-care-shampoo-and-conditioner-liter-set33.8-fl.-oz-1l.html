            <li>Good Value for the price.</li>
            <li>My stylist always compliments me on how healthy my hair is!</li>
            <li>before I used to use the 2-in-1s kind</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be honest...</li>
            <li>Leave my hair very manageable and maintain my highlight beautiful!</li>
            <li>Always liked this product.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, great salon products at fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Liked your price even more</li>
            <li>Love it, makes my hair look and feel nice without all the added wax and junk that make my hair freak out.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell you more than that. ))</li>
            <li>Arrived with no problems &amp; will be buying more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but</li>
            <li>I love this more than Matrix Biolage!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair feels much better</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I love Matrix products.</li>
            <li>It is the best product I have found after trying numerous brands.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many hair products, but this outshines them all.thi</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I also highlight and sometimes color my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of shampoos and conditioners and was hooked on paul mitchell and redken for a while, but I like this better.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Love it,  and so does my hair...</li>
            <li>I am hoping these products work as well for fade as most claimed.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fine (I like it much more than the conditioner).</li>
            <li>Recommended by my hair stylist and I was glad to find such a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair though and rinses clean, so if it works I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li>can however see it working just fine for individuals with fine hair or hair on the thinner side.</li>
            <li>My hair had better control and more shine after the first use.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner work fine</li>
            <li>So, protected it to the fullest is incredibly important to me.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, clean, &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell and rinses out clean.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product makes hair color last longer and stays soft after coloring.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>My daughter, who is 6, also needs a good conditioner for the same reasons.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older and my hair is dryer and colored more often, I had to find a gentler product.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel very smooth and soft</li>
            <li>The conditioner does such a great job of detangling and leaving my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo and conditioner that really works with my fine hair and keeps the color from fading.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smell right, and was not the right color.</li>
            <li>What works best for me is using a deep conditioner hair mask in place of regular conditioner, as it leaves my hair very soft, immediately removes tangles, etc.</li>
            <li>It is great for the larger size to fill up my smaller bottles and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>She purchased similar but was not as pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this shampoo, and especially not the conditioner.</li>
            <li>So, I tried a natural sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love having an alternate way to purchase salon products without paying the salon prices.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered my matrix shampoos from Amazon before, but this is my first order from this vender.  </li>
            <li>It is very watery and it doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo and conditioner set after reading really positive reviews.</li>
            <li>And I love getting the liter bottles (I have long hair).</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and this work great on it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for those who have&lt;br /&gt;color treated hair!</li>
            <li>so this shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to work too well for my needs - but may be very well for others.</li>
            <li>Classic Matrix.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try something new</li>
            <li>It gets the job done without excessive lathering, but it&#x27;s not my favorite by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Conditioner makes hair too soft, so I water it down and it works fine.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t make me frizzy or weigh it down, it just gets it clean.</li>
            <li>I like the shampoo and conditioner a lot, but it does seem that these are old bottles.</li>
            <li>Far Cheaper through amazon than in salons.</li>
            <li>the Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;It is so soft and</li>
            <li>With very fine, very thin, and very curly hair... I&#x27;m extremely particular about the products I use.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not overly sensitive generally about these things.</li>
            <li>The color of the bottles isn&#x27;t the same and also they aren&#x27;t as sturdy as new ones.</li>
            <li>Some cheap, some expensive, none that were right for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s either extremely old, or mixed with something else.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length, thick yet really fine, color treated blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>Because of the bleaching, I try to use high quality products that aren&#x27;t going to further damage and dry out my hair.</li>

            <li> Salons always had all the other Total Results sets, but never the purple.  </li>
            <li> Found nothing about these products that distinguished them from any other.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comapre this to any other product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I tried anything other than Matrix products.</li>
            <li> and though I had not been fond of Matrix products in the past, decided to give their Total Results line a whirl...</li>
            <li> and my hair even feels a little dry.</li>
            <li> Comes with the tops taped down so they don&#x27;t leak during shipping.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hair which is naturally dark but heavily highlighted blonde.</li>
            <li> I tend to wear my hair down and am very active during the day.</li>
            <li> and I see less of hair falling after I&#x27;ve started using this set of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I typically use Biolage Hydrasource, but thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> Typically, my hair stops responding well to a product after a while.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to leave my hair feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li> I already have very thick, heavy hair</li>
            <li> I wasted over 30$ on shampoo and conditioner that washes out my hair like crazy.</li>
            <li> This can cause a bit of tangling (nothing very bad at all though), and conditioning obviously helps untangle without the damage running a brush through your hair</li>
            <li> It is still not a s great as Matrix&#x27;s Logics brand that for some reason they decided to discontinue!!!  </li>
            <li> Something is wrong with my conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fruity smell and my hair seems to feel dirty by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> One hairdresser there tried to tell me they were bad for my hair because they contained sulfates.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed one bit!!  </li>

            <li> Great product great deal.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. I didn&#x27;t notice any &#x27;results.&#x27; Found nothing about these products that distinguished them from any other.</li>
            <li> The lady I acquired this for says it is wonderful.  She purchased similar but was not as pleased. One use of this product, and she said she noticed an immediate difference in the feeling and scent of her hair.  Can&#x27;t tell you more than that. ))</li>
            <li> Holds my color from fading. Conditioner makes hair too soft, so I water it down and it works fine.</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere in local stores/salons ( even out of town) but could never find this item.  Salons always had all the other Total Results sets, but never the purple.  Happy I found on here.  Only shampoo/conditioner that I can use on my oily hair.  Arrived with no problems &amp; will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo and conditioner a lot, but it does seem that these are old bottles. The color of the bottles isn&#x27;t the same and also they aren&#x27;t as sturdy as new ones. But about the shampoo and conditioner, it did wonders for my hair! It&#x27;s softer and I could tell a difference almost instantly. It smells great too and my color has seemed to hold longer.</li>
            <li> Far Cheaper through amazon than in salons. Works great on my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> The stylist recommended this to me on my last visit to the salon. It makes my hair feel very smooth and soft and I see less of hair falling after I&#x27;ve started using this set of shampoo and conditioner. before I used to use the 2-in-1s kind so I can&#x27;t comapre this to any other product. But this product itself has given me great reults.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Leaves your feeling wonderful.  I switch around products and this alleviates shampoo build-up in your hair from the Moroccan Oil I had been using..</li>
            <li> I typically use Biolage Hydrasource, but thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  It&#x27;s ok, but I don&#x27;t like the fruity smell and my hair seems to feel dirty by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is.  Comes with the tops taped down so they don&#x27;t leak during shipping.  Very nice, very happy with the product and shipping.  Will come back to do business with again.</li>
            <li> I love this more than Matrix Biolage!&lt;br /&gt;My Hair feels much better and I love the Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;It is so soft and untangled!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product! Highly recommend this for those who have&lt;br /&gt;color treated hair!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell right, and was not the right color. It&#x27;s either extremely old, or mixed with something else.  I&#x27;d suggest buying from a salon to ensure quality. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner set after reading really positive reviews. I was looking for a salon-quality product that didn&#x27;t break the bank.  Here is my personal experience with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have very long, very thick hair which is naturally dark but heavily highlighted blonde. Because of the bleaching, I try to use high quality products that aren&#x27;t going to further damage and dry out my hair. This can get pricy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m going to be honest...I don&#x27;t love this shampoo, and especially not the conditioner. I tend to wear my hair down and am very active during the day. This can cause a bit of tangling (nothing very bad at all though), and conditioning obviously helps untangle without the damage running a brush through your hair could cause. My daughter, who is 6, also needs a good conditioner for the same reasons. The conidtioner hasn&#x27;t lived up to my hopes. I don&#x27;t find it particularly good at detangling---at all--- even when I use and excess amount and leave it for quite some time. My hair is still knotty and requires a further deep condition with a different product. This seems to defet the purpose. When used alone I haven&#x27;t noticed any type of benefits- and my hair even feels a little dry. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, and definietly isn&#x27;t noticeable. I like my hair to have hint of a pleasant scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The shampoo is fine (I like it much more than the conditioner). It gets the job done without excessive lathering, but it&#x27;s not my favorite by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will not be buying this again. What works best for me is using a deep conditioner hair mask in place of regular conditioner, as it leaves my hair very soft, immediately removes tangles, etc. This product does not do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can however see it working just fine for individuals with fine hair or hair on the thinner side. If you need something that does a great job at conditioning or detangling, I&#x27;d skip this set.</li>
            <li> Been using it for several years.... Best products I have found...</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo and conditioner that I used to get from my hairdresser.  It is great for the larger size to fill up my smaller bottles and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love Matrix products. I used the Amplify Volume for YEARS! As I&#x27;ve gotten older and my hair is dryer and colored more often, I had to find a gentler product. I don&#x27;t know why I tried anything other than Matrix products. I was disappointed in them all. Some cheap, some expensive, none that were right for my hair. I just switched to another Matrix product. I love this product and the Exquisite Oil set. And I love getting the liter bottles (I have long hair). I cannot beat the price. I either order here or get them at the Walmart salon (I don&#x27;t have my hair done there, I just buy the shampoo there). One hairdresser there tried to tell me they were bad for my hair because they contained sulfates. So, I tried a natural sulfate free shampoo. Yuck! It did nothing. It didn&#x27;t even get the products off my hair. Some people complain that the shampoo is drying. Well...that&#x27;s what the conditioner is for. The shampoo cleans all the gunk off, the conditioner puts the moisture back. That&#x27;s why they work best as a set. I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> It is the best product I have found after trying numerous brands.  It has a light smell and rinses out clean.  It is still not a s great as Matrix&#x27;s Logics brand that for some reason they decided to discontinue!!!  I still wish they would bring it back.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it all the time but it does add texture to your hair</li>
            <li> Matrix Shampoo and Conditioner is the best.  I have tried many many hair products, but this outshines them all.thi</li>
            <li> So far so good! Leave my hair very manageable and maintain my highlight beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to leave my hair feeling heavy.  I already have very thick, heavy hair so this shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to work too well for my needs - but may be very well for others.</li>
            <li> Not the product I wanted.  Was suppose to be Matrix So Silver shampoo</li>
            <li> Always liked this product. Liked your price even more</li>
            <li> Perfect product. Recommended by my hair stylist and I was glad to find such a great price on Amazon. The price is much better than anywhere else I looked, perfect for anyone with colored or highlighted hair. Great to use in order to avoid build up on hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this. I wasted over 30$ on shampoo and conditioner that washes out my hair like crazy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have very thick hair and this work great on it.  I have tried a lot of shampoos and have never found one like this</li>
            <li> great frizzy curly hair the best</li>
            <li> Love having an alternate way to purchase salon products without paying the salon prices.</li>
            <li> Great price. Worked well for me!</li>
            <li> With very fine, very thin, and very curly hair... I&#x27;m extremely particular about the products I use.  On top of that, I also highlight and sometimes color my hair.  So, protected it to the fullest is incredibly important to me.  Typically, my hair stops responding well to a product after a while.  I decided to try something new and though I had not been fond of Matrix products in the past, decided to give their Total Results line a whirl... I have not been disappointed one bit!!  The conditioner does such a great job of detangling and leaving my hair soft and silky.  And the shampoo protects and extend my color for weeks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. My stylist always compliments me on how healthy my hair is!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It smells great and is great for the price.  I&#x27;ve used tons of shampoos and conditioners and was hooked on paul mitchell and redken for a while, but I like this better.  I have medium length, thick yet really fine, color treated blonde hair.  This doesn&#x27;t make me frizzy or weigh it down, it just gets it clean.</li>
            <li> Classic Matrix.  Love it, makes my hair look and feel nice without all the added wax and junk that make my hair freak out.  Quick delivery, great salon products at fraction of the cost.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> This product met all expectations.</li>
            <li> Excellent product makes hair color last longer and stays soft after coloring. Would buy again. Very good price! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it,  and so does my hair...</li>
            <li> So great - I&#x27;ve ordered twice!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly. Something is wrong with my conditioner. It is very watery and it doesn&#x27;t smell right. I&#x27;ve ordered my matrix shampoos from Amazon before, but this is my first order from this vender.  I will not order from this vender again.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo and conditioner that really works with my fine hair and keeps the color from fading. My hair had better control and more shine after the first use.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner work fine but I do not care for the scent of the conditioner.  I Prefer Matrix Color Care shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, clean, &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> Good Value for the price.</li>
            <li> I am hoping these products work as well for fade as most claimed. I thought they were a great deal and I am very happy with the way they cleanse and the body and texture they leave my fine hair with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the smell of the conditioner and I&#x27;m not overly sensitive generally about these things. It doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair though and rinses clean, so if it works I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
