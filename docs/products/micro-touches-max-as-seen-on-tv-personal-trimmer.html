            <li>and it&#x27;s worked great!  </li>
            <li>This gadget is superb.  </li>
            <li>An excellent mustache trimmer, too, guys!  </li>
            <li>THAT DID NOT DO A VERY GOOD</li>
            <li>Would never order anything from Good Stuff again!</li>
            <li>This thing is a piece of junk, but when it works, it works great.</li>
            <li>BUT DOES A GREAT</li>
            <li>... works great and lasts forever..</li>
            <li>I gave five stare for timely delivery and for it being a great product.</li>
            <li>I do run it against the hair to trim brows and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Hopefully this is a one time error but some feedback from the company would have been nice!</li>
            <li>Good luck to all of us.</li>
            <li>Good item if you are patient.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not function we&#x27;ll not even a good toy.</li>
            <li>Does not do a good job of trimming.</li>
            <li>We were very pleased with the product since we had ordered one before.</li>
            <li>The cost of shipping was more than the product itself!</li>
            <li>THE BEST ONE AND THE BEST PRICE.A LITTLE NOISY</li>
            <li>Made real cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>and it worked amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a handy product for those of us who cut our own hair.</li>
            <li>I HAVE MANY TRIMMERS</li>
            <li>AND GLAD</li>
            <li>I have since purchased a different trimmer for my nose, but this is still the best I have found to use on my ears.</li>
            <li>The light is an added bonus!</li>
            <li>I for one would pay lots more for it.</li>
            <li>Many thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benny</li>
            <li>In fact it broke all most immediately.</li>
            <li>I love you guys and you do such a great job.</li>
            <li>For 12 years, though, a pretty amazing appliance/tool.  </li>
            <li>The performance of the trimmer is fine</li>
            <li>light doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>The switch mechanism is extremely cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>The light does not work.</li>
            <li>Im glad I didnt pay very much for this item that way</li>
            <li>I have found that the best thing for trimming nose hair is the Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer</li>
            <li>Some have literally fallen apart, breaking into pieces without any special pressure being applied.</li>
            <li>Figure to get six months&#x27; use out of the thing, or maybe a year if you&#x27;re lucky, and then just replace it.</li>
            <li>The one received would not work at first, we put in new batteries of our own and it would work for maybe a minute, max, then stop working.  </li>
            <li>This is just an updated version that is slightly better made (the old one came apart on me).</li>
            <li>it was better than this peice of junk which can barely shave lint let alone</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t powerful enough to take anything more but the stray beard or head hair though.</li>
            <li>Still a good buy for tiny hairs in sensitive places.</li>
            <li>Put the battery that came with the package into the trimmer, and then also put one of my own brand new batteries into the trimmer, it it barely runs.  </li>
            <li>AT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE.</li>
            <li>Now if it were only made to be recharged with more power then it has now.</li>
            <li>I also have a Full Beard and it allows me to touch up those stray hair&#x27;s that always runs wild.  </li>
            <li>Put a drop of light oil on the cutters before each use and the battery will last MUCH longer!</li>
            <li>It works very well, but it is flimsy.</li>
            <li>The one we had worked very well</li>
            <li>Saw the commerical so many times and expected what I saw.  </li>
            <li>WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t trim too much hair even when it is running, neither in the nose, ears, or even on arms.  </li>
            <li>very disappointed.cuts</li>
            <li>Only the light remains functional, blade does not work.</li>
            <li>But the thing is, when it works it&#x27;s better than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The second one works sometimes but is also just overall a very cheaply made product.  </li>
            <li>If the particular product was upgraded, then the images and descriptions should have been updated on the website as well.</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this that I used on my nose and ears.</li>
            <li>If you turn the light on while cutting it does not work as good.  </li>
            <li>but I of course expected the light to work.</li>
            <li>It was a good thought just a poor product.</li>
            <li>The two shavers I bought arrived closed and new but the LED light doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Some just stop working, even if you put in a new battery.</li>
            <li>The Norelco didn&#x27;t cut well for me, and two Remingtons I&#x27;ve tried both stopped working, even with new batteries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a new one tonight.</li>
            <li>The early micro touch units were great little trimmers and while the need to replace their blades every so often was a little anoying</li>
            <li>The markings on the side aren&#x27;t very clear, either.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not sure why it didn&#x27;t work but love the new one.</li>
            <li>IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>, HOWEVER IT DID NOT PERFORM ANYWHERES NEAR TO THIS ONE.</li>
            <li>So far after 7 months of use, This product has done what they say.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this trimmer</li>
            <li>This is a flimsy piece of garbage that doesn&#x27;t work well, looks and feels cheap, and is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned this thing is cheap and hardly works.  </li>
            <li>and it barely worked then.</li>
            <li>at least Im not out what the original micro touch cost.</li>
            <li>It lasted for about a year, but then started to cut hairs less and less easy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> NOT CUTTING POOR QUALITY</li>
            <li> This small gem works like a charm on those areas that have always been hard to groom -- ears &amp; nose, as well as quick touch up to mustache and beard.</li>
            <li> Had to clean it up, oil it once in a while, but it finally had a small plastic part fail tonight.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a hunk of junk.. total waste of time ...</li>
            <li> It is a waste of time to try to get our money back.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, I would&#x27;ve gotten the same result if I threw my money in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth a single star rating.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews, and thought I give it a try anyways.</li>
            <li> The device failed after first use.</li>
            <li> less of what expected</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these items and one would only work if I bumped it on a countertop or hard surface.  </li>
            <li> The shipping for the proudct is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and like other have mentioned</li>
            <li> I wouldnt waste my time.  </li>
            <li> This product is completely a waste and they show something on TV and the the product does not perform at all.</li>
            <li> Eye brows are a breeze and just takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or money...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is a little problem solver!  </li>
            <li> JOB.GIVE IT A SHOT FOR TEN BUCKS CANT GO WRONG.</li>
            <li> the worse thing I ever spent money on</li>
            <li> Wrote to the company with my complaint, heard nothing from them.  </li>
            <li> Slow and china mail .</li>
            <li> Not a good product</li>
            <li> Dull and weak!  </li>
            <li> I would classify this as false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we are now in April with still no status.</li>
            <li> , it pulls and cuts very poorly.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> It&amp;#34;s a piece of crap...</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> These were a real disappointment.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment!!</li>
            <li> Received the product and was very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The microtouch trimmer broke on the second use.  This is the second time I have had a microtouch that broke this way.</li>
            <li> After making this purchase, I was led to believe that I was ordering the correct item as indicated on the website. The items shipped and received were the items that I did not order. If the particular product was upgraded, then the images and descriptions should have been updated on the website as well. I would classify this as false advertisement. I contacted the company on February 24th 2010 and received a reply stating that this matter would be looked into. Needless to say, we are now in April with still no status. Hopefully this is a one time error but some feedback from the company would have been nice!</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of junk, but when it works, it works great. What to do? I&#x27;ve owned probably about eight of these over the years. Some have literally fallen apart, breaking into pieces without any special pressure being applied. Some just stop working, even if you put in a new battery. But the thing is, when it works it&#x27;s better than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. The Norelco didn&#x27;t cut well for me, and two Remingtons I&#x27;ve tried both stopped working, even with new batteries. So I&#x27;m back to the Micro Touch. Figure to get six months&#x27; use out of the thing, or maybe a year if you&#x27;re lucky, and then just replace it. Good luck to all of us.</li>
            <li> NOT CUTTING POOR QUALITY</li>

            <li> It works very well, but it is flimsy. The markings on the side aren&#x27;t very clear, either. Good item if you are patient.</li>
            <li> We were very pleased with the product since we had ordered one before. The one we had worked very well but when it didn&#x27;t work and we changed the battery and it still didn&#x27;t work we had to order another one. We&#x27;re not sure why it didn&#x27;t work but love the new one.</li>
            <li> Saw the commerical so many times and expected what I saw.  What a disappointment!! Got it as a gift and nothing it said it would do worked.  Even changed the battery twice hoping that would help.  Wrote to the company with my complaint, heard nothing from them.  Would never order anything from Good Stuff again!</li>
            <li> I HAVE MANY TRIMMERS THAT SAY THEY WORK BUT DONT.IVE GOT TRIMMERS FROM BOTH BROOKSTONE AND REMIMGTON AT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE. THAT DID NOT DO A VERY GOOD JOB.I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE MICRO MAX A TRY AND GLAD I DID.THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE AND THE BEST PRICE.A LITTLE NOISY BUT DOES A GREAT JOB.GIVE IT A SHOT FOR TEN BUCKS CANT GO WRONG.</li>
            <li> This thing is a hunk of junk.. total waste of time ... I have found that the best thing for trimming nose hair is the Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer ... works great and lasts forever..</li>
            <li> These were a real disappointment.  I wouldnt waste my time.  Kills the batteries after a couple uses.  It was a good thought just a poor product.</li>
            <li> less of what expected</li>
            <li> Does a good job. But don&#x27;t drop it, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m going to say.</li>
            <li> Saw the TV ad several times. Shows the product working efficiently trimming facial hair;nose hair and eyebrows. Received the product and was very disappointed. Does not work on nasal hair and eyebrows. Works poorly on  facial hair. I am not using it at all.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this that I used on my nose and ears. This is just an updated version that is slightly better made (the old one came apart on me). I have since purchased a different trimmer for my nose, but this is still the best I have found to use on my ears. It isn&#x27;t powerful enough to take anything more but the stray beard or head hair though. Still a good buy for tiny hairs in sensitive places.</li>
            <li> This is a handy product for those of us who cut our own hair. It works well to trim around the ears, and along the neck-line. The shipping for the proudct is my only complaint. The cost of shipping was more than the product itself!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it does not work as advertised .. the worse thing I ever spent money on</li>
            <li> Tried to test it out and the unit fell apart..into about 10 pieces.  Made real cheap and flimsy. Not worth buying. What this purchase amounts to is paying $10.00 for a battery.</li>
            <li> Arrived like it came from china. Slow and china mail . Low priced but low quality also.&lt;br /&gt;It does not function we&#x27;ll not even a good toy.</li>
            <li> Had one for over 12 years and it&#x27;s worked great!  Had to clean it up, oil it once in a while, but it finally had a small plastic part fail tonight.  For 12 years, though, a pretty amazing appliance/tool.  I&#x27;m ordering a new one tonight.</li>
            <li> This product is completely a waste and they show something on TV and the the product does not perform at all.</li>
            <li> This small gem works like a charm on those areas that have always been hard to groom -- ears &amp; nose, as well as quick touch up to mustache and beard. The light is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> HAVE HAD ANOTHER PRODUCT SIMILIAR TO THIS, HOWEVER IT DID NOT PERFORM ANYWHERES NEAR TO THIS ONE. WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews, and thought I give it a try anyways. I got the package on time and used it that evening and it worked amazing. I gave five stare for timely delivery and for it being a great product. Also bc it work like it said on line</li>
            <li> Just received this \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot;.  What a joke.  Put the battery that came with the package into the trimmer, and then also put one of my own brand new batteries into the trimmer, it it barely runs.  Doesn&#x27;t trim too much hair even when it is running, neither in the nose, ears, or even on arms.  Very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> So far after 7 months of use, This product has done what they say. It trims, cuts, and cleans up unwanted hair. Eye brows are a breeze and just takes a few seconds. I do run it against the hair to trim brows and it does a great job. I also have a Full Beard and it allows me to touch up those stray hair&#x27;s that always runs wild.  Now if it were only made to be recharged with more power then it has now. I for one would pay lots more for it. If you turn the light on while cutting it does not work as good.  If this one stops on me, I will buy one to replace it.</li>
            <li> Product is simply a piece of junk....don&#x27;t waste your time or money...this has to be a scam that someone has probably made a lot of money</li>
            <li> It&amp;#34;s a piece of crap...light doesn&#x27;t work...very disappointed.cuts&lt;br /&gt;also, it pulls and cuts very poorly. I would like a refund or another unit shipped.</li>
            <li> The two shavers I bought arrived closed and new but the LED light doesn&#x27;t work. They should turn on and not do it.</li>
            <li> This gadget is superb.  Between haircuts I always grow extra hair around my hears .  This product takes car of that and eyebrows as well as heair in the nose and ears.  Many thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benny</li>
            <li> The device failed after first use. Only the light remains functional, blade does not work. Do not recommend for any use.</li>
            <li> It lasted for about a year, but then started to cut hairs less and less easy. It&#x27;s cheap, but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Does not work as described. If you have one or two hairs maybe but the neck hair trim it advertises does not work at all. I would not recommend wasting your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of this product, the personal trimmer as seen on TV, and received only one.  The one received would not work at first, we put in new batteries of our own and it would work for maybe a minute, max, then stop working.  On and off, On and off and finally stopped working at all.  Could not even finish the nape of the neck.  We threw it away and I guess we are out for the 2 we ordered.  When will I ever learn to not listen to TV ads. It is a waste of time to try to get our money back.  Certainly not worth a single star rating.  Dode</li>
            <li> El articulo adquirido fue recibido sin funcionamiento de sus partes, de toda mercancia que he adquirido primera vez me sucede tal inconveniente por lo tanto no puedo calicar el articulo por inconformidad del mismo</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned this thing is cheap and hardly works.  I used it a few times and like other have mentioned, you can&#x27;t just turn it on.  It has to be fiddled around with to get it to work.  After using it about a dozen times mine now will not turn on at all, and is headed for the garbage can.</li>
            <li> I HAVE WRITTEN TWICE TO LET SOMEONE KNOW THAT THIS ITEM DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.IT WILL NOT EVEN TRIM THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK. I HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR THREE WEEK TO GET RETURN AUTHORIZATION FOR THIS ITEM WITHOUT ANY LUCK.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these items and one would only work if I bumped it on a countertop or hard surface.  The switch mechanism is extremely cheaply made.  The second one works sometimes but is also just overall a very cheaply made product.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest smallest razor I have ever bought. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> bought it for my husband and he didn&#x27;t like it at all. In fact it broke all most immediately. Not a good product</li>
            <li> Gave one of these Micro Touch Trimmers to my husband and son for Christmas. It works great and I borrow it myself !</li>
            <li> Does not do a good job of trimming.I love you guys and you do such a great job.Praise the Lord!</li>
            <li> The early micro touch units were great little trimmers and while the need to replace their blades every so often was a little anoying it was better than this peice of junk which can barely shave lint let alone body hair. Im glad I didnt pay very much for this item that way at least Im not out what the original micro touch cost.</li>
            <li> This is a flimsy piece of garbage that doesn&#x27;t work well, looks and feels cheap, and is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Used this once and it barely worked then. This was a waste of money, I would&#x27;ve gotten the same result if I threw my money in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap.  Does not shave anything!  Dull and weak!  Do not waste your money on this trimmer</li>
            <li> The light does not work. The performance of the trimmer is fine but I of course expected the light to work.</li>
            <li> This is a little problem solver!  I have told everyone I know about this device, and I believe that my word of mouth has caused a run on these tings.  It can get into places that a razor, or shaver WILL NOT!!  An excellent mustache trimmer, too, guys!  Advice: Put a drop of light oil on the cutters before each use and the battery will last MUCH longer!</li>
