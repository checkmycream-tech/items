            <li>I love this line of products and my hair dresser&#x27;s shop no longer carries the Catwalk</li>
            <li>and this is even better because it is for color treated blondes.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff....</li>
            <li>/&gt;These were even better then</li>
            <li>what I got from the salon, not to mention I got a WAY better price for them.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Seemed to work ok.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really keeps my highlights bright.</li>
            <li>Very happy I spent the money on this.</li>
            <li>OK but nothing special.  </li>

            <li>highlights have definitely lasted a lot longer , and I am really happy with the way my hair is looking and how the color is lasting.&lt;br /&gt;100% would recommend</li>
            <li>Smells good and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>I was really excited for this product when I got it.</li>
            <li>but it does clean my hair</li>
            <li>The products work great, however, the shampoo made my hair feel very dry (like straw).  </li>
            <li>My hair is as soft as can be and it smells so nice.</li>
            <li>Found it here for $24.98 for two full size bottles.  </li>

            <li>My new staple for sure</li>
            <li>It was purple in a clear bottle with a turquoise top.  </li>
            <li>I  love it so far.</li>
            <li>The product itself spread though my hair a lot more evenly and rinsed out completely (which were both problems I was having with the one from my</li>
            <li>Thank you first for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Not bad -- I really like the purple bottle fashionista -- but</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioiner softened the brightness and brought it to the exact color I have wanted from the salon.  </li>
            <li>and I do like this purple shampoo toner for platinum blonde from TIGI Catwalk much better than the others I used before.</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>The consistency is completely different and leads me to believe it may not be authentic product.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first use and continue to use it about once a week.</li>
            <li>After receiving it, the first thing I did was try it out.</li>
            <li>I want to see how much I have left in there to know when to buy more ahead of time...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be cheap and use regular shampoo!</li>
            <li>Very Purple and</li>
            <li>I really can tell it helped.</li>
            <li>My hair is dark, so it wasn&#x27;t suitable for my hair.</li>
            <li>even got another brand name from my regular hairdresser who introduced this T.I.G.I catwalk brand to me because I had finally run out of my beloved CATWALK for the last hair color appt in August this year...</li>
            <li>Less gold tones, not purple &amp; blue just a nice platinum.</li>
            <li>this new brand she gave me...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically spend more than $4 a bottle on shampoo or conditioner, but I will DEFINITELY pay the price to replenish these when they run out!</li>
            <li>Floral old ladyish smell.  </li>
            <li>It also does not condition my hair as well as the old version.  </li>
            <li>but I purchased it directly from the salon.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying direct from you stylist or a store.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t see inside to see how much you have left either</li>
            <li>I bought this and was surprised that it was purple.  </li>
            <li>Make your hair so soft and manageable ..</li>
            <li>If you use it every day it will dry out your hair and make your scalp pretty itchy.</li>
            <li>my first attempt was the usual of a first time level 4 to level 7</li>
            <li>No more brassy blonde :)</li>
            <li>Please bring back the old version.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry, colored blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Plus to make things worse, the top cap was busted and didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but I was kind of disappointed that some of it was wasted.</li>

            <li> This brand was recommended to me by my hair dresses when I got my blond highlights down, and they warned me not to buy it from anywhere but an actual salon because chances were I would get an old and expired product.</li>
            <li> the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling and looking dry.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a harsh chemical smell to it and leaves my highlighted hair soft, not brittle.</li>
            <li> Did not realize this was for highlights or blonde was not very descriptive.</li>
            <li> The description needs to be revised, so other customers won&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be that person with bronze hair or frayed dry hair.</li>
            <li> They also seem to work well with my hair, which tends to be very dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s helping my color not go dull or brittle.</li>
            <li> I recently finished a small bottle</li>
            <li> Seems to leave my hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and noticed my hair was beginning to be very dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The only complaint i have is the spout.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is DARK PURPLE.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair - kept the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my dark brown colored hair.  </li>
            <li> bought at Ulta previously for around $20 per bottle.  </li>
            <li> it leaks shampoo a little.</li>
            <li> so it can get messy when using it.</li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance on here because the bottles I got from my salon were so small and expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to use A LOT of shampoo because it didn&#x27;t lather hardly at all.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because the description didn&#x27;t state this shampoo and conditioner set is for blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews which spoke poorly of the smell.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, it&#x27;s purple &amp; thin</li>
            <li> I am not happy ...</li>
            <li> This one has a weird smell to it.  </li>
            <li> mad they are downsizing the size from 25 oz to 12 oz at my hairdressers</li>
            <li> Awful, it was so smelly it reminded me of a strip club.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel nasty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i like how this makes my hair look and feel.  i only use a couple of times a week.  the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I read some reviews which spoke poorly of the smell.  I love it.  I have my hair highlighted every 5-6 weeks.  This shampoo/conditioiner softened the brightness and brought it to the exact color I have wanted from the salon.  Hair is fuller, thicker and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> This is all I use and all I&#x27;ll ever use. My hair is as soft as can be and it smells so nice. I work with about 20 men and they always compliment me on how great my hair smells. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Thank you first for the quick delivery. I recently finished a small bottle and I do like this purple shampoo toner for platinum blonde from TIGI Catwalk much better than the others I used before. Plus the scent is perfect for me. Less gold tones, not purple &amp; blue just a nice platinum.</li>
            <li> Does what it says!  Smells nice, too!  I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking...my first attempt was the usual of a first time level 4 to level 7 n00b.  I saw the bleach working and freaked out and washed it out. Then I saw the color working and freaked out and washed it out.  What&#x27;s worse is I used a neutral instead of an ash.  I KNOW how to do it, why do I do this to myself? haha! So guess what I was left with?!  Brassy strawberry blondish yuckiness. This stuff helped mellow it out until I could do a correction, and  now that I have my level 7 the brassiness is kept at bay and my color stays and stays. Love this stuff!  I love TIGI shampoos and conditioners, they always smell and work great!</li>
            <li> I received these two items in a giveaway goody bag at a Guess Fashion event, where the girls from Toni and Guy were doing our hair. I thought as a freebie it was probably some discontinued item. I ALMOST gave it away to my sister, but decided to try it. It smells AMAZING!! I LOVE the scent! These two bottles also seem to last forever! I have probably had them for 4 months now and am just starting to run out of the conditioner (I use these probably 3-4 times a week). They also seem to work well with my hair, which tends to be very dry and damaged. I don&#x27;t typically spend more than $4 a bottle on shampoo or conditioner, but I will DEFINITELY pay the price to replenish these when they run out!</li>
            <li> Please bring back the old version. It was purple in a clear bottle with a turquoise top.  This one has a weird smell to it.  Floral old ladyish smell.  It also does not condition my hair as well as the old version.  Seems to leave my hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before but I purchased it directly from the salon. The consistency is completely different and leads me to believe it may not be authentic product. It could also be expired product but I could not locate the expiration date anywhere on the bottles. I would recommend buying direct from you stylist or a store.</li>
            <li> When i opened the box, i noticed that the conditioner bottle was open and had spilled out some of the product. It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but I was kind of disappointed that some of it was wasted.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Best shampoo ever. The only complaint i have is the spout. it leaks shampoo a little.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be that person with bronze hair or frayed dry hair. This violet shampoo gets the job done. The conditioner keeps it silky smooth. Very happy I spent the money on this. Don&#x27;t be cheap and use regular shampoo! PS: I&#x27;m a guy, I care about my hair. Don&#x27;t feel like a wuss because you care about your hair - take care of it. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really keeps my highlights bright. I noticed a difference after the first use and continue to use it about once a week.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry, colored blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for highlighted hair.  I strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> It does seem eliminate the brassy tones of your hair within 3-4 weeks of use. And I loooove the grape scent!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these at ULTA after a home coloring session came out too brassy.  The products work great, however, the shampoo made my hair feel very dry (like straw).  I&#x27;ll keep buying the conditioner and use it as a mask when my blonde hair gets brassy in between coloring.</li>
            <li> I too use it a good 3 to 4 times a week as the other poster mentioned and this awesome wonderful T.I.G.I catwalk has lasted me a good OVER a year here too! It&#x27;s just awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I even got another brand name from my regular hairdresser who introduced this T.I.G.I catwalk brand to me because I had finally run out of my beloved CATWALK for the last hair color appt in August this year... but I want my T.I.G.I Catwalk BACK!!!&lt;br /&gt;Well this new brand she gave me... WHAT? you can&#x27;t see inside to see how much you have left either (I don&#x27;t like that either.. I want to see how much I have left in there to know when to buy more ahead of time... so I wont be in the middle of the shower \\&quot;oh no\\&quot;?) so it&#x27;s now BACK to the my FAVE Catwalk again but I&#x27;ll finish this up in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mad they are downsizing the size from 25 oz to 12 oz at my hairdressers AUGH WHAT How dare they lol? So I am frantically looking online for the awesome LASTS FOR A GOOD YEAR FOR ME 25 oz sized with the pump!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for carrying this. I saw on EBAY too but their sh&amp;h is a lot too.. I trust Amazon even more...</li>
            <li> This is a great once a week system. If you use it every day it will dry out your hair and make your scalp pretty itchy. I use it once a week and I can tell it takes away some brassiness in my bleached hair. My hair tends to get orange after the toner wears off. This is a great in between brightener.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and leaves my hair super soft! Even brightens my highlights! No more brassy blonde :)</li>
            <li> Does a great job. Smells good and my hair is soft. No one ever told me that I need this kind of Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Awful, it was so smelly it reminded me of a strip club.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo that i ever had in life i will continue using these.</li>
            <li> I love this line of products and my hair dresser&#x27;s shop no longer carries the Catwalk and this is even better because it is for color treated blondes.</li>
            <li> I only use this product 3 times a week and it helps with my highlights so far it&#x27;s helping my color not go dull or brittle. recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....bought at Ulta previously for around $20 per bottle.  Found it here for $24.98 for two full size bottles.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a harsh chemical smell to it and leaves my highlighted hair soft, not brittle.</li>
            <li> Love this!  My new staple for sure</li>
            <li> I  love it so far. Very Purple and the bottles are really big for the price I paid</li>
            <li> I bought this and was surprised that it was purple.  Obviously I didn&#x27;t read description too closely.  I purchased it b/c my hair color was starting to look brassy.  I really can tell it helped.</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended to me by my hair dresses when I got my blond highlights down, and they warned me not to buy it from anywhere but an actual salon because chances were I would get an old and expired product. I decided to take a chance on here because the bottles I got from my salon were so small and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were even better then what I got from the salon, not to mention I got a WAY better price for them. The product itself spread though my hair a lot more evenly and rinsed out completely (which were both problems I was having with the one from my salon)&lt;br /&gt;The highlights have definitely lasted a lot longer , and I am really happy with the way my hair is looking and how the color is lasting.&lt;br /&gt;100% would recommend</li>
            <li> After my second use the blonde in my hair is noticeably brighter &amp; the brassy tones are almost nonexistent! Love it</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product when I got it. After receiving it, the first thing I did was try it out. I had to use A LOT of shampoo because it didn&#x27;t lather hardly at all. Plus to make things worse, the top cap was busted and didn&#x27;t work properly. I used it for a few weeks and noticed my hair was beginning to be very dry and frizzy. I changed to my regular shampoo, Paul Mitchell Tea Tree, and my hair felt like it always does, and no frizz. This shampoo does however take some of the brassy notes out of your hair. Its just it takes all the softness and smoothness along with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this color safe shampoo &amp; conditioner for blonde/color treated hair. Keep in mind, it&#x27;s purple &amp; thin so it can get messy when using it. I can&#x27;t say that it keeps my color longer but it does clean my hair, I prefer the Oatmeal/honey by TiGi.</li>
            <li> Love this product ! Make your hair so soft and manageable .. Very quick delivery !</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling and looking dry.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel nasty. I feel residue from the shampoo in my hair.</li>
            <li> Not bad -- I really like the purple bottle fashionista -- but this is cool</li>
            <li> Good for color treated hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo is DARK PURPLE. It is also for blondes. This was not anywhere on the product description when I ordered the set. I have dark hair - kept the shampoo and conditioner. Seemed to work ok. Would not order again for myself.</li>
            <li> OK but nothing special.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Did not realize this was for highlights or blonde was not very descriptive. Said for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Salon quality for blonde hair to reduce brassiness. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my dark brown colored hair.  Once I received today, it says on the bottle it is for blondes.  No where in the description before I ordered did it say for blondes.  I am not happy ...</li>
            <li> Disappointed because the description didn&#x27;t state this shampoo and conditioner set is for blonde hair. My hair is dark, so it wasn&#x27;t suitable for my hair. The description needs to be revised, so other customers won&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> I am rating this on behalf of my teenage daughter who loves this product -- loves the smell and how it makes her hair feel.</li>
