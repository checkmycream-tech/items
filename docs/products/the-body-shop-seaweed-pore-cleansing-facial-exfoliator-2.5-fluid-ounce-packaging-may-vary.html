            <li>I would have liked it to be priced below $10</li>
            <li>I liked this-</li>
            <li>I still like the st ives apricot scrub as the best scrub going but like to change it up with new scrubs every now and again.</li>
            <li>It provides the perfect level of exfoliation, smells good, and last awhile-</li>
            <li>I think this is pretty good!</li>
            <li>I feel I get a deeper scrub as there are more scrubbing granules-</li>
            <li>I also bought a seaweed mask which seems to be more on point with detoxifying</li>
            <li>I had been using the #1 favorite</li>
            <li>I would prefer a scrub that has more scrubbing particles in it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love it now.</li>
            <li>I use this every day and my skin is softer,brighter and many of my acne scars are fading in just a week.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really love the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>As much as I want to give a 1 star, I have been using this product for over a year and it is amazing but best to buy direct from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li>The Body Shop has pretty good products and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>but it was pretty fishy smelly whereas this product is not fishy smelling, has a light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>Gentle yet effective and makes my skin feel really clean and nice for the cleanser</li>
            <li>its only fair!</li>
            <li>My face always feels so smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my normal/ oily skin free of blemishes and residue.</li>
            <li>Also, it did make my skin nice and soft!</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling special.</li>
            <li>It kills all my acne with one wash because it is very drying to my skin but causes me to need a lot more moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love the whole wish list thing...</li>
            <li>love it with the whole seaweed collection.</li>
            <li>This is one of my new favorite products.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this particular wash because it makes my face feel so clean and makes my complexion look even.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product for the first time and went by the reviews I read on</li>
            <li>This is pretty abrasive</li>
            <li>Try department store samples first before you buy and see which one fits your needs.</li>
            <li>I purchased this scrub since it was listed as the #2 favorite facial exfoliate online.  </li>
            <li>I steam my skin first,rub in the scrub for 5-10 minutes (GENTLY) and then rinse with hot water.</li>
            <li>This exfoliator is absolutely gentle on my skin, but does the job well.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I think that is why my previous favorite scrubs have been discontinued because they are quite &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Though it is a decent scrub, I prefer the scrub from Clinique.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my blackheads so far however.</li>
            <li>I always feel fresh-faced and brand new after using this product.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful what I use because it will either break me out or dry out my skin very easily.</li>
            <li>I use it three or four times a week and my skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>, will figure that out as I near the end of the tube...will try to update the review then.</li>
            <li>and I could only use it a few times a week vs. some exfoliators that were slightly more gentle that I could use daily.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>It is not a harsh scrub, and does not leave your face red, as some do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I would caution to use it especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Love this scrub- no environmentally unfriendly microbeads and no super harsh apricot pit shavings.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was all too excited when I got it and all too disappointed when I took the lid off......</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I wish I could use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> This scrub isn&#x27;t as thick as the st ives scrub, it has a lighter feel (less scrubby).</li>
            <li> I personally use ponds cold cream afterwards to moisturize and soothe my skin afterwards before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> The granules are very hard, but I do feel cleansed after use.</li>
            <li> Too damn expensive.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I use the cold cream and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

            <li> My face is originally very dry in the morning and as the day goes on it gets oily. This stuff made my face so dry, even when i moisturized. Terrible product. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I use once a week.  The granules are very hard, but I do feel cleansed after use.</li>
            <li> Little on the expensive side but a nice product. Keeps acne in check. I would have liked it to be priced below $10</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Works wonders!! Nice smell!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for the first time and went by the reviews I read on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful,  and is a very good exfoliator. It is not a harsh scrub, and does not leave your face red, as some do.&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily, and it does not bother my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I think the wonderful scent is what I like best.  Called seaweed, it reminds me of the ocean, or a wonderful spa.  Try it, and see if you agree.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> OMG! This exfoliator was the best ever! The perfect amount of roughness. It left my face feeling so heavenly! I definitely need another one!</li>
            <li> This is pretty abrasive so I would caution to use it especially if you have sensitive skin. That said, it does what it says and does it well. I use it three or four times a week and my skin feels very soft. You do need to moisturize after though as it dries my skin afterwards. Also the smell is pretty bad, so I actually mix it with my other wash to lessen the smell</li>
            <li> Love this! Great buy. My face always feels so smooth after I use it. I&#x27;ve used it multiple days in a row and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my face or feel like sandpaper, yet still feels/looks as though it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I love this item! I will continue to purchase this particular wash because it makes my face feel so clean and makes my complexion look even.</li>
            <li> Smelled good. Too damn expensive. Didn&#x27;t last long at all when used twice a week.</li>
            <li> This is the best non-harsh exfoliating face wash I have found. It leaves my normal/ oily skin free of blemishes and residue. I always feel fresh-faced and brand new after using this product.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on facial scrubs before I arrived at this one.  This is one was rated number 2 out of 10 that were listed (10 being worst - 1 being best). Though it is a decent scrub, I prefer the scrub from Clinique. I feel I get a deeper scrub as there are more scrubbing granules- leaving face like my pores breath once again. But the last time I used Clinique was YEARS ago, so the consistency might have changed. Try department store samples first before you buy and see which one fits your needs.</li>
            <li> I still like the st ives apricot scrub as the best scrub going but like to change it up with new scrubs every now and again. This scrub isn&#x27;t as thick as the st ives scrub, it has a lighter feel (less scrubby). I also bought a seaweed mask which seems to be more on point with detoxifying but it was pretty fishy smelly whereas this product is not fishy smelling, has a light, pleasant fragrance. All in all, I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase this or try other options yet, will figure that out as I near the end of the tube...will try to update the review then.</li>
            <li> I have oily/dry skin. This stuff is awesome and I am so glad I found it!  A little drop goes a long way</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling special.</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favorite products. I have really sensitive skin, and I break out from products that are too harsh. This exfoliator is absolutely gentle on my skin, but does the job well.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use this everyday.  Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used...and that says A LOT.  Good at twice the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scrub since it was listed as the #2 favorite facial exfoliate online.  I had been using the #1 favorite but it has been discontinued.  This scrub has a very nice scent and lathers nicely.  I would prefer a scrub that has more scrubbing particles in it but I think that people can misuse the rougher scrubs and then complain about face irritation.  I think that is why my previous favorite scrubs have been discontinued because they are quite &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;. I use this scrub daily and have no facial irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I liked this- I didn&#x27;t love it. I didn&#x27;t really love the smell and I could only use it a few times a week vs. some exfoliators that were slightly more gentle that I could use daily. However, for the price- I think this is pretty good! Also, it did make my skin nice and soft!</li>
            <li> amazing product for skin exfoliation.</li>
            <li> As much as I want to give a 1 star, I have been using this product for over a year and it is amazing but best to buy direct from The Body Shop. I was all too excited when I got it and all too disappointed when I took the lid off......it is about time Amazon changed their rating system. There should be a rating for the product and a separate one for the seller....its only fair! I read through all the reviews but some give 5 stars for a product that they have  not bought through that particular seller which means they are getting false reviews</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning your pores. I get enlarged pores and black heads. This product does a great job cleaning your skin and leaving it smooth.</li>
            <li> It kills all my acne with one wash because it is very drying to my skin but causes me to need a lot more moisturizer. It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my blackheads so far however.</li>
            <li> I loved this on my face.  I felt so refreshed and revitalized after I used it.  May purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a gift.  She had it on her wish list.  Love the whole wish list thing...She received the gift as promised, and loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago and I loved it then and I love it now. I have sensitive skin and eczema. I have to be careful what I use because it will either break me out or dry out my skin very easily. I use this every day and my skin is softer,brighter and many of my acne scars are fading in just a week. No lie. I love this stuff. You may need a moisturizer just to fight that \\&quot;tight face\\&quot; feeling. I personally use ponds cold cream afterwards to moisturize and soothe my skin afterwards before I go to bed. I steam my skin first,rub in the scrub for 5-10 minutes (GENTLY) and then rinse with hot water. Afterwards I use the cold cream and rinse with cold water. I really love the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub- no environmentally unfriendly microbeads and no super harsh apricot pit shavings. It provides the perfect level of exfoliation, smells good, and last awhile- you don&#x27;t need much. I&#x27;m a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> The Body Shop has pretty good products and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> love it with the whole seaweed collection. Gentle yet effective and makes my skin feel really clean and nice for the cleanser</li>
