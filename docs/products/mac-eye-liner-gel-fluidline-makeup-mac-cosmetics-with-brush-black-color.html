    <ol>
            <li>i think it is great!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>I apply my make up every day and one bottle lasted me almost a year that is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>For the price I must say it is the best!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>it s a great price she said....</li>
            <li>What an amazing product!</li>
            <li>Over all a good one.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and smudge.</li>
            <li>so if u want to line the water line of the eye, specially the top water line, its great</li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on very smooth and stays on.</li>
            <li>thats sounds appealing to you</li>
            <li>I do love the mac fluidline blacktrack liner but b4</li>
            <li>She will probably like it more</li>
            <li>:) it is rich and creamy</li>
            <li>I love this one since it was easy to apply and it came with handy brush and it smudges very well to create a smokey eye effect.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, and easily.  </li>
            <li>It came in a rectangular box and the the cheap plastic square container is a joke.</li>
            <li>This wins my vote:)</li>
            <li>Smudged right off!</li>
            <li>i loved E.L.F gel liner and it comes in the same contianer as this one.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>i bought it and its not even a little bit of good.</li>
            <li>You can really tell its a premium makeup!</li>
            <li>Real MAC COSMETICS will not provide a brush with their fluidline.</li>
            <li>This cheap knock off is definitely not mac.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy</li>
            <li>but you cannot use too much.</li>
            <li>Okay so MAC fluidline comes in a round pot.</li>
            <li>The brush that it came with is great, the brush is a little thicker brush than what I usually use, but it works well when creating looks where you want a thicker line.</li>
            <li>perfect for smokey eyes, now the only complaint I have is that it smudged a little too well!  </li>
            <li>This is not round.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product was a complete was of my money.</li>
            <li>May be useful for other purpose, but now as liner!</li>

            <li> Please do not buy, this product is FAKE, not a MAC original, I am rating this with a \\&quot;1\\&quot; score since this is unacceptable!</li>
            <li> I was not happy about how often I have smudge marks under my eyes half way through the day I expected more from m.a.c.</li>
            <li> so easy to apply, its waterproof, dries instantly and u can get real thin line to really bold an thick!</li>
            <li> Clearly not what was advertised as what was being sold.</li>
            <li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> you have to be careful what you put so close to your eye.</li>
            <li> This is not real MAC.  </li>
            <li> not what I expected will give to my niece.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be similar to the other Mac eyeliner I had bought previously which also came in a pot with a little brush.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> , then please, purchase this imitation eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You would be better off to get one from EFT for 3 bucks than to get this mystery crap.</li>
            <li> It is not called \\&quot;black color\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Imagine putting black Crisco on your eyelids...</li>
            <li> Leaves a black mess on your eyes and kinda burns.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> This eyeliner is a definite knock-off, not only that, but a bad one.</li>
            <li> i always used pencil and had a hard time with liquid liner.</li>
            <li> around my eyes, not a good look.....</li>
            <li> This product is obviously fake.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy thise item, its fake.</li>
            <li> so fake</li>
            <li> i don t know if this is fake.</li>
            <li> So this leaves me with one conclusion: fake.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t this illegal?</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, so fake...</li>
            <li> this is a fake.</li>
            <li> it is a fake.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product and not real MAC!!</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting MAC quality you&#x27;re bound to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is some made in china crap.</li>
            <li> BAD KNOCK OFF!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is obviously fake. The mac container for fluidlines is not like that and they never have sell the fluidline with an included brush.</li>
            <li> Smudged right off! Terrible quality. May be useful for other purpose, but now as liner!</li>
            <li> I donÂ´t like this product, because it make me cry. It itches me, this just happened to me with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This was counterfeit  Clearly not what was advertised as what was being sold.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product and not real MAC!! Do not buy!!! Waste of money and time.  BAD KNOCK OFF!</li>
            <li> Please do not buy thise item, its fake. trust me. i bought it and its not even a little bit of good. so fake</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and smudge.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be similar to the other Mac eyeliner I had bought previously which also came in a pot with a little brush.&lt;br /&gt;But no while this goes on like a dream it rubs off like a nightmare. I ended up looking like a raccoon with smudges&lt;br /&gt;all around my eyes, not a good look.....</li>
            <li> i don t know if this is fake. but my wife like it. she even tell her friend about it. it s a great price she said....</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this online but i do have this eyeliner!! i think it is great!! i always used pencil and had a hard time with liquid liner. my cousin told me about this and it&#x27;s awesome! so easy to apply, its waterproof, dries instantly and u can get real thin line to really bold an thick! 2 thumbs up on this one!!!</li>
            <li> Okay so MAC fluidline comes in a round pot. This is not round. Also, the box is a square. This box is a rectangle. Fluidline alone cost $15, and the brush costs an additional $18, and they are never sold together. So this leaves me with one conclusion: fake.</li>
            <li> This is some made in china crap. Real MAC COSMETICS will not provide a brush with their fluidline. It is not called \\&quot;black color\\&quot; is is called \\&quot;blacktrack\\&quot; and real mac is in a ROUND glass pot, not a square plastic pot. You would be better off to get one from EFT for 3 bucks than to get this mystery crap. you have to be careful what you put so close to your eye. Who knows what is on the ingredient list here!</li>
            <li> This cheap knock off is definitely not mac. It came in a rectangular box and the the cheap plastic square container is a joke. Mac never packages the gel liner in plastic. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t live without this. This should be in every woman&#x27;s makeup bag. Lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> perfect for smokey eyes, now the only complaint I have is that it smudged a little too well!  It is very creamy so if u want to line the water line of the eye, specially the top water line, its great but you cannot use too much. Over all a good one.</li>
            <li> I love this one since it was easy to apply and it came with handy brush and it smudges very well to create a smokey eye effect. This wins my vote:)</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on very smooth and stays on. I only need apply it in the morning and by evening still there. :) it is rich and creamy I have had no flaking or smudging. I do have sensitive skin and I have got to say no complaints at all. I have also purchased this item twice already. I apply my make up every day and one bottle lasted me almost a year that is awesome!!! For the price I must say it is the best!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my MAC eyeliner gel fluidline makeup!! What an amazing product! Glides on so sleek! You can really tell its a premium makeup!</li>
            <li> Please do not buy, this product is FAKE, not a MAC original, I am rating this with a \\&quot;1\\&quot; score since this is unacceptable! Isn&#x27;t this illegal?</li>
            <li> Imagine putting black Crisco on your eyelids...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If thats sounds appealing to you, then please, purchase this imitation eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, so fake...</li>
            <li> This is not real MAC.  Very disappointed.  Never buying cosmetics online again!!!!  Leaves a black mess on your eyes and kinda burns.</li>
            <li> I do love the mac fluidline blacktrack liner but b4 i used tht i loved E.L.F gel liner and it comes in the same contianer as this one. It also looks like the same liner itself so yeah this is a fake.</li>
            <li> I was not happy about how often I have smudge marks under my eyes half way through the day I expected more from m.a.c.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting MAC quality you&#x27;re bound to be disappointed. This eyeliner is a definite knock-off, not only that, but a bad one. The eyeliner is so smeary and greasy that I felt like I was applying literal oil onto my eye. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, and easily.  The brush that it came with is great, the brush is a little thicker brush than what I usually use, but it works well when creating looks where you want a thicker line.</li>
            <li> This is not a mac eyeliner !</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT it is a fake. It comes in a square container with a brush which A, Mac sells they&#x27;re eye liner in a circle container and B, it came with a brush??? Mac never includes brushes with their products. This product was a complete was of my money. Bull****</li>
            <li> not what I expected will give to my niece. She will probably like it more she loves all types of makeup</li>
