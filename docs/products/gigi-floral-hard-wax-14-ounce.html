            <li>It did as good a job at removing my stubborn hair as the product used at my waxer...</li>
            <li>Honestly, pull whichever way and the hair comes out as well.</li>
            <li>after having my niece do this for me I decided to buy my own and try it myself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>Wax works great, smells pretty</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely but doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Love their products and the prices.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Lovely</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>That is why I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wax, don&#x27;t know what more to say.</li>
            <li>So easy to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I yuor skin is not bad, I love it hope you feel like me</li>
            <li>Another fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I smooth it on my hands and</li>
            <li>I should probably have put this right on top of the list.&lt;br /&gt;Another use of olive oil: replacement for the pre-hon.</li>
            <li>Beware-make sure it isn&#x27;t heated up too much</li>
            <li>It works BUT the Brazilian Body wax works better for more coarse hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Should have read reviews first!</li>
            <li>It always comes right</li>
            <li>I tried using the brazilian hard wax on my legs and hands, and ended up using LOTS of wax because it hardens very quickly, so the spreadability isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>Always exactly what you order.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to spread!</li>
            <li>, if you can&#x27;t pull it, just hold your skin taunt and roll it whichever direction the wax is willing to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays slightly gooey, so it&#x27;s not as effective removing the hair.</li>
            <li>I love it, the hard was is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>But the Floral hard wax is good, too.</li>
            <li>and I really hope they can improve the formula on this one.</li>
            <li>it was much messier (drips etc) and took longer to use.  </li>
            <li>but, I really like this one.</li>
            <li>In my experience, it doesn&#x27;t really affect the hair-pulling effect.</li>
            <li>your skin taunt makes a real difference in the pain</li>
            <li>She waxes my eyebrows with it and it really works.</li>
            <li>Next time I order I&#x27;ll be sure to double check!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a problem with the wax sticking to my skin in the first place, but for those who is worried, rub A LITTLE olive oil over your skin before doing it and the wax comes off much easily.</li>
            <li>Worked as described but still hard to use on yourself :) you need to practice in getting it to be the right temperature</li>
            <li>was new to waxing</li>
            <li>It smells so good, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>It appears to be less painful and it smells better but to get the best out of your hair removal process I would use the Brazilian one - an African American</li>
            <li>I do not, however, love the floral hard wax.</li>
            <li>I love hard wax</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of application,I had zero issues with this being too soft.</li>
            <li>This is more subtle and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell and really hope they can change this one to work as well as other Gigi hard waxes.</li>
            <li>Led to major irritation because the hair wasn&#x27;t removed correctly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While many complained about how it doesn&#x27;t get hard enough, I think they&#x27;ve missed out a fantastic trait.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have to use the method for the Brazilian hard wax because it is easy enough to flick a corner up and pull.</li>
            <li>On top of that I noticed it wasn&#x27;t getting as hard as the other was</li>
            <li>I can take my time spreading it over a large area, so I end up using less wax for the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;*I used the same heating pot for the wax and set at the same temperature, so it isn&#x27;t due to a difference in temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t harden up enough to be pulled off in strips, leaving a sticky mess on your skin which you have to pull or scrape off little by little - this really can hurt on sensitve areas!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the pre-hon before, but I&#x27;ve watched tons of Youtube videos where other users says that the pre-hon is the same as mineral oil or something.</li>
            <li> Use the previous strip you pulled out to stick onto the next strip that you are going to pull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Of course I try to do it, but when I can&#x27;t (sometimes it is just in an awkward position), I just pull it whichever way is comfortable for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The strip wax lasts longer, but it is drastically harder to use on yourself.</li>
            <li> Brazilian hard wax is the first hard wax I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I do use some other brands</li>
            <li> So this method is extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> the shiny side (the side without the hair) against those little pieces of wax</li>
            <li> But I have absolutely no issue with the Floral hard wax.</li>
            <li> It remains too soft, making it difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I see quite a few 1 and 2 star reviews that I don&#x27;t think the product deserve.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not good, or anything like the regular hard wax.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It still doesn&#x27;t get as hard as the Gigi brazilian hard wax, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as sticky or messy as how some other reviewers put</li>
            <li> Man, this stuff has had some harsh reviews!</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gigi hard wax for almost 2 years now</li>
            <li> Yes, it doesn&#x27;t get as hard as the Gigi Brazilian Hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gigi</li>
            <li> prefer this scent to the brazilian hard wax.</li>
            <li> Not the hard wax I was looking for.</li>
            <li> And since it comes off easily, it is less painful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sensitive to smells and to me this stuff smells absolutely awful.  </li>
            <li> When all else fails ...&lt;br /&gt;Roll</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t harden and then it&#x27;s nearly impossible to remove from your skin.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gigi hard wax for almost 2 years now and I love it. I do not, however, love the floral hard wax. It remains too soft, making it difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Not good, or anything like the regular hard wax. It doesn&#x27;t harden and then it&#x27;s nearly impossible to remove from your skin. It smells lovely but doesn&#x27;t work. Led to major irritation because the hair wasn&#x27;t removed correctly.</li>
            <li> I love hard wax and I really hope they can improve the formula on this one. It smells so good, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work very well. It doesn&#x27;t harden enough on the skin. It stays slightly gooey, so it&#x27;s not as effective removing the hair. It does remove some hair, but not all. I love the smell and really hope they can change this one to work as well as other Gigi hard waxes.</li>
            <li> I misread and thought I was buying the Brazilian wax.  I&#x27;m quite sensitive to smells and to me this stuff smells absolutely awful.  On top of that I noticed it wasn&#x27;t getting as hard as the other was I&#x27;m used to using so it was much messier (drips etc) and took longer to use.  Next time I order I&#x27;ll be sure to double check!</li>
            <li> Wax works great, smells pretty</li>
            <li> Worked as described but still hard to use on yourself :) you need to practice in getting it to be the right temperature</li>
            <li> Way to sticky, won&#x27;t come off skin.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice, and the texture of it is manageable. Well made</li>
            <li> Always exactly what you order. Love their products and the prices. I do use some other brands but, I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Another fantastic product. Love, love, love! I see quite a few 1 and 2 star reviews that I don&#x27;t think the product deserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t get as hard as the Gigi Brazilian Hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gigi Brazilian hard wax is the first hard wax I&#x27;ve ever used and I LOVE IT. It&#x27;s easy to use and it works! But the Floral hard wax is good, too. I&#x27;ll write some tips that will help you with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. So easy to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While many complained about how it doesn&#x27;t get hard enough, I think they&#x27;ve missed out a fantastic trait. It is so much easier to spread! I tried using the brazilian hard wax on my legs and hands, and ended up using LOTS of wax because it hardens very quickly, so the spreadability isn&#x27;t good. But I have absolutely no issue with the Floral hard wax. I can take my time spreading it over a large area, so I end up using less wax for the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I used the same heating pot for the wax and set at the same temperature, so it isn&#x27;t due to a difference in temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this scent to the brazilian hard wax. This is more subtle and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, the TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Leave it on longer!&lt;br /&gt;It still doesn&#x27;t get as hard as the Gigi brazilian hard wax, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as sticky or messy as how some other reviewers put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Use the previous strip you pulled out to stick onto the next strip that you are going to pull.&lt;br /&gt;I was new to waxing so I checked out plenty of Youtube videos before trying it myself. And in the videos, they always suggest that you take the shiny part (the part without the hair) of the strip you&#x27;ve just pulled out to stick at the edge of the strip you&#x27;re going to pull, and use that as leverage to pull the next strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have to use the method for the Brazilian hard wax because it is easy enough to flick a corner up and pull. But for this, it is rather sticky, and it tends to roll up. So this method is extremely helpful. It got things moving a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. When all else fails ...&lt;br /&gt;Roll it like a burrito. :) Yes. It pulls out the hair anyway. I don&#x27;t even have to go in the opposite direction of hair growth. Honestly, pull whichever way and the hair comes out as well. That is why I love it. Of course I try to do it, but when I can&#x27;t (sometimes it is just in an awkward position), I just pull it whichever way is comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you can&#x27;t pull it, just hold your skin taunt and roll it whichever direction the wax is willing to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Dealing with the stickiness?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as it is somewhat flexible and sticky. It can get stuck in your nails and leave a sticky residue on your fingers. I didn&#x27;t buy any of the pre-hon or wax-off that Gigi has. I simply use ... OLIVE OIL (for body, not the cooking oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonder. I smooth it on my hands and wherever I&#x27;ve wax to just comfort the skin, and I realize that it removes all the stickiness in my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Tiny pieces of wax won&#x27;t come off?&lt;br /&gt;Use the strips you&#x27;ve just pulled out! Stick or even rub (since it&#x27;s rather flexible) the shiny side (the side without the hair) against those little pieces of wax that&#x27;s stuck against your skin. It may take just once or a couple of times, but it does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The wax still refuses to come off?&lt;br /&gt;Well then, I&#x27;ll douse a piece of tissue with olive oil and rubbed it against the wax. It always comes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. I should probably have put this right on top of the list.&lt;br /&gt;Another use of olive oil: replacement for the pre-hon. I&#x27;ve never used the pre-hon before, but I&#x27;ve watched tons of Youtube videos where other users says that the pre-hon is the same as mineral oil or something. Since I have olive oil, I gave that a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a problem with the wax sticking to my skin in the first place, but for those who is worried, rub A LITTLE olive oil over your skin before doing it and the wax comes off much easily. In my experience, it doesn&#x27;t really affect the hair-pulling effect. And since it comes off easily, it is less painful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Pulling your skin taunt makes a real difference in the pain factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This product is great ,the smell that stay I yuor skin is not bad, I love it hope you feel like me once you buy it..</li>
            <li> It glues to your fingers when peeling it of and there is no way to get it out!!! Very messy. Sometimes it glues to the skin of the area you want to wax and peels your skin of. Horrible!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wax, don&#x27;t know what more to say. Bought the wax and the Gigi warmer for my wife and she loves them. It works awesome. She waxes my eyebrows with it and it really works.</li>
            <li> Quite dissapointed in this wax. Should have read reviews first! It doesn&#x27;t harden up enough to be pulled off in strips, leaving a sticky mess on your skin which you have to pull or scrape off little by little - this really can hurt on sensitve areas!! Pleasent smell but i&#x27;m not going to be using it again...</li>
            <li> It works BUT the Brazilian Body wax works better for more coarse hair like mine. It appears to be less painful and it smells better but to get the best out of your hair removal process I would use the Brazilian one - an African American</li>
            <li> after having my niece do this for me I decided to buy my own and try it myself.  I love it, the hard was is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Man, this stuff has had some harsh reviews! Once I got the hang of application,I had zero issues with this being too soft. It did as good a job at removing my stubborn hair as the product used at my waxer... Only downside is that I went through the entire tub for my lower legs, bikini line, and underarms. The strip wax lasts longer, but it is drastically harder to use on yourself. Really happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> I use this wax on my underarm hair. Beware-make sure it isn&#x27;t heated up too much or else it will be a disaster.</li>
            <li> Not the hard wax I was looking for.</li>
