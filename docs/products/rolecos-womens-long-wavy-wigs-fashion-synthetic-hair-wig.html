            <li>Nice amount of material.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product that is of great quality.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was better quality.</li>
            <li>Great condition and a natural look.</li>
            <li>It fits great, looks just as it is pictured, and many people thought it was my actual hair!</li>
            <li>so it worked fine.</li>
            <li>really cheap  cant be styled</li>
            <li>Hair was not as full as the picture represented.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t style to look better no hard I tried</li>
            <li>after I brushed it out a little it was perfect, Its more platinum blonde then</li>
            <li>and it was much more yellow.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Not like picture, more yellow.</li>
            <li>The quality seemed OK, it might have worked for a different outfit, but not for me!</li>
            <li>it arrived in perfcet condition, was soft , natural and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The curls were much tighter than the picture</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for a Cosplay and it was better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>It stays in place very well and isn&#x27;t too itchy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a decent quality</li>
            <li>More of a low quality Halloween wig than regular use or cosplay.</li>
            <li>i used it in my golden greek goddess halloween make up tutorial</li>
            <li>The wig I recieved is more of a strawberry blonde not light golden blonde in the picture.</li>
            <li>I ended up not having to wear a cap as my hair color isn&#x27;t too dark and the wig has full coverage.</li>
            <li>It was suuuuper super curly, it looked a little cartoonish, I didn&#x27;t even up wearing it.</li>

            <li> It did not look like photo at all. Crappy wig really wide wefts. More of a low quality Halloween wig than regular use or cosplay. You get what you pay for...I just wish it was better quality.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t stand how the whole front is just thick bangs. Can&#x27;t style to look better no hard I tried</li>
            <li> Yellow hair not blonde</li>
            <li> I bought this for a cinderella costume and the wig is not the color pictured. The wig I recieved is more of a strawberry blonde not light golden blonde in the picture. I will try to find some hair chalk or something or just buy another wig somewhere else. Nice feel to the wig but extremly diassapointed with the color</li>
            <li> This wig is perfect! It fits great, looks just as it is pictured, and many people thought it was my actual hair! It stays in place very well and isn&#x27;t too itchy. Overall a great product that is of great quality. My only complaint is that it came with a wig cap...except the cap was black! I ended up not having to wear a cap as my hair color isn&#x27;t too dark and the wig has full coverage. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the product its cheaply made and looks nothing like the picture do not buy</li>
            <li> The color of the wig is definitely darker that what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Item pictured was not like the item received</li>
            <li> Nice amount of material.</li>
