            <li>May be a great product but the one I got had no plastic covering or foil over the makeup.</li>
            <li>Great product for costume make-up.</li>
            <li>I cannot even say how happy I am with this</li>
            <li>It is a great make-up for us Goths</li>
            <li>This honestly does help lighten my foundation and makes a perfect match for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The packaging was great and came with no problems</li>
            <li>great coverage, not cakey, doesn&#x27;t make me oily.</li>
            <li>I keep seeing all these reviews that say how great it is blended with foundation...</li>
            <li>Great seller, great product.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of giving me the results I want</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to find a solution that doesn&#x27;t leave me pasty or orange.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>LOVE iT!!</li>
            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a test to see if it would work for me and am pleased to say that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to adjust the color of all my foundations to a perfect match.  </li>
            <li>This foundation is awesome for mixing into those foundations that you love, but don&#x27;t quite match your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consistency: semi full coverage, blends out great and sets with powder perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product is a huge money saver cause it gives you the power to buy ivory or porcelain drug store items that are too warm/tan/yellow and make them the perfect color.</li>
            <li>This is perfect if you have really light skin.</li>
            <li>good price too.</li>
            <li>, it might be a good idea to consider a setting spray instead.</li>
            <li>and my foundation still has good coverage.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Really good for mixing with it with a skin tone foundation.</li>
            <li>but it will emphasize fair skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is fairly even so</li>
            <li>Smooth, silky, mixes perfectly with my foundations</li>
            <li>Will probably not repurchase, even though it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>Can I get an amen for the fact this product is also VEGAN and has good ingredients too?</li>
            <li>fairly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I emailed them and they gave me a full refund and told me to keep the product!!!</li>
            <li>THEYRE AMAZING AND KIND!</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is very light weight which is awesome because I do not wear makeup</li>
            <li>Minus)I think this product is an exceptional value.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps someone in need of having the perfect fair complexion with confidence and for those just trying to find their right foundation color.</li>
            <li>For that purpose it works absolutely great, and I&#x27;m sure I will repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Manic Panic&#x27;s products, and i was thinking about buying this for quite a while, and heard about all the great reviews about.</li>
            <li>One pump goes a long way, blends perfectly into my covergirl and provides me with a flawless face!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, and could probably be used as a highlight if you&#x27;re extremely fair skinned.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Now, I mix in a bit of this magic stuff until i get my desired shade, and voila!</li>
            <li>It is pretty tricky trying to figure out the perfect ratio of this product and your foundation or concealer.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I also love the pump!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely lovely!  </li>
            <li>I love!</li>
            <li>This foundation is great for quickly lightening up my foundations!</li>
            <li>i use this on my body and it looks great, a tip, spray a light bit of hairspray over your shoulders if you apply it there</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Over-all the product is amazing, I will repurchase and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, it&#x27;s amazing at what it&#x27;s suppose to do: lighten another foundation.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like it does much, but when paired with the creme foundation or even your own, it works wonders!!!</li>
            <li>it does have a chalky kind of feel to it after drying</li>
            <li>would have liked something a bit softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>and it blended nicely.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Easily my most used and loved beauty product I own.</li>
            <li>I have a yellow-green undertone, and I&#x27;m very oily, and I have the perfect foundation for when I am tan, so</li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s on the runny side.</li>
            <li>It ends up looking flawless and very porcelain.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>honestly I feel like it used to be thicker.</li>
            <li>I decided to quit the search and just blend my own.</li>
            <li>The container is high-quality glass with a nice pump for dispensing the foundation.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, glad I got it.</li>
            <li>They were so nice about it.</li>
            <li>I also have a combination of oily to normal skin, and it goes on perfect.</li>
            <li>Love mixing this with any foundation, makes it the absolute perfect shade for me!</li>
            <li>For best results you have to be sure to blend it very well.</li>
            <li>You can use it on just your skin to lighten your natural skin or mix it in with your foundation to create your perfect shade.</li>
            <li>So for me, this is best used to just gently lighten an already light foundation.</li>
            <li>Great because you can build up the intensity of the whiteness depending how much you apply!</li>
            <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Its great to mix in with any foundation both matte and dewy and its perfect for pale girls :</li>
            <li>Have used this for years now and find that it works well for my very light complexation.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product through a fellow woman who has acne prone skin and has a super fair complexion.</li>
            <li>I always come back to this seller; very quick, courteous, and best priced.</li>
            <li>oh.. and the packaging is so cute.</li>
            <li>i love the bats :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s many rave reviews.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite makeup ever.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>i used this to lighten my foundation, but it needs more pigmenting.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t change the consistency &amp; even adds MORE coverage.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but I do believe it could have arrived in a better state.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love, love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The top was intact and secured.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also could have been packaged better...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Or maybe it&#x27;s the adorable bat design.</li>
            <li>Perfect for mixing with a regular darker pigment to lighten it.</li>
            <li>I quite enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>This product, when mixed with my foundation, BB cream, or concealer, makes the colour match me perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have very white skin and mix it with my foundation for a perfect match.</li>
            <li>Will always be repurchasing. :)</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>The ingredient lists don&#x27;t help because this seems to be water-based, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I love what it does to the color of my foundation, but my skin cannot handle i .</li>
            <li>(I have so many of them).  </li>
            <li>Outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, so I was glad to find this brand.</li>
            <li>Even more glad that I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I bought this foundation to use as a mixer to lighten foundations, since I&#x27;m paler than most companies cater to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a mixer to lighten foundations to see if those work better.</li>
            <li>and i fell in love with it</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients and found out why: this foundation is oil based (contains jojoba oil) whereas most drug store foundations are silicone based.</li>
            <li>I also do not notice it making my skin any more oily, but I will see how it behaves this summer.</li>
            <li>I feel so much more confident now that my face truly matches the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>Its no clown makeup but a nice light almost translucent like foundation.</li>
            <li>Manic Panic says you can mix this up to 1:1 ratio (50%/50%) with your favorite foundation without changing the consistency or finish.</li>
            <li>I love this product-</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff does the job :)</li>
            <li>I like it for the most part</li>
            <li>but some days are better than others with this one.</li>
            <li>I love Manic Panic as a company</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This makeup makes me see better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, I&#x27;m so in love.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more so watery</li>
            <li>So, make sure you exfoliate and use lotion before applying.</li>
            <li>Using this, I&#x27;m able to lighten foundations that I love the coverage of and don&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vegan, cruelty free, and comes in a nice glass bottle.</li>
            <li>and i found it more helpful a face primer than without.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about the arrival of this item, but when I opened the package I found that there was no plastic lid to cover the spout so makeup was EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>It is the best purchase I have made in a long time.  </li>
            <li>The product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to mix/lighten your foundation with a product that still has a HINT of color to it, I would recommend the Graftobian HD Glamour Creme Palettes in the shade Ultra Lites, which comes in a range of warm, cool and neutral undertones in it.</li>
            <li>it is great to mix with another foundation to make the color match a lighter skin tone, but if you are wanting to use this by itself, it is very very watery and light light coverage.</li>
            <li>I can never get the right shade but now with this I can make my own:)</li>
            <li>I am not quite porcelain light, but I have a very light complexion.</li>
            <li>I was able to mix this perfectly with regular foundation and FINALLY have results that make me happy.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and the majority of the foundations I own are too dark for me.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and have never been able to find a foundation light enough and always end up with an orangey color.</li>
            <li>I mix this with my ivory colored make up to make it more light.  </li>
            <li>It is a lovely smooth application.</li>
            <li>Love this product...wish Anemic we&#x27;re available in this liquid form.  </li>
            <li>You know, this stuff is really cool!</li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s perfect for blending foundations.</li>
            <li>My dream come true!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin (redhead) and I could never find a foundation that was light enough for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Easily mixes with liquid or cream bases and has never broke me out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone with extremely fair skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only foundation that does not make my skin appear orange it also blends very nicely :)</li>
            <li>I bought it to mix with my Dark foundations and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>it works out fine.</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I got it for that reason, and for when I am doing vintage style makeup and really want that super fair look.  </li>
            <li>This white is great if you are super fair skinned and really like to play that up.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really stay on fabulously, but if u aren&#x27;t going at your own face with an ice scraper throughout the day, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>Also, a HUGE problem for me was that it took over two weeks for me to get this.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great once mixed in with a light foundation.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and mixes well.</li>
            <li>, it mixes well, and it&#x27;s awesome for everyday and costume wear.</li>
            <li>Oh and did I mention it is CRUELTY FREE AND VEGAN?</li>
            <li>This works great as a color corrector and also supplies extra coverage.</li>
            <li>This Manic Panic foundation is literally WHITE, but it does blend very nicely and also offers good coverage.  </li>
            <li>A ration of 1:1 is perfect for my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t make me look pale.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much some2buy!!!</li>
            <li>i love this foundation first time buying it</li>
            <li>This also works great to lighten a summer foundation to use all winter long as well.</li>
            <li>AWESOME for pale girls, i use this every day, cant imagine how i wore foundation before this!</li>
            <li>It got to me quickly and completely secure.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but takes some practice getting familiar with it.</li>
            <li>I am wearing it right now!</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t purchase again, but it does seem like it&#x27;ll last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I love it so much &amp;#</li>
            <li>it can wrapped very well and even though I would not call my self a &amp;#34;goth girl&amp;#34; I took my Fatal Impact sticker and hung it my cubicle at work &#x3D;).</li>
            <li>I never thought i&#x27;d find a foundation that would work for me since i also needed it to be full coverage.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a good white foundation, skip this and go with MAC.</li>
            <li>I prefer medium to full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>really helpful for anyone with light skin!</li>
            <li>Very runny, doesn&#x27;t stay applied very well and tends to clump real easy and quick</li>
            <li>I have an incredible struggle trying to find the correct foundation color for my incredibly pale skin tone.</li>
            <li>I thought at first perhaps the runny consistency was because the bottle had gotten warm in the mailbox, so i made sure it was cool and shook the bottle for attempt 2, same issue.</li>
            <li>came and not only does it stay on beautifully, but it evens out my skintone super well and feels so smooth and soft....</li>
            <li>; i had free shipping and it arrived so fast and secure...</li>
            <li>This does help to lighten my makeup, but it&#x27;s super liquid-y.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft and  smooth and feeling lovely.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li>its your gosh darn super power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it goes on nicely for really pale skin like my own.</li>
            <li>but I guess someone complained to the right person because it came to me in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>I tried applying several separate times with my fingers, a sponge, a flat foundation brush and a stippling brush and the stippling brush gave the best results.</li>
            <li>The color is great for lightening other foundations or applying right over the skin.</li>
            <li>Mix and play around with your foundations  tell you you fine the exact right shade.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to mix with other foundation and it stays looking nice all day.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and have only found one other super light foundation that matches my skin tone, and that is MAC studio fix liquid in NW13.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re worried about wrinkles and stuff i definitely recommend a nice primer because this settles.</li>
            <li>Good product, but doesn&#x27;t keep to it&#x27;s color as well as I expected</li>
            <li>And handy to have for Halloween which is next month!  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to find foundation light enough for my skin- besides Mary Kay</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those of you pale ladies who struggle to find the perfect foundation for your light skin, look no further!</li>
            <li>so when i heard about this from youtuber thataylaa (if you&#x27;re pale &amp; into makeup videos, SUB to her &amp;#60;3, you&#x27;re welcome in advance)</li>
            <li>As someone who is too pale for even the lightest color foundation, this product is great.</li>
            <li>This is a really great balancing color for people with pale skin tones.</li>
            <li>This has been great to add to the two that I can wear to help pale them out.</li>
            <li>I mix this in a 1/3 mixture with 1/3 of two other foundations to be a good tint/color match.</li>
            <li>I have never ever found another foundation as good, for mixing with other foundations too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lightens my foundation to the right shade with ease.</li>
            <li>However, I often just mix it up right before application</li>
            <li>I purchased it to tone down my regular foundation for a Halloween costume and it worked great!</li>
            <li>I can see this being wonderful if you only need to slightly lighten a foundation</li>
            <li>I tried adding this to my normal foundation to lighten it, and it does lighten it, but it also alters the texture to be cheap and chalky</li>
            <li>This is great for mixing in with foundation if you&#x27;re exceptionally pale!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my pale skin days or works wonders when mixed in with a foundation to lighten it.</li>
            <li>I bought this foundation for helping with full white face make up for cosplaying, and it is good, its very white however you do have to pack on this liquid foundation</li>
            <li>If you really want a white foundation that has a very strong pigment I&#x27;d suggest getting the &amp;#34;Goth White&amp;#34; Powder Cream Foundation instead</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all either too light or too dark but mixing a little of this with my darker foundations really has helped me get my perfect shade.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>This foundation has saved me so much money!</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well</li>
            <li>im more Snow White.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product through a youtube video</li>
            <li>So i ordered it and it came pretty fast!</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly as featured.</li>
            <li>The bottle was so gothic and pretty.</li>
            <li>This is better than the generic white makeup found in many Halloween kits.</li>
            <li>Either way I love this product and will definitely re-purchase.</li>
            <li>I have tried higher end</li>
            <li>And it agrees very well with even the oiliest acne prone skin like mine!</li>
            <li>With Dreamtone I can achieve the exact match I need and its consistency is indeed DREAMY.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, the shipping took forever.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and will probably purchase more until I run out or find my white whale: a foundation that actually matches my skin color.</li>
            <li>Manic Panic White Dreamtone: You&#x27;ll be able to see like</li>
            <li>It actually makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li>First off: this is NOT intended as a stand-alone foundation.</li>
            <li>Not on a hot day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal for me though, because it works beautifully when mixed with other foundations, and that&#x27;s what I got it for :)</li>
            <li>Many people asked me if i was ok because i had a strange white tint to my face,</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin and even with the absolute lightest foundation I can find, it is still much too dark.</li>
            <li>Great for the pale princesses out there!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m an extremely fair skinned person, and white out makeup tends to look much more natural than any other type of foundation or powder.</li>
            <li>This foundation also makes my blush stay on really well :)Since the alternatives are around $40 for a white foundation</li>
            <li>instead of wasting money trying to scout a new foundation that&#x27;s light enough for me, I just mix this Manic Panic foundation in and it makes it exactly the shade I need!!</li>
            <li>It is pretty runny, but I didn&#x27;t see that it affected the foundation much when applying it.</li>
            <li>I love this because it&#x27;s the only white foundation available to me, but</li>
            <li>im also really fair skinned and have a lot of trouble finding make up that is light enough</li>
            <li>I would end up looking like a circus clown but on the contrary the color is not an overwhelming white but a nice pale one.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny squirt too, so it will last me for a good while before I need to repurchase!</li>
            <li>First time I use a foundation that was light enough for me!</li>
            <li>This can be used sparingly to lighten a foundation, but once you pass a certain ratio, it changes the foundations texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it can easily make you look WAY too white if you accidentally use too much of it.</li>
            <li>overall, i really love this and a i think a majority of my pale princesses and those who can&#x27;t exactly get their correct shade will really love this.</li>
            <li>It came early and very secure, its just as described and fits well on my paper white skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, my foundation stays exactly the same, just now my right shade!</li>
            <li>My daughter says this is perfect to mix with other foundation when you have a very pale complexion.</li>
            <li>All in all, I do really like this product</li>
            <li>I got this to mix with my too-dark foundations, but the formula didn&#x27;t really work with any of them.</li>
            <li>i like that its vegan, and it blends really well.</li>
            <li>, it blends very well with my skin tone though.</li>
            <li>I looked very unnatural.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li>Of course you have to measure it well and match it to your skintone, but it works very well.</li>
            <li>I end up with really intense, under the skin break outs every time that I try to use it.</li>
            <li>Dreamtone really IS dreamy.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;THANKYOU</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap/sticky and covers really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It does not dilute the coverage and the consistency is very blendable.</li>
            <li>I really wish that it was a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>some pros: it is indeed white, it aplies rather smoothly, it blends</li>
            <li>but i really like it for mixing into my foundation and making it closer to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>but it is really watery</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since its watery the foundation will apply really patchy.</li>
            <li>I also use &amp;#34;maybelline fit me matte and poreless translucent powder&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;stargazer white pressed powder&amp;#34; as my setting powders.</li>
            <li>Pretty good to make dark foundation lighter though, especially during the months when I tend to get lighter (winter)</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I also tried using it &#x27;as is&#x27; for highlighting, but couldn&#x27;t achieve a good result, as the formula applies somewhat unevenly and patchy when used on its own (at least on my skin...).</li>
            <li>One of the best uses I have seen is cutting a foundation that is a little dark, which can be useful if you are someone who is more fair in the winter and does not want to keep buying different colors.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really change the consistency of my foundations, other than making them have a more mousse texture, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the price is great.  </li>
            <li>It smells a lot better to me than other foundation,</li>
            <li>and I got so excited because I thought I finally found something to help me with my foundation problems.</li>
            <li>The thing I really love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have that offsetting yellowish tone that some other products of foundations can have.</li>
            <li>It works so well to lighten my normal concealer!</li>
            <li>Mac may cost more, but it will last for an extremely long time and is well worth the price difference.</li>
            <li>Love it to mix into my other</li>
            <li>However, I wish it was a bit more pigmented, as I have to add at least a full pump to get the color results I want</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a little bit of figuring out how much of the manic panic dreamtone you will need vs your foundation (i usually do 50/50) but once that happens this will be your new best friend!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It dries and looks like chalk, and really only looks good if you take one pump and rub it in over a large patch of skin (like your arm) as if it were a moisturizer, so if you just want a pale body foundation go for it.  </li>
            <li>did not hinder my setting powder either, and lasted the full 8 hours I worked outside in heat index 108 degree weather</li>
            <li>I still get full coverage even mixing equal parts.</li>
            <li>I am super pale and can&#x27;t seem to find any makeup that will fit my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Wow this product actually matches my skin tone and makes me feel happy with being pale.</li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s difficult to find foundations that don&#x27;t make me break out and still match my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This has saved so many foundations for me that I had previously thought I could never wear.  </li>
            <li>I mixed this with my regular foundation, but found that it wasn&#x27;t opaque enough on its own to really make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I purchased a white powder at the same time that has much better coverage.</li>
            <li>I have found that it makes my foundation more mattifying than I prefer, so I add facial oils to the mix and it brings it back to my preferred texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>And this looks alot more white along with a white face powder.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t mix easily with other foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead, so naturally I&#x27;m the fairest of them all, haha</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used this enough to say much about it, but for the times i have it has worked really well.</li>
            <li>so I mix this product with my normal foundation to make the perfecr color.</li>
            <li>If you need to lighten your concealer or even just use it as your normal concealer</li>
            <li>I love this makeup, it&#x27;s a pale girl</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this again, though I probably won&#x27;t have to for a very long time. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very pale skinned girl, and as with many other girls with my skin tone, it&#x27;s very hard to find a foundation in the store that comes close to or perfectly matches the color of your skin.</li>
            <li>I can finally wear foundation and have it look right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to being about 3-4 shades darker than I currently am, and haven&#x27;t found the right foundation for me that can accommodate all that my skin needs.</li>
            <li>If this ends up being too pale for you, it is also great for lightening previously purchased foundations.</li>
            <li>I have more pink than yellow in my skin and most makeups that are pale</li>
            <li>only wish it was available in Australia locally.</li>
            <li>Really a must have for pale or light complexions</li>
            <li>a I very far</li>
            <li>I can say that I have very sensitive skin with exzema and severe allergies and the manic panic brand cosmetics do not give me any problems.  </li>
            <li>The reason I still gave this 3 stars, is that it is a nice sheer and pale foundation on</li>
            <li>Pretty gross and unattractive, if you ask me.</li>
            <li>The lightest shades available are always to dark.  </li>
            <li>The prodect at first looks as if it would be white circus makeup</li>
            <li>I was super scared about trying this and not have it mix with my other high end foundation.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and trying to find a foundation that matches me is nearly impossible.</li>
            <li>I mix it to about a 50/50 ratio with my foundation, sometimes I do more white toner than foundation when I want to look a little more pale</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find light enough foundations in the right tint!</li>
            <li>how pale I am and this has made my wish come true!</li>
            <li>(I love to look very pale).</li>
            <li>The only fault is that the white will stick much more to dry skin.</li>
            <li>(Illamasqua pure white,</li>
            <li>If you want to mix it with another foundation it will work, and if you already have flawless skin and you just want to be perfectly pale then go for it, but if you have even slightly dry skin or a couple blemishes this stuff sucks.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is an average foundation size with a pump that gives just the right amount of product needed!</li>
            <li>This is very handy to have if you are very pale and have trouble finding matches in drugstore or even highend foundations.</li>
            <li>With this stuff, it looks like my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>I recommend to vamps, ghouls and all goth girls who may want to either blend to get their preferred shade, or to those who want to lighten their natural skin tone up a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it the same way, and it really works.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction.</li>
            <li>Like I said earlier, I am very oily, and the humid Texas heat puts any foundation to the test.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t seem to change my regular foundation much at all.</li>
            <li>THIS FIXED</li>
            <li>It seems that many people posting negative reviews dont know this.</li>
            <li>This is a great foundation mixer for pale skintones who have trouble finding foundation matches, especially from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff to lighten up my foundations that arnt quite pale enough for me.</li>
            <li>but im ethnic so pale for me is lightly tan</li>
            <li>I bought it back in November 2012, used it pretty much every single day, and just finished it in July of 2013.</li>
            <li>or it won&#x27;t come out even, and does not cover blemishes or dark spots well, plus you will run out quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true white, not a pale skin tone, and the consistency is such that it could probably be layered to create an opaque white skin tone.</li>
            <li>I liked to use this when highlighting my cheekbones or when correcting tones of other pale makeup I have.</li>
            <li>Wow, finally, the dread of putting on foundation that is too dark, too light,</li>
            <li>I love being ghostly white, so simply making do with something too dark was NOT an option.</li>
            <li>This liquid foundation is very VERY runny, it doesn&#x27;t really cover well and needs to be applied dried and layered to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because beauty guru and general all round flippin awesome human being, ThatTaylaa (youtube) used it on her pale skin with other foundations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very, very, very pale to begin with and no foundation matches since I&#x27;m so fair, so for the longest time I&#x27;ve been working with the wrong colors, trying to lighten them up with white eye shadow on top to set the liquid foundation</li>
            <li>I mix it with MAC&#x27;s match master foundation in 1.0 (obviously the palest one) and it looks exactly like my actual skin tone.</li>
            <li>I typically add about one pump of this to one pump of foundation,and it makes my foundation light enough to match my skintone.  </li>
            <li>For people as white as me, there are only a few cosmetic brands that carry light enough foundation, and they are around $30~$50, or higher.</li>
            <li>I tried using it with a foundation that was a couple shades darker than what I would normally wear, you know for the summer when you&#x27;re a little more tanned, and I noticed that even when working with the amount of the Manic Panic along with the foundation, it just kept coming out an odd color that still didn&#x27;t match my skin.</li>
            <li>foundation is absolutely pure white, very concentrated, and it is pretty thick.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to add to my current foundation as I find most don&#x27;t seem to be pale enough for me</li>
            <li>I mixed up a large batch and put it in a different container for travel.</li>
            <li>When i mixed it together, it had a very unnatural white tint to it!!!!!</li>
            <li>no regrets here!</li>
            <li>This is the first foundation I have found that allows my other foundation to match my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only can it be used with liquid foundation, I even use it with a heavy coverage stick foundation, I just put some of the stick foundation on my face, then I apply the same amount (or more) of the white, and then spread it on my face until it&#x27;s blended.</li>
            <li>All of the ingredients are safe for skin, and there are no free radical damage causing ingredients (which cause premature aging of skin) like alcohol, fragrance, or other irritants.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am still satisfied with my purchase, but I must continue my search for a foundation corrector that doesn&#x27;t cost a ridiculous amount of money.</li>
            <li>My older skin has sun damage and is now a different shade from my too white neck.  </li>
            <li>It has to be the middle of summer for me to look natural in foundation.</li>
            <li>Even the lightest foundations are too dark, but thanks to this I can buy any one I want and not need to worry!</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice thus far, so I will not know how my skin reacts for another week or so.</li>
            <li>Upon first looking at this product I expected it to come out as milk white as the liquid looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most affordable color corrector out there that I&#x27;ve found and I will probably repurchase, but it was just frustrating to use.</li>
            <li>if you have pretty pale clear skin</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast - I use this as a base to mix with other liquid foundations, as I am very fair skinned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thin almost translusent on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>A lot of people say it mixes really well with other foundations to lighten them.  </li>
            <li>so i have to apply alot, that leaves patches and streaks, its REALLY runny, and the pump nozzle sucks and sprays it everywhere when you press it, it also wears out fast.</li>
            <li>It also gives a sheer wash of white but offers no coverage.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re naturally paler or want to lighten this just a bit, definitely use a coat of this after a coat of the Revlon ColorStay stuff I was talking about earlier because they both work phenomenally.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s good that it really melts into your skin, as I hate cakey makeup, but it just lacks the pigmentation that I wanted.</li>
            <li>I mix 3 dabs of this with a half pump of light (but still way too dark for me</li>
            <li>Purchased because of it being cruelty free to add to my foundation which is still too dark for my skin slightly.</li>
            <li>the liquid had been dried up and when I first started trying to pump it out, it wouldn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of trouble finding my right shade of foundation, especially since I only purchase drug store products.</li>
            <li>First of all I am seriously pale.</li>
            <li>Im pretty pale</li>
            <li>do you have dark circles under your eyes, concealer and sunglases will only cover so much?</li>
            <li>So being a really pale woman, i am always getting the lightest shade of foundation available only to find that it is WAY too dark for me, makes me look orange or just does not match my skin tone</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it works perfectly</li>
            <li> I decided to add this product to my Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation until I reached the correct shade and it works great!</li>
            <li> Flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Her makeup is always flawless and she credits this.</li>
            <li> This product arrived before my estimated delivery date and it is very good!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> I add a couple drops of this with a touch of my foundation and get the perfect color.</li>
            <li> Would make a perfect halloween foundation!</li>
            <li> and it came out perfectly.</li>
            <li> It blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> which is great!</li>
            <li> They work amazing as a team and both deserve the credit!!!</li>
            <li> but now I don&#x27;t have that problem! :D</li>
            <li> However, blended with my liquid foundation, it worked perfectly to lighten the makeup and match my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It work marvelously.</li>
            <li> I can never find the perfect shade foundation.</li>
            <li> All together it is a flawless look that does not oxidize at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and I like to mix this ~1:1</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin</li>
            <li> used for cosplay and loved it!</li>
            <li> and it blends in beautifully</li>
            <li> May be a great product but the one I got had no plastic covering or foil over the makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product for costume make-up.</li>
            <li> I cannot even say how happy I am with this</li>
            <li> It is a great make-up for us Goths</li>
            <li> This honestly does help lighten my foundation and makes a perfect match for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The packaging was great and came with no problems</li>
            <li> great coverage, not cakey, doesn&#x27;t make me oily.</li>
            <li> I keep seeing all these reviews that say how great it is blended with foundation...</li>
            <li> Great seller, great product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of giving me the results I want</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find a solution that doesn&#x27;t leave me pasty or orange.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> LOVE iT!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a test to see if it would work for me and am pleased to say that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to adjust the color of all my foundations to a perfect match.  </li>
            <li> This foundation is awesome for mixing into those foundations that you love, but don&#x27;t quite match your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Consistency: semi full coverage, blends out great and sets with powder perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product is a huge money saver cause it gives you the power to buy ivory or porcelain drug store items that are too warm/tan/yellow and make them the perfect color.</li>
            <li> This is perfect if you have really light skin.</li>
            <li> good price too.</li>
            <li> , it might be a good idea to consider a setting spray instead.</li>
            <li> and my foundation still has good coverage.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Really good for mixing with it with a skin tone foundation.</li>
            <li> but it will emphasize fair skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is fairly even so</li>
            <li> Smooth, silky, mixes perfectly with my foundations</li>
            <li> Will probably not repurchase, even though it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Can I get an amen for the fact this product is also VEGAN and has good ingredients too?</li>
            <li> fairly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I emailed them and they gave me a full refund and told me to keep the product!!!</li>
            <li> THEYRE AMAZING AND KIND!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is very light weight which is awesome because I do not wear makeup</li>
            <li> Minus)I think this product is an exceptional value.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone in need of having the perfect fair complexion with confidence and for those just trying to find their right foundation color.</li>
            <li> For that purpose it works absolutely great, and I&#x27;m sure I will repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Manic Panic&#x27;s products, and i was thinking about buying this for quite a while, and heard about all the great reviews about.</li>
            <li> One pump goes a long way, blends perfectly into my covergirl and provides me with a flawless face!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, and could probably be used as a highlight if you&#x27;re extremely fair skinned.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Now, I mix in a bit of this magic stuff until i get my desired shade, and voila!</li>
            <li> It is pretty tricky trying to figure out the perfect ratio of this product and your foundation or concealer.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I also love the pump!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely lovely!  </li>
            <li> I love!</li>
            <li> This foundation is great for quickly lightening up my foundations!</li>
            <li> i use this on my body and it looks great, a tip, spray a light bit of hairspray over your shoulders if you apply it there</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> Over-all the product is amazing, I will repurchase and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, it&#x27;s amazing at what it&#x27;s suppose to do: lighten another foundation.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like it does much, but when paired with the creme foundation or even your own, it works wonders!!!</li>
            <li> it does have a chalky kind of feel to it after drying</li>
            <li> would have liked something a bit softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> and it blended nicely.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Easily my most used and loved beauty product I own.</li>
            <li> I have a yellow-green undertone, and I&#x27;m very oily, and I have the perfect foundation for when I am tan, so</li>
            <li> On it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s on the runny side.</li>
            <li> It ends up looking flawless and very porcelain.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> honestly I feel like it used to be thicker.</li>
            <li> I decided to quit the search and just blend my own.</li>
            <li> The container is high-quality glass with a nice pump for dispensing the foundation.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, glad I got it.</li>
            <li> They were so nice about it.</li>
            <li> I also have a combination of oily to normal skin, and it goes on perfect.</li>
            <li> Love mixing this with any foundation, makes it the absolute perfect shade for me!</li>
            <li> For best results you have to be sure to blend it very well.</li>
            <li> You can use it on just your skin to lighten your natural skin or mix it in with your foundation to create your perfect shade.</li>
            <li> So for me, this is best used to just gently lighten an already light foundation.</li>
            <li> Great because you can build up the intensity of the whiteness depending how much you apply!</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Its great to mix in with any foundation both matte and dewy and its perfect for pale girls :</li>
            <li> Have used this for years now and find that it works well for my very light complexation.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through a fellow woman who has acne prone skin and has a super fair complexion.</li>
            <li> I always come back to this seller; very quick, courteous, and best priced.</li>
            <li> oh.. and the packaging is so cute.</li>
            <li> i love the bats :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s many rave reviews.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup ever.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> i used this to lighten my foundation, but it needs more pigmenting.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t change the consistency &amp; even adds MORE coverage.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but I do believe it could have arrived in a better state.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love, love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The top was intact and secured.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also could have been packaged better...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Or maybe it&#x27;s the adorable bat design.</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixing with a regular darker pigment to lighten it.</li>
            <li> I quite enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> This product, when mixed with my foundation, BB cream, or concealer, makes the colour match me perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have very white skin and mix it with my foundation for a perfect match.</li>
            <li> Will always be repurchasing. :)</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> The ingredient lists don&#x27;t help because this seems to be water-based, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I love what it does to the color of my foundation, but my skin cannot handle i .</li>
            <li> (I have so many of them).  </li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, so I was glad to find this brand.</li>
            <li> Even more glad that I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation to use as a mixer to lighten foundations, since I&#x27;m paler than most companies cater to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a mixer to lighten foundations to see if those work better.</li>
            <li> and i fell in love with it</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients and found out why: this foundation is oil based (contains jojoba oil) whereas most drug store foundations are silicone based.</li>
            <li> I also do not notice it making my skin any more oily, but I will see how it behaves this summer.</li>
            <li> I feel so much more confident now that my face truly matches the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> Its no clown makeup but a nice light almost translucent like foundation.</li>
            <li> Manic Panic says you can mix this up to 1:1 ratio (50%/50%) with your favorite foundation without changing the consistency or finish.</li>
            <li> I love this product-</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the job :)</li>
            <li> I like it for the most part</li>
            <li> but some days are better than others with this one.</li>
            <li> I love Manic Panic as a company</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This makeup makes me see better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I&#x27;m so in love.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more so watery</li>
            <li> So, make sure you exfoliate and use lotion before applying.</li>
            <li> Using this, I&#x27;m able to lighten foundations that I love the coverage of and don&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vegan, cruelty free, and comes in a nice glass bottle.</li>
            <li> and i found it more helpful a face primer than without.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the arrival of this item, but when I opened the package I found that there was no plastic lid to cover the spout so makeup was EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> It is the best purchase I have made in a long time.  </li>
            <li> The product is pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to mix/lighten your foundation with a product that still has a HINT of color to it, I would recommend the Graftobian HD Glamour Creme Palettes in the shade Ultra Lites, which comes in a range of warm, cool and neutral undertones in it.</li>
            <li> it is great to mix with another foundation to make the color match a lighter skin tone, but if you are wanting to use this by itself, it is very very watery and light light coverage.</li>
            <li> I can never get the right shade but now with this I can make my own:)</li>
            <li> I am not quite porcelain light, but I have a very light complexion.</li>
            <li> I was able to mix this perfectly with regular foundation and FINALLY have results that make me happy.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and the majority of the foundations I own are too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and have never been able to find a foundation light enough and always end up with an orangey color.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my ivory colored make up to make it more light.  </li>
            <li> It is a lovely smooth application.</li>
            <li> Love this product...wish Anemic we&#x27;re available in this liquid form.  </li>
            <li> You know, this stuff is really cool!</li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s perfect for blending foundations.</li>
            <li> My dream come true!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin (redhead) and I could never find a foundation that was light enough for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Easily mixes with liquid or cream bases and has never broke me out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone with extremely fair skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only foundation that does not make my skin appear orange it also blends very nicely :)</li>
            <li> I bought it to mix with my Dark foundations and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> it works out fine.</li>
            <li> and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I got it for that reason, and for when I am doing vintage style makeup and really want that super fair look.  </li>
            <li> This white is great if you are super fair skinned and really like to play that up.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really stay on fabulously, but if u aren&#x27;t going at your own face with an ice scraper throughout the day, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Also, a HUGE problem for me was that it took over two weeks for me to get this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great once mixed in with a light foundation.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smooth and mixes well.</li>
            <li> , it mixes well, and it&#x27;s awesome for everyday and costume wear.</li>
            <li> Oh and did I mention it is CRUELTY FREE AND VEGAN?</li>
            <li> This works great as a color corrector and also supplies extra coverage.</li>
            <li> This Manic Panic foundation is literally WHITE, but it does blend very nicely and also offers good coverage.  </li>
            <li> A ration of 1:1 is perfect for my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t make me look pale.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much some2buy!!!</li>
            <li> i love this foundation first time buying it</li>
            <li> This also works great to lighten a summer foundation to use all winter long as well.</li>
            <li> AWESOME for pale girls, i use this every day, cant imagine how i wore foundation before this!</li>
            <li> It got to me quickly and completely secure.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but takes some practice getting familiar with it.</li>
            <li> I am wearing it right now!</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t purchase again, but it does seem like it&#x27;ll last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I love it so much &amp;#</li>
            <li> it can wrapped very well and even though I would not call my self a &amp;#34;goth girl&amp;#34; I took my Fatal Impact sticker and hung it my cubicle at work &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> I never thought i&#x27;d find a foundation that would work for me since i also needed it to be full coverage.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a good white foundation, skip this and go with MAC.</li>
            <li> I prefer medium to full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> really helpful for anyone with light skin!</li>
            <li> Very runny, doesn&#x27;t stay applied very well and tends to clump real easy and quick</li>
            <li> I have an incredible struggle trying to find the correct foundation color for my incredibly pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> I thought at first perhaps the runny consistency was because the bottle had gotten warm in the mailbox, so i made sure it was cool and shook the bottle for attempt 2, same issue.</li>
            <li> came and not only does it stay on beautifully, but it evens out my skintone super well and feels so smooth and soft....</li>
            <li> ; i had free shipping and it arrived so fast and secure...</li>
            <li> This does help to lighten my makeup, but it&#x27;s super liquid-y.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin soft and  smooth and feeling lovely.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li> its your gosh darn super power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it goes on nicely for really pale skin like my own.</li>
            <li> but I guess someone complained to the right person because it came to me in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> I tried applying several separate times with my fingers, a sponge, a flat foundation brush and a stippling brush and the stippling brush gave the best results.</li>
            <li> The color is great for lightening other foundations or applying right over the skin.</li>
            <li> Mix and play around with your foundations  tell you you fine the exact right shade.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to mix with other foundation and it stays looking nice all day.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and have only found one other super light foundation that matches my skin tone, and that is MAC studio fix liquid in NW13.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re worried about wrinkles and stuff i definitely recommend a nice primer because this settles.</li>
            <li> Good product, but doesn&#x27;t keep to it&#x27;s color as well as I expected</li>
            <li> And handy to have for Halloween which is next month!  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to find foundation light enough for my skin- besides Mary Kay</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those of you pale ladies who struggle to find the perfect foundation for your light skin, look no further!</li>
            <li> so when i heard about this from youtuber thataylaa (if you&#x27;re pale &amp; into makeup videos, SUB to her &amp;#60;3, you&#x27;re welcome in advance)</li>
            <li> As someone who is too pale for even the lightest color foundation, this product is great.</li>
            <li> This is a really great balancing color for people with pale skin tones.</li>
            <li> This has been great to add to the two that I can wear to help pale them out.</li>
            <li> I mix this in a 1/3 mixture with 1/3 of two other foundations to be a good tint/color match.</li>
            <li> I have never ever found another foundation as good, for mixing with other foundations too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lightens my foundation to the right shade with ease.</li>
            <li> However, I often just mix it up right before application</li>
            <li> I purchased it to tone down my regular foundation for a Halloween costume and it worked great!</li>
            <li> I can see this being wonderful if you only need to slightly lighten a foundation</li>
            <li> I tried adding this to my normal foundation to lighten it, and it does lighten it, but it also alters the texture to be cheap and chalky</li>
            <li> This is great for mixing in with foundation if you&#x27;re exceptionally pale!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my pale skin days or works wonders when mixed in with a foundation to lighten it.</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation for helping with full white face make up for cosplaying, and it is good, its very white however you do have to pack on this liquid foundation</li>
            <li> If you really want a white foundation that has a very strong pigment I&#x27;d suggest getting the &amp;#34;Goth White&amp;#34; Powder Cream Foundation instead</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all either too light or too dark but mixing a little of this with my darker foundations really has helped me get my perfect shade.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This foundation has saved me so much money!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well</li>
            <li> im more Snow White.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product through a youtube video</li>
            <li> So i ordered it and it came pretty fast!</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly as featured.</li>
            <li> The bottle was so gothic and pretty.</li>
            <li> This is better than the generic white makeup found in many Halloween kits.</li>
            <li> Either way I love this product and will definitely re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tried higher end</li>
            <li> And it agrees very well with even the oiliest acne prone skin like mine!</li>
            <li> With Dreamtone I can achieve the exact match I need and its consistency is indeed DREAMY.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, the shipping took forever.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and will probably purchase more until I run out or find my white whale: a foundation that actually matches my skin color.</li>
            <li> Manic Panic White Dreamtone: You&#x27;ll be able to see like</li>
            <li> It actually makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> First off: this is NOT intended as a stand-alone foundation.</li>
            <li> Not on a hot day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal for me though, because it works beautifully when mixed with other foundations, and that&#x27;s what I got it for :)</li>
            <li> Many people asked me if i was ok because i had a strange white tint to my face,</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin and even with the absolute lightest foundation I can find, it is still much too dark.</li>
            <li> Great for the pale princesses out there!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m an extremely fair skinned person, and white out makeup tends to look much more natural than any other type of foundation or powder.</li>
            <li> This foundation also makes my blush stay on really well :)Since the alternatives are around $40 for a white foundation</li>
            <li> instead of wasting money trying to scout a new foundation that&#x27;s light enough for me, I just mix this Manic Panic foundation in and it makes it exactly the shade I need!!</li>
            <li> It is pretty runny, but I didn&#x27;t see that it affected the foundation much when applying it.</li>
            <li> I love this because it&#x27;s the only white foundation available to me, but</li>
            <li> im also really fair skinned and have a lot of trouble finding make up that is light enough</li>
            <li> I would end up looking like a circus clown but on the contrary the color is not an overwhelming white but a nice pale one.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny squirt too, so it will last me for a good while before I need to repurchase!</li>
            <li> First time I use a foundation that was light enough for me!</li>
            <li> This can be used sparingly to lighten a foundation, but once you pass a certain ratio, it changes the foundations texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it can easily make you look WAY too white if you accidentally use too much of it.</li>
            <li> overall, i really love this and a i think a majority of my pale princesses and those who can&#x27;t exactly get their correct shade will really love this.</li>
            <li> It came early and very secure, its just as described and fits well on my paper white skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, my foundation stays exactly the same, just now my right shade!</li>
            <li> My daughter says this is perfect to mix with other foundation when you have a very pale complexion.</li>
            <li> All in all, I do really like this product</li>
            <li> I got this to mix with my too-dark foundations, but the formula didn&#x27;t really work with any of them.</li>
            <li> i like that its vegan, and it blends really well.</li>
            <li> , it blends very well with my skin tone though.</li>
            <li> I looked very unnatural.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li> Of course you have to measure it well and match it to your skintone, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> I end up with really intense, under the skin break outs every time that I try to use it.</li>
            <li> Dreamtone really IS dreamy.  </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;THANKYOU</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap/sticky and covers really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It does not dilute the coverage and the consistency is very blendable.</li>
            <li> I really wish that it was a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> some pros: it is indeed white, it aplies rather smoothly, it blends</li>
            <li> but i really like it for mixing into my foundation and making it closer to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> but it is really watery</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since its watery the foundation will apply really patchy.</li>
            <li> I also use &amp;#34;maybelline fit me matte and poreless translucent powder&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;stargazer white pressed powder&amp;#34; as my setting powders.</li>
            <li> Pretty good to make dark foundation lighter though, especially during the months when I tend to get lighter (winter)</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I also tried using it &#x27;as is&#x27; for highlighting, but couldn&#x27;t achieve a good result, as the formula applies somewhat unevenly and patchy when used on its own (at least on my skin...).</li>
            <li> One of the best uses I have seen is cutting a foundation that is a little dark, which can be useful if you are someone who is more fair in the winter and does not want to keep buying different colors.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really change the consistency of my foundations, other than making them have a more mousse texture, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the price is great.  </li>
            <li> It smells a lot better to me than other foundation,</li>
            <li> and I got so excited because I thought I finally found something to help me with my foundation problems.</li>
            <li> The thing I really love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have that offsetting yellowish tone that some other products of foundations can have.</li>
            <li> It works so well to lighten my normal concealer!</li>
            <li> Mac may cost more, but it will last for an extremely long time and is well worth the price difference.</li>
            <li> Love it to mix into my other</li>
            <li> However, I wish it was a bit more pigmented, as I have to add at least a full pump to get the color results I want</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a little bit of figuring out how much of the manic panic dreamtone you will need vs your foundation (i usually do 50/50) but once that happens this will be your new best friend!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It dries and looks like chalk, and really only looks good if you take one pump and rub it in over a large patch of skin (like your arm) as if it were a moisturizer, so if you just want a pale body foundation go for it.  </li>
            <li> did not hinder my setting powder either, and lasted the full 8 hours I worked outside in heat index 108 degree weather</li>
            <li> I still get full coverage even mixing equal parts.</li>
            <li> I am super pale and can&#x27;t seem to find any makeup that will fit my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Wow this product actually matches my skin tone and makes me feel happy with being pale.</li>
            <li> I have very fair sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s difficult to find foundations that don&#x27;t make me break out and still match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This has saved so many foundations for me that I had previously thought I could never wear.  </li>
            <li> I mixed this with my regular foundation, but found that it wasn&#x27;t opaque enough on its own to really make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased a white powder at the same time that has much better coverage.</li>
            <li> I have found that it makes my foundation more mattifying than I prefer, so I add facial oils to the mix and it brings it back to my preferred texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> And this looks alot more white along with a white face powder.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mix easily with other foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead, so naturally I&#x27;m the fairest of them all, haha</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used this enough to say much about it, but for the times i have it has worked really well.</li>
            <li> so I mix this product with my normal foundation to make the perfecr color.</li>
            <li> If you need to lighten your concealer or even just use it as your normal concealer</li>
            <li> I love this makeup, it&#x27;s a pale girl</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again, though I probably won&#x27;t have to for a very long time. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very pale skinned girl, and as with many other girls with my skin tone, it&#x27;s very hard to find a foundation in the store that comes close to or perfectly matches the color of your skin.</li>
            <li> I can finally wear foundation and have it look right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to being about 3-4 shades darker than I currently am, and haven&#x27;t found the right foundation for me that can accommodate all that my skin needs.</li>
            <li> If this ends up being too pale for you, it is also great for lightening previously purchased foundations.</li>
            <li> I have more pink than yellow in my skin and most makeups that are pale</li>
            <li> only wish it was available in Australia locally.</li>
            <li> Really a must have for pale or light complexions</li>
            <li> a I very far</li>
            <li> I can say that I have very sensitive skin with exzema and severe allergies and the manic panic brand cosmetics do not give me any problems.  </li>
            <li> The reason I still gave this 3 stars, is that it is a nice sheer and pale foundation on</li>
            <li> Pretty gross and unattractive, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> The lightest shades available are always to dark.  </li>
            <li> The prodect at first looks as if it would be white circus makeup</li>
            <li> I was super scared about trying this and not have it mix with my other high end foundation.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and trying to find a foundation that matches me is nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> I mix it to about a 50/50 ratio with my foundation, sometimes I do more white toner than foundation when I want to look a little more pale</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find light enough foundations in the right tint!</li>
            <li> how pale I am and this has made my wish come true!</li>
            <li> (I love to look very pale).</li>
            <li> The only fault is that the white will stick much more to dry skin.</li>
            <li> (Illamasqua pure white,</li>
            <li> If you want to mix it with another foundation it will work, and if you already have flawless skin and you just want to be perfectly pale then go for it, but if you have even slightly dry skin or a couple blemishes this stuff sucks.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is an average foundation size with a pump that gives just the right amount of product needed!</li>
            <li> This is very handy to have if you are very pale and have trouble finding matches in drugstore or even highend foundations.</li>
            <li> With this stuff, it looks like my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> I recommend to vamps, ghouls and all goth girls who may want to either blend to get their preferred shade, or to those who want to lighten their natural skin tone up a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it the same way, and it really works.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction.</li>
            <li> Like I said earlier, I am very oily, and the humid Texas heat puts any foundation to the test.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t seem to change my regular foundation much at all.</li>
            <li> THIS FIXED</li>
            <li> It seems that many people posting negative reviews dont know this.</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation mixer for pale skintones who have trouble finding foundation matches, especially from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff to lighten up my foundations that arnt quite pale enough for me.</li>
            <li> but im ethnic so pale for me is lightly tan</li>
            <li> I bought it back in November 2012, used it pretty much every single day, and just finished it in July of 2013.</li>
            <li> or it won&#x27;t come out even, and does not cover blemishes or dark spots well, plus you will run out quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true white, not a pale skin tone, and the consistency is such that it could probably be layered to create an opaque white skin tone.</li>
            <li> I liked to use this when highlighting my cheekbones or when correcting tones of other pale makeup I have.</li>
            <li> Wow, finally, the dread of putting on foundation that is too dark, too light,</li>
            <li> I love being ghostly white, so simply making do with something too dark was NOT an option.</li>
            <li> This liquid foundation is very VERY runny, it doesn&#x27;t really cover well and needs to be applied dried and layered to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because beauty guru and general all round flippin awesome human being, ThatTaylaa (youtube) used it on her pale skin with other foundations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very, very, very pale to begin with and no foundation matches since I&#x27;m so fair, so for the longest time I&#x27;ve been working with the wrong colors, trying to lighten them up with white eye shadow on top to set the liquid foundation</li>
            <li> I mix it with MAC&#x27;s match master foundation in 1.0 (obviously the palest one) and it looks exactly like my actual skin tone.</li>
            <li> I typically add about one pump of this to one pump of foundation,and it makes my foundation light enough to match my skintone.  </li>
            <li> For people as white as me, there are only a few cosmetic brands that carry light enough foundation, and they are around $30~$50, or higher.</li>
            <li> I tried using it with a foundation that was a couple shades darker than what I would normally wear, you know for the summer when you&#x27;re a little more tanned, and I noticed that even when working with the amount of the Manic Panic along with the foundation, it just kept coming out an odd color that still didn&#x27;t match my skin.</li>
            <li> foundation is absolutely pure white, very concentrated, and it is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to add to my current foundation as I find most don&#x27;t seem to be pale enough for me</li>
            <li> I mixed up a large batch and put it in a different container for travel.</li>
            <li> When i mixed it together, it had a very unnatural white tint to it!!!!!</li>
            <li> no regrets here!</li>
            <li> This is the first foundation I have found that allows my other foundation to match my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only can it be used with liquid foundation, I even use it with a heavy coverage stick foundation, I just put some of the stick foundation on my face, then I apply the same amount (or more) of the white, and then spread it on my face until it&#x27;s blended.</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients are safe for skin, and there are no free radical damage causing ingredients (which cause premature aging of skin) like alcohol, fragrance, or other irritants.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am still satisfied with my purchase, but I must continue my search for a foundation corrector that doesn&#x27;t cost a ridiculous amount of money.</li>
            <li> My older skin has sun damage and is now a different shade from my too white neck.  </li>
            <li> It has to be the middle of summer for me to look natural in foundation.</li>
            <li> Even the lightest foundations are too dark, but thanks to this I can buy any one I want and not need to worry!</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice thus far, so I will not know how my skin reacts for another week or so.</li>
            <li> Upon first looking at this product I expected it to come out as milk white as the liquid looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most affordable color corrector out there that I&#x27;ve found and I will probably repurchase, but it was just frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> if you have pretty pale clear skin</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast - I use this as a base to mix with other liquid foundations, as I am very fair skinned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin almost translusent on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> A lot of people say it mixes really well with other foundations to lighten them.  </li>
            <li> so i have to apply alot, that leaves patches and streaks, its REALLY runny, and the pump nozzle sucks and sprays it everywhere when you press it, it also wears out fast.</li>
            <li> It also gives a sheer wash of white but offers no coverage.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re naturally paler or want to lighten this just a bit, definitely use a coat of this after a coat of the Revlon ColorStay stuff I was talking about earlier because they both work phenomenally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s good that it really melts into your skin, as I hate cakey makeup, but it just lacks the pigmentation that I wanted.</li>
            <li> I mix 3 dabs of this with a half pump of light (but still way too dark for me</li>
            <li> Purchased because of it being cruelty free to add to my foundation which is still too dark for my skin slightly.</li>
            <li> the liquid had been dried up and when I first started trying to pump it out, it wouldn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble finding my right shade of foundation, especially since I only purchase drug store products.</li>
            <li> First of all I am seriously pale.</li>
            <li> Im pretty pale</li>
            <li> do you have dark circles under your eyes, concealer and sunglases will only cover so much?</li>
            <li> So being a really pale woman, i am always getting the lightest shade of foundation available only to find that it is WAY too dark for me, makes me look orange or just does not match my skin tone</li>
            <li> I buy this to mix with regular foundation to match my pale skin, but I really need coverage.</li>
            <li> I think this is an absolute MUST HAVE beauty tool for pale asses like myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly meant to blend with other foundation, but I can&#x27;t find one that works with it.  </li>
            <li> one word of warning though, too much, you&#x27;ll look like a dry clown, and if you have acne, it will exaggerate it a little when it dries if you use it alone.</li>
            <li> The Gothic white Manic Panic Powder is better but this foundation is terrific for a base coat or very ghostly look.</li>
            <li> i tested a little tiny drop onto the back of my hand and just a little tiny bit goes a pretty long way.</li>
            <li> After a long battle of squeezing at the tube I finally got the liquid to come out the pump.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, and even the lightest foundations quickly turn 2-3 shades to dark on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> only downfall is that if i add too much it can be a bit hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to lighten any random foundation that I have (or will buy) because I can never seem to find a foundation light enough that doesn&#x27;t either turn orange on me or wash me out.  </li>
            <li> It clumps around dry skin that you can&#x27;t even feel, and the coverage is patchy even after multiple coats.  </li>
            <li> (Or those foundations that I paid WAY too much for, but they&#x27;re just a little bit too dark, and I can&#x27;t bring myself to return them, lol.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so I think it would only give a subtle ghostly look, not a stark white look like a white cake makeup.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see flashback, but in my dark room my face definitely had a white</li>
            <li> it also isn&#x27;t long wearing.</li>
            <li> The package arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin as water,not worth the money.</li>
            <li> From drug store to more expensive brands they all have let me down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for several years to find foundation that matched my skin due to me being so pale, and ManicPanic Dreamtone completely changed everything for me!</li>
            <li> I mixed a little bit of this with my regular foundation</li>
            <li> Chalky dry.  </li>
            <li> I unscrewed the lid and there was dry liquid in the tube.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use this to blend with my foundation for a lighter look for a Halloween wedding (going as Morticia Addams) and EVERY SINGLE foundation I&#x27;ve tried to blend this with</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin so sometimes even the lightest shades will show up dark and very orange on me.</li>
            <li> , it goes on smoothly, and does not change colors to that ugly fake tan orange/brown color like most of my foundations do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend spending the few extra dollars to order this directly from Manic Panic, because ordering from this distributor was a waste of money (and product).</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a bit iffy for me is that if I don&#x27;t cover the foundation with a setting powder, it can tend to get greasy or slide around a bit after a few hours, but since I am mixing 3 different foundations, it can&#x27;t be expected that they all play well together.</li>
            <li> (it does say it has Jojoba oil in it, but further down the list).  </li>
            <li> This product is to be MIXED with other foundation!</li>
            <li> and they were always too dark, tan, orange, pink or red.</li>
            <li> When the foundations are mixed a little goes</li>
            <li> It is just enough coverage and gives me a little ghostly look.</li>
            <li> It also neutralizes the color so the color is no longer too orange or too pink.</li>
            <li> Just takes a few layers, in conjunction with the powder, to get a completely white look</li>
            <li> Be careful when you try to pump it out.</li>
            <li> it mixes well and doesn&#x27;t thin out the foundation too much either</li>
            <li> now, the product itself.. finally something matches my pasty pale skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for a Harley cosplay by its self its too translucent but if you mix it with a pale foundation and set it with white powder or baby powder  </li>
            <li> Therefore you don&#x27;t have to rely on super-expensive brands like Nars or Bobbi Brown to get a pale enough foundation.</li>
            <li> When I tan in the summer I use a liquid foundation which I love-but it doesn&#x27;t come in shades pale enough for me to use in the winter...</li>
            <li> This pale girl will finally stop looking like an orange!^_^ BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE.</li>
            <li> I mix it into my regular foundation that is half a shade to a shade too dark on me.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;The lightest color they sell in stores is a bit too dark for me, but if I mix just a little bit of that in with this, it actually matches my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend even if you&#x27;re not fair but get darker and lighter throughout the seasons but dont want 3 bottles of foundation in different colors sitting around.</li>
            <li> I am very pale blonde hair blue eyed girl who has had so much trouble finding make up to match.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it to mix in with my foundations to lighten them, since I am so pale it is nearly impossible to find one light enough.</li>
            <li> ratio to regular foundation, usually the lightest I can get in stores.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure since I haven&#x27;t tried it that way, but it&#x27;s quite sheer by itself</li>
            <li> I cannot say how it works with acne or other skin blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a foundation corrector, like some other reviewers suggested, but it does not work with any of my foundations.</li>
            <li> do not think this was made to wear by itself, it is made to correct the tone of your other foundations, and it does</li>
            <li> I got this to blend with other foundations.</li>
            <li> It cakes up around it and brings attention to it in an extremely unflattering way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added it to other foundations to make then lighter as well</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first product I found like this in this price range, all the others I had seen were outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, break me out, or change the consistency/finish of my other medium-full foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am naturally a very pale person (and sitting outside just makes me a lobster)</li>
            <li> whatever other foundations I have that are too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I have a very-very pale yellow-based complexion, so finding the right foundation is always difficult.</li>
            <li> just not right IS OVER.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright for mixing with other foundations, but gives an odd texture.</li>
            <li> I use it to lighten any foundations that are too dark for me.</li>
            <li> She used it as a medium to mix with her foundations that are too dark.</li>
            <li> the two lightest shades in foundations are too dark for me, im not albino.</li>
            <li> I use this to lighten up foundations I buy that are too dark.</li>
            <li> So if you have dark circles under your eyes or blemishes, you&#x27;ll need a hell of a lot of concealer.</li>
            <li> Got this to mix in with a foundation that is to dark for me.</li>
            <li> This actually wasn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it would be for cosplay</li>
            <li> That brought it down one star.</li>
            <li> I ordered this-along with a few other things-and it took about 3 days just for my order to paid for and processed.</li>
            <li> I heard that i should mix it half and half for the correct balance.</li>
            <li> So I tried adding less of the color correction to my foundation and it still looked unnatural.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly greasy texture, but blends well with both silicone and water based foundations.</li>
            <li> It sort of just thinned out my existing foundation giving it less coverage.</li>
            <li> so it gave me much less coverage than I need.</li>
            <li> If you are too pale or purchased a foundation that&#x27;s a bit too dark</li>
            <li> I plan on reordering this product from them, because it was just a little mess up.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago to help lighten up a few foundations I&#x27;ve bought that turned out to be too dark for my complexion.</li>
            <li> Might be a little runny, so shake the Manic Panic vigorously.</li>
            <li> seems a little watery</li>
            <li> I mix this with a little bit of another foundation to make my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little paddle to spoon it onto my hand and it is a medium consistency.</li>
            <li> so it doesnt thicken up your foundation during mixing, and I find that if I mix it with foundation in a container it thicken up a bit after awhile if it was a little watery.</li>
            <li> the only reason why i haven&#x27;t given this 5 stars was because the cap was a little broken to cover the pump</li>
            <li> but thankfully no product was wasted upon delivery.</li>
            <li> The foundation ended up just being flaky and uneven.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few of these and had no problem.  </li>
            <li> The last one I bought, however, is so thin and watery</li>
            <li> but when I took the bottle out I noticed one part of the liquid looked like it was missing.</li>
            <li> I was so worried about the packaging because some reviewers commented on how messy it was</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin, white liquid that you mix with your foundation or concealer to lighten it.</li>
            <li> In the past i&#x27;d pick up foundations too dark for me all the time, which meant wasted money on something i could never use.</li>
            <li> (yes, I&#x27;m that pale).</li>
            <li> This is THE holy grail beauty product for pale skin girls and boys.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anybody who is looking to achieve perfectly pale skin.</li>
            <li> I shall start off by saying that I am *extremely* pale.</li>
            <li> 60;3 if u have pale skin</li>
            <li> It is my holy grail for my pale complexion.</li>
            <li> already it will probably do the trick, however if you&#x27;re trying to pale out and/or cover up</li>
            <li> I got this because another reviewer mentioned in their review of this that they use if with Revlon ColorStay in ivory, saying that they use a combination of both for their pale, oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Its my holy grail pale girl makeup item.</li>
            <li> I am on a very tight budget.</li>
            <li> The pump was a little hard to control.</li>
            <li> but I can get past that.</li>
            <li> no more circles</li>
            <li> but past about a 1:4 ratio, it makes it go on very unevenly and chalky with pilling in deeper pores.</li>
            <li> is the solution to every pale girls problems!</li>
            <li> PALE OILY SKIN?!?</li>
            <li> I may try the Yaby &amp;#34;daisy&amp;#34; foundation or the Illamasqua Skin Base in white next time</li>
            <li> I am a very pale girl, and I bought this to lighten my foundation.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this reacts strangely to every type of concealer I have used.</li>
            <li> so sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get a color match.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this is very dry and chalky and that is coming from someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as I would have hoped for.  </li>
            <li> I decided to order despite some customers recieving a defective bottle, I am to say I didn&#x27;t get one and the product is thick and works well.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this would be sticky and difficult to apply like Halloween makeup, but thankfully, it goes on like any other foundation, and covers up blemishes just as well.</li>
            <li> I found that in the sun with flash (which, I mean why would you do that anyway?)</li>
            <li> Seriously...</li>
            <li> If you are super pale, BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not good as a foundation alone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been so difficult for me to find a foundation that matches my pale neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick consistency that was a bit difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> and I just have to think about something irritating to my skin</li>
            <li> the pump cap was broken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thin.</li>
            <li> but I would like to think it hasn&#x27;t made it worse by any means.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick consistency spreads very thin, and it&#x27;s not buildable.</li>
            <li> Not good for acne-prone skin!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything wrong with the texture of this product.</li>
            <li> but I found it difficult to mix in with liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> It merely changes the color of the product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a bit weird</li>
            <li> I could be wrong but this was thinner</li>
            <li> Sadly, I got a dud.</li>
            <li> This is a very thin, patchy, and chalky product.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked with this</li>
            <li> like i was sick.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried it by itself on my face and it looked awful.  </li>
            <li> This foundation has terrible coverage.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So awesome &amp;#34;LOVE THIS STUFF&amp;#34; i had free shipping and it arrived so fast and secure... Really a must have for pale or light complexions LOVE iT!!</li>
            <li> I am very pale blonde hair blue eyed girl who has had so much trouble finding make up to match.  From drug store to more expensive brands they all have let me down.  I mix this with my ivory colored make up to make it more light.  It works perfectly.  A little goes a long way and the price is great.  I also use just this as my highlight when contouring.  Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it to lighten any foundations that are too dark for me. I&#x27;m very fair so sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get a color match. This works perfect.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like it does much, but when paired with the creme foundation or even your own, it works wonders!!!</li>
            <li> May be a great product but the one I got had no plastic covering or foil over the makeup. Not even about to put an opened liquid on my face! It could&#x27;ve been paint for all I know?!</li>
            <li> the only reason why i haven&#x27;t given this 5 stars was because the cap was a little broken to cover the pump but thankfully no product was wasted upon delivery. now, the product itself.. finally something matches my pasty pale skin. i tested a little tiny drop onto the back of my hand and just a little tiny bit goes a pretty long way. it does have a chalky kind of feel to it after drying but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable. would have liked something a bit softer to the touch. perfect for mixing though. i combined my current foundation with this stuff and it blended nicely. if you&#x27;re worried about wrinkles and stuff i definitely recommend a nice primer because this settles. overall, i really love this and a i think a majority of my pale princesses and those who can&#x27;t exactly get their correct shade will really love this. oh.. and the packaging is so cute. i love the bats :)</li>
            <li> I mix this stuff in with my regular foundation to lighten it and it works wonders. I&#x27;m very, very, very pale to begin with and no foundation matches since I&#x27;m so fair, so for the longest time I&#x27;ve been working with the wrong colors, trying to lighten them up with white eye shadow on top to set the liquid foundation (yes, I&#x27;m that pale). It&#x27;s been doing it&#x27;s job, but it hasn&#x27;t been...right. With this stuff, it looks like my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been so difficult for me to find a foundation that matches my pale neck. This is a life saver to mix into any foundation to lighten it up! I also feel like it doesn&#x27;t change how my foundations wear or the finish. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was worried that this would be sticky and difficult to apply like Halloween makeup, but thankfully, it goes on like any other foundation, and covers up blemishes just as well. It smells a lot better to me than other foundation, too.&lt;br /&gt;The lightest color they sell in stores is a bit too dark for me, but if I mix just a little bit of that in with this, it actually matches my skin tone. This is perfect if you have really light skin. I would also recommend it if you need your face to be white for a costume, since, like I said before, it&#x27;s a lot easier to use than Halloween makeup (it&#x27;s also a lot easier to wash off).</li>
            <li> Great product for costume make-up.</li>
            <li> used it for Halloween, it gave me even coverage, used with Manic Panic Virgin White Pressed Powder Gothic Vampire</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great for the pale princesses out there!! I mix it into my regular foundation that is half a shade to a shade too dark on me.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the arrival of this item, but when I opened the package I found that there was no plastic lid to cover the spout so makeup was EVERYWHERE. About 1/3 of the makeup ended up all over the box. I&#x27;d recommend spending the few extra dollars to order this directly from Manic Panic, because ordering from this distributor was a waste of money (and product).</li>
            <li> This does help to lighten my makeup, but it&#x27;s super liquid-y. For that reason, I only use it with thicker foundations. Probably won&#x27;t purchase again, but it does seem like it&#x27;ll last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very pale skinned girl, and as with many other girls with my skin tone, it&#x27;s very hard to find a foundation in the store that comes close to or perfectly matches the color of your skin. Even the lightest shade in the foundation line can be tricky to work with sometimes. So after researching on YouTube, I came across this item and decided to give it a try after reading it&#x27;s many rave reviews. Personally, I like it. I tried using it with a foundation that was a couple shades darker than what I would normally wear, you know for the summer when you&#x27;re a little more tanned, and I noticed that even when working with the amount of the Manic Panic along with the foundation, it just kept coming out an odd color that still didn&#x27;t match my skin. It didn&#x27;t particularly lighten it, it just gave it an odd color. So for me, this is best used to just gently lighten an already light foundation. I didn&#x27;t notice anything wrong with the texture of this product. It is pretty runny, but I didn&#x27;t see that it affected the foundation much when applying it. All in all, I do really like this product and I would repurchase it again.</li>
            <li> Made me into the perfectly ghostly &amp;#34;goth / vampire&amp;#34; that I was aiming to become on Halloween!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product!</li>
            <li> I got this to mix with my too-dark foundations, but the formula didn&#x27;t really work with any of them. The foundation ended up just being flaky and uneven.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a translucent white makeup.If I bought it and used as a Fondation . I would be very disappointed. I bought it to mix with my Dark foundations and it worked perfectly. Mix and play around with your foundations  tell you you fine the exact right shade. Might be a little runny, so shake the Manic Panic vigorously. When the foundations are mixed a little goes a I very far and it blends in beautifully</li>
            <li> I have bought a few of these and had no problem.  The last one I bought, however, is so thin and watery that&#x27;s it is unusable.  Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Please note with this review that I have never used this product on it&#x27;s own. I purchased this because beauty guru and general all round flippin awesome human being, ThatTaylaa (youtube) used it on her pale skin with other foundations. Well, let me tell you! This is THE holy grail beauty product for pale skin girls and boys. This foundation has saved me so much money! In the past i&#x27;d pick up foundations too dark for me all the time, which meant wasted money on something i could never use. Now, I mix in a bit of this magic stuff until i get my desired shade, and voila! perfect foundation every time. I think this is an absolute MUST HAVE beauty tool for pale asses like myself. You can also mix anything, concealers, foundations, bb creams, anything! I cannot even say how happy I am with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And can i get a hell YES for the pump?! swoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily my most used and loved beauty product I own.</li>
            <li> This product is as white as the driven snow.  I purchased this to lighten any random foundation that I have (or will buy) because I can never seem to find a foundation light enough that doesn&#x27;t either turn orange on me or wash me out.  It is pretty tricky trying to figure out the perfect ratio of this product and your foundation or concealer.  It will be a lot of trial and error so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> i like that its vegan, and it blends really well. good price too. im also really fair skinned and have a lot of trouble finding make up that is light enough</li>
            <li> Chalky dry.  Doesn&#x27;t mix easily with other foundation.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup ever. I&#x27;ve tried every type of &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; toned makeup sold in stores and they were always too dark, tan, orange, pink or red. Pretty gross and unattractive, if you ask me. I&#x27;m a redhead, so naturally I&#x27;m the fairest of them all, haha! I mix a bit of this with drugstore makeup and create the perfect color (or lack thereof) for me. I recommend to vamps, ghouls and all goth girls who may want to either blend to get their preferred shade, or to those who want to lighten their natural skin tone up a bit. Or s lot. Whatever.</li>
            <li> It works okay but I found it difficult to mix in with liquid foundations. It&#x27;s a thick consistency that was a bit difficult to work with. Once I got it to mix in, it worked well. It&#x27;s the most affordable color corrector out there that I&#x27;ve found and I will probably repurchase, but it was just frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> I saw a review of this on a beauty guru&#x27;s channel on YouTube. She used it as a medium to mix with her foundations that are too dark. I&#x27;m using it the same way, and it really works.</li>
            <li> It blends well with my regular foundation. Leaves my skin white and Gothic looking. It doesn&#x27;t leave lines or creases. It is a great make-up for us Goths</li>
            <li> My daughter tried mixing this with her foundation to lighten the fairest foundation we could find on the shelf anywhere.  Seems to work pretty well - just have to experiment to not have foundation look to white when applied.</li>
            <li> i used this to lighten my foundation, but it needs more pigmenting. it also isn&#x27;t long wearing.</li>
            <li> the two lightest shades in foundations are too dark for me, im not albino. im more Snow White. so when i heard about this from youtuber thataylaa (if you&#x27;re pale &amp; into makeup videos, SUB to her &amp;#60;3, you&#x27;re welcome in advance) i ordered it asap! no regrets here! it doesn&#x27;t change the consistency &amp; even adds MORE coverage. i use it to highlight &amp; i add it to my concealer too! this stuff is a miracle product for us &amp;#34;Pale Princesses&amp;#34; as thataylaa calls us ;P</li>
            <li> I have a very-very pale yellow-based complexion, so finding the right foundation is always difficult. I bought this white foundation to mix with darker foundations that I already had. For that purpose it works absolutely great, and I&#x27;m sure I will repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I also tried using it &#x27;as is&#x27; for highlighting, but couldn&#x27;t achieve a good result, as the formula applies somewhat unevenly and patchy when used on its own (at least on my skin...). It&#x27;s not a big deal for me though, because it works beautifully when mixed with other foundations, and that&#x27;s what I got it for :)</li>
            <li> This is going to be a lengthy review but I hope this helps in your decision of whether or not to buy this product. I first heard about this product through a youtube video and I got so excited because I thought I finally found something to help me with my foundation problems. The reviews I had seen basically led me to believe that this would correct the color of my foundation and it would help solve all of my makeup troubles. This honestly does help lighten my foundation and makes a perfect match for my skin tone. BUT, the texture of it feels like chalky paint. It rubs in okay but you have to blend it for a while for it to actually feel and look like regular foundation. The packaging was great and came with no problems but when I took the bottle out I noticed one part of the liquid looked like it was missing. It looked like the liquid had been dried up and when I first started trying to pump it out, it wouldn&#x27;t come out. I unscrewed the lid and there was dry liquid in the tube. After a long battle of squeezing at the tube I finally got the liquid to come out the pump. Like I said earlier, this product does what it claims but I do believe it could have arrived in a better state.  Also, a HUGE problem for me was that it took over two weeks for me to get this. I ordered this-along with a few other things-and it took about 3 days just for my order to paid for and processed. I have never had this happen before and the longest I have had to wait until processing was 1 business day. Also it took 9 days to get here after leaving the facility so it may take a while for your order to be processed and shipped.</li>
            <li> I was super scared about trying this and not have it mix with my other high end foundation. But it&#x27;s PERFECT. Love, love, love, love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> Good product, but doesn&#x27;t keep to it&#x27;s color as well as I expected, it blends very well with my skin tone though. If you really want a white foundation that has a very strong pigment I&#x27;d suggest getting the &amp;#34;Goth White&amp;#34; Powder Cream Foundation instead</li>
            <li> works to lighten your foundation. seems a little watery but overal;l does the job. one word of warning though, too much, you&#x27;ll look like a dry clown, and if you have acne, it will exaggerate it a little when it dries if you use it alone. i use this on my body and it looks great, a tip, spray a light bit of hairspray over your shoulders if you apply it there so it wont rub off on the straps of your tanks or fishnets</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does have a bit of a smell but it disappears after it dries. It is a lovely smooth application. It dries without any greasy feel afterwards. It leaves the skin soft and  smooth and feeling lovely. You can use it on just your skin to lighten your natural skin or mix it in with your foundation to create your perfect shade. The package was perfect. The top was intact and secured. I could not be happier with the outcome of this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have an incredible struggle trying to find the correct foundation color for my incredibly pale skin tone. I absolutely love Manic Panic&#x27;s products, and i was thinking about buying this for quite a while, and heard about all the great reviews about. Everyone was raving about it. So i saw it on amazon for a discounted price and i just had to try it. So i ordered it and it came pretty fast! It arrived exactly as featured. The bottle was so gothic and pretty. So i rushed to get my current foundation, and mix a bit with it. I heard that i should mix it half and half for the correct balance. But that&#x27;s when i had a problem. When i mixed it together, it had a very unnatural white tint to it!!!!! I looked very unnatural. So I tried adding less of the color correction to my foundation and it still looked unnatural. Many people asked me if i was ok because i had a strange white tint to my face, like i was sick. I dunno if it was just me who has encountered this problem and i hope no one has! but i guess i should try picking a foundation even darker than the one i already have that doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone. Oh well hahah.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin and even with the absolute lightest foundation I can find, it is still much too dark. I almost never wear foundation for that reason. It has to be the middle of summer for me to look natural in foundation. I was able to mix this perfectly with regular foundation and FINALLY have results that make me happy. I also have super-sensitive skin and I just have to think about something irritating to my skin and I break out, so I was concerned. But, I decided to give it a go and have used it several times and have had no issues what so ever. I can finally wear foundation and have it look right. It is super easy to mix with other foundation and it stays looking nice all day. I bought this as a test to see if it would work for me and am pleased to say that it&#x27;s perfect. I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright for mixing with other foundations, but gives an odd texture. I would not use as foundation alone...it&#x27;s thick consistency spreads very thin, and it&#x27;s not buildable. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle but will not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also could have been packaged better...the pump cap was broken.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years now and find that it works well for my very light complexation. It is just enough coverage and gives me a little ghostly look. I have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction.</li>
            <li> First of all I am seriously pale. I mix this with a little bit of another foundation to make my skin tone. It works wonders. Ive never used this foundation by itself though. It goes on really smooth and mixes well. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> First time I use a foundation that was light enough for me! Great because you can build up the intensity of the whiteness depending how much you apply!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cover the skin as stated. I now need to buy clown white makeup tomorrow!!</li>
            <li> I love this makeup, it&#x27;s a pale girl must and I&#x27;m on my second bottle! My only issue is that this makeup and powder do NOT go together, so if you&#x27;re going to wear this and you use a powder to set your makeup, it might be a good idea to consider a setting spray instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago to help lighten up a few foundations I&#x27;ve bought that turned out to be too dark for my complexion. I am not quite porcelain light, but I have a very light complexion. It&#x27;s hard to find light enough foundations in the right tint! I mix this in a 1/3 mixture with 1/3 of two other foundations to be a good tint/color match. It comes with a little paddle to spoon it onto my hand and it is a medium consistency. It works really well and my foundation still has good coverage. I am wearing it right now! The only thing that is a bit iffy for me is that if I don&#x27;t cover the foundation with a setting powder, it can tend to get greasy or slide around a bit after a few hours, but since I am mixing 3 different foundations, it can&#x27;t be expected that they all play well together. This foundation also makes my blush stay on really well :)Since the alternatives are around $40 for a white foundation (Illamasqua pure white, Face Atlier Zero Minus)I think this product is an exceptional value. It is in a glass container though, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend carrying it around in your purse. I mixed up a large batch and put it in a different container for travel.</li>
            <li> As someone who is too pale for even the lightest color foundation, this product is great. I mix 3 dabs of this with a half pump of light (but still way too dark for me) foundation and the end result is perfect. If you are too pale or purchased a foundation that&#x27;s a bit too dark I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for a Harley cosplay by its self its too translucent but if you mix it with a pale foundation and set it with white powder or baby powder  it works out fine.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I bought it back in November 2012, used it pretty much every single day, and just finished it in July of 2013. This product is to be MIXED with other foundation! I get the lightest foundation I can find, and mix this in for the PERFECT skin tone! A little goes a long way with this. One or two pumps into my daily foundation. I would recommend this to anybody who is looking to achieve perfectly pale skin.</li>
            <li> Not good for acne-prone skin! It is not oil-free.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for lightening my foundations! I love it.</li>
            <li> Very runny, doesn&#x27;t stay applied very well and tends to clump real easy and quick</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it to mix in with my foundations to lighten them, since I am so pale it is nearly impossible to find one light enough. #palegirlproblems</li>
            <li> I found out about this through youtube.  This stuff is awesome!!! I have mixed this with bb creams, liquid foundations, and cream foundations and it works like a dream!  I&#x27;m able to adjust the color of all my foundations to a perfect match.  I do two parts foundation to one part manic panic. The best part is the texture and coverage of all my foundations didn&#x27;t change because I added this.  I was so worried about the packaging because some reviewers commented on how messy it was but I guess someone complained to the right person because it came to me in perfect condition.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin so sometimes even the lightest shades will show up dark and very orange on me. This foundation is awesome for mixing into those foundations that you love, but don&#x27;t quite match your skin. It also neutralizes the color so the color is no longer too orange or too pink.</li>
            <li> Thinner than I&#x27;d prefer, but blends well. It&#x27;s a true white, not a pale skin tone, and the consistency is such that it could probably be layered to create an opaque white skin tone.</li>
            <li> Amazing. This blends well, it mixes well, and it&#x27;s awesome for everyday and costume wear.</li>
            <li> You know, this stuff is really cool! I purchased it to tone down my regular foundation for a Halloween costume and it worked great! It stayed on through the day.  This is better than the generic white makeup found in many Halloween kits.</li>
            <li> It came undamaged and in only two days! The bottle is an average foundation size with a pump that gives just the right amount of product needed! If this ends up being too pale for you, it is also great for lightening previously purchased foundations. Oh and did I mention it is CRUELTY FREE AND VEGAN? That might be the best part. Or maybe it&#x27;s the adorable bat design. Either way I love this product and will definitely re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver!  I have very fair skin, and the majority of the foundations I own are too dark for me.  I used to tuck them away in a drawer and figure that all hope was lost.  Then I heard a Youtuber (ThaTaylaa) talk about this product, and I decided to give it a try.  It is the best purchase I have made in a long time.  I typically add about one pump of this to one pump of foundation,and it makes my foundation light enough to match my skintone.  It&#x27;s so wonderful.  I do not notice that it changes the consistency of my foundation and it does not change the finish - it does not mattify dewy foundations and it does not make matte foundations dewy.  It merely changes the color of the product.  This has saved so many foundations for me that I had previously thought I could never wear.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixing with a regular darker pigment to lighten it. Im pretty pale so i can never find a shade that matches my skin tone. So this did the trick.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is very light weight which is awesome because I do not wear makeup AT ALL (until now) so I am not use to anything on my face. The smell is a bit weird but I can get past that. This is the only foundation that does not make my skin appear orange it also blends very nicely :) I would recommend this product to anyone who needs something like this.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble finding my right shade of foundation, especially since I only purchase drug store products. I&#x27;m used to being about 3-4 shades darker than I currently am, and haven&#x27;t found the right foundation for me that can accommodate all that my skin needs. I have a yellow-green undertone, and I&#x27;m very oily, and I have the perfect foundation for when I am tan, so instead of wasting money trying to scout a new foundation that&#x27;s light enough for me, I just mix this Manic Panic foundation in and it makes it exactly the shade I need!! This is a water based product, so I would recommend only using it with water based foundations. It doesn&#x27;t really change the consistency of my foundations, other than making them have a more mousse texture, which I don&#x27;t mind at all. Otherwise, my foundation stays exactly the same, just now my right shade!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li> I quite enjoyed this product. I have very fair skin, and trying to find a foundation that matches me is nearly impossible. This product, when mixed with my foundation, BB cream, or concealer, makes the colour match me perfectly. Of course you have to measure it well and match it to your skintone, but it works very well. I would definitely buy this again, though I probably won&#x27;t have to for a very long time. :)</li>
            <li> Upon first looking at this product I expected it to come out as milk white as the liquid looks. In fact I was worried the moment I applied it to my face I would end up looking like a circus clown but on the contrary the color is not an overwhelming white but a nice pale one. The color is great for lightening other foundations or applying right over the skin. I liked to use this when highlighting my cheekbones or when correcting tones of other pale makeup I have. The thing I really love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have that offsetting yellowish tone that some other products of foundations can have. This is a really great balancing color for people with pale skin tones.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and I like to mix this ~1:1 ratio to regular foundation, usually the lightest I can get in stores. It&#x27;s the only way I can match my pasty skin! I always come back to this seller; very quick, courteous, and best priced. I also love the pump!</li>
            <li> I am naturally a very pale person (and sitting outside just makes me a lobster) so I mix this product with my normal foundation to make the perfecr color. Even the lightest foundations are too dark, but thanks to this I can buy any one I want and not need to worry!</li>
            <li> I have never ever found another foundation as good, for mixing with other foundations too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you pale ladies who struggle to find the perfect foundation for your light skin, look no further! This is the first foundation I have found that allows my other foundation to match my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: semi full coverage, blends out great and sets with powder perfectly. And the best part of all is NO CREASING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helped you!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used this enough to say much about it, but for the times i have it has worked really well. I havent had any problems with it. The shipping time was great!</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Its great to mix in with any foundation both matte and dewy and its perfect for pale girls :D&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it was available in Australia locally.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my pale skin days or works wonders when mixed in with a foundation to lighten it. I can never get the right shade but now with this I can make my own:)</li>
            <li> Works well. I have very white skin and mix it with my foundation for a perfect match. Not a bad product, but takes some practice getting familiar with it.</li>
            <li> Love mixing this with any foundation, makes it the absolute perfect shade for me! Will always be repurchasing. :)</li>
            <li> accidentally got a foundation one or two shades darker than my skintone... decided to purchase this since a youtuber recommended it and i love it. great coverage, not cakey, doesn&#x27;t make me oily. only downfall is that if i add too much it can be a bit hard to blend. other than that it&#x27;s perfect for blending foundations.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as I would have hoped for.  Just takes a few layers, in conjunction with the powder, to get a completely white look</li>
            <li> Good product. Will purchase again.Really good for mixing with it with a skin tone foundation.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use this to blend with my foundation for a lighter look for a Halloween wedding (going as Morticia Addams) and EVERY SINGLE foundation I&#x27;ve tried to blend this with has been like blending oil and water.  It does not mix.  I keep seeing all these reviews that say how great it is blended with foundation...WHAT FOUNDATIONS ARE YOU GUYS USING?! Seriously...I have tried higher end (Tarte, It Cosmetics) and drugstore (L&#x27;Oreal TruBlend) and this will NOT blend with any of them.  The ingredient lists don&#x27;t help because this seems to be water-based, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure (it does say it has Jojoba oil in it, but further down the list).  I tried it by itself on my face and it looked awful.  It&#x27;s clearly meant to blend with other foundation, but I can&#x27;t find one that works with it.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely FANTASTIC! I shall start off by saying that I am *extremely* pale. For people as white as me, there are only a few cosmetic brands that carry light enough foundation, and they are around $30~$50, or higher. Not an option for me. I am on a very tight budget. So I read the reviews for this, and discovered it is to be mixed with foundation to make it paler. I mix it to about a 50/50 ratio with my foundation, sometimes I do more white toner than foundation when I want to look a little more pale (I love to look very pale). On it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s on the runny side. But it dries to a matte finish, and won&#x27;t slide around or transfer when you touch it. That can change when mixed with foundation, depending on how your foundation works. Also, it&#x27;s water based, and not greasy. And it agrees very well with even the oiliest acne prone skin like mine! Not only can it be used with liquid foundation, I even use it with a heavy coverage stick foundation, I just put some of the stick foundation on my face, then I apply the same amount (or more) of the white, and then spread it on my face until it&#x27;s blended. Then I finish it off with a matte face powder. It ends up looking flawless and very porcelain. It&#x27;s absolutely lovely!  I think it could be used on it&#x27;s own, I&#x27;m not sure since I haven&#x27;t tried it that way, but it&#x27;s quite sheer by itself and so I think it would only give a subtle ghostly look, not a stark white look like a white cake makeup. I swear this has saved my life!!!! I love being ghostly white, so simply making do with something too dark was NOT an option. I wanted to find something to help me embrace how pale I am and this has made my wish come true! If you are super pale, BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will not regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this to lighten up foundations I buy that are too dark. This works great as a color corrector and also supplies extra coverage. Great seller, great product.</li>
            <li> used for cosplay and loved it!</li>
            <li> Several layers must be applied for it to give you an actual white face. Pretty good to make dark foundation lighter though, especially during the months when I tend to get lighter (winter) and I still have some of my summer foundation left this is what i use. I recommend (from several trials) to use a foundation brush, preferably a stippling brush to apply evenly and give a porcelain look. I tried applying several separate times with my fingers, a sponge, a flat foundation brush and a stippling brush and the stippling brush gave the best results.</li>
            <li> I love what it does to the color of my foundation, but my skin cannot handle i . I end up with really intense, under the skin break outs every time that I try to use it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this foundation after seeing a bunch of people use it on YouTube beauty channels.  One of the best uses I have seen is cutting a foundation that is a little dark, which can be useful if you are someone who is more fair in the winter and does not want to keep buying different colors.  A lot of people say it mixes really well with other foundations to lighten them.  I am very fair skinned and have only found one other super light foundation that matches my skin tone, and that is MAC studio fix liquid in NW13.  This Manic Panic foundation is literally WHITE, but it does blend very nicely and also offers good coverage.  You do not look like you have white painted on but it will emphasize fair skin.  My skin is fairly even so I cannot say how it works with acne or other skin blemishes.  I can say that I have very sensitive skin with exzema and severe allergies and the manic panic brand cosmetics do not give me any problems.  This white is great if you are super fair skinned and really like to play that up.  I got it for that reason, and for when I am doing vintage style makeup and really want that super fair look.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Wow, finally, the dread of putting on foundation that is too dark, too light, just not right IS OVER.  Dreamtone really IS dreamy.  It&#x27;s amazing.  My older skin has sun damage and is now a different shade from my too white neck.  No foundation I ever purchased was an acceptable shade.  With Dreamtone I can achieve the exact match I need and its consistency is indeed DREAMY.  Smooth, silky, mixes perfectly with my foundations (I have so many of them).  Outstanding product.  And handy to have for Halloween which is next month!  I give this product 5 dreamy stars!!!</li>
            <li> My dream come true! Finally bit the bullet and started mixing my foundation, since NO ONE seems to cater to my neutral/olive/pale skin. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, so I was glad to find this brand. Even more glad that I LOVE it. One pump goes a long way, blends perfectly into my covergirl and provides me with a flawless face! Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the shipping took forever. That brought it down one star. The product is pretty good. I bought this foundation to use as a mixer to lighten foundations, since I&#x27;m paler than most companies cater to. It has a slightly greasy texture, but blends well with both silicone and water based foundations. However, I wish it was a bit more pigmented, as I have to add at least a full pump to get the color results I want and this can effect the finish of the foundations that I&#x27;m mixing it with. Also, it doesn&#x27;t work as a matte highlight, which I tried several times. I guess it&#x27;s good that it really melts into your skin, as I hate cakey makeup, but it just lacks the pigmentation that I wanted. Will probably not repurchase, even though it&#x27;s a good value. I may try the Yaby &amp;#34;daisy&amp;#34; foundation or the Illamasqua Skin Base in white next time I&#x27;m looking for a mixer to lighten foundations to see if those work better.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you try to pump it out. It squirted everywhere ( hahah )</li>
            <li> i love this foundation first time buying it and i fell in love with it</li>
            <li> I wouldnt consider this a foundation, it is a foundation lightener. it is great to mix with another foundation to make the color match a lighter skin tone, but if you are wanting to use this by itself, it is very very watery and light light coverage. I wouldnt think it would cover any imperfections in the skin. But, if you are purchasing this for a lightener, you have found your dream.</li>
            <li> I love it so much &amp;#60;3 if u have pale skin it works perfectly i recommend  you buy it XD</li>
            <li> The Gothic white Manic Panic Powder is better but this foundation is terrific for a base coat or very ghostly look. ^v^</li>
            <li> I am very pale, and even the lightest foundations quickly turn 2-3 shades to dark on my oily skin. I bought this as a foundation corrector, like some other reviewers suggested, but it does not work with any of my foundations. I read the ingredients and found out why: this foundation is oil based (contains jojoba oil) whereas most drug store foundations are silicone based. So try to mix these two, and you will get white oil globs that refuse to mix with your foundation. The reason I still gave this 3 stars, is that it is a nice sheer and pale foundation on it&#x27;s own. I have been wearing it all winter, it goes on smoothly, and does not change colors to that ugly fake tan orange/brown color like most of my foundations do. I also do not notice it making my skin any more oily, but I will see how it behaves this summer. Like I said earlier, I am very oily, and the humid Texas heat puts any foundation to the test. Overall, I am still satisfied with my purchase, but I must continue my search for a foundation corrector that doesn&#x27;t cost a ridiculous amount of money.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and it has been a struggle to find makeup that matches.  The lightest shades available are always to dark.  I decided to add this product to my Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation until I reached the correct shade and it works great!</li>
            <li> I love! It is my holy grail for my pale complexion. I mix it with MAC&#x27;s match master foundation in 1.0 (obviously the palest one) and it looks exactly like my actual skin tone. I feel so much more confident now that my face truly matches the rest of my body. You only need a tiny squirt too, so it will last me for a good while before I need to repurchase! I also have a combination of oily to normal skin, and it goes on perfect. Flawless finish. Can I get an amen for the fact this product is also VEGAN and has good ingredients too? Damn! No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with my regular foundation, but found that it wasn&#x27;t opaque enough on its own to really make much of a difference. It sort of just thinned out my existing foundation giving it less coverage. I purchased a white powder at the same time that has much better coverage.</li>
            <li> Love this product...wish Anemic we&#x27;re available in this liquid form.  It can be used to tint darker foundation or alone.</li>
            <li> Omg Yes! This IS the answer for all fair-skinned ladies. This product is a huge money saver cause it gives you the power to buy ivory or porcelain drug store items that are too warm/tan/yellow and make them the perfect color. Therefore you don&#x27;t have to rely on super-expensive brands like Nars or Bobbi Brown to get a pale enough foundation.</li>
            <li> do you have dark circles under your eyes, concealer and sunglases will only cover so much? pat this under your eyes before you put on concealer ...and no more circles</li>
            <li> This liquid foundation is very VERY runny, it doesn&#x27;t really cover well and needs to be applied dried and layered to get the desired effect. I thought at first perhaps the runny consistency was because the bottle had gotten warm in the mailbox, so i made sure it was cool and shook the bottle for attempt 2, same issue. if you have pretty pale clear skin already it will probably do the trick, however if you&#x27;re trying to pale out and/or cover up I would pass.</li>
            <li> So being a really pale woman, i am always getting the lightest shade of foundation available only to find that it is WAY too dark for me, makes me look orange or just does not match my skin tone right.&lt;br /&gt;This is the solution to every pale girls problems! You mix this with ANY foundation you have and it will make it lighter, YOU CAN CUSTOM MAKE YOUR FOUNDATIONS TO SUIT YOU!&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little bit of figuring out how much of the manic panic dreamtone you will need vs your foundation (i usually do 50/50) but once that happens this will be your new best friend!&lt;br /&gt;I do not think this was made to wear by itself, it is made to correct the tone of your other foundations, and it does it&#x27;s job very well.&lt;br /&gt;THANKYOU MANIC PANIC!</li>
            <li> It came early and very secure, its just as described and fits well on my paper white skin. Its no clown makeup but a nice light almost translucent like foundation.</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation mixer for pale skintones who have trouble finding foundation matches, especially from the drugstore. This also works great to lighten a summer foundation to use all winter long as well. Manic Panic says you can mix this up to 1:1 ratio (50%/50%) with your favorite foundation without changing the consistency or finish. I&#x27;ve gone up to around a 1:2 ratio (33%/67%) and it didn&#x27;t seem to change my regular foundation much at all. All of the ingredients are safe for skin, and there are no free radical damage causing ingredients (which cause premature aging of skin) like alcohol, fragrance, or other irritants. This is very handy to have if you are very pale and have trouble finding matches in drugstore or even highend foundations. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am super pale and can&#x27;t seem to find any makeup that will fit my skin tone. Since I am Irish/American I have more pink than yellow in my skin and most makeups that are pale turn out too yellow. This has been great to add to the two that I can wear to help pale them out. Sometimes I also use it as a primer and then use foundation powder. It has not casused any reactions or acne (both of which I am prone to). I love this product- it can wrapped very well and even though I would not call my self a &amp;#34;goth girl&amp;#34; I took my Fatal Impact sticker and hung it my cubicle at work &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> My daughter says this is perfect to mix with other foundation when you have a very pale complexion. Her makeup is always flawless and she credits this.</li>
            <li> Meant as a mixer not by itself</li>
            <li> This product arrived before my estimated delivery date and it is very good! It works so well to lighten my normal concealer! It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap/sticky and covers really well. If you need to lighten your concealer or even just use it as your normal concealer I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for several years to find foundation that matched my skin due to me being so pale, and ManicPanic Dreamtone completely changed everything for me! I never thought i&#x27;d find a foundation that would work for me since i also needed it to be full coverage. Two pumps of this in the foundation i have and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect. It doesn&#x27;t take away the coverage of my foundation and actually makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very fair skin and have never been able to find a foundation light enough and always end up with an orangey color. I add a couple drops of this with a touch of my foundation and get the perfect color. Highly recommended to anyone with extremely fair skin.</li>
            <li> I love this because it&#x27;s the only white foundation available to me, but honestly I feel like it used to be thicker. I could be wrong but this was thinner than I remember(I haven&#x27;t bought this in a year) so it gave me much less coverage than I need. I buy this to mix with regular foundation to match my pale skin, but I really need coverage. Over-all the product is amazing, I will repurchase and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and all Manic Panic products !</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail product. It&#x27;s a thin, white liquid that you mix with your foundation or concealer to lighten it. I use it daily, about 2 pumps, mixed with my Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation. It does not dilute the coverage and the consistency is very blendable. I have oily/combination skin and have no problem with this separating or sliding off my face...though I do use a primer (Benefit Porefessional) and have never tried it without. Will continue to repurchase this!</li>
            <li> I got this to blend with other foundations. I have very fair skin (redhead) and I could never find a foundation that was light enough for my skin tone. I decided to quit the search and just blend my own. This stuff does the job :)</li>
            <li> Purchased because of it being cruelty free to add to my foundation which is still too dark for my skin slightly. I like it for the most part but sometimes it doesnt blend well with my skin. It may be my skin or its the product but some days are better than others with this one.</li>
            <li> This foundation has terrible coverage.  If you want to mix it with another foundation it will work, and if you already have flawless skin and you just want to be perfectly pale then go for it, but if you have even slightly dry skin or a couple blemishes this stuff sucks.  It clumps around dry skin that you can&#x27;t even feel, and the coverage is patchy even after multiple coats.  It dries and looks like chalk, and really only looks good if you take one pump and rub it in over a large patch of skin (like your arm) as if it were a moisturizer, so if you just want a pale body foundation go for it.  Extremely sheer and doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love Manic Panic as a company and I adore their dyes! I&#x27;ve been using them for 15 years. But I just cannot get into their makeup :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an extremely fair skinned person, and white out makeup tends to look much more natural than any other type of foundation or powder. Sadly, this is very dry and chalky and that is coming from someone with oily skin. It also gives a sheer wash of white but offers no coverage. So if you have dark circles under your eyes or blemishes, you&#x27;ll need a hell of a lot of concealer. Sadly, this reacts strangely to every type of concealer I have used. It cakes up around it and brings attention to it in an extremely unflattering way. It doesn&#x27;t not build well, it just looks layered and streaky if you try. The pump also leaves a ton of product left in the container. I tried adding this to my normal foundation to lighten it, and it does lighten it, but it also alters the texture to be cheap and chalky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good white foundation, skip this and go with MAC. Mac may cost more, but it will last for an extremely long time and is well worth the price difference.</li>
            <li> Love it to mix into my other foundations!&lt;br /&gt;It is not good as a foundation alone. It&#x27;s too thin. I really wish that it was a bit thicker. Would make a perfect halloween foundation!</li>
            <li> Although I wanted to try this product, I found it made my foundation too watery. I prefer medium to full coverage foundation. When it mixed it felt like paint and sheered out my foundation. The pump was a little hard to control. This was not the product for me.</li>
            <li> some pros: it is indeed white, it aplies rather smoothly, it blends fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: i have paleish skin but im ethnic so pale for me is lightly tan so i have to apply alot, that leaves patches and streaks, its REALLY runny, and the pump nozzle sucks and sprays it everywhere when you press it, it also wears out fast.</li>
            <li> I just got this product recently and I love it. The package arrived earlier than expected. I mixed a little bit of this with my regular foundation and it came out perfectly. A little bit of this goes a long way. For best results you have to be sure to blend it very well. I&#x27;ll definitely buy another bottle of this when I&#x27;ve run out.</li>
            <li> It got to me quickly and completely secure. The prodect at first looks as if it would be white circus makeup but it goes on nicely for really pale skin like my own. It blends perfectly. I&#x27;ve added it to other foundations to make then lighter as well and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! really helpful for anyone with light skin! I have never been able to find foundation light enough for my skin- besides Mary Kay (but that brand doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on my skin). I have been looking for a way to lighten my foundation for years without having to pay over $50 for.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this earlier! I currently mix it with Mac N15. (whatever the lightest shade is) it mixes well and doesn&#x27;t thin out the foundation too much either which is great! I also mix this with Lancome and whatever other foundations I have that are too dark for me. I will be buying this again and again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to add to my current foundation as I find most don&#x27;t seem to be pale enough for me and I get that totally unsexy look of an oompa-loompa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does the trick! It lightens the foundation without sacrificing coverage. I have found that it makes my foundation more mattifying than I prefer, so I add facial oils to the mix and it brings it back to my preferred texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is made with titanium dioxide, it does provide flashback in some settings from flash photography. I found that in the sun with flash (which, I mean why would you do that anyway?) I couldn&#x27;t see flashback, but in my dark room my face definitely had a white cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first product I found like this in this price range, all the others I had seen were outrageously expensive. The container is high-quality glass with a nice pump for dispensing the foundation. I really love this product and will probably purchase more until I run out or find my white whale: a foundation that actually matches my skin color.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this makeup</li>
            <li> Holy butts.  I got this because another reviewer mentioned in their review of this that they use if with Revlon ColorStay in ivory, saying that they use a combination of both for their pale, oily skin.  PALE OILY SKIN?!?! THAT&#x27;S ME!!!  WE&#x27;RE SOULMATES!!!!!  I was so shocked with this came and not only does it stay on beautifully, but it evens out my skintone super well and feels so smooth and soft.... I have a problem where my skin gets so oily throughout the day that my glasses basically refuse to stay put on my nose no matter what I do.  THIS FIXED THAT PROBLEM.  Guys.  This makeup makes me see better.  That should be one of their selling points; Manic Panic White Dreamtone: You&#x27;ll be able to see like its your gosh darn super power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I&#x27;m so in love.  And if you&#x27;re naturally paler or want to lighten this just a bit, definitely use a coat of this after a coat of the Revlon ColorStay stuff I was talking about earlier because they both work phenomenally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I did basically leave the same review for the Revlon product.  They work amazing as a team and both deserve the credit!!!</li>
            <li> Wow this product actually matches my skin tone and makes me feel happy with being pale. When I tan in the summer I use a liquid foundation which I love-but it doesn&#x27;t come in shades pale enough for me to use in the winter...but now I don&#x27;t have that problem! :D It smells like baby powder to me. I also did a swatch on my hand and the portion covered with this was smoother, not just with the product on it but even now-over 12 hours after I&#x27;ve wiped it off! It actually makes my skin feel better. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through a fellow woman who has acne prone skin and has a super fair complexion. I decided to order despite some customers recieving a defective bottle, I am to say I didn&#x27;t get one and the product is thick and works well. It lightens my foundation to the right shade with ease. I haven&#x27;t determined yet if it has affected the acne already on my face but I would like to think it hasn&#x27;t made it worse by any means. I hope this helps someone in need of having the perfect fair complexion with confidence and for those just trying to find their right foundation color.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice thus far, so I will not know how my skin reacts for another week or so. However, blended with my liquid foundation, it worked perfectly to lighten the makeup and match my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not hinder my setting powder either, and lasted the full 8 hours I worked outside in heat index 108 degree weather (100% humidity, yay south). Good stuff, glad I got it.</li>
            <li> This actually wasn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it would be for cosplay but i really like it for mixing into my foundation and making it closer to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast - I use this as a base to mix with other liquid foundations, as I am very fair skinned. It work marvelously.</li>
            <li> I can never find the perfect shade foundation. They&#x27;re all either too light or too dark but mixing a little of this with my darker foundations really has helped me get my perfect shade.</li>
            <li> I am a very pale girl, and I bought this to lighten my foundation. Sadly, I got a dud. BUT. I emailed them and they gave me a full refund and told me to keep the product!!! I will DEFIANTLY be buying from them again. They were so nice about it. I plan on reordering this product from them, because it was just a little mess up. Thank you so much some2buy!!! This pale girl will finally stop looking like an orange!^_^ BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE. THEYRE AMAZING AND KIND!</li>
            <li> Got this to mix in with a foundation that is to dark for me. Does a great job of giving me the results I want but it is really watery so it takes a a bit of mixing to get it to evenly distribute throughout the product.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re getting this to use as a stand alone foundation I do not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Since its watery the foundation will apply really patchy.</li>
            <li> This can be used sparingly to lighten a foundation, but once you pass a certain ratio, it changes the foundations texture. This is a very thin, patchy, and chalky product. I can see this being wonderful if you only need to slightly lighten a foundation but past about a 1:4 ratio, it makes it go on very unevenly and chalky with pilling in deeper pores.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff to lighten up my foundations that arnt quite pale enough for me. Its my holy grail pale girl makeup item. Easily mixes with liquid or cream bases and has never broke me out.</li>
            <li> This is great for mixing in with foundation if you&#x27;re exceptionally pale! It doesn&#x27;t really stay on fabulously, but if u aren&#x27;t going at your own face with an ice scraper throughout the day, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> First off: this is NOT intended as a stand-alone foundation. It seems that many people posting negative reviews dont know this. Aside from that, it&#x27;s amazing at what it&#x27;s suppose to do: lighten another foundation. It&#x27;s more so watery so it doesnt thicken up your foundation during mixing, and I find that if I mix it with foundation in a container it thicken up a bit after awhile if it was a little watery. However, I often just mix it up right before application and theres no problem. I&#x27;ve used this with MAC and Revlon foundations. It lightens without any chalkiness or caking. I still get full coverage even mixing equal parts. Definitely recommend even if you&#x27;re not fair but get darker and lighter throughout the seasons but dont want 3 bottles of foundation in different colors sitting around.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix with my regular foundation. A ration of 1:1 is perfect for my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t make me look pale. It&#x27;s great to find a solution that doesn&#x27;t leave me pasty or orange. The only fault is that the white will stick much more to dry skin. So, make sure you exfoliate and use lotion before applying.</li>
            <li> This foundation is great for quickly lightening up my foundations! I have very fair sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s difficult to find foundations that don&#x27;t make me break out and still match my skin tone. Using this, I&#x27;m able to lighten foundations that I love the coverage of and don&#x27;t break me out. (Or those foundations that I paid WAY too much for, but they&#x27;re just a little bit too dark, and I can&#x27;t bring myself to return them, lol.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation is absolutely pure white, very concentrated, and it is pretty thick. I would say this is a medium coverage foundation on it&#x27;s own, and could probably be used as a highlight if you&#x27;re extremely fair skinned. It&#x27;s vegan, cruelty free, and comes in a nice glass bottle. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, break me out, or change the consistency/finish of my other medium-full foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it can easily make you look WAY too white if you accidentally use too much of it. If you&#x27;re looking to mix/lighten your foundation with a product that still has a HINT of color to it, I would recommend the Graftobian HD Glamour Creme Palettes in the shade Ultra Lites, which comes in a range of warm, cool and neutral undertones in it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great once mixed in with a light foundation. It&#x27;s very thin almost translusent on it&#x27;s own. If you plan on using this product without mixing it you&#x27;re going to have to layer or it won&#x27;t come out even, and does not cover blemishes or dark spots well, plus you will run out quickly.</li>
            <li> Ehhh.. Sometimes it works. Not on a hot day.</li>
            <li> Takes a lot of product for coverage</li>
            <li> I am 2-3 shades paler than the palest drugstore shades (ie: porcelain / ivory / translucent) so I mix this Dreamtone with the palest shade I have found for oily skin (Revlon colorstay in ivory) in a 2-3 ratio. It works great. I also use &amp;#34;maybelline fit me matte and poreless translucent powder&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;stargazer white pressed powder&amp;#34; as my setting powders. All together it is a flawless look that does not oxidize at all. Lasts for about 8-9 hours on my oily skin. I ordered on the 13th and received it on the 18th. I will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin as water,not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation for helping with full white face make up for cosplaying, and it is good, its very white however you do have to pack on this liquid foundation and i found it more helpful a face primer than without. And this looks alot more white along with a white face powder. This is littler than face paint, so if you don&#x27;t want facepaint caked on, I would go with this foundation.</li>
            <li> AWESOME for pale girls, i use this every day, cant imagine how i wore foundation before this!</li>
