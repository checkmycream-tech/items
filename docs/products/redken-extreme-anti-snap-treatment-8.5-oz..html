            <li>I love all Redken products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>most salons have this product and use it...</li>
            <li>Yes I love this product and will reorder it when I run out</li>
            <li>I love this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Keeps my fine hair healthy.</li>
            <li>Came in secure packaging, I felt confident no chance of tampering.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s seems more healthy and full</li>
            <li>But everyone is different so best thing is to try first then buy...</li>
            <li>The Anti Snap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The person talking about it couldn&#x27;t say enough great things about it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to help my hair look better, but they all made my fine hair get very oily very quick.</li>
            <li>fast and leaves my hair strong and healthy</li>
            <li>Noticed improvement very quickly, well worth the cost of the product.</li>
            <li>if you have fine hair that gets weighed down fast, this is a great product!</li>
            <li>When I go to comb my hair, the comb glides through easily, and any tangles comb right out.</li>
            <li>I originally saw this product in the Glamtwins straight hair routine video, and since it got such great reviews, I figured I would go ahead and try it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I get much more breakage, especially in the front where there is the most heat treatment being done.</li>
            <li>Seriously this product is amazing, and smells SO good too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair looked this healthy!</li>
            <li>and I love the scent and that it is not heavy on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff helps a lot, and Is really nice especially when I&#x27;m not wanting to spend money on Kevin Murphy products.</li>
            <li>to it and the &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; immediately absorbed into my skin :</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and damaged especially on the ends.</li>
            <li>I first heard of this product online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, love the smell, and think it protects my hair from the heat while I blow dry.  </li>
            <li>makes my curly hair calm down, smells lovely and helps with tangles.</li>
            <li>I cant really say this has made a difference in I</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like it that much TBH.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Works better than other products on my hair.</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice, but when it goes on my hair, there is hardly any slip.</li>
            <li>My damaged hair is on it way to being soft again!</li>
            <li>:) bleached my hair on monday, washed it last night used this and a loreal shampoo and conditioner, in the black bottle.</li>
            <li>I rub one squirt if this between my hands and smooth it over my hair, working it in just a little.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and leaves your hair soft with no fly aways.</li>
            <li>I really think it helps not only with breakage but with styling as well.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and has even started fixing my split ends problem.</li>
            <li>Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought directly from Amazon.com</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and gets rid of the fuzz.</li>
            <li>always helped bring my hair back to normal state after coloring or bleaching.</li>
            <li>I really see a difference in my hair when I use it - there is definitely less breakage.</li>
            <li>It make my dry ends soft again.</li>
            <li>My hair feels quite stiff and I&#x27;m not sure if the Anti-snapping actually works.&lt;br /&gt;I have to use this in conjunction with oil or another slippery leave in to be able to use it at all.</li>
            <li>I am certain that the product I received was heavily watered down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I am certain that the product I received was heavily watered down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I rub a small amount it every morning when I am getting ready for work</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using long enough to know if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> hate to spend time detangling my long hair after a shower, but my hair is extremely fine, so most leave-in products weigh it down and make it go limp.</li>
            <li> have been using Redken Anti Snap for a long time and</li>
            <li> Some of the meds I take remove the shine from my hair, but the Redken Extreme treatment restores not only the shine,, but also softness and body.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s the only hair product I will use because I can&#x27;t stand anything weighing down my hair or making it feel greasy, and antisnap does neither.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It felt like when you have a little conditioner left in the bottle</li>
            <li> Like I said, every other product I&#x27;ve tried has caused my hair to get greasy and then weighed down and flat.</li>
            <li> I can either scrunch it and air dry or blow dry, and the product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a film feeling on your hair like other leave in treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past year and finally ran out.</li>
            <li> ask for a sample and take a small zip-lock with you to get one from an open container if they do not have samples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair softer and I believe I have been experiencing less breakage</li>
            <li> Doesnt make hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Then I let it sit for a few minutes while I put on my makeup or brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 5 to 7 years.  </li>
            <li> (I have thick, dense, 3c to 4a hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Sorry this did nothing for the snapping of my hair.</li>

            <li> I cant really say this has made a difference in I also see my hair stylist each week but she says that it is good stuff so I would recommend</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a film feeling on your hair like other leave in treatments. Noticed improvement very quickly, well worth the cost of the product. My damaged hair is on it way to being soft again! Thank you Redken and Amazon for your great service.</li>
            <li> Awesome to use after dying your hair... it gives enough nutrients to your hair so it won&#x27;t get that elastic effect.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 5 to 7 years.  I use it every time I wash my hair and I love the scent and that it is not heavy on my hair.  I really think it helps not only with breakage but with styling as well.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I love this and it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels great and I see a big difference in the hair loss and texture .... I love it.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for about a decade now. I really see a difference in my hair when I use it - there is definitely less breakage. There have been times where I have run out and haven&#x27;t repurchased immediately and I get much more breakage, especially in the front where there is the most heat treatment being done. I love how I can&#x27;t even tell this stuff is in my hair - it&#x27;s the only hair product I will use because I can&#x27;t stand anything weighing down my hair or making it feel greasy, and antisnap does neither.

            <li> I love this product and appreciate being able to order it on line at my convenience.</li>
            <li> I think this product was not even a recken Product</li>
            <li> I love all Redken products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and this was not different&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dries fast and leaves my hair strong and healthy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and my ends are close</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever used for frizzy hair. It makes my hair feel soft and gets rid of the fuzz.</li>
            <li> Keeps my fine hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Great for frizzy and unmanageable​ hair!!!  Smells really nice, too!</li>
            <li> The Anti Snap is fantastic. It make my dry ends soft again. I rub a small amount it every morning when I am getting ready for work</li>
            <li> I cut almost a foot of my hair off about a year ago. My stylist suggested this product to me since I had a lot of issues with split ends. I&#x27;ve been using this for the past year and finally ran out. I didn&#x27;t get my hair cut for an entire year and I had virtually NO split ends. Seriously this product is amazing, and smells SO good too.</li>
            <li> I first heard of this product online. The person talking about it couldn&#x27;t say enough great things about it so I decided to try it out. My hair is very fine and damaged especially on the ends. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to help my hair look better, but they all made my fine hair get very oily very quick. This product didn&#x27;t at all. My hair soaked up the product like a sponge and there is no residue left over to cause grease later on. Like I said, every other product I&#x27;ve tried has caused my hair to get greasy and then weighed down and flat. This product made my hair look and feel amazing. I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair looked this healthy! I&#x27;m very happy I chose this product and if you have fine hair that gets weighed down fast, this is a great product! Couldn&#x27;t be happier, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works better than other products on my hair. But everyone is different so best thing is to try first then buy...most salons have this product and use it...ask for a sample and take a small zip-lock with you to get one from an open container if they do not have samples.</li>
            <li> I am certain that the product I received was heavily watered down.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Redken Anti Snap for a long time and I could immediately&lt;br /&gt;tell the consistency was off. I squirted a good amount on my fingertip and touched another&lt;br /&gt;fingertip to it and the &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; immediately absorbed into my skin :-(&lt;br /&gt;It felt like when you have a little conditioner left in the bottle and you add too much&lt;br /&gt;water to get it out.</li>
            <li> My hair feels stronger after using this product.  It is not greasy and it is very light.  I use this product in conjuction with Crack.  And it works great.</li>
            <li> Works great from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using long enough to know if it&#x27;s working but the delicious scent alone is worth it.  Came in secure packaging, I felt confident no chance of tampering.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after a stylist used it on my hair at a salon. I was looking for a product that I could leave in, and I loved the smell of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to spend time detangling my long hair after a shower, but my hair is extremely fine, so most leave-in products weigh it down and make it go limp. I rub one squirt if this between my hands and smooth it over my hair, working it in just a little. Then I let it sit for a few minutes while I put on my makeup or brush my teeth. When I go to comb my hair, the comb glides through easily, and any tangles comb right out. I can either scrunch it and air dry or blow dry, and the product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third bottle-- great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair repair treatment!</li>
            <li> always helped bring my hair back to normal state after coloring or bleaching. It is something everyone should have in there cabnet</li>
            <li> This is a very good leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> the best thing everrrrr!!! my hair changes a lot when i put i on... it&#x27;s seems more healthy and full</li>
            <li> Like the way this product leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, love the smell, and think it protects my hair from the heat while I blow dry.  It also seems to make my hair a bit shinier, as well.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time.  It works great for my hair to soften it and protect it but not make it greasy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Sorry this did nothing for the snapping of my hair. It did give it some added moisture but my hair still broke every time I ran my fingers thru it. I will finish the bottle I have but will not be purchasing another.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair strengthening products I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Yes I love this product and will reorder it when I run out</li>
            <li> Great for bleached or damaged hair, great for preventing damage.</li>
            <li> I use this product after towel drying my hair. It makes my hair softer and I believe I have been experiencing less breakage</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in conditioner. Some of the meds I take remove the shine from my hair, but the Redken Extreme treatment restores not only the shine,, but also softness and body. Excellent product., I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
