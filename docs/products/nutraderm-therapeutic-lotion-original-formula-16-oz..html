            <li>It works perfectly on my skin and it was first recommended to me by a dermatologist for our son as he had a blotchy condition.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to see that Amazon offered it, and I hope that this fine product will continue to be available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion... light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it online</li>
            <li>but this one is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nutraderm Original Formula for over 20 years, and it&#x27;s still the best all-over body lotion available anywhere.</li>
            <li>Pleasant light smell</li>
            <li>The convenience of ordering online, good price, and quick delivery have made this my saving grace!</li>
            <li>Wonderful for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is very light and</li>
            <li>Newer products moisturize better, but leave an oily or slimy feeling on my hands.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has it at a better price that my pharmacy will order it for.  </li>
            <li>great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>but because of the internet I&#x27;ve always been able to locate it...</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had another skin problem and was thrilled to find Nutraderm online as it doesn&#x27;t seem to be readily available in stores in our area any more.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Nutraderm.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have found it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight yet effective.  </li>
            <li>and of course shop for the better price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but none of the stores around me carry Nutraderm any more.  </li>
            <li>So glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of lotions before, most of them costing in the $30-$50 range.  </li>
            <li>It has been a fixture in the bathroom for many years.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by a dermotologist to a friend many years ago.</li>
            <li>I have used Nutraderm lotion for many years ever since a Pharmacist in Oklahoma recommended it as the best lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Recommended to me by a dermatologist many years ago, this moisturizing hand cream has good and fast penetration, no greasy surface residue and is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>This lotion is light, non-greasy, has a very light scent, doesn&#x27;t cause acne and can be used face to toe.</li>
            <li>~this place is becoming my &#x27;one stop shop&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and refreshing, hydrates</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and has NO lanolin, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product is especially superior to other moisturizers, but I have used it for years on the recommendation of a dermatologist and just prefer it.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is light and easy for a child to apply - not sticky and it soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is light and never feels greasy or oily after application</li>
            <li>It is lanolin free.</li>
            <li>but they said it was no longer available</li>
            <li>and they talked me in to trying the Advanced formula</li>
            <li>I have used Nutraderm original formula for over 20 years</li>
            <li>I originally remember looking for something which didn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my face</li>
            <li>And thank you, Nutraderm, for keeping your Original Formula in production.</li>
            <li>The original company sold its formula and claims not to know who bought it.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found out I could order it.</li>
            <li>The best feature for me is that I can smooth it directly over my closed eyes and have no problem.  </li>
            <li>As promised, it moisturizes without causing breakouts and likely would be good for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it on Amazon at such a good price with such fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Like many other people who have commented, I have used this product for many years and have found it to be the very best moisturizer for dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only lotion I will ever put on my face, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many others!</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers, Nutraderm Original Formula was recommended to me many, many years ago by a dermatologist for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>LIke many others, my skin is too sensitive to use anything that is heavier and have no substitute for it.</li>
            <li>Formerly, Nutraderm was readily available at most drugstores.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses this daily on his sensitive skin and it works great for him.</li>
            <li>long use of this product which is very good but not sold locally anymore</li>
            <li>Please pass the work that there are many who still use it constantly.</li>
            <li>And many do the same to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by a dermatologist and has never failed me.  </li>
            <li>This was first introduced to me by a paediatrician in South Africa and it is fantastic - my 9 year old has used it morning and night for 7 years.  </li>
            <li>Now, 20 years later, I still have the occasional breakout and continue to love Nutraderm for its light, non-greasy feel and quick absorbency.</li>
            <li>and NUtraderm certainly doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Since I use the lotion every day, literally, I go through 2 large bottles per month.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive and dry skin for daily use.  </li>
            <li>The service was fast and the product was packed well.</li>
            <li>THANKS, OBAMA.</li>
            <li>Mi skin is very allergyc but with Nutraderm i feel a real relaxation.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it handles super-dry skin with a minimal amount of lotion.  </li>
            <li>None come close to the gentle moisturizing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I am ready to go for the day.</li>
            <li>I live in the Tucson area--NEVER bothered by dry, itchy skin--like many of my friends.</li>
            <li>It also does not have a perfume scent like many other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is prone to allergic reactions to certain cosmetic products.  </li>
            <li>It HAS gotten hard to find locally, I&#x27;m soooo happy to discover it on Amazon</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those with allergies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to almost every facial lotion and product, and this is one of the rare ones I can use that&#x27;s not astronomically priced.</li>
            <li>I first started using it as a teenager because it was the only lotion without lanolin, so it absolutely will not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>And it is a great moisturizing base for liquid foundation (makeup) - the makeup is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face for years, and nobody seems to carry it around where I live.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have sensitive, acne prone skin~or not!</li>
            <li>However, if you have extremely dry skin this may not be strong enough for you.  </li>
            <li>They recently stopped carrying the large bottles of Original Nutraderm in my local pharmacy (I now live in Jackson, Miss.), and they&#x27;ve never carried it at the big chains like Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li>I love this hard to find lotion.</li>
            <li>It was available for a long time in all Long&#x27;s, Savons, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple dozen products and they all irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Like I said in my title and as far as I am concerned, Neutraderm saved my life.</li>
            <li>Virtually no smell and keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li>My mother uses this product for extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(it wasn&#x27;t available in the small town in Iowa where my college was), then again when I was in Wisc.</li>
            <li>I have always had trouble with my skin and have tried MANY different lotions (including several that my dermatologist suggested)</li>
            <li>this came highly recommended from a dermatologist that I saw early in grad school when I moved to a really dry climate...</li>
            <li>NO other cream has worked for us and we have tried everything.  </li>
            <li>The only product I can use on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wasted SO MANY $$ trying other products and this is the ONLY thing that works.</li>
            <li>There are (or used to be) a couple of other similar-ish Nutraderm products that I have tried (one was in a green bottle and one in a blue, as I recall), once each, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find this lotion in drug stores, but if you order thru Amazon.com you will receive it quickly - right at your front door!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other specialty face lotions, thinking that I&#x27;m older now</li>
            <li>This lotion is a must have for my dry, sensitive skin and for my eczema.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my dermatologist years ago because I have dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Now it is hard, if not impossible, to find locally, and drugstore.com quit carrying it as well.  </li>

            <li> The service was fast and the product was packed well.</li>
            <li> THANKS, OBAMA.</li>
            <li> Mi skin is very allergyc but with Nutraderm i feel a real relaxation.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it handles super-dry skin with a minimal amount of lotion.  </li>
            <li> None come close to the gentle moisturizing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I am ready to go for the day.</li>
            <li> I live in the Tucson area--NEVER bothered by dry, itchy skin--like many of my friends.</li>
            <li> It also does not have a perfume scent like many other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to allergic reactions to certain cosmetic products.  </li>
            <li> It HAS gotten hard to find locally, I&#x27;m soooo happy to discover it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those with allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to almost every facial lotion and product, and this is one of the rare ones I can use that&#x27;s not astronomically priced.</li>
            <li> I first started using it as a teenager because it was the only lotion without lanolin, so it absolutely will not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> And it is a great moisturizing base for liquid foundation (makeup) - the makeup is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face for years, and nobody seems to carry it around where I live.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have sensitive, acne prone skin~or not!</li>
            <li> However, if you have extremely dry skin this may not be strong enough for you.  </li>
            <li> They recently stopped carrying the large bottles of Original Nutraderm in my local pharmacy (I now live in Jackson, Miss.), and they&#x27;ve never carried it at the big chains like Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li> I love this hard to find lotion.</li>
            <li> It was available for a long time in all Long&#x27;s, Savons, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple dozen products and they all irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Like I said in my title and as far as I am concerned, Neutraderm saved my life.</li>
            <li> Virtually no smell and keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this product for extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (it wasn&#x27;t available in the small town in Iowa where my college was), then again when I was in Wisc.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with my skin and have tried MANY different lotions (including several that my dermatologist suggested)</li>
            <li> this came highly recommended from a dermatologist that I saw early in grad school when I moved to a really dry climate...</li>
            <li> NO other cream has worked for us and we have tried everything.  </li>
            <li> The only product I can use on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted SO MANY $$ trying other products and this is the ONLY thing that works.</li>
            <li> There are (or used to be) a couple of other similar-ish Nutraderm products that I have tried (one was in a green bottle and one in a blue, as I recall), once each, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this lotion in drug stores, but if you order thru Amazon.com you will receive it quickly - right at your front door!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other specialty face lotions, thinking that I&#x27;m older now</li>
            <li> This lotion is a must have for my dry, sensitive skin and for my eczema.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my dermatologist years ago because I have dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Now it is hard, if not impossible, to find locally, and drugstore.com quit carrying it as well.  </li>
            <li> Nutraderm was recommended by my dermatologist about 25 years ago after I&#x27;d developed a serious rash and dry skin patches on my face - unusual since acne and blackheads had always been my issues because of oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I was ordering directly from the distributor, half a case at a time and sharing with my cousin.  </li>
            <li> She uses it on the insides of her elbows, back of knees, chest and face and anywhere where the skin is dry and sore.  </li>
            <li> A different company is manufacturing it than previously but the ingredients are the same and it feels the same.  </li>
            <li> I have only one bottle left, and have tried to track it down via its manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> And I received several samples of their other products.</li>
            <li> I tried other facial moisturizers as could no longer find it in stores</li>
            <li> Other lotions seem to block pores and sometimes cause tiny hard-centered skin bumps called milia.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me when I was having persistent eczema and it has helped with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> it was probably really dry out</li>
            <li> but I use it when my hands and face dry out after sailing.  </li>
            <li> I could not live without Neutraderm.</li>
            <li> The doctor prescribed a salve to treat the rash, then told me to toss the expensive lotions I&#x27;d been using and switch to pure, non-greasy, inexpensive Nutraderm - using it on my face and neck daily and sparingly.</li>
            <li> It has become harder and harder to come by</li>
            <li> and I needed something extra heavy duty...</li>
            <li> It is not the cheapest but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to use it rather than other heavier</li>
            <li> Every other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried in its place burns or stings my eyes in varying degrees.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily as a face wash and moisturizer, and have been using it for the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> I feel I have saved a lot of money by using this product rather than trying and discarding other brands.</li>
            <li> As a devoted fan she is not interested in trying anything else.</li>
            <li> Big fan of this product but hard to find in my area.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item from Amazon because it is hard to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> It is impossible to find in any stores, even by special order.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I was unable to find it in drug stores and none of the popular products work the same.  </li>
            <li> I have seen another formula, but not Original.  </li>
            <li> I have had cystic acne since I was 12 years old, and was unable to use ANY lotion on my skin UNTIL I TRIED NUTRADERM.</li>
            <li> and my skin has changed, but they&#x27;re all too heavy or perfume-y.</li>
            <li> but isn&#x27;t heavy</li>
            <li> No more break outs after I started using this lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Hard to find at a store.</li>
            <li> Lately I cannot find Nutraderm in the stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been the mainstay of my am and pm cleaning/moisturizing regimen ever since, which has been at least 30 years.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky in that 30 years ago in the midst of horrible skin problems, I stumbled on a dermatologist who told me to use Neutraderm to help heal my skin.</li>
            <li> I like it because it isn&#x27;t too thick and greasy nor is it too thin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure where I went wrong.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by a dermatologist after I had problems with an expensive dept store brand.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY !!!!</li>
            <li> It has become increasingly difficult to find.</li>
            <li> and it realy SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> Now it seems impossible to find.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, recommended by my dermatologist, but it&#x27;s soo expensive! :(</li>
            <li> Bad decision.</li>
            <li> I hate lotion</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Nutraderm since a dermatologist recommended it to me over 40 years ago(gee..where did the time go?). I have had cystic acne since I was 12 years old, and was unable to use ANY lotion on my skin UNTIL I TRIED NUTRADERM. It HAS gotten hard to find locally, I&#x27;m soooo happy to discover it on Amazon~this place is becoming my &#x27;one stop shop&#x27;. Truly a great product if like me..you have sensitive, acne prone skin~or not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for 25+ years. Newer products moisturize better, but leave an oily or slimy feeling on my hands.  Nutraderm is not oily feeling at all after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face for years, and nobody seems to carry it around where I live.  Amazon has it at a better price that my pharmacy will order it for.  I&#x27;m allergic to almost every facial lotion and product, and this is one of the rare ones I can use that&#x27;s not astronomically priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nutraderm lotion after my dermatologist recommended it. However, I can never find it in stores.  This was a good price and its lasts forever!</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have used Nutraderm lotion for many years ever since a Pharmacist in Oklahoma recommended it as the best lotion for dry skin. Lately I cannot find Nutraderm in the stores so I ordered from the company. The service was fast and the product was packed well. And I received several samples of their other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance-free product for decades! It was available for a long time in all Long&#x27;s, Savons, etc. Now, there are competitors (with lesser quality items) that hog all the shelf space. I am SO happy that I can buy it through Amazon. It is the best lotion ever -- will not clog pores, so can be used under make-up. I definitely give it an A+ rating!</li>
            <li> Big fan of this product but hard to find in my area.  Happy to get it easily and for a good price online.</li>
            <li> I love this hard to find lotion. It&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I have used this as a facial moisturizer for years after my dermatologist recommended it. Used to break out and he said to try this. I love it! No more break outs after I started using this lotion.It is light and never feels greasy or oily after application but it moistens my skin well. I tried other facial moisturizers as could no longer find it in stores and they just did not cut it. I was thrilled to find it online so I could continue using it.</li>
            <li> With no reservations, I say this is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Recommended to me by a dermatologist many years ago, this moisturizing hand cream has good and fast penetration, no greasy surface residue and is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I have used for years on my face. It was recommended to me by a dermatologist after I had problems with an expensive dept store brand.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for those with sensitive skin. My dermatologist told me to use it rather than other heavier formulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find in stores. Thank goodness for Amazon</li>
            <li> I WANT MY NUTRADERM BACK! I&#x27;ve used this lotion for 34 years... EXCLUSIVELY! It is without a doubt the best lotion on the market. It has become harder and harder to come by but because of the internet I&#x27;ve always been able to locate it... Now this?!?! It&#x27;s the ONLY lotion I can use on my face! AND on my entire body (especially crucial in the winter months!) without adverse affects (itching, etc.). I&#x27;ve wasted SO MANY $$ trying other products and this is the ONLY thing that works. Who do I write? I want it back!</li>
            <li> Best ever light weight lotion!  I have been using this for over 25 years.  Now it seems impossible to find.</li>
            <li> UNAVAILABLE AT EVERY STORE I HAVE LOOKED...THEY HAVE PLENTY OF LUBIDERM...BUT NEVER HEARD OF NUTRADERM.....DERMATOLOGIST RECCOMENDED SINCE I WAS A TEENAGE 40+ YEARS AGO.........</li>
            <li> I am not sure where I went wrong. However, I have A LOT of moisture in my mouth now. THANKS, OBAMA.</li>
            <li> Mi skin is very allergyc but with Nutraderm i feel a real relaxation. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for over 50 years and if they stop making it I don&#x27;t know what I will do.  It works perfectly on my skin and it was first recommended to me by a dermatologist for our son as he had a blotchy condition. This product still works for him as well.  Please pass the work that there are many who still use it constantly.</li>
            <li> I have used Nutraderm original formula for over 20 years and I love it. I originally remember looking for something which didn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my face and NUtraderm certainly doesn&#x27;t.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Nutraderm was recommended by my dermatologist about 25 years ago after I&#x27;d developed a serious rash and dry skin patches on my face - unusual since acne and blackheads had always been my issues because of oily skin.  The doctor prescribed a salve to treat the rash, then told me to toss the expensive lotions I&#x27;d been using and switch to pure, non-greasy, inexpensive Nutraderm - using it on my face and neck daily and sparingly. I&#x27;ve never had another skin problem and was thrilled to find Nutraderm online as it doesn&#x27;t seem to be readily available in stores in our area any more.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it handles super-dry skin with a minimal amount of lotion.  The big boost for me is that it is unscented, so my \\&quot;scent-sitivity\\&quot; isn&#x27;t aggravated.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandma because her local pharmacy stopped selling it. She&#x27;s allergic to petroleum and swears this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t break her out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nutraderm for 45 years. It has become increasingly difficult to find it in stores (with the advent of the many different types of Lubriderm). However, this is the only lotion that works on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple dozen products and they all irritate my sensitive skin. I LOVE Nutraderm.  I even buy two bottles at a time so I don&#x27;t run out!. Glad to have found it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nutraderm Original Formula for over 20 years, and it&#x27;s still the best all-over body lotion available anywhere. It&#x27;s the only lotion I will ever put on my face, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many others! I first started using it as a teenager because it was the only lotion without lanolin, so it absolutely will not cause breakouts. I&#x27;m such a devoted fan of it that my grandmother used to buy it in Calif. and ship it to me in college (it wasn&#x27;t available in the small town in Iowa where my college was), then again when I was in Wisc. for graduate school. Now, 20 years later, I still have the occasional breakout and continue to love Nutraderm for its light, non-greasy feel and quick absorbency. I&#x27;ve tried other specialty face lotions, thinking that I&#x27;m older now and my skin has changed, but they&#x27;re all too heavy or perfume-y. They recently stopped carrying the large bottles of Original Nutraderm in my local pharmacy (I now live in Jackson, Miss.), and they&#x27;ve never carried it at the big chains like Wal-Mart or Target. And don&#x27;t be fooled by the brands they carry: Lubriderm is NOT the same! It&#x27;s greasy and causes pimples--okay for feet and knees, but not hands, face, or body, in my book! Now the only place I can find Nutraderm is online with Amazon. The convenience of ordering online, good price, and quick delivery have made this my saving grace! Since I use the lotion every day, literally, I go through 2 large bottles per month. Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this excellent product. And thank you, Nutraderm, for keeping your Original Formula in production. Please continue to do so for all of your fans like me!</li>
            <li> I could not live without Neutraderm. EVERYTHING else causes me redness, swelling, peeling and scaling. You name it, and I react to it. I was lucky in that 30 years ago in the midst of horrible skin problems, I stumbled on a dermatologist who told me to use Neutraderm to help heal my skin. And he also told me to use Cetaphil Cleanser to wash with. He said that if those two didn&#x27;t work, nothing would. Like I said in my title and as far as I am concerned, Neutraderm saved my life.</li>
            <li> I was ordering directly from the distributor, half a case at a time and sharing with my cousin.  When I tried to reorder last month, I was told the formula has been sold and the company that bought the formula has discontinued it.  Like others have said, Nutraderm was recommended to me by a Dermatologist and I&#x27;ve used it exclusively on my face for close to 40 years.  Since it&#x27;s been discontinued, I&#x27;ve tried several others.  None come close to the gentle moisturizing this product provides my face and neck.  The best feature for me is that I can smooth it directly over my closed eyes and have no problem.  Every other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried in its place burns or stings my eyes in varying degrees.  And many do the same to my skin.  Is there any possibility of seeing a return of this product?</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores now that I have moved to Florida so order it on-line.  You can apply and immediately get dressed, work on the computer (which makes it a great choice for work as well), etc.  It is light weight yet effective.  It also does not clog pores if I apply and then go work out.  I have always had trouble with my skin and have tried MANY different lotions (including several that my dermatologist suggested) but this one is the absolute best.</li>
            <li> Thank you for carrying the Nutraderm. It is impossible to find in any stores, even by special order. I use it daily as a face wash and moisturizer, and have been using it for the past 20 years. Can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over 20 years.  My dermatologist recommended this to me when I was having persistent eczema and it has helped with my dry skin.  I was so disappointed when I was unable to find it in drug stores and none of the popular products work the same.  This lotion is light, non-greasy, has a very light scent, doesn&#x27;t cause acne and can be used face to toe.</li>
            <li> A superlative health care skin product that I have used for over 20 years. However, I have been advised this item has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Bad decision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It&#x27;s a superb moisturizer and it&#x27;s lanolin-free!</li>
            <li> Like many other people who have commented, I have used this product for many years and have found it to be the very best moisturizer for dry and sensitive skin.  I have only one bottle left, and have tried to track it down via its manufacturer.  The original company sold its formula and claims not to know who bought it.  I finally found that it has been sold to an International company, Galderma, not here in the US.  I have written to them, but have had no response.&lt;br /&gt;Please, Amazon, try to find this product for your customers who depend on it.  LIke many others, my skin is too sensitive to use anything that is heavier and have no substitute for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years. I was delighted to find it on Amazon at such a good price with such fast shipping.  This lotion is a must have for my dry, sensitive skin and for my eczema.  It is lanolin free.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more years than I can remember as a great moisturizer. It is light and non-greasy, which is perfect for my face. It also does not have a perfume scent like many other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> long use of this product which is very good but not sold locally anymore so have to make purchases via the internet and of course shop for the better price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but none of the stores around me carry Nutraderm any more.  I was so excited when I found out I could order it. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nutraderm lotion with great pleasure. The price was great! Thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from Amazon because it is hard to find in local stores.  I don&#x27;t know if this product is especially superior to other moisturizers, but I have used it for years on the recommendation of a dermatologist and just prefer it.  I feel I have saved a lot of money by using this product rather than trying and discarding other brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 35 years.  I have very sensitive skin that is prone to allergic reactions to certain cosmetic products.  Whenever I have one of these reactions, I stop using all products except Nutraderm until the condition clears.  It was recommended by a dermatologist and has never failed me.  I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for 30 plus years. It isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore, only online. So glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY !!!!&lt;br /&gt;  This what ordered but they said it was no longer available and they talked me in to trying the Advanced formula and it realy SUCKS!!!,.......... GREASY</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, Nutraderm Original Formula was recommended to me many, many years ago by a dermatologist for my sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s been the mainstay of my am and pm cleaning/moisturizing regimen ever since, which has been at least 30 years.  As promised, it moisturizes without causing breakouts and likely would be good for all skin types.  Formerly, Nutraderm was readily available at most drugstores.  Now it is hard, if not impossible, to find locally, and drugstore.com quit carrying it as well.  I have seen another formula, but not Original.  I was very happy to see that Amazon offered it, and I hope that this fine product will continue to be available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nutraderm Therapeutic Lotion for my facial moisturizer for years.  It was recommended to me by my dermatologist years ago because I have dry, sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s very soothing and has NO lanolin, which is a good thing.  I highly recommend this moisturizing lotion.  However, if you have extremely dry skin this may not be strong enough for you.  I purchased this item thru Amazon.com and it was delivered within 3 days.  It&#x27;s hard to find this lotion in drug stores, but if you order thru Amazon.com you will receive it quickly - right at your front door!</li>
            <li> This was first introduced to me by a paediatrician in South Africa and it is fantastic - my 9 year old has used it morning and night for 7 years.  It is light and easy for a child to apply - not sticky and it soaks in very quickly.  Pleasant light smell and we would not be without it.  She uses it on the insides of her elbows, back of knees, chest and face and anywhere where the skin is dry and sore.  NO other cream has worked for us and we have tried everything.  The thing to do is attack the excema vigorously for a week with specific PRESCRIBED steroidal cream... then use this MORNING and NIGHT and after bath or swimming, to keep the excema at bay.  When we stop using it, the excema comes back... so we keep on using it, until hopefully she might grow out of the excema.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember why I bought this lotion... it was probably really dry out and I needed something extra heavy duty...oh yea... this came highly recommended from a dermatologist that I saw early in grad school when I moved to a really dry climate... yes... this works great!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of lotions before, most of them costing in the $30-$50 range.  I like this one best.  It&#x27;s smooth and refreshing, hydrates but isn&#x27;t heavy</li>
            <li> Other lotions seem to block pores and sometimes cause tiny hard-centered skin bumps called milia. A dermatologist recommended this lotion to my wife years ago and it seems to work perfectly. It is also pleasant to use and has a nice texture. It is not the cheapest but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Using for 25 years - love it! !!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion... light and not greasy.  Great for sensitive and dry skin for daily use.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nutraderm Therapeutic Lotion&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product.  It was recommended to me by a Doctor. The service from Amazon was excellent also. Joanne</li>
            <li> My wife and her mother thrive on this goop.  I hate lotion but I use it when my hands and face dry out after sailing.  It&#x27;s Hard to find at a store.</li>
            <li> No smell or residue. Great for use on face for people with allergies.</li>
            <li> using it for years and it is great.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this lotion for years and loves it.  As a devoted fan she is not interested in trying anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the best for sensitive skin. Been using it for 20 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nutraderm for years. The only product I can use on my sensitive skin. Highly recommended for those with allergies. Virtually no smell and keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It has been a fixture in the bathroom for many years.  We would not be without it.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this product for extremely sensitive skin.  It is very light and the size of the bottle is generous.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. A dermatologist recommended it 15 years ago. It has become increasingly difficult to find. It has no scent (great for me with allergies). I apply it every morning all over my body and I am ready to go for the day. I live in the Tucson area--NEVER bothered by dry, itchy skin--like many of my friends. It is not greasy. It is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, recommended by my dermatologist, but it&#x27;s soo expensive! :(</li>
            <li> My husband uses this daily on his sensitive skin and it works great for him.Would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by a dermotologist to a friend many years ago. I use it on my face (only). I like it because it isn&#x27;t too thick and greasy nor is it too thin. And it is a great moisturizing base for liquid foundation (makeup) - the makeup is easy to apply.  A different company is manufacturing it than previously but the ingredients are the same and it feels the same.  There are (or used to be) a couple of other similar-ish Nutraderm products that I have tried (one was in a green bottle and one in a blue, as I recall), once each, but this is my favorite.</li>
