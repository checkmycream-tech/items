            <li>Perfect for pickle juice on our bloody mary bar.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and needed.</li>

            <li> Really crappy bottle, the top does not work properly, no returns on this product, don&#x27;t bother ordering it just so you can throw it in the garbage.     Contacted Amazon, credit is on the way.</li>
            <li> This is a reliable bottle with a nice flip top which comes in quite handy.  I like it and you will too!</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these, and use them for various oils &amp; balsamic vinegar for quick access while cooking.  They work well, and don&#x27;t leak around the lid like the ones I was using previously.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  Just what I needed for my liquid soap.</li>
            <li> I use this to hold my laundry detergent for the fire station. I have a 5 gallon bucket of detergent and then transfer it to this little guy. It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bottle, and it holds liquid.</li>
            <li> Great bottle. High quality , I  use them for my detailing chemicals and they handle everything I put in them and are durable and are the perfect size. I recommend them to all .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and needed. Great for homemade body wash. Seals nicely. No leaks.</li>
            <li> Use this to store my shampoo and conditioner in a convenient size. Not having to lug around big bulky bottles is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Great seller.  Bottles as described, better than expected!  The weight and size are exactly what I was looking for to use for shampoo and conditioner.  There are nice deep ridges in the cap that make it easy to use in the shower.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well. Seems like it will last.</li>
            <li> I use this for a travel wipe solution container and it works perfect, no leaks even clanking around in a backpack!</li>
            <li> Served its purpose and was not expensive. I like the spout built into the lid. I didn&#x27;t realize that came with it so that was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> A great product.  Only problem is the Shampoo hardens in the flip top, but that is easily corrected.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great quality!</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> Perfect for pickle juice on our bloody mary bar.</li>

This takes up less space under the bathroom sink and is easily marked with a felt pen.</li>
            <li> Came with one of those stickers that don&#x27;t come off easily and you have to use soap to properly remove the residue.</li>
            <li> Good bottle, good price.</li>
            <li> I use this container for shampoo that I buy in bulk sizes. I am happy with it - the flip top works well.</li>
            <li> This bottle is perfect for what I needed.  I had purchased a large refill size for my liquid body wash, but found that the original body wash bottle top couldn&#x27;t be removed to refill it.  The refill size was way too large to hold in my hands comfortably in the shower, so I found this bottle here on Amazon.  It fits my hand perfectly and is so easy to fill with a small funnel.  So glad I found it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Theres really nothing to say. It is exactly what it looks like, serves its function as a shampoo bottle perfectly. No leaks, no complaints.</li>
            <li> They are everything they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say? Works great. Well made.</li>
            <li> I use 2 of these. One for my baking soda wash and one for my apple cider vinegar rinse. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for these are perfect. I&#x27;d say the only thing is that when I shake the bottles to mix (most of what&#x27;s in them is water), it tends to splash/leak. But it&#x27;s not really a problem if I just wait to do that until I&#x27;m actually in the shower. I do like the spouts in the end though because I can squeeze my hair wash/rinse exactly where i need it most. Especially in the roots. Very happy.</li>
