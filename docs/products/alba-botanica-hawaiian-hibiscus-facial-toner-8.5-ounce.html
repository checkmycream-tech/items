    <ol>
            <li>great toner!</li>
            <li>It is also a great toner for anyone wanting to purchase vegetarian-friendly products!</li>
            <li>and they smell awesome and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and  I am VERY happy to have found it.</li>
            <li>Excellent!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>I can see this working great for someone who is transitioning from a chemical-laden toner to this.</li>

            <li>Another great product to try is The body shop&#x27;s seaweed toner.</li>
            <li>but it is also great for combination skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li>compared to when I wash with a cleanser and moisturize WITHOUT toning, and my skin looks noticeably not AS bright.</li>
            <li>its good in size, just got this today and used it.</li>
            <li>Still a good product, although I think it&#x27;s overpriced.</li>
            <li>It smells so good,</li>
            <li>Excellent toner with no burn, just a clean feel.  </li>
            <li>It smells good but the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and it does a great job of getting everything off of my face that I might have missed with the wash.</li>
            <li>well I&#x27;m so glad I did because it evens your tone,cleans and smell great</li>

            <li>nice cleansing</li>
            <li>My skin tone has evened out nicely after using this product.</li>

            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and not once have I experienced a stinging sensation from this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used this product for several years and its great!  </li>
            <li>This company used to make a pineapple toner that had more exfoliating enzyme in it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Great toner for removing any residue that I miss when washing and for leaving the face ready for serums that I put on afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love the way it was packaged.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Skin is more even.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect accent to my facial cleansing products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have clean, healthy skin with a great product that amazing shows results than torture it with written promises on a bottle that can actually make it look and feel worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and smell is good</li>
            <li>This toner smells amazing, feels amazing, and leaves my skin smooth, clean, and ready for moisture.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong, so it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>Feels cool and refreshing on face.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box, it felt light.</li>
            <li>got a light scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>I feel like it has the right amount of ingredients for refreshing the skin without leaving a residue or tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>smell wasnt very pleasent on the first application but by the third day I grew to love it, its awesome does what a toner should PLUS ITS ORGANIC holla!!</li>
            <li>It is pretty great that it is all natural and you can still feel it working.</li>
            <li>Since I added this to my skin care routine, it has made a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>Working great for my dry skin, then I use their face cream</li>
            <li>It feels very refreshing and leaves a slight tingly sensation after applying which feels really nice.</li>
            <li>This Hibiscus Toner is much milder and provides better results for my type of skin, even though it isn&#x27;t targeted towards acne prevention.</li>
            <li>really nice toner for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>i used to be able to purchase this item in local stores but not any more</li>
            <li>but luckily I found it here.</li>
            <li>It gets the extra dirt and oils that washing missed and makes my face feel clean and my skin absorbs my night cream nicely.</li>
            <li>Not sure if better than others but feel good after putting it on my face.</li>
            <li>My arms are not at 100% clear, but I can&#x27;t believe how much better they look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rare find in the stores here in St. Louis.</li>
            <li>smells fresh, cleans pores well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is more clear than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>It may be a good product to use when you want to take a short break from your usual product regimen, since it&#x27;s nice to have a vegan option.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>After my first use, my skin immediately felt tight and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light citrus smell, which is great because I have a sensitive nose and hate products with strong smells because they give me headaches.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Face is smooth and soft with no stickiness too.</li>
            <li>was witch hazel, because my face gets irritated by pretty much anything else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pricing is a fraction of the pricier department store brands I was using, and the quality and performance is just as good, (if not better).</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this product works so well to revitalize my skin after cleansing and taking any leftover residue from the cleaner off.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as much as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have really oily skin this toner may not work too well</li>
            <li>soooooo I am very picky about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job smoothing and exfoliating your face, but not to that extent.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face, but the main reason I bought this is my arms.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>Starting to be hard to find in stores near me, but this product, along with the face wash and aloe moisturizer work great on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few months and love the way it works.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen no negative reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It fixed my face!</li>
            <li>right after I rinse my face wash off, most likely because my pores are all still open, but it cools and my skin feels tight and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sensitive, oily skin responds well to this toner.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone, oily/combination, sunlight sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so cleansing my face has always been a factor I&#x27;ve always used alba products body washes</li>
            <li>Now I know why; the bottle of toner was half full.</li>
            <li>** star rating because with my complicated skin-type, its the ONLY thing that works for me and makes a night and day difference in my skin&#x27;s moisture retention and bright tone.</li>
            <li>It cleans the oily parts but does not dry my skin out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have been using this facial toner for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Super annoyed.</li>
            <li> I recently invested in a few Acnedote products from Alba Botanica, but I am currently returning two of them to Amazon because they reddened/irritated my skin and dried out the edges around the blemishes/breakout I had, which was really embarrassing to have noticed at work, and has NEVER happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product can go a long way.</li>
            <li> I paid nearly $8 for a HALF empty bottle?</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my face to dry or oily.</li>
            <li> The lid must have been loose because it spilled all over the stuff in the box</li>
            <li> if all I will only get half of what I paid for?</li>
            <li> Too watery, it didn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do, didn&#x27;t like smell.</li>
            <li> Whatever you want to say may have happened, its due to this.</li>
            <li> The bottle was not in a bag to protect the other items I purchased with it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin/ acne scars/ black heads, etc.</li>
            <li> but it stink my face a little.</li>
            <li> I cannot use Alba Botanica&#x27;s Acnedote Astringent Toner, it&#x27;s just WAY too harsh.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday in summer.</li>
            <li> and I almost lost half of the bottle!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Alba products, I find they usually work well</li>
            <li> (too lazy to go to the drugstore to pick up a bottle).</li>
            <li> and no more acne</li>
            <li> After using it for about a month, twice a day, my breakouts were just as common and my skin tone showed no improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clarins camomile toner for years and wanted to switch to a less expensive product.</li>
            <li> Plus, when I received it, the bottle cap was broken and leaking.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this toner.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated that Walgreens stopped stocking it</li>
            <li> Its awful and embarrassing.  </li>

            <li> This is my favorite. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on skin. Remove blackheads without drying me out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial toner for a long time.  Not sure if better than others but feel good after putting it on my face.</li>
            <li> Works just as any toner I have had does. It is pretty great that it is all natural and you can still feel it working.</li>
            <li> great toner! i&#x27;ve used this product for several years and its great!  i used to be able to purchase this item in local stores but not any more</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, it felt light. Now I know why; the bottle of toner was half full. The bottle did NOT open and there were no water stains on the package or liquid inside the box. I am incredibly disappointed. I paid nearly $8 for a HALF empty bottle? I will never purchase anymore products from this company. Why would I buy again if all I will only get half of what I paid for? If I could give zero stars, I would.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a very timely manner. It is also a great toner for anyone wanting to purchase vegetarian-friendly products! However, I would probably opt for a different toner if you hope to rid your face of acne. It does a decent job smoothing and exfoliating your face, but not to that extent.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and smell is good</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, but the main reason I bought this is my arms.  The hair follicles on my arms clog and I get red bumps.  Its awful and embarrassing.  Since I added this to my skin care routine, it has made a significant difference.  My arms are not at 100% clear, but I can&#x27;t believe how much better they look.  People have commented on the difference too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its got a light scent, it&#x27;s not greasy and I am already on my second bottle.  This is a permanent staple for me now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rosewater and witch hazel as my toner/astringent for years now. I decided to try this to see what the hype was about. After my first use, my skin immediately felt tight and not in a good way. I can see this working great for someone who is transitioning from a chemical-laden toner to this.</li>
            <li> Love this toner! What a way to make my brown skin glow and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while and Amazon is the only place I can find this product. I had used the facemask in this line and liked it so I also tried this. It has a nice smell and I can notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Alba products, I find they usually work well and they smell awesome and don&#x27;t irritate my skin. This toner is no exception. I use it at night after washing my face and before I put on my night cream. It gets the extra dirt and oils that washing missed and makes my face feel clean and my skin absorbs my night cream nicely. would recommend</li>
            <li> This product can go a long way. its good in size, just got this today and used it. already looks like a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This toner smells amazing, feels amazing, and leaves my skin smooth, clean, and ready for moisture. All that without over-drying, stinging or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;My skin clarity is great. And along with using the pineapple enzyme wash and jasmine E moisturizer my skin looks, feels, and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;The pricing is a fraction of the pricier department store brands I was using, and the quality and performance is just as good, (if not better).</li>
            <li> I like this toner, it&#x27;s very refreshing and smells great. This company used to make a pineapple toner that had more exfoliating enzyme in it. I was hoping this would be a lot like that. It&#x27;s not as much as I hoped.  Still a good product, although I think it&#x27;s overpriced. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> These two items that I ordered was not packaged well. It was just placed in the box and not sealed or bubble wrapped. As a result it opened and emptied into the box en route. How do you plan on compensating me for this?</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin. Then all of a sudden, w/i a week, there it was! Those big pores around my chin area that looked like wrinkley pits in my face  ,strunk, disappeared, or smoothed out. Whatever you want to say may have happened, its due to this. I continue to use it daily &amp; will buy again! I&#x27;m very pleased! It fixed my face!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and  I am VERY happy to have found it. It&#x27;s a rare find in the stores here in St. Louis.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells so good, your gonna want to drink it, but don&#x27;t! Lol. Working great for my dry skin, then I use their face cream</li>
            <li> Love this toner!  I have combination skin.  It cleans the oily parts but does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Great toner for removing any residue that I miss when washing and for leaving the face ready for serums that I put on afterwards. I feel like it has the right amount of ingredients for refreshing the skin without leaving a residue or tacky feeling. My sensitive, oily skin responds well to this toner.</li>
            <li> Too watery, it didn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do, didn&#x27;t like smell. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I think this is alright product. nice cleansing</li>
            <li> I love the product but I don&#x27;t love the way it was packaged. The bottle was not in a bag to protect the other items I purchased with it. The lid must have been loose because it spilled all over the stuff in the box and I almost lost half of the bottle! Not to mention the fact that I was stuck with cleaning up everything that was in the box with it. Super annoyed.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this toner. After using it for about a month, twice a day, my breakouts were just as common and my skin tone showed no improvement. Plus, when I received it, the bottle cap was broken and leaking.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has evened out nicely after using this product. It&#x27;s very gentle and not once have I experienced a stinging sensation from this product. It has a nice light citrus smell, which is great because I have a sensitive nose and hate products with strong smells because they give me headaches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clarins camomile toner for years and wanted to switch to a less expensive product. I took a chance on this and am glad I did. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Starting to be hard to find in stores near me, but this product, along with the face wash and aloe moisturizer work great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone, oily/combination, sunlight sensitive skin. The only follow-up \\&quot;toner\\&quot; I could use on my face after washing with a cleanser was witch hazel, because my face gets irritated by pretty much anything else. I recently invested in a few Acnedote products from Alba Botanica, but I am currently returning two of them to Amazon because they reddened/irritated my skin and dried out the edges around the blemishes/breakout I had, which was really embarrassing to have noticed at work, and has NEVER happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the hibiscus toner and gave it a 5**** star rating because with my complicated skin-type, its the ONLY thing that works for me and makes a night and day difference in my skin&#x27;s moisture retention and bright tone. It has that initial \\&quot;sting\\&quot; right after I rinse my face wash off, most likely because my pores are all still open, but it cools and my skin feels tight and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I moisturize, my skin just glows.. compared to when I wash with a cleanser and moisturize WITHOUT toning, and my skin looks noticeably not AS bright. I&#x27;ve done it before, because I&#x27;ve gone a week without it (too lazy to go to the drugstore to pick up a bottle). So this toner doesn&#x27;t just pick up any left over dirt, but it boosts and illuminates the overall look of your skin. Which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different. If you have problems with repeat acne/blemishes, monitor the amount and frequency of products containing salicylic acid that you use. I cannot use Alba Botanica&#x27;s Acnedote Astringent Toner, it&#x27;s just WAY too harsh. This Hibiscus Toner is much milder and provides better results for my type of skin, even though it isn&#x27;t targeted towards acne prevention. I&#x27;d rather have clean, healthy skin with a great product that amazing shows results than torture it with written promises on a bottle that can actually make it look and feel worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give the Hibiscus Toner a try!!</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use, my skin began to breakout. It may be a good product to use when you want to take a short break from your usual product regimen, since it&#x27;s nice to have a vegan option.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this product works so well to revitalize my skin after cleansing and taking any leftover residue from the cleaner off.  My skin loves it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell wasnt very pleasent on the first application but by the third day I grew to love it, its awesome does what a toner should PLUS ITS ORGANIC holla!!</li>
            <li> smells fresh, cleans pores well. not too drying.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so cleansing my face has always been a factor I&#x27;ve always used alba products body washes are great oils are great so why wouldn&#x27;t I try this well I&#x27;m so glad I did because it evens your tone,cleans and smell great all at the same time. It smells like lemons or some type of citrus and I&#x27;ve start letting my 15 yr use it and no more acne she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months and love the way it works. The scent is nice and it goes on smooth. I bought to use on my face and started using it on my chest and back. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is more clear than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> I really love this toner! It feels very refreshing and leaves a slight tingly sensation after applying which feels really nice. Face is smooth and soft with no stickiness too.</li>
            <li> Excellent toner with no burn, just a clean feel.  I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday in summer.</li>
            <li> really nice toner for sensitive skin, it&#x27;s very gentle. However, if you have really oily skin this toner may not work too well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my face to dry or oily. I have combination skin/ acne scars/ black heads, etc. etc. soooooo I am very picky about what I put on my skin. I hated that Walgreens stopped stocking it but luckily I found it here. Another great product to try is The body shop&#x27;s seaweed toner. I don&#x27;t have it in front of me but it is also great for combination skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I like it but it stink my face a little.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  It is my favorite.  People always tell me how nice my skin is for my age.</li>
            <li> I use only Alba products and this is an essential for me.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Feels cool and refreshing on face. Skin is more even. It isn&#x27;t too strong, so it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. It&#x27;s the perfect accent to my facial cleansing products.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells good but the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and it does a great job of getting everything off of my face that I might have missed with the wash. It&#x27;s light and I&#x27;ve seen no negative reaction whatsoever.</li>
