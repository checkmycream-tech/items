            <li>This stuff is sooo amazing!</li>
            <li>At 3 weeks there was no question, they were curling on their own.</li>
            <li>The combination of Rapid Lash, a great eye lash curler, and the right mascara really does make my lashes look great.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased.</li>

            <li>!00% satisfied.</li>
            <li>but most noticibly is the curl they have taken on.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad to use it anyway.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I PLAN TO PURCHASE ONE MORE TUBE TO SEE</li>
            <li>IF I GET MORE RESULTS.</li>
            <li>Definately recommended. :)</li>
            <li>and now I have more growing, giving my eyelashes a fuller appearance.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make the hairs thicker, but now I have more lashes.</li>
            <li>I recommend this and will buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Bonnie Goldman-Gold</li>
            <li>and I could&#x27;nt be more pleased.</li>
            <li>When I run out I will certainly by more.</li>
            <li>As for the price that many may not want to pay... I ALWAYS find it on Amazon the cheapest between $32-35.</li>
            <li>Yes, I probably pay more attention than I used to when I put on mascara because I just love seeing those looooong lashes get a quick coat of mascara, but there&#x27;s no question that my lashes are longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>Price is not bad either!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply once a night before bed time.</li>
            <li>I would like to know if their policy was easily obtainable before purchase.  </li>
            <li>fl oz tube is still going strong after 8 wks --</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after a blogger raved about it and since it is cheaper than most eyelash serums, I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This seller was fast and the price was the best I found on the net.</li>
            <li>Other than great looking lashes, I have experienced no other side affects!  </li>
            <li>I mainly noticed my lashes begin to curl on their own.  </li>
            <li>I really have noticed a difference in length of my top lashes and fullness on my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>But now that I have tried and used RapidLash for about 4 weeks, I can truely say \\&quot;it works\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works like magic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>and I am still on my first tube of it, btw!  </li>
            <li>I really did not see a huge diference until about 2-3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>It took my lashes the full 12 weeks before I could really see the long gorgeous fuller, darker, lash results.</li>
            <li>I can assume that it won&#x27;t work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>, i have notice my lash seem to be longer and more lush looking</li>
            <li>Believe all the positive reviews!  </li>
            <li>Some have done it during the day, but I think it&#x27;s better at night when there&#x27;s no other product to interfere with the process.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look gorgeous with a little eyebrow gel...</li>
            <li>Have been using Rapid lash for exactly one month now.</li>
            <li>My top lashes actually are hitting my sunglass frames which has never happened before.</li>
            <li>so by next month I will most likely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Rapid Lash!</li>
            <li>It does exactly as it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first tube</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an eyelash curler since I was 14, so I know what I&#x27;m talking about when I say that MY EYELASHES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRAIGHT!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first tube, though I already have an additional supply.</li>
            <li>The first .1</li>
            <li>I had to use it for exactly 2 months to see ANY results.</li>
            <li>I love my lashes, just wished this product kept them that way since you&#x27;ll have to keep applying 2-3X a week to keep your lashes unless I hear they go back to their \\&quot;original\\&quot; state.</li>
            <li>This product realy does what it claims, and I only use it before bed on top lashes.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows are very sparse but last month, they were more sparse than they are this month.  </li>
            <li>I saw many more positive reviews than negative, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>You really have to be patient.</li>
            <li>I think the difference really shows up when I use mascara....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work out, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt your wallet as much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>I was really skeptic at the thought that something could really do what this said.    </li>
            <li>Thanks,    Peggy</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to apply it to your lower lashes if you go straight to bed after the application, cos the serum will also soak into them when you close your eyes.</li>
            <li>Now so much change, but then again I haven&#x27;t paid as much attention to them as I have my diligent nightly application to my eyelashes.     </li>
            <li>After about 4 weeks, my lashes and brows looked much fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for having it affordable.</li>
            <li>It really works, you just have to wait for it to start to work in about 4 weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited about it because I didn&#x27;t think anything would actually work.  </li>
            <li>After using this product faithfully for a month and a half, I can report that my brows seem more, well, furry.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for 2 more weeks because I see in other reviews that you really see a major difference at 6 weeks!  </li>
            <li>I have hazel (more green hazel)</li>
            <li>Well I started using this stuff and they are starting to grow back in quick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap compare to other products.  </li>
            <li>I AM NOT SEEING MUCH NEW GROWTH</li>
            <li>because I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Well, 4+ weeks of religious application exactly as instructed and NOTHING has changed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, what people said about good and bad things.</li>
            <li>It is also true what some other reviewers have described....</li>
            <li>After using Rapid Lash for 6 weeks, now when I curl my lashes they really do look longer (not much fuller though) and are much easier to curl.  </li>
            <li>As a mature woman who always had great eyelashes, when I reached my 50&#x27;s and realized they were diminishing, I was unhappy.</li>
            <li>When I put my eye makeup on, wow, my lashes are lots longer, although they are not thicker yet...</li>
            <li>The regimen is fast and simple: at bedtime apply the serum like eyeliner.</li>
            <li>So far, this product did not work at all.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but   not any more.</li>
            <li>Lately, my brows have been getting even more sparse, especially in the post-arch area.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this product on my brows and upper lashes since Jan. 2nd and as much as I&#x27;d like to say I see a difference</li>
            <li>No more dealing with special eye washes at night.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because this is all I could have expected from my REAL eyelashes.</li>
            <li>but I use concealer so you can&#x27;t barely see it.</li>
            <li>What I like about it is that it helps tamp down any hard-to-tame hairs that cannot be accomplished using clear mascara.     </li>
            <li>I am a skeptic about most beauty products and have spent a little on some and have spent alot on others over the years.  </li>
            <li>The ends of my upper lashes used to barely peep out from between my eyelash curler, but now about 1/4\\&quot; poke out.</li>

            <li> I have different definition in the upper part of the face due to the brows - I would go so far to say that I now have the brows I had before I started to pluck them.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I did go thru an initial 5 day period of having red, slightly swollen skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Only  half, near my nose, grew darker and longer.</li>
            <li> so it does last long.</li>
            <li> My friend and my boyfriend have both told me this week that my lashes are so long, without prompting.</li>
            <li> My lashes are ridiculously long.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be realistic, you can&#x27;t expact wirey thick false looking eyelashes with no mascara, but this really did help make my lashes grow longer</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few times so no results yet.</li>
            <li> I am on my second tube and have tried to be diligent about using every night, but have skipped a few times.</li>
            <li> I was considering giving up wearing mascara because my eyelashes were getting harder to deal with.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product they are noticably longer and starting to fill in where I was missing them before.</li>
            <li> cuz I&#x27;m forgetful)</li>
            <li> Not really thicker</li>
            <li> I read the reviews carefully before ordering.</li>
            <li> Like all of you, I could probably retire on the amount of money I&#x27;ve spent over decades on products that promised something and didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> I use an eyelash curler and I wear waterproof mascara, so I had little missing patches, and my eyelashes never got long enough.</li>
            <li> I was pretty cynical about its effects on me, but after 3 weeks of daily applications, I could see an increase in length, although not in thickness.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have never been this long or thick in my entire life.  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE THEY ARE THINNING OUT DUE TO AGE.</li>
            <li> The real &#x27;wow&#x27; impact is when I&#x27;m wearing mascara, it almost looks as if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have not seen any improvement in the other half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to actually \\&quot;see\\&quot; a difference</li>
            <li> I was skeptical if this product really works.</li>
            <li> Now, with RapidLash I have the same (no, better eyelashes than I did before)!</li>
            <li> There is a slight pink/brown area where I apply along my lash line</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are now curly, thick and long.</li>
            <li> BUT it does burn a little and thought it was odd that no one else mentioned it.</li>
            <li> Got this product in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have next to none eyebrows due to an unfortunate incident with having them groomed in college.</li>
            <li> My lashes have been stiff and on the brittle side</li>
            <li> I do notice a very slight tingle while it dries which is all but a minute</li>
            <li> I need very little to get them to look longer.</li>
            <li> I started to see a small difference about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 weeks I saw results and small eyelashes growing in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a cynical person, but after using it now for 10 or so weeks (not everyday either</li>
            <li> No more clumpy, sticky messes.  </li>
            <li> I know others have said it worked after 2 weeks... not sure about that since your eye lashes need to shed to grow longer.</li>
            <li> Some of this is due to a thyroid condition (very common) and some because of the process of aging (also common).</li>
            <li> my lashes appeared healthier looking within a matter of days, after 4-6 weeks, longer and thicker, haven&#x27;t noticed any negative side effects</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re not sure what&#x27;s changed!  </li>
            <li> And much less expensive than Latisse.</li>
            <li> I was one of those skeptics that tried things and was always seriously disppointed.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I had tried Jan Marini&#x27;s brand and was sorely disappointed, same with Peter Roth&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> So not happy w/the stores policy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the bottom lash results.</li>
            <li> Very irritating stuff</li>
            <li> I noted that some people had bad reactions from using RapidLash, so I decided that if I had any adverse response I would immediately discontinue use.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of over the counter lash growing products and always been disappointed, but not this time.</li>
            <li> results.\\&quot; Don&#x27;t get disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to actually \\&quot;see\\&quot; a difference and it did take the 4-6 weeks as described to actually \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the difference. You really have to be patient. After using Rapid Lash for 6 weeks, now when I curl my lashes they really do look longer (not much fuller though) and are much easier to curl.  I think the difference really shows up when I use mascara....I need very little to get them to look longer. The combination of Rapid Lash, a great eye lash curler, and the right mascara really does make my lashes look great. I will buy again for maintenance as I am happy with the results. It is also true what some other reviewers have described....it may cause itching and red eyes when using.  Other than great looking lashes, I have experienced no other side affects!  Oh and btw....Amazaon does have the best price.</li>
            <li> Have been using Rapid lash for exactly one month now. I do see a difference in the thickness and I think the length too.  I can&#x27;t wait for 2 more weeks because I see in other reviews that you really see a major difference at 6 weeks!  I would recommend this product.  I don&#x27;t have any side effects or darkening of the eye area.  Easy to apply once a night before bed time. If this product continues to make my lashes thicker and longer I will continue to buy it.  Amazon is the cheapest place to buy it as well.  And much less expensive than Latisse.</li>
            <li> Because of all the great reviews I decided to try this product.  Have only used it a few times so no results yet. BUT it does burn a little and thought it was odd that no one else mentioned it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooo amazing! I started using RapidLash for about 12 weeks now. I started to see a small difference about 6 weeks. I really did not see a huge diference until about 2-3 weeks ago. My eyelashes are now curly, thick and long. I end up getting mascara on my eyelids now because my lashes now touch my eyelids. My friend and my boyfriend have both told me this week that my lashes are so long, without prompting. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have used Rapid Lash for 3 weeks now.  So far so good. No side effects.  My lashes seem curlier.  The only problem I have with the product is that now I check the mirror constantly to see had my lash grow or not.  I recommend people to try it.  It&#x27;s cheap compare to other products.  If it doesn&#x27;t work out, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt your wallet as much.</li>
            <li> I was reccomended this product by my mom who had said it worked for her so I decided to purchase it because I was noticing I had some bald spots on my eyelash all of a sudden. After 2-3 weeks I saw results and small eyelashes growing in. By  5-6 weeks they had fully grown in and are now the longest I&#x27;ve ever had them. This product does work!!</li>
            <li> I am on my second tube and have tried to be diligent about using every night, but have skipped a few times. I really have noticed a difference in length of my top lashes and fullness on my bottom lashes. I didn&#x27;t notice much with my eyebrows. My top lashes actually are hitting my sunglass frames which has never happened before.I am really pleased. I had tried Jan Marini&#x27;s brand and was sorely disappointed, same with Peter Roth&#x27;s. I will continue to buy and use this item.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My lashes are ridiculously long. My scanty eyebrows are totally restored.  This seller was fast and the price was the best I found on the net.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with Rapid Lash .I can tell the difference in my lashes, they are longer and fuller.Have received many compliments.I can say that for the price Iam really pleased.I was skeptical at first but   not any more.I have recommended this product to several of my friends</li>
            <li> Well, I researched this product before I bought it and had some confidence in it before trying it.  My eyebrows are very sparse but last month, they were more sparse than they are this month.  I can see them filling in and their actual shape this month.  I&#x27;m really excited about it because I didn&#x27;t think anything would actually work.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever have eyebrows like brook shields but I do think I will have eyebrows that I can see without makeup on.    I can now see my brows without makeup on.  I now have an expression to my face without using makeup soo this is big news for me.  It&#x27;s only been a month so by next month I will most likely love this product.  When I put my eye makeup on, wow, my lashes are lots longer, although they are not thicker yet...but longer is good!  My eyebrows look gorgeous with a little eyebrow gel...So it&#x27;s coming together.  Thanks, Rapid Lash!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my eyebrows (my eyelashes don&#x27;t need help) to help with overplucking I did in my twenties (now in my fifties) and I started seeing results in about 3 weeks of daily application.  My face looks different now with brows - I have different definition in the upper part of the face due to the brows - I would go so far to say that I now have the brows I had before I started to pluck them.  People tell me I look different but they&#x27;re not sure what&#x27;s changed!  I would give this product ten stars!**********</li>
            <li> This product really works.  It does exactly as it is advertised to do.  My eyelashes have never been this long or thick in my entire life.  !00% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my eyebrows and eyelashes both in thickness and in length.</li>
            <li> As a mature woman who always had great eyelashes, when I reached my 50&#x27;s and realized they were diminishing, I was unhappy. Now, with RapidLash I have the same (no, better eyelashes than I did before)! People ask me all the time if I have the prescription and I tell them about this product!</li>
            <li> WITH IN A WEEK I COULD SEE HOW GREAT THIS ITEM WAS GOING TO BE... A GREAT BUT AND A GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after a blogger raved about it and since it is cheaper than most eyelash serums, I figured it was worth a try. I started to notice results around the six week mark. I don&#x27;t think my lashes are fuller are thicker but they are noticeable longer. The real &#x27;wow&#x27; impact is when I&#x27;m wearing mascara, it almost looks as if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product now for about 2.5 months and I&#x27;m still on my first tube so it does last long. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Another gimmick in the beauty world.  This product did nothing but irritate my eye lids.  I woke in the a.m. with red skin around the outer edge of my eyes.  Very irritating stuff</li>
            <li> I was really skeptic at the thought that something could really do what this said.    But now that I have tried and used RapidLash for about 4 weeks, I can truely say \\&quot;it works\\&quot;.  I can actually see lashes where before there were none or were so short they were not noticeable.  I also have not had any side effects from usage.  I will continue to use, purchase and promote RapidLash from Amazon.com    Thanks,    Peggy</li>
            <li> I was considering giving up wearing mascara because my eyelashes were getting harder to deal with. RapidLash has changed that. My eyelashes are fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out Rapid Lash Eyelash Renewal Serum before forking over big bucks for Latisse. I was pretty cynical about its effects on me, but after 3 weeks of daily applications, I could see an increase in length, although not in thickness. The ends of my upper lashes used to barely peep out from between my eyelash curler, but now about 1/4\\&quot; poke out. The regimen is fast and simple: at bedtime apply the serum like eyeliner. You get about a 2 months supply per tube if you only use it on your upper eyelashes. There&#x27;s no need to apply it to your lower lashes if you go straight to bed after the application, cos the serum will also soak into them when you close your eyes. I have sensitive skin, so I did go thru an initial 5 day period of having red, slightly swollen skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am definately impressed with this product. I saw results after just 3 weeks.  I mainly noticed my lashes begin to curl on their own.  When I put mascara on, the lashes stay curled the entire day.  My lashes have been stiff and on the brittle side and I have noticed that they are softer now and look healthier.  It&#x27;s been about 1 month that I have been using the product and my lashes are filling out, but most noticibly is the curl they have taken on.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For years now, I have been filling in my brows with brow pencil. Lately, my brows have been getting even more sparse, especially in the post-arch area. Some of this is due to a thyroid condition (very common) and some because of the process of aging (also common). After using this product faithfully for a month and a half, I can report that my brows seem more, well, furry. Blonde fur. I give the product an 8 out 10 in my rating. What I like about it is that it helps tamp down any hard-to-tame hairs that cannot be accomplished using clear mascara.     I also tried it on my lash line, even though my lashes don&#x27;t need the help. I found that it irritated my skin so I stopped using it in this area after a week. I cannot report any change though others who have used it faithfully in this area may have different results.</li>
            <li> I did read the review and I wanted to try it. It&#x27;s true, what people said about good and bad things. But I&#x27;m glad to use it anyway.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am on my 3rd tube. Each  one lasts 2 months when used every night on upper and lower lashes, and eyebrows. It took my lashes the full 12 weeks before I could really see the long gorgeous fuller, darker, lash results. I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the bottom lash results. Only  half, near my nose, grew darker and longer. Have not seen any improvement in the other half. I have now been using this product 5 months. I don&#x27;t even use mascara. They look like they have mascara on them all the time. Love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING RAPID LASH ON MY EYEBROWS FOR ABOUT 6 WEEKS BECAUSE THEY ARE THINNING OUT DUE TO AGE. I AM NOT SEEING MUCH NEW GROWTH YET HOWEVER IT DID MAKE MY EYEBROWS DARKER WHICH HELPED TO MAKE THEM LOOK FULLER. I PLAN TO PURCHASE ONE MORE TUBE TO SEE IF I GET MORE RESULTS. I HAVE NOT TRIED IT  ON MY EYELASHS.</li>
            <li> I have next to none eyebrows due to an unfortunate incident with having them groomed in college. Well I started using this stuff and they are starting to grow back in quick! Definately recommended. :)</li>
            <li> I finally have hope for the cosmetic industry! I was one of those skeptics that tried things and was always seriously disppointed. Rapidlash worked for me! Let&#x27;s be realistic, you can&#x27;t expact wirey thick false looking eyelashes with no mascara, but this really did help make my lashes grow longer and now I have more growing, giving my eyelashes a fuller appearance. It didn&#x27;t make the hairs thicker, but now I have more lashes. I think, for me, it allowed my eyelashes to grow longer, without falling out. I use an eyelash curler and I wear waterproof mascara, so I had little missing patches, and my eyelashes never got long enough. Since I have been using this product they are noticably longer and starting to fill in where I was missing them before. I gave it 5 stars because this is all I could have expected from my REAL eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a cynical person, but after using it now for 10 or so weeks (not everyday either cuz I&#x27;m forgetful) I must say my eyelashes seem longer.  Not really thicker I don&#x27;t think, but longer.  I recommend this and will buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product on my brows and upper lashes since Jan. 2nd and as much as I&#x27;d like to say I see a difference.......I don&#x27;t. I will continue using though and hope that results start showing soon. I did miss 3 nights (not in a row) during this month of use....maybe that made a difference???</li>
            <li> I read the reviews carefully before ordering. I saw many more positive reviews than negative, so I decided to give it a try. I may be 60+ but I still care how I look! I noted that some people had bad reactions from using RapidLash, so I decided that if I had any adverse response I would immediately discontinue use.     I&#x27;m here to report that at 7 weeks, my eyelashes hit my bifocals. At 3 weeks there was no question, they were curling on their own. I&#x27;ve used an eyelash curler since I was 14, so I know what I&#x27;m talking about when I say that MY EYELASHES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRAIGHT! Yes, I probably pay more attention than I used to when I put on mascara because I just love seeing those looooong lashes get a quick coat of mascara, but there&#x27;s no question that my lashes are longer and thicker. Eyebrows? Now so much change, but then again I haven&#x27;t paid as much attention to them as I have my diligent nightly application to my eyelashes.     Like all of you, I could probably retire on the amount of money I&#x27;ve spent over decades on products that promised something and didn&#x27;t deliver. RapidLash worked for me. I can assume that it won&#x27;t work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth a try. Just short of 2 months of use and I&#x27;m still on my first tube, though I already have an additional supply. No way will I run out of this!</li>
            <li> my lashes appeared healthier looking within a matter of days, after 4-6 weeks, longer and thicker, haven&#x27;t noticed any negative side effects</li>
            <li> Believe all the positive reviews!  This stuff really works like magic.  I am a skeptic about most beauty products and have spent a little on some and have spent alot on others over the years.  After about 4 weeks, my lashes and brows looked much fuller and thicker.  Today (Week 7) I skipped the mascara and I am still on my first tube of it, btw!  It truly works and I already have another tube in my drawer when this one runs out.....it&#x27;s fabulous stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been three weeks since starting the serum, but I&#x27;m starting to see some difference.  I&#x27;m told it takes time, so I&#x27;m going to continue.</li>
            <li> The product description advises that it takes 4 wks or so before you notice a difference in the length and/or thickness of your lashes.  It&#x27;s true.  Noticed improvement at a month, and DRASTIC improvement after another 2 wks.  I do not need to wear mascara any longer.  Seriously.  No more clumpy, sticky messes.  No more dealing with special eye washes at night.  My eyelashes actually brush against my eyeglasses when I blink!    The first .1 fl oz tube is still going strong after 8 wks -- but I&#x27;ve already ordered the replacment product.  I know I&#x27;ll continue to use it.  How wonderful to have a cosmetic that delivers on its promises!</li>
            <li> Got this product in just a few days.  Came in great condition. Love this stuff. I wouldnt buy it though at the regular price. Thanks for having it affordable.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical if this product really works. I read ALOT of reviews before I purchased RapidLash eyelash serum. Well, 4+ weeks of religious application exactly as instructed and NOTHING has changed.  So far, this product did not work at all.  I gave it 1-star because I have very sensitive eyes and this product did not cause any discomfort.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It really works, you just have to wait for it to start to work in about 4 weeks you will have longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product irritated my eyes and the sellers will not take it back once opened.  How would one know if you didn&#x27;t open it  and try????????????????????????  So not happy w/the stores policy.  I would like to know if their policy was easily obtainable before purchase.  Sincerely, Bonnie Goldman-Gold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of over the counter lash growing products and always been disappointed, but not this time. My lashes are back to my pre-menopasal length and I could&#x27;nt be more pleased. When I run out I will certainly by more.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I&#x27;ve used this longer than the \\&quot;2 months it takes to see results.\\&quot; Don&#x27;t get disappointed with this product. You WILL see results. I had to use it for exactly 2 months to see ANY results. I&#x27;m using it now for maintenance about 2/3 times a week. I know others have said it worked after 2 weeks... not sure about that since your eye lashes need to shed to grow longer. I love my lashes, just wished this product kept them that way since you&#x27;ll have to keep applying 2-3X a week to keep your lashes unless I hear they go back to their \\&quot;original\\&quot; state. I have hazel (more green hazel) eyes &amp; have not had any change in my eye color. I do notice a very slight tingle while it dries which is all but a minute &amp; I do this routine at night with my nightly face wash &amp; face cream. Some have done it during the day, but I think it&#x27;s better at night when there&#x27;s no other product to interfere with the process. There is a slight pink/brown area where I apply along my lash line but I use concealer so you can&#x27;t barely see it. There are no problems with this product as I see it.  Just remember to be patient, it took me longer to get results. As for the price that many may not want to pay... I ALWAYS find it on Amazon the cheapest between $32-35. DO NOT order from the company site since it&#x27;s approx $50!</li>
            <li> i like this, i have notice my lash seem to be longer and more lush looking once i put on my mascara. would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Longer, thicker lashes after 2 weeks.....no side effects or irritation.  This product realy does what it claims, and I only use it before bed on top lashes.  Price is not bad either!</li>
