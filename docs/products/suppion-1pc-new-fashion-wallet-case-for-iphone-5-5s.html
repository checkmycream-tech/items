            <li> It look just like the picture but it does stand up on its own.</li>
            <li> nice wallet really it worth for  this price&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
            <li> I am livid. The case I received isn&#x27;t the case pictured. I specifically chose this case bc it was light pink on the inside (fabric and case). The one I received is light pink with a cheesy looking hot pink case. It&#x27;s not even quality. I&#x27;m currently waiting for a response from the seller. So far it&#x27;s been quiet.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD QUALITY AT ALL, OH WELL I GET WHAT I PAY FOR.</li>
            <li> came and was the wrong size for my phone i got it and my phone was to big dont fit a 5c so heads up it was great case if i could of used it</li>
            <li> This case started cracking and peeling after a month of using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;sâ€‹ okay! Didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Super cute. Fits in my back pocket perfect though the material is PVC tends to crack easy. But love the design</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fir a gift but seemed great.</li>
            <li> Love my case. Looks exactly like the picture. It said it was suppose to come a few weeks later but I got it really early. I love my case!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t fit my iphone 5s</li>
            <li> It very pretty my new housing</li>
            <li> I just bought this and it is already falling apart.</li>
            <li> This does not fit the iPhone 5C.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t keep more than two credit cards and the snap broke after two weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great bought one for a friend too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan. And that&#x27;s cause the flap gets in the way when I fold it back. If I want to take a quick picture I have to hold the flap. I also have to hold the flap just to use my flash light. It&#x27;s a good product. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> I like this case, i didnt really expect anything different from what i got but after a couple times using it the magnet started wearing the fabric out</li>
            <li> Was a nice gift for niece.</li>
            <li> Not even 1 star rating!  My phone would not fit the case!  The case was too small and my phone kept popping out!</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. It doesn&#x27;t even fit my iPhone. I have to stuff it in and it still doesn&#x27;t stay.  What a horrible cheap product.ðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> I like it . It&#x27;s pretty and everything but by the 2nd day it was starting to kinda fall apart:/</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t that pretty &#x27;. And the inside case fall out when I opened it</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture, but my 7yr old niece likes it so it&#x27;s her play phone.</li>
            <li> Awesome product... cute and worth the price!</li>
            <li> breaks easy on the corner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long wait to get the item but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. This case does not fit my daughters phone. Case is cheap, not well made.</li>
