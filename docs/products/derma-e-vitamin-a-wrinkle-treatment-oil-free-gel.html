            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I use this product at night and love it.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>feels good, nice and light - good for extra hydration in the winter with wind and heat.  </li>
            <li>I love gel masks because they are cooling in the summer and so easy to wash off compared to clay mask.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing but good for skin prone to acne.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a light moisturizer with no fuss.</li>
            <li>This is also paraben free and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I use this in the mornings after washing my face with neutrogena oil free face wash and using neutrogena oil eliminating toner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutrogena oil free face wash&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutrogena oil free face wash&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena</li>
            <li>I will definitely repurchase this, great product.</li>
            <li>Never thought a gel could do such a great job.  </li>
            <li>Well I have finally found a great natural combination that works great and is very economic too.</li>
            <li>Great price for the amount you get, it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I also use this Gel through the day if my face is dry just as it is and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would hold up to the dry winter air, but I&#x27;m actually quite impressed.</li>
            <li>A)is the second ingredient(after water), followed by Vitamin E indicating that it has a good concentration of both.</li>
            <li>Its a clear gel and it smooths on nicely and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>It appears to be fragrance free and very pure.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine, but the scent to me is too much.  </li>
            <li>This is the fourth derma-e product that I have tried, and while the products themselves have all been fine, the fragrances are too overwhelming in all of them.  </li>
            <li>If you are prone to any acne and are middle aged, this is a great moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am so glad to have found the Derma e line of products.  </li>
            <li>and I have finally relaxed back into beautiful skin and products I intend to stay with for a while.</li>
            <li>I massage it into my face, and it has a cooling sensation, absorbing quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin type is fair, sensitive, combo, fought acne on and off, and because of my mother I know prone to blackheads and larger pores with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No weird scent.</li>
            <li>It dies very fast, you only need a little bit, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and it leaves your face feeling soft and looking great without that oily-look that most moisturizers tend to give.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>But as of now, I am not going to order any more derma-e products as long as these added scents are in them.</li>
            <li>This large bottle has lasted me 2+ years.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this one, too.  </li>
            <li>The fragrances are just too much.</li>
            <li>whole process is:&lt;br /&gt;Morning:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 4 months now and I will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>Glycerin and Carbomer are now the main ingredients.</li>
            <li>I apply twice a day  - because it has a high water</li>
            <li>though very light small amount in AM under Primer&lt;br /&gt;Colorescience</li>
            <li>The is important for those have dark /black</li>
            <li>I mostly use this as a moisturizer for my neck, a little bit sinks into the skin right away.  </li>
            <li>This new formulation does not work as well as the old.</li>
            <li>It comes in a HUGE bottle that will last for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - this one is filled with natural oils (which i always thought i should avoid like the plague because of my acne prone skin) but somehow, when I use it, my face is LESS oily.</li>
            <li>mixed with this Pure D&#x27; or Organic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>It is clear, has no scent and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a clear gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised this product doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive, oily, and aging skin at 51 years old.  </li>
            <li>bottle lasts a while, as a little bit goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with other derma-e products and have seen a definite improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>My 26 year old son (with ultra sensitive, break out prone skin) started using it regularly, too.  </li>
            <li>I have one of those complexions that is greasy during the day, but very dry and flakey if i wash too much.</li>
            <li>I need very moisturizing hydrating creams, any dry skin cream gives me spots and normal creams leave my skin dry..</li>
            <li>This is a clear gel with retinol that I could tell was making me look younger.  </li>
            <li>However, their previous product seemed like it was a little better...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sharing because i have always suffered from adult acne and after fighting some super bad breakouts most of 2013, I&#x27;ve finally got it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cost is not high but felt it left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>I recently noticed how clear my skin has become since I&#x27;ve switched to this as my daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me first mention that the small picture of this product, with the yellow label is the old packaging.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and it will last a long time because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Too thick and has a strong scent - did not live up to describition.</li>
            <li>I started using this moisturizer, along with the wash and the derma e dark spot gel and my skin has never looked SO vibrant.</li>
            <li>It really seems to smooth my skin without making it feel dirty.</li>

            <li> I have very dry &amp; mixed skin that does not like oily creams.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years, as it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I like it because it does not leave a \\&quot;white\\&quot; residue like other facial cream.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get too dry.  </li>
            <li> it also works well with other facial products - you can layer it other skin treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to LaTHerape that I have been using this product did not measure up to the standards I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lotions that claim to be \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; but it felt as if they didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 other evenings</li>
            <li> My face would break out in little zits everywhere, blackheads were giving me pores in my nose area, seemed to be oily or dry but never balanced.</li>
            <li> I have acne and my skin gets dry from using medications and such, and this did not make my breakouts worse.</li>
            <li> always seems to have a layer of dry dead skin building up!</li>
            <li> It even lasted while I was in Chicago last week, and I was constantly outside with cold wind blowing in my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> purchase this product a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> At night I add a few drops of Argan Oil to it to use as a nighttime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> , I have combination skin and it has been hard for me to find a lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too oily looking.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to find the wright product.</li>
            <li> Before you look at the poor reviews, read this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use it also a base for my homemade gel charcoal mask that i use twice a week .</li>

            <li> It feels like elmers glue on your face.  I did not notice any difference in my skin, but then again, since it feels like glue on my skin, I only used it twice.  I will probably just toss it, its just too sticky.</li>
            <li> I have tried many retinol treatments and Derma e is the best I have found. I have used this only twice and my skin started peeling. This is what I wanted, something that actually works!</li>
            <li> Let me first mention that the small picture of this product, with the yellow label is the old packaging. The red label is the newest. I am on my 3rd bottle of this gel. And I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years, as it lasts a really long time. I put it on my face after my shower every morning. It is clear, has no scent and is non-greasy. I massage it into my face, and it has a cooling sensation, absorbing quickly. I use it in conjunction with other derma-e products and have seen a definite improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes. Retinol Palmitate(Vitamin A)is the second ingredient(after water), followed by Vitamin E indicating that it has a good concentration of both. It is not oily, a good thing if you have oily or blemish-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Hey,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this product a few years ago.  I like it because it does not leave a \\&quot;white\\&quot; residue like other facial cream.  The is important for those have dark /black skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product is also very light on the skin. Great in warm weather -like Miami. I apply twice a day  - because it has a high water content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for alot of Vitamin A treatment. Get a prescription.  If you are looking for a light moisturizer with no fuss. Get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS it also works well with other facial products - you can layer it other skin treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANN</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, but the scent to me is too much.  This is the fourth derma-e product that I have tried, and while the products themselves have all been fine, the fragrances are too overwhelming in all of them.  I wish that derma-e would make products that are just the products themselves without any added fragrances.  The fragrances are just too much. Unscented derma-e products would be definately something I would order.  But as of now, I am not going to order any more derma-e products as long as these added scents are in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised this product doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars. I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s, I have combination skin and it has been hard for me to find a lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too oily looking. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions that claim to be \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; but it felt as if they didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It comes in a HUGE bottle that will last for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s a GEL. It dies very fast, you only need a little bit, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and it leaves your face feeling soft and looking great without that oily-look that most moisturizers tend to give.&lt;br /&gt;3) Vitamin A is great for keeping the skin looking young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product every night, even my husband uses it and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I was approaching 30 and all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t seem to satisfy my skin. My face would break out in little zits everywhere, blackheads were giving me pores in my nose area, seemed to be oily or dry but never balanced. After several months of searching and trying different products I finally found the Derma E line of skin care and I have finally relaxed back into beautiful skin and products I intend to stay with for a while. My skin type is fair, sensitive, combo, fought acne on and off, and because of my mother I know prone to blackheads and larger pores with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s finally worked for me and hopefully my help you if you are in a similar search:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Glycolic Cleanser - AM/PM (takes of makeup too)&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Vitamin A Wrinkle Treatment Moisturizing Gel - PM Only (allow to set)&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Hyaluronic Night Cream - AM/PM though very light small amount in AM under Primer&lt;br /&gt;Colorescience Calming Primer SPF 20 - AM (trust me it&#x27;s the best tinted moisturizer/primer out there)</li>
            <li> Vitamin A is no longer the second ingredient for the bottle pictured. Amazon, this needs to be corrected. Glycerin and Carbomer are now the main ingredients. This new formulation does not work as well as the old.</li>
            <li> feels good, nice and light - good for extra hydration in the winter with wind and heat.  derma e is a great line</li>
            <li> I love, love this gel. I&#x27;ve never heard of a moisturizing gel before, just regular lotion moisturizer. I have oily combination skin and this gel is perfect. Its so lite and non greasy, but it still keeps my face from drying out, without breaking out. Its a clear gel and it smooths on nicely and absorbs well. My skin has never looked better. This is also paraben free and cruelty free. It has ingredients that you can pronounce! I have been using this for 4 months now and I will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to any acne and are middle aged, this is a great moisturizer!  Keeps your face moist without using a lot of oil.</li>
            <li> Compared to LaTHerape that I have been using this product did not measure up to the standards I expected. Cost is not high but felt it left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> Love this non greasy, colorless moisturizer.  Really love that it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this gel, non greasy. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> Before you look at the poor reviews, read this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and my skin always seems to have a layer of dry dead skin building up! I started using this moisturizer, along with the wash and the derma e dark spot gel and my skin has never looked SO vibrant. I have curly hair and use loads of products, so they always end up on my face and clogging my pores. The wash does an amazing job. I&#x27;m in the process of evening out my skin tone, so I have switched to all natural / minimally processed products.  This is a staple! Use sunscreen when going out!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this in the mornings after washing my face with neutrogena oil free face wash and using neutrogena oil eliminating toner. (im not advertising neutrogena, im just sharing what works for me.) I&#x27;m sharing because i have always suffered from adult acne and after fighting some super bad breakouts most of 2013, I&#x27;ve finally got it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is great. Like I said, it&#x27;s very light weight, but moisturizing anyway. I have one of those complexions that is greasy during the day, but very dry and flakey if i wash too much. This gel keeps me from drying out, without over oiling me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whole process is:&lt;br /&gt;Morning:&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena oil free face wash&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena oil eliminating toner&lt;br /&gt;*Derma E oil-free moisturizing Gel*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evenings:&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena oil free face wash&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena oil eliminating toner&lt;br /&gt;Bel essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - this one is filled with natural oils (which i always thought i should avoid like the plague because of my acne prone skin) but somehow, when I use it, my face is LESS oily. Im guessing because my skin isn&#x27;t producing oil, because it notices there is already oil on it. ?! Just a guess though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 evenings a week:&lt;br /&gt;Indian healing clay mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 other evenings a week&lt;br /&gt;*Derma E Microdermabrasion scrub*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, this product is great for mornings, and is part of my clear-skin process.</li>
            <li> I use it daily. I believe it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Too thick and has a strong scent - did not live up to describition.</li>
            <li> I have used Derma&#x27;s Vitamin A Wrinkle Treatment Moisturizing Gel for many years.  Great Moisturizer for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I got this awhile ago on a whim while at sprouts.  I love gel products, since I have oily acne prone skin.  Great price for the amount you get, it lasts a long time! I mostly use this as a moisturizer for my neck, a little bit sinks into the skin right away.  I also use it also a base for my homemade gel charcoal mask that i use twice a week . I love gel masks because they are cooling in the summer and so easy to wash off compared to clay mask.  I will definitely repurchase this, great product.</li>
            <li> My go to moisturizer for the summer. It&#x27;s non greasy and  feels really refreshing when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes without any oils, so it&#x27;s great for combination skin! I recently noticed how clear my skin has become since I&#x27;ve switched to this as my daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would hold up to the dry winter air, but I&#x27;m actually quite impressed. It even lasted while I was in Chicago last week, and I was constantly outside with cold wind blowing in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts a while, as a little bit goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive, oily, and aging skin at 51 years old.  This is the moisturizer I have found that serves me well.  At night I add a few drops of Argan Oil to it to use as a nighttime moisturizer.  So far, so good!  And, I have not found it to create an issue with my pores.  My 26 year old son (with ultra sensitive, break out prone skin) started using it regularly, too.  Good for all ages!  That, and lots of water - the number one beauty treatment!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer in a gel form for oily skin. I don&#x27;t know if the amount of retinal is enough to truly help with wrinkles, but I like it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am so glad to have found the Derma e line of products.  I use this gel at night before bed.  Sometimes I layer a moisturizer over it so I don&#x27;t get too dry.  It&#x27;s a great product - will continue to use!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer.  Never thought a gel could do such a great job.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tacky, either.  Good value.</li>
            <li> This is a clear gel with retinol that I could tell was making me look younger.  This large bottle has lasted me 2+ years.  You only need a thin, light coat that absorbs into your skin after about a minute. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is a clear gel. It is a good sized bottle. I layer my body lotion over it. It appears to be fragrance free and very pure. Not too sticky. It contains Vitamin A, which is supposed to improve the appearance of skin. It is also touted as an anti-aging ingredient. I will keep using this. Affordable and nice formula.</li>
            <li> I have very dry &amp; mixed skin that does not like oily creams. I need very moisturizing hydrating creams, any dry skin cream gives me spots and normal creams leave my skin dry.. I find it hard to find the wright product. Well I have finally found a great natural combination that works great and is very economic too. I use this Vitamin A Wrinkle Treatment Moisturizing Gel by Derma E 8oz (  a bottle last me 6 months) mixed with this Pure D&#x27; or Organic Argan Oil. I use 1 spay of the oil with a peanut amount of the Gel in my hand and mix to put on face morning and night and my skin feels great and I love it. I also use this Gel through the day if my face is dry just as it is and it works great for me. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It&#x27;s very moisturizing but good for skin prone to acne.</li>
            <li> Very light gel, not greasy yet moisturizing. I use this product at night and love it. It seems to deliver moisture more effectively than some creams I&#x27;ve used. I have acne and my skin gets dry from using medications and such, and this did not make my breakouts worse.</li>
            <li> Use it every day, and I&#x27;m a dude! No weird scent. One bottle lasts about two months.</li>
