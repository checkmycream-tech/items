            <li>but I have my own tools, I literally bought this&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose abd the colors are nicely blending</li>

            <li>nice product for the price.</li>
            <li>Its a nice set.</li>

            <li>For how cheap this product is it is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>The product is brand new and is awesome!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, stays on &amp; looks good.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and there are three shades to chose from.</li>
            <li>The brush is very easy to use too.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I love love loooove this product!</li>
            <li>It covered better - and looked better - than putting hair dye on my brows ever did!  </li>
            <li>Seemed very cheap to me, kind of regret wasting my money.</li>
            <li>The best brow product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Also love the fact that it gives you step by step directions on how to make and keep your eyebrows looking nice.  </li>
            <li>The tools and the brow powder make for a very beautiful and natural affect.</li>
            <li>The brown is a bit too light brown, but blends in surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>The color was good, and it went on smooth, but immediately flaked all over my cheek.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all you&#x27;d need to create a perfect looking but natural eye brows.</li>
            <li>Would cost more to build, of course - but use your own mirror.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed as far as shipping wise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice to have more than one color</li>

            <li>The brush is pretty nice and makes good outlines of the brow.  </li>
            <li>The stencils are a great tool in shaping your brow and the brow powder once applied looks very natural and gives a nice definition and finish to your looks.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need more practice.</li>

            <li>I have Anastasia dipbrow products that I love for their longetivity, but</li>
            <li>I never heard of this company, but I&#x27;m so glad I bought from them</li>
            <li>Better than ANY DRUG STORE BRAND INCLUDING NYX, REVLON, MAYBELLINE ETC.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have too many expectations, as I&#x27;ve never used a powder before, so I have nothing to compare it too...</li>

            <li>If you are trying to stay healthy and avoid breast cancer, avoiding parabens and halides will help.  </li>
            <li>Many companies are removing parabens from their products.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon......  </li>

            <li>Many colors for blending.  </li>
            <li>Love the color choices and brush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting a lighter shade but overall they are great!</li>
            <li>Finally I have the perfect eyebrows!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>So  much better than the pencil I used before,</li>
            <li>I only use the darkest shade because it shows up best on me, being a orange tanned color.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>The brow brush is a lovely addition to this.</li>

            <li>so much better then a pencil.  </li>

            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I like :)</li>
            <li>Compared to a lot of other brow products, the Cameo Perfect Brow Makeup is by far the best!</li>
            <li>It arrived packaged perfectly, but I was already using other brow products and doubted that it would be a &amp;#34;game changer&amp;#34; in my routine since the price is so amazing....</li>
            <li>but I find them very useful to guide my arch!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this eyebrow kit or</li>
            <li>I love it, so worth it!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s act fit on nicely and doesn&#x27;t get easily removed.</li>
            <li>Though I rarely use the plastic guide, the color is good, it does not smudge and its easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, the 3 different shades are great and it fills in the scraggly areas where I need it!  </li>
            <li>This came in three different shades to blend perfectly and applies easily.</li>
            <li>Shades are very complimentary and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It works great and it makes your eyebrows look normal.</li>
            <li>Product itself is pretty good....</li>
            <li>I already gave pretty good eyebrows, and never used a brow powder before.  </li>
            <li>Love the different shades and the quality very good.</li>
            <li>Now for the powders, they aren&#x27;t super pigmented and feel kind silky</li>
            <li>Really it&#x27;s as easy as brushing the color on, which I think might take more precision with an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a really good product for a good price, I have it to my friend with lighter brows</li>
            <li>it makes my eyes brow look great and natural love it</li>
            <li>those days are gone and now this product is my new favorite!!</li>
            <li>I never used these types of kits before for my eyebrows, but the large  stencil came out good.</li>
            <li>good quality stencils just too large for my face.</li>
            <li>GREAT, easy to use and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality, easy to apply,  stays on for long time, no mess, good price too !</li>
            <li>I was trying to be cheap, but knew better.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it always fills evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>The three colors are great for blending to make a natural brow.</li>
            <li>(I would have preferred it more if it had been glitter free.)</li>
            <li>Works great, and makes it look natural</li>
            <li>Love the product but, the stencil doesn&#x27;t fit my brow shape</li>
            <li>I loved that it came with stencils even though I probably won&#x27;t use them much.</li>
            <li>I wanted to have a very nice natural look.</li>
            <li>the other brow kit are perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a really cool set!  </li>
            <li>smears kinda easy ,not water proof</li>
            <li>The color stays and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So easy to use…</li>
            <li>And can easily be taken on the go</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the stencil but the powder is easy to apply and build up.</li>
            <li>I used the darkest one and it applied easily.</li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use even without the stencils.</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to use</li>
            <li>So easy to use with out the pattern too.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and comes in a variety of shades.</li>
            <li>it comes off too easily.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and my brows looked so good that I actually had several people comment that I have nice brows!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for a great price, however, I was not a fan of the flat eyebrow brush and used one of my own, I also neglected to use the eyebrow stencils, but overall the actual product itself is great.</li>
            <li>It comes with three stencils and your brows will look so amazing after the first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect color for my eyebrows, I thought it would be too dark but it suits me fine.</li>
            <li>But when applied to brows, they look fine.</li>
            <li>The kit was fine, I just had to give it away because it was too slim for the shape of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>the one I use works fine</li>
            <li>thats fine with me.</li>
            <li>The brushes are fine, tweasers work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Super product!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery too!</li>
            <li>This is a must have, really fills in areas, love it!</li>
            <li>Thanks for fast shipment and great product.</li>
            <li>The powders are great though, and made the money I spent worthwhile.</li>
            <li>This product had the potential to be great,  </li>
            <li>This case doesn&#x27;t fit in my travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li>and I have to free hand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the stencils or the tweezers, but the blendable colors and brushes make this kit more than worth it.  </li>
            <li>The stencils and utensils are great but the powder does not last at all.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast and it was wrapped really nice , packaged well.</li>
            <li>Overall, i&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I will order this again for the powder.</li>
            <li>This apply smoothly with a brush, and will survive sweating.</li>
            <li>and I wanted light brown.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the light color at all.</li>
            <li>but those aren&#x27;t really important.</li>
            <li>My brows are fuller, gaps filled, and you&#x27;d never know it.  </li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;ve always had extremely light eyebrows like my mom.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was hassle free.</li>
            <li>and so I just free hand the lines.</li>
            <li>Smooth color match all....</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>Darker for the ends and light for the front.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Although i have no use for the stencils i am happy with the rest of the set!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>This brow kit makes them look natural and really good.</li>
            <li>This product works like magic, it&#x27;s very easy to apply and looks natural.</li>
            <li>The powder is good, I&#x27;ve used it once so far and will have to practice a little bit to find the right mix of colors, but I like that it has 3 options so you can get the perfect match, and the brush that comes in this kit works just fine.</li>
            <li>Very nice however if the box had a snap to keep it close it would keep the brushes in place other than that I love it</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my order and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>This is the  best eyebrow makeup, it stays on all day and you need very little to apply to get the desired result.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow set, it goes on pretty well.</li>
            <li>The stencils are kind of a joke, but it&#x27;s not hard to apply this makeup without them.  </li>
            <li>The powder is true to color, has a nice, soft feel, it goes on easily and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Gave it a five star because it arrived early on top of how much I am satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would have liked was more stencils.  </li>
            <li>and more it makes you&#x27;re eyebrows look like pure perfection .</li>
            <li>Brilliant little case to keep everything in as well.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the pigmentation but its very good and stays on all day with a few touch ups every now and then.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural , looks just like the picture and the price is just amazing (:</li>
            <li>.. Will be buying more.. And also fast shipping</li>
            <li>Overall for the price its good to dust over liner.</li>
            <li>It lasts the entire day and looked just as good 8 hours after I applied it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>and I still have a good bit left from the one color I use to fill in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It might work better on real eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this product has such good reviews.</li>
            <li>Okay for filling in, but didn&#x27;t care for it much for definition of the brow.</li>
            <li>and I was going to be upset because I paid good money for something that might not actually be what the photo shows.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say more than that</li>
            <li>This product is full of parabens.  </li>
            <li>Thanks:)</li>
            <li>The powder in this product are reliable, but I think it&#x27;s only good for eyebrows that are still full.</li>
            <li>Not bad...</li>
            <li>not bad for the price, stencils were did not work for my eyebrow shape.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I MEAN THE BEST EYE BROW KIT EVER MADE, BAR NONE.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice and dark and with the brush, it is VERY easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It lasts long and makes brows look natural unlike most brow makeup I&#x27;ve used and the shipping was also great</li>
            <li>Thank order came quickly</li>
            <li>Super helpful like it</li>
            <li>I love the brush better than the one I received from urban decay and the stencils that comes with the product</li>
            <li>On days when I want something quick</li>
            <li>I love how the powder goes on so smooth and looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Quick application.  </li>
            <li>Better than most similar products</li>
            <li>So much better than my old eyebrow pencil!!</li>
            <li>I either sported a not quite full enough brow, or I looked like the iconic artist Frida Kahlo!</li>
            <li>This is a really great brow powder for dark hair (even medium tones could use this).</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>it looks so natural and easy too use!</li>
            <li>This kit is very versatile and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it when I first got it done, but as of recently they need to be redone.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I want!</li>
            <li>I have tried many brow makeups and most have either been too dark or too light.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>The instructions could&#x27;ve been better and the brushes are kind of hard to hold on to especially at certain angles.</li>
            <li>This is just a great little eyebrow kit.  </li>
            <li>Hahahaha light</li>
            <li>Great kit, useful for everyday.</li>
            <li>Although I have my own tweezers, to me, the tweezers that come with this kit are short</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a powder to use instead of the pencil I use because I think powder would give a more natural brow appearance.  </li>
            <li>And the powder is easier and looks more natural than using the pencil.</li>
            <li>Realistic looking and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Using just this kit alone gives it a more natural look.</li>
            <li>I like the fact it can be blended, to give your brows a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are helpful and the tools can be useful.</li>
            <li>the price, I say the product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is worth it, worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be doing my own eyebrow styling from now on.</li>
            <li>but I was looking for something more natural.</li>
            <li>its worth the money tbh</li>
            <li>I still looked freshly made up.</li>
            <li>I had been using a brow pencil for quite a while and was looking for something that made my sparse eyebrows look more natural, and I came upon this.</li>
            <li>like choice of colors to mix for more natural effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Brushes &amp; Product my own fault though since it was totally inexpensive.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t see that as worth losing a star.</li>
            <li>I like the shades of brown because it allows me to make my eyebrows look more natural.</li>
            <li>I love how natural it looks.</li>
            <li>Since, I kind of stink at making the proper outline for my brows, the templates have been a Godsend.  </li>
            <li>It comes with three shades of brown powder, a soft angle brush, a bristle brush, tweezers (which I didn&#x27;t think I would use but are actually pretty good quality and good and plucking small eyebrow hairs) and eyebrow stencils.  </li>
            <li>Hi, I ordered this for a friend and she and some other friends liked this so much that I placed another order for more.</li>
            <li>The color palette is fine, I guess, but the main reason I bought this was for the stencils, which in my book is a fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love things product...wish it had didn&#x27;t stencils but other then that you will love it..</li>
            <li>Other than that its a good product that does what it says</li>
            <li>Everyone is right about the stencils that it comes with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for that just right color of brow makeup for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Everything in it is just right except the stencils</li>
            <li>right before it was delivered  </li>
            <li>and it came right on time</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>Just had to try it right away.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be going back to a pencil though for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Color is perfect for someone with dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect kit for my brows anyone with brown mid-brown or dark eyebrows I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>So natural and perfect for my jet black hair!!</li>
            <li>I have black hair and this matches perfectly, doesn&#x27;t look too dark and the brush makes it so easy to shape your eyebrows the way you want it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very think and full eyebrows</li>
            <li>I have dark eyebrows and this makes them look clean and really nice.</li>
            <li>Love love that its in a little box</li>
            <li>but it is cheap so just buy new ones for about $10.</li>
            <li>The colors are natural and the instructions on the inside are easy and helpful.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was, and how &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; it made my eyebrows look.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, natural looking and lasts.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and looks fairly natural.</li>
            <li>Easy to use , natural looking brows stay on for hours.</li>
            <li>The powder looks ok, but this is not a package worth buying overall.</li>
            <li>It looks natural, stays on, and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I like this but have not been able to hold the shaper on in the right place and apply color at the same time</li>
            <li>The stencils are sooo good, my eyebrows are on FLEEEEEK , I used the Kiss eyebrow kit previously, but this will be my new go to, trust me it is worth the buy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheaply made entirely.</li>
            <li>i like it very much &amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>Seems like a good idea with a neat little eyebrow kit all in one place, but i wouldnt reccomend.</li>
            <li>great product other than the tweezers are worthless, Brushes are good and the colors are good.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>First of all, this was packaged well, and arrived in a timely manner..</li>
            <li>I did love the eyebrow brush and the tweezers &amp; I definitely consider those a plus.</li>
            <li>Unless you are willing to take your time and tape the stencils to your brows so you can outline them then</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>Only thing I wish is that there were more of the eyebrow guides provided as none of the ones provided work for my shape</li>
            <li>I was trying to find something similar to dip brow for a better price.</li>
            <li>Well, first off the stencils are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and blends in with my natural eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I used it as soon as I got it &amp; instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>Love the different shades</li>
            <li>I love the stencils, the color, the only thing that it does not stay.</li>
            <li>This was my first venture into powder brow liner.</li>
            <li>I like the texture of the powder, it&#x27;s soft and fills in smoothly</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li>This stuff really sticks!  </li>
            <li>and I love the different shoes they have.</li>
            <li>That exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>The brow powder stays in place with two powders the same color, the one I&#x27;ll use the most, and a lighter powder.  </li>
            <li>When it is hot or I sweat</li>
            <li>I have finally found a brow powder that I&#x27;m satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self, everything is pretty good to me, the stencils look good on me, I don&#x27;t know where other people are getting those negative thoughts from.  </li>
            <li>It comes with all you need to have great brows, I just suggest to get small pair of scissors for your brows and brow fabulosity will happen!</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m good for the whole day, even if I rub my face...which would mess up my brows when I penciled them over.  </li>
            <li>Would not recommend this to anyone serious about having great eyebrows.</li>
            <li>My hairs black, and this color matches perfect for my eye brows in the dark brown.</li>
            <li>The stencils don&#x27;t really work for anything but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through countless different colored brow pencils and gels, and most are too light for me.</li>
            <li>, Thats it actually really lighter than I had wanted in the first place</li>
            <li>Thanks much!</li>
            <li>I have pretty full eyebrows, so I don&#x27;t need to fill in a lot, thus I cannot tell exactly how the product would perform on bare</li>
            <li>I love this shadows, just the color that I&#x27;ve been looking for for so long.</li>
            <li>Nice color eye brow liner but not as dark pigmented as I like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone has a pair, but mine was recently trashed and I was looking forward to this one being decent.</li>
            <li>It does not leave powder everywhere and is easy to apply and stays on the entire day.</li>
            <li>You can use different colors and it easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Does come off easy with water and soap, however my facial cleanser also has make up remover in it.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use, especially for someone like me who knows nothing about makeup.</li>
            <li>but I definitely recommend for beginners because of easy application and price.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need the stencils because they were too large for my face, however I do use all three of the shades.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to find a good match.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it that much yet, but the colors are nice the little tools work really well.</li>
            <li>i really like this product.  </li>
            <li>They are an absolute joke.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>very convenient......</li>
            <li>very helpful</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>It truly does give a natural look and it was worth the money,</li>
            <li>The tweezers didn&#x27;t work very well for me</li>
            <li>I have no problems with smearing or anything really.</li>
            <li>I like my brows very defined and using this powder alone</li>
            <li>sure it gives you everything you need (minus a wax or brow mascara)</li>
            <li>Last all day even when sweating or in water at a water park, for which outside of my daily activities i Have tested that statement lol.</li>
            <li>The size and container it comes in doesn&#x27;t really work to take with you.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product- definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have eyebrows</li>
            <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge unless I&#x27;m really sweating and rubbing.</li>
            <li>My mom loves my brow kit sooooo much</li>
            <li>and it really threw me off</li>
            <li>I also really like the application brush included.  </li>
            <li>very unnatural looking.</li>
            <li>They are an absolute joke.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very 90&#x27;s-ish.</li>
            <li>thank you so much and came here and immaculant condition</li>
            <li>and it was more than what I expected</li>
            <li>Really fills in where my eyebrows are scarce.  </li>
            <li>It really helps when it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve had my brows arched.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>It looks much nicer than pencil alone.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to a beginner because the stencils could really help you shape if you don&#x27;t know what your doing.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No one WANTS eyebrows or has eyebrows in those shapes.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>There are three stencils and they are a reasonable size.  </li>
            <li>Prompt delivery, packed very well.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much, it comes with the essentials</li>
            <li>I am caramel with dark hair and this powder doesn&#x27;t even show up in am pretty sure I received the darkest shade it is a miss for me</li>
            <li>I have never filled in my own eye brows before this</li>
            <li>Since I have thin eyebrows, the stencils actually work for me, which is surprising because there were so many complaints on them.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, looks very natural....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every day, it stays much better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I use these more often that my other eyebrow shadow</li>
            <li>Finish it off with a little eyebrow/eyelash gel and your brows will look great all day long</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable and the product is of high quality.</li>
            <li>But this &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; product is great...takes  a few times to get used to just how much to put on, but the combination of three graduated colors makes it easy to combine just the right shade for yourself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie at make-up, but I think this looked pretty natural.</li>
            <li>you are ordering this kit mainly for the stencils, don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li>I love the different color of the eyebrow shades, the only thing that I have to complain about is the stencils.</li>
            <li>I used light shade first then dark..</li>
            <li>you are ordering this kit mainly for the stencils, don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li>Really Works &amp; Makes Eyebrows Look Natural !</li>
            <li>, I only use the top color on my brows, spoolie brush is quite short and pretty cheaply made, the tweezers are useless (they won&#x27;t grab ONE hair - not in my brows, not even on my head), and the brush is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Unless, you have eyebrows with an extremely high arch they probably won&#x27;t work for you either.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Unless, you have eyebrows with an extremely high arch they probably won&#x27;t work for you either.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li>i love this little kit,just got it today.</li>
            <li>I love this little set.</li>
            <li>I love the little brush and applicator.</li>
            <li>I wish the eyebrow stencils were a little more durable, stiffer but</li>
            <li>The arch stencil will only work if you have an amazonian head, the brow is super long &amp; the arch is super high.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I ordered another stencil set because I would never use any of the stencils that come in this set (they are all highly arched and do not fit my face at all), but I wasn&#x27;t ordering for the stencils so that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li>Wow I really like this.</li>
            <li>the templates are useless but still this powder in 3 shades is great</li>
            <li>I got this because I&#x27;m very self conscious about it and using a pencil</li>
            <li>Some fall out, yeah normal, but this leaves A LOT.</li>
            <li>I love the powder I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need the stencils, I actually used the two other colors as an eyeshadow, the spoolie brush is good for travel, I use my favorite Tweezerman brand tweezers, and the little brush actually works.</li>
            <li>so they glide on...and glide right back off.</li>
            <li>How did I live my life without this product?</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve learned to just use the powder (the darkest one) to go over my natural brow and it comes out looking very natural and realistic.</li>
            <li>I also use the powder to darken my scalp in my hair part and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural on, if applied correctly.</li>
            <li>Very natural colors as well.  </li>
            <li>Very natural look in no time at all.</li>
            <li>so I never truly worried getting them to look exactly the same since one eyebrow is exposed all the time.</li>
            <li>Now they look exactly the same</li>
            <li>stencils only helped with the first time shaping.</li>
            <li>I ordered this powder and received it exactly 1 week later.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I love the Sephora brow kit, but I can never justify spending that much extra when I have to have my other makeup necessities.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The kit would be better if the lid had a small mirror on it for when I carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li>I use the darkest shade of the trio, and it works fine on my black eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Even the darkest color in this palette appears light brown on my skin, so this product gets 2 thumbs down for me.</li>
            <li>Overall great product for such a small price!</li>
            <li>Even after giving my brow brush that I use for application a few good &amp;#34;knocks&amp;#34; to rid the excess product on my brush, there is still dark powder all over my face when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I also love the tweezers (they&#x27;re actually high quality, not the crap kind) and the brushes.</li>
            <li>Not bad other than that</li>
            <li>The stencils are useless, as are the tweezers, but the powder brush is awesome (just the right amount of stiffness) and the other brush works as could be expected.</li>
            <li>But if you like definition and rich pigment to blend into your brows because you have thin brows and want to make them full, this kit isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>It takes a little trial and error to get the color you want but the powder stays put all day and my brows look fabulous.</li>
            <li>Would recommend buying clear gel to go along with it.</li>
            <li>The colors also are pretty - matches very well if you have dark brown hair and eyes.</li>
            <li>Even the smallest one was FAR to big/long for my face.</li>
            <li>it looks so natural</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at this brow enhancer.  </li>
            <li>The compact offers three colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows look completely natural, still, while using this.</li>
            <li>Looks natural on me</li>
            <li>What I do is use a pencil to softly mark the lower line of the brow and then fill-in the remainder of the shape with the powder --</li>
            <li>that way it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>And, I was surprised at how long-lasting it is.</li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>and I was nervous that my eyebrows wouldn&#x27;t look natural -</li>
            <li>and I really wanted something that would last all day.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a natural look...as opposed to that drawn on look an eyebrow pencil gives you.</li>
            <li>THAT MAKES IT BLEND SEAMLESSLY WITH EYEBROW HAIR.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how NATURAL these color are.  </li>
            <li>has been getting on my nerves and it&#x27;s not looking as natural as I would like.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural. .</li>
            <li>The only thing about it that I don&#x27;t really like is the brush it comes with to set it with because it can make it go everywhere.</li>
            <li>I needed something that would define and fill in my brows and last for a whole day.</li>
            <li>The tweezers were a bit too thick and didn&#x27;t grab and hold many hairs at all.</li>
            <li>I have just now gotten to the age where I realize my eyebrows are slowly disappearing :)</li>
            <li>Other than that I think the brow powder, the angled brush, and the brow tamer are pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that effects the easy removal process or not.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a huge make-up head and will barely use this or you will use it  to just help fill in your brows a bit, this may work fine for you.</li>
            <li>I was going from light blonde (my natural color) to dark brown</li>
            <li>only thing i dont like is the stencils are so similar instead of being super different.</li>
            <li>I must say this particular product I ordered came back in no time.</li>
            <li>the brush that came with it came apart the moment i took it out of the package, but a little super glue fixed that.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would give it ten stars if I could!!</li>
            <li>its is a little messy, the powder falls on your face but overall its good</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using this kit when I run out of my normal brow kit as a &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; until I repurchase my regular.</li>
            <li>I was initially unimpressed with the cheap little brush and tweezers that came with the product but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>that your hair color; it looks too hard and will most definitely age you...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I only really use the darkest shade, sometimes the middle one.</li>
            <li>, I still have to use a pencil to add definition and more color because of how &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; the dark color is (I have dark hair, brown/black).</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money...wish they had thicker eyebrow shapes (I like my eyebrows thick not thin).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simple the use, and the results are very natural looking.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the product is very inexpensive compared to so many other products out there that I have tried and been disappointed with.</li>
            <li>complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on me like everyone says, I am a professional acrobat with oily skin, the oil and sweat pretty much just melts it off at work.  </li>
            <li>You can easily blend the dark and the medium colors to achieve a natural looking dark brown color.</li>
            <li>You can easily blend the dark and the medium colors to achieve a natural looking dark brown color.</li>
            <li>I did not like this product it is hard to apply and too light for me.</li>
            <li>I have all kinds of eyebrow products from high end to low end and the problem is ALWAYS THE SAME</li>
            <li>These kit is the only thing i use on my eyebrows, no need for eyebrow pencil or clear mascara.</li>
            <li>However, when I used the powder on my brownish-black brow, the color barely showed up on my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I apparently have to find another one now.</li>
            <li>swatched on my hand, the powders seemed very silky (not chalky whatsoever), but not very opaque.</li>
            <li>I only use one of the colors on the palette and even after two years I&#x27;m no where near finished with the powder.</li>
            <li>but if I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li>This one offers three different colors and the one color</li>
            <li>but i find it doesn&#x27;t look natural enough and doesn&#x27;t stay for 8+ hours at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but instead it gave me thick bushy eyebrows that didn&#x27;t fit my face</li>
            <li>I wish there was a black in the set for dark hair but the darkest brown works just fine.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used the middle brown color,</li>
            <li>The stencils are completely unusable because they are not naturally shaped at all</li>
            <li>I bought a few and none did what this product does, so pigmented that don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li>I never was blessed with full thick eyebrows, so</li>
            <li>Long wearing, natural looking stay,  my eyebrow was singed by a fire but is now in process of growing back.  </li>
            <li>In addition, all the stencils are pretty much for extremely thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The kit was very good for me, mainly because Im inexperienced with doing eyebrows, each stencil does its job nothing bad to say about them, only misleading thing is the color in the display photo, it shows darker colors which i was looking for  because my hair is very dark</li>
            <li>even the dark brown dip brow has that annoying red undertone and it takes FOREVER to apply perfectly...</li>
            <li>So much lighter and better than using eye shadow or a pencil, which would come out to dark sometimes or look fake.</li>
            <li>Not as harsh as long as you use the right color.  </li>
            <li>but the brush is flimsy and hardly holds any powder, the stencils a thin which to many is a problem, for me personally my problem was that all 3 were the exact same shape...</li>
            <li>Only slightly darker than expected, love this product, use it everyday.</li>

            <li> The price is good</li>

            <li> Good for thining brows.</li>
            <li> I remember the good ole days when I didn&#x27;t have to wear anything in my brows...</li>
            <li> The colors are good and the things that come with it are good but the eyebrow shaper things suck, don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t matter to me because I have good tweezers already.  </li>
            <li> This one is really good</li>
            <li> Really good brow powder it beats my nyx brow powders.</li>

            <li> Good product for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend laughed at me when I used the stencils..</li>
            <li> The brushes are a perfect size for eye brows but the case itself feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> i use it all the time for a night out, and it does great, and the stencil is nice.</li>
            <li> Great stuff was perfect color went on easy  recommended  very easy to use</li>
            <li> On the bright side, nice tweezers.. if this brand effed up tweezers  I&#x27;d lose hope for humanity.</li>

            <li> but I have my own tools, I literally bought this&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose abd the colors are nicely blending</li>

            <li> The brush is very easy to use too.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I love love loooove this product!</li>
            <li> It covered better - and looked better - than putting hair dye on my brows ever did!  </li>
            <li> Seemed very cheap to me, kind of regret wasting my money.</li>
            <li> The best brow product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Also love the fact that it gives you step by step directions on how to make and keep your eyebrows looking nice.  </li>
            <li> The tools and the brow powder make for a very beautiful and natural affect.</li>
            <li> The brown is a bit too light brown, but blends in surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> The color was good, and it went on smooth, but immediately flaked all over my cheek.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all you&#x27;d need to create a perfect looking but natural eye brows.</li>
            <li> Would cost more to build, of course - but use your own mirror.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed as far as shipping wise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice to have more than one color</li>
            <li> The powder is very natural looking and still looked good after working out for an hour- LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> daughter had wanted this and loves it, thanks for a nice product and great deal</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for giving me beautiful eyebrows</li>
            <li> Goes great with my skin tone and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> were to very very cheap.</li>
            <li> This powder set is perfect with 3 colors to choose from and it is small which makes it great for travel.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty nice and makes good outlines of the brow.  </li>
            <li> The stencils are a great tool in shaping your brow and the brow powder once applied looks very natural and gives a nice definition and finish to your looks.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need more practice.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product .</li>
            <li> Love love love.  </li>

            <li> Works well, great price and fast delivery...</li>
            <li> I have Anastasia dipbrow products that I love for their longetivity, but</li>
            <li> I never heard of this company, but I&#x27;m so glad I bought from them</li>
            <li> Better than ANY DRUG STORE BRAND INCLUDING NYX, REVLON, MAYBELLINE ETC.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have too many expectations, as I&#x27;ve never used a powder before, so I have nothing to compare it too...</li>
            <li> I love this brow kit,</li>
            <li> love love love</li>
            <li> This brow kit is better than anything I have tried.</li>

            <li> If you are trying to stay healthy and avoid breast cancer, avoiding parabens and halides will help.  </li>
            <li> Many companies are removing parabens from their products.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon......  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I most definetly would.</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> Love the colors although I wish the darkest was a bit darker.</li>
            <li> Many colors for blending.  </li>
            <li> Love the color choices and brush.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a lighter shade but overall they are great!</li>
            <li> Finally I have the perfect eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> So  much better than the pencil I used before,</li>
            <li> I only use the darkest shade because it shows up best on me, being a orange tanned color.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> The brow brush is a lovely addition to this.</li>
            <li> So I bought this a month ago and I am in love with this.</li>
            <li> so much better then a pencil.  </li>
            <li> After getting this yesterday, I tried it and its ok.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I like :)</li>
            <li> Compared to a lot of other brow products, the Cameo Perfect Brow Makeup is by far the best!</li>
            <li> It arrived packaged perfectly, but I was already using other brow products and doubted that it would be a &amp;#34;game changer&amp;#34; in my routine since the price is so amazing....</li>
            <li> but I find them very useful to guide my arch!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this eyebrow kit or</li>
            <li> I love it, so worth it!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s act fit on nicely and doesn&#x27;t get easily removed.</li>
            <li> Though I rarely use the plastic guide, the color is good, it does not smudge and its easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, the 3 different shades are great and it fills in the scraggly areas where I need it!  </li>
            <li> This came in three different shades to blend perfectly and applies easily.</li>
            <li> Shades are very complimentary and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works great and it makes your eyebrows look normal.</li>
            <li> Product itself is pretty good....</li>
            <li> I already gave pretty good eyebrows, and never used a brow powder before.  </li>
            <li> Love the different shades and the quality very good.</li>
            <li> Now for the powders, they aren&#x27;t super pigmented and feel kind silky</li>
            <li> Really it&#x27;s as easy as brushing the color on, which I think might take more precision with an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a really good product for a good price, I have it to my friend with lighter brows</li>
            <li> it makes my eyes brow look great and natural love it</li>
            <li> those days are gone and now this product is my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> I never used these types of kits before for my eyebrows, but the large  stencil came out good.</li>
            <li> good quality stencils just too large for my face.</li>
            <li> GREAT, easy to use and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> Very good quality, easy to apply,  stays on for long time, no mess, good price too !</li>
            <li> I was trying to be cheap, but knew better.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it always fills evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> The three colors are great for blending to make a natural brow.</li>
            <li> (I would have preferred it more if it had been glitter free.)</li>
            <li> Works great, and makes it look natural</li>
            <li> Love the product but, the stencil doesn&#x27;t fit my brow shape</li>
            <li> I loved that it came with stencils even though I probably won&#x27;t use them much.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have a very nice natural look.</li>
            <li> the other brow kit are perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a really cool set!  </li>
            <li> smears kinda easy ,not water proof</li>
            <li> The color stays and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So easy to use…</li>
            <li> And can easily be taken on the go</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the stencil but the powder is easy to apply and build up.</li>
            <li> I used the darkest one and it applied easily.</li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use even without the stencils.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use</li>
            <li> So easy to use with out the pattern too.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and comes in a variety of shades.</li>
            <li> it comes off too easily.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and my brows looked so good that I actually had several people comment that I have nice brows!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for a great price, however, I was not a fan of the flat eyebrow brush and used one of my own, I also neglected to use the eyebrow stencils, but overall the actual product itself is great.</li>
            <li> It comes with three stencils and your brows will look so amazing after the first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect color for my eyebrows, I thought it would be too dark but it suits me fine.</li>
            <li> But when applied to brows, they look fine.</li>
            <li> The kit was fine, I just had to give it away because it was too slim for the shape of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> the one I use works fine</li>
            <li> thats fine with me.</li>
            <li> The brushes are fine, tweasers work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Super product!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> This is a must have, really fills in areas, love it!</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast shipment and great product.</li>
            <li> The powders are great though, and made the money I spent worthwhile.</li>
            <li> This product had the potential to be great,  </li>
            <li> This case doesn&#x27;t fit in my travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li> and I have to free hand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the stencils or the tweezers, but the blendable colors and brushes make this kit more than worth it.  </li>
            <li> The stencils and utensils are great but the powder does not last at all.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast and it was wrapped really nice , packaged well.</li>
            <li> Overall, i&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I will order this again for the powder.</li>
            <li> This apply smoothly with a brush, and will survive sweating.</li>
            <li> and I wanted light brown.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the light color at all.</li>
            <li> but those aren&#x27;t really important.</li>
            <li> My brows are fuller, gaps filled, and you&#x27;d never know it.  </li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve always had extremely light eyebrows like my mom.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was hassle free.</li>
            <li> and so I just free hand the lines.</li>
            <li> Smooth color match all....</li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> Darker for the ends and light for the front.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Although i have no use for the stencils i am happy with the rest of the set!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This brow kit makes them look natural and really good.</li>
            <li> This product works like magic, it&#x27;s very easy to apply and looks natural.</li>
            <li> The powder is good, I&#x27;ve used it once so far and will have to practice a little bit to find the right mix of colors, but I like that it has 3 options so you can get the perfect match, and the brush that comes in this kit works just fine.</li>
            <li> Very nice however if the box had a snap to keep it close it would keep the brushes in place other than that I love it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my order and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is the  best eyebrow makeup, it stays on all day and you need very little to apply to get the desired result.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow set, it goes on pretty well.</li>
            <li> The stencils are kind of a joke, but it&#x27;s not hard to apply this makeup without them.  </li>
            <li> The powder is true to color, has a nice, soft feel, it goes on easily and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Gave it a five star because it arrived early on top of how much I am satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would have liked was more stencils.  </li>
            <li> and more it makes you&#x27;re eyebrows look like pure perfection .</li>
            <li> Brilliant little case to keep everything in as well.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the pigmentation but its very good and stays on all day with a few touch ups every now and then.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural , looks just like the picture and the price is just amazing (:</li>
            <li> .. Will be buying more.. And also fast shipping</li>
            <li> Overall for the price its good to dust over liner.</li>
            <li> It lasts the entire day and looked just as good 8 hours after I applied it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> and I still have a good bit left from the one color I use to fill in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It might work better on real eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product has such good reviews.</li>
            <li> Okay for filling in, but didn&#x27;t care for it much for definition of the brow.</li>
            <li> and I was going to be upset because I paid good money for something that might not actually be what the photo shows.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say more than that</li>
            <li> This product is full of parabens.  </li>
            <li> Thanks:)</li>
            <li> The powder in this product are reliable, but I think it&#x27;s only good for eyebrows that are still full.</li>
            <li> Not bad...</li>
            <li> not bad for the price, stencils were did not work for my eyebrow shape.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I MEAN THE BEST EYE BROW KIT EVER MADE, BAR NONE.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice and dark and with the brush, it is VERY easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It lasts long and makes brows look natural unlike most brow makeup I&#x27;ve used and the shipping was also great</li>
            <li> Thank order came quickly</li>
            <li> Super helpful like it</li>
            <li> I love the brush better than the one I received from urban decay and the stencils that comes with the product</li>
            <li> On days when I want something quick</li>
            <li> I love how the powder goes on so smooth and looks so natural.</li>
            <li> Quick application.  </li>
            <li> Better than most similar products</li>
            <li> So much better than my old eyebrow pencil!!</li>
            <li> I either sported a not quite full enough brow, or I looked like the iconic artist Frida Kahlo!</li>
            <li> This is a really great brow powder for dark hair (even medium tones could use this).</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> it looks so natural and easy too use!</li>
            <li> This kit is very versatile and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it when I first got it done, but as of recently they need to be redone.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I want!</li>
            <li> I have tried many brow makeups and most have either been too dark or too light.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> The instructions could&#x27;ve been better and the brushes are kind of hard to hold on to especially at certain angles.</li>
            <li> This is just a great little eyebrow kit.  </li>
            <li> Hahahaha light</li>
            <li> Great kit, useful for everyday.</li>
            <li> Although I have my own tweezers, to me, the tweezers that come with this kit are short</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a powder to use instead of the pencil I use because I think powder would give a more natural brow appearance.  </li>
            <li> And the powder is easier and looks more natural than using the pencil.</li>
            <li> Realistic looking and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Using just this kit alone gives it a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it can be blended, to give your brows a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are helpful and the tools can be useful.</li>
            <li> the price, I say the product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is worth it, worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be doing my own eyebrow styling from now on.</li>
            <li> but I was looking for something more natural.</li>
            <li> its worth the money tbh</li>
            <li> I still looked freshly made up.</li>
            <li> I had been using a brow pencil for quite a while and was looking for something that made my sparse eyebrows look more natural, and I came upon this.</li>
            <li> like choice of colors to mix for more natural effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Brushes &amp; Product my own fault though since it was totally inexpensive.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t see that as worth losing a star.</li>
            <li> I like the shades of brown because it allows me to make my eyebrows look more natural.</li>
            <li> I love how natural it looks.</li>
            <li> Since, I kind of stink at making the proper outline for my brows, the templates have been a Godsend.  </li>
            <li> It comes with three shades of brown powder, a soft angle brush, a bristle brush, tweezers (which I didn&#x27;t think I would use but are actually pretty good quality and good and plucking small eyebrow hairs) and eyebrow stencils.  </li>
            <li> Hi, I ordered this for a friend and she and some other friends liked this so much that I placed another order for more.</li>
            <li> The color palette is fine, I guess, but the main reason I bought this was for the stencils, which in my book is a fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love things product...wish it had didn&#x27;t stencils but other then that you will love it..</li>
            <li> Other than that its a good product that does what it says</li>
            <li> Everyone is right about the stencils that it comes with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for that just right color of brow makeup for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Everything in it is just right except the stencils</li>
            <li> right before it was delivered  </li>
            <li> and it came right on time</li>
            <li> Just the right size.</li>
            <li> Just had to try it right away.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be going back to a pencil though for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Color is perfect for someone with dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect kit for my brows anyone with brown mid-brown or dark eyebrows I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> So natural and perfect for my jet black hair!!</li>
            <li> I have black hair and this matches perfectly, doesn&#x27;t look too dark and the brush makes it so easy to shape your eyebrows the way you want it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very think and full eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have dark eyebrows and this makes them look clean and really nice.</li>
            <li> Love love that its in a little box</li>
            <li> but it is cheap so just buy new ones for about $10.</li>
            <li> The colors are natural and the instructions on the inside are easy and helpful.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was, and how &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; it made my eyebrows look.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, natural looking and lasts.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and looks fairly natural.</li>
            <li> Easy to use , natural looking brows stay on for hours.</li>
            <li> The powder looks ok, but this is not a package worth buying overall.</li>
            <li> It looks natural, stays on, and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I like this but have not been able to hold the shaper on in the right place and apply color at the same time</li>
            <li> The stencils are sooo good, my eyebrows are on FLEEEEEK , I used the Kiss eyebrow kit previously, but this will be my new go to, trust me it is worth the buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheaply made entirely.</li>
            <li> i like it very much &amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Seems like a good idea with a neat little eyebrow kit all in one place, but i wouldnt reccomend.</li>
            <li> great product other than the tweezers are worthless, Brushes are good and the colors are good.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> First of all, this was packaged well, and arrived in a timely manner..</li>
            <li> I did love the eyebrow brush and the tweezers &amp; I definitely consider those a plus.</li>
            <li> Unless you are willing to take your time and tape the stencils to your brows so you can outline them then</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> Only thing I wish is that there were more of the eyebrow guides provided as none of the ones provided work for my shape</li>
            <li> I was trying to find something similar to dip brow for a better price.</li>
            <li> Well, first off the stencils are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and blends in with my natural eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I used it as soon as I got it &amp; instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> Love the different shades</li>
            <li> I love the stencils, the color, the only thing that it does not stay.</li>
            <li> This was my first venture into powder brow liner.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the powder, it&#x27;s soft and fills in smoothly</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff really sticks!  </li>
            <li> and I love the different shoes they have.</li>
            <li> That exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> The brow powder stays in place with two powders the same color, the one I&#x27;ll use the most, and a lighter powder.  </li>
            <li> When it is hot or I sweat</li>
            <li> I have finally found a brow powder that I&#x27;m satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self, everything is pretty good to me, the stencils look good on me, I don&#x27;t know where other people are getting those negative thoughts from.  </li>
            <li> It comes with all you need to have great brows, I just suggest to get small pair of scissors for your brows and brow fabulosity will happen!</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m good for the whole day, even if I rub my face...which would mess up my brows when I penciled them over.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend this to anyone serious about having great eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My hairs black, and this color matches perfect for my eye brows in the dark brown.</li>
            <li> The stencils don&#x27;t really work for anything but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through countless different colored brow pencils and gels, and most are too light for me.</li>
            <li> , Thats it actually really lighter than I had wanted in the first place</li>
            <li> Thanks much!</li>
            <li> I have pretty full eyebrows, so I don&#x27;t need to fill in a lot, thus I cannot tell exactly how the product would perform on bare</li>
            <li> I love this shadows, just the color that I&#x27;ve been looking for for so long.</li>
            <li> Nice color eye brow liner but not as dark pigmented as I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure everyone has a pair, but mine was recently trashed and I was looking forward to this one being decent.</li>
            <li> It does not leave powder everywhere and is easy to apply and stays on the entire day.</li>
            <li> You can use different colors and it easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Does come off easy with water and soap, however my facial cleanser also has make up remover in it.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, especially for someone like me who knows nothing about makeup.</li>
            <li> but I definitely recommend for beginners because of easy application and price.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need the stencils because they were too large for my face, however I do use all three of the shades.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a good match.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it that much yet, but the colors are nice the little tools work really well.</li>
            <li> i really like this product.  </li>
            <li> They are an absolute joke.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> very convenient......</li>
            <li> very helpful</li>
            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> It truly does give a natural look and it was worth the money,</li>
            <li> The tweezers didn&#x27;t work very well for me</li>
            <li> I have no problems with smearing or anything really.</li>
            <li> I like my brows very defined and using this powder alone</li>
            <li> sure it gives you everything you need (minus a wax or brow mascara)</li>
            <li> Last all day even when sweating or in water at a water park, for which outside of my daily activities i Have tested that statement lol.</li>
            <li> The size and container it comes in doesn&#x27;t really work to take with you.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product- definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have eyebrows</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge unless I&#x27;m really sweating and rubbing.</li>
            <li> My mom loves my brow kit sooooo much</li>
            <li> and it really threw me off</li>
            <li> I also really like the application brush included.  </li>
            <li> very unnatural looking.</li>
            <li> They are an absolute joke.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very 90&#x27;s-ish.</li>
            <li> thank you so much and came here and immaculant condition</li>
            <li> and it was more than what I expected</li>
            <li> Really fills in where my eyebrows are scarce.  </li>
            <li> It really helps when it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve had my brows arched.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> It looks much nicer than pencil alone.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to a beginner because the stencils could really help you shape if you don&#x27;t know what your doing.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No one WANTS eyebrows or has eyebrows in those shapes.</li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> There are three stencils and they are a reasonable size.  </li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, packed very well.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much, it comes with the essentials</li>
            <li> I am caramel with dark hair and this powder doesn&#x27;t even show up in am pretty sure I received the darkest shade it is a miss for me</li>
            <li> I have never filled in my own eye brows before this</li>
            <li> Since I have thin eyebrows, the stencils actually work for me, which is surprising because there were so many complaints on them.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, looks very natural....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day, it stays much better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use these more often that my other eyebrow shadow</li>
            <li> Finish it off with a little eyebrow/eyelash gel and your brows will look great all day long</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable and the product is of high quality.</li>
            <li> But this &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; product is great...takes  a few times to get used to just how much to put on, but the combination of three graduated colors makes it easy to combine just the right shade for yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie at make-up, but I think this looked pretty natural.</li>
            <li> you are ordering this kit mainly for the stencils, don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> I love the different color of the eyebrow shades, the only thing that I have to complain about is the stencils.</li>
            <li> I used light shade first then dark..</li>
            <li> you are ordering this kit mainly for the stencils, don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> Really Works &amp; Makes Eyebrows Look Natural !</li>
            <li> , I only use the top color on my brows, spoolie brush is quite short and pretty cheaply made, the tweezers are useless (they won&#x27;t grab ONE hair - not in my brows, not even on my head), and the brush is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Unless, you have eyebrows with an extremely high arch they probably won&#x27;t work for you either.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unless, you have eyebrows with an extremely high arch they probably won&#x27;t work for you either.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li> i love this little kit,just got it today.</li>
            <li> I love this little set.</li>
            <li> I love the little brush and applicator.</li>
            <li> I wish the eyebrow stencils were a little more durable, stiffer but</li>
            <li> The arch stencil will only work if you have an amazonian head, the brow is super long &amp; the arch is super high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I ordered another stencil set because I would never use any of the stencils that come in this set (they are all highly arched and do not fit my face at all), but I wasn&#x27;t ordering for the stencils so that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li> Wow I really like this.</li>
            <li> the templates are useless but still this powder in 3 shades is great</li>
            <li> I got this because I&#x27;m very self conscious about it and using a pencil</li>
            <li> Some fall out, yeah normal, but this leaves A LOT.</li>
            <li> I love the powder I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need the stencils, I actually used the two other colors as an eyeshadow, the spoolie brush is good for travel, I use my favorite Tweezerman brand tweezers, and the little brush actually works.</li>
            <li> so they glide on...and glide right back off.</li>
            <li> How did I live my life without this product?</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve learned to just use the powder (the darkest one) to go over my natural brow and it comes out looking very natural and realistic.</li>
            <li> I also use the powder to darken my scalp in my hair part and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural on, if applied correctly.</li>
            <li> Very natural colors as well.  </li>
            <li> Very natural look in no time at all.</li>
            <li> so I never truly worried getting them to look exactly the same since one eyebrow is exposed all the time.</li>
            <li> Now they look exactly the same</li>
            <li> stencils only helped with the first time shaping.</li>
            <li> I ordered this powder and received it exactly 1 week later.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I love the Sephora brow kit, but I can never justify spending that much extra when I have to have my other makeup necessities.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The kit would be better if the lid had a small mirror on it for when I carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li> I use the darkest shade of the trio, and it works fine on my black eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Even the darkest color in this palette appears light brown on my skin, so this product gets 2 thumbs down for me.</li>
            <li> Overall great product for such a small price!</li>
            <li> Even after giving my brow brush that I use for application a few good &amp;#34;knocks&amp;#34; to rid the excess product on my brush, there is still dark powder all over my face when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I also love the tweezers (they&#x27;re actually high quality, not the crap kind) and the brushes.</li>
            <li> Not bad other than that</li>
            <li> The stencils are useless, as are the tweezers, but the powder brush is awesome (just the right amount of stiffness) and the other brush works as could be expected.</li>
            <li> But if you like definition and rich pigment to blend into your brows because you have thin brows and want to make them full, this kit isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It takes a little trial and error to get the color you want but the powder stays put all day and my brows look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Would recommend buying clear gel to go along with it.</li>
            <li> The colors also are pretty - matches very well if you have dark brown hair and eyes.</li>
            <li> Even the smallest one was FAR to big/long for my face.</li>
            <li> it looks so natural</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at this brow enhancer.  </li>
            <li> The compact offers three colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows look completely natural, still, while using this.</li>
            <li> Looks natural on me</li>
            <li> What I do is use a pencil to softly mark the lower line of the brow and then fill-in the remainder of the shape with the powder --</li>
            <li> that way it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> And, I was surprised at how long-lasting it is.</li>
            <li> Looks natural.</li>
            <li> and I was nervous that my eyebrows wouldn&#x27;t look natural -</li>
            <li> and I really wanted something that would last all day.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a natural look...as opposed to that drawn on look an eyebrow pencil gives you.</li>
            <li> THAT MAKES IT BLEND SEAMLESSLY WITH EYEBROW HAIR.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how NATURAL these color are.  </li>
            <li> has been getting on my nerves and it&#x27;s not looking as natural as I would like.  </li>
            <li> It looks natural. .</li>
            <li> The only thing about it that I don&#x27;t really like is the brush it comes with to set it with because it can make it go everywhere.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would define and fill in my brows and last for a whole day.</li>
            <li> The tweezers were a bit too thick and didn&#x27;t grab and hold many hairs at all.</li>
            <li> I have just now gotten to the age where I realize my eyebrows are slowly disappearing :)</li>
            <li> Other than that I think the brow powder, the angled brush, and the brow tamer are pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that effects the easy removal process or not.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a huge make-up head and will barely use this or you will use it  to just help fill in your brows a bit, this may work fine for you.</li>
            <li> I was going from light blonde (my natural color) to dark brown</li>
            <li> only thing i dont like is the stencils are so similar instead of being super different.</li>
            <li> I must say this particular product I ordered came back in no time.</li>
            <li> the brush that came with it came apart the moment i took it out of the package, but a little super glue fixed that.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and would give it ten stars if I could!!</li>
            <li> its is a little messy, the powder falls on your face but overall its good</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this kit when I run out of my normal brow kit as a &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; until I repurchase my regular.</li>
            <li> I was initially unimpressed with the cheap little brush and tweezers that came with the product but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> that your hair color; it looks too hard and will most definitely age you...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I only really use the darkest shade, sometimes the middle one.</li>
            <li> , I still have to use a pencil to add definition and more color because of how &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; the dark color is (I have dark hair, brown/black).</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money...wish they had thicker eyebrow shapes (I like my eyebrows thick not thin).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple the use, and the results are very natural looking.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the product is very inexpensive compared to so many other products out there that I have tried and been disappointed with.</li>
            <li> complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on me like everyone says, I am a professional acrobat with oily skin, the oil and sweat pretty much just melts it off at work.  </li>
            <li> You can easily blend the dark and the medium colors to achieve a natural looking dark brown color.</li>
            <li> You can easily blend the dark and the medium colors to achieve a natural looking dark brown color.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product it is hard to apply and too light for me.</li>
            <li> I have all kinds of eyebrow products from high end to low end and the problem is ALWAYS THE SAME</li>
            <li> These kit is the only thing i use on my eyebrows, no need for eyebrow pencil or clear mascara.</li>
            <li> However, when I used the powder on my brownish-black brow, the color barely showed up on my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I apparently have to find another one now.</li>
            <li> swatched on my hand, the powders seemed very silky (not chalky whatsoever), but not very opaque.</li>
            <li> I only use one of the colors on the palette and even after two years I&#x27;m no where near finished with the powder.</li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li> This one offers three different colors and the one color</li>
            <li> but i find it doesn&#x27;t look natural enough and doesn&#x27;t stay for 8+ hours at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but instead it gave me thick bushy eyebrows that didn&#x27;t fit my face</li>
            <li> I wish there was a black in the set for dark hair but the darkest brown works just fine.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the middle brown color,</li>
            <li> The stencils are completely unusable because they are not naturally shaped at all</li>
            <li> I bought a few and none did what this product does, so pigmented that don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> I never was blessed with full thick eyebrows, so</li>
            <li> Long wearing, natural looking stay,  my eyebrow was singed by a fire but is now in process of growing back.  </li>
            <li> In addition, all the stencils are pretty much for extremely thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The kit was very good for me, mainly because Im inexperienced with doing eyebrows, each stencil does its job nothing bad to say about them, only misleading thing is the color in the display photo, it shows darker colors which i was looking for  because my hair is very dark</li>
            <li> even the dark brown dip brow has that annoying red undertone and it takes FOREVER to apply perfectly...</li>
            <li> So much lighter and better than using eye shadow or a pencil, which would come out to dark sometimes or look fake.</li>
            <li> Not as harsh as long as you use the right color.  </li>
            <li> but the brush is flimsy and hardly holds any powder, the stencils a thin which to many is a problem, for me personally my problem was that all 3 were the exact same shape...</li>
            <li> Only slightly darker than expected, love this product, use it everyday.</li>
            <li> But if you are a light skin girl with non black hair color, then I would not recommend this item as it might be too dark and might give you a drag queen</li>
            <li> The brush was stiff &amp; the powder didn&#x27;t stick to it very well</li>
            <li> The angled brush is not very stiff, so it is a little difficult to draw precisely, but it works decently for laying the product.</li>
            <li> Since I have a problem of the powder not staying on, I use my urban decay palette and use all of the other products that this one offers.</li>
            <li> This helps to draw my other eyebrow in until it has completely grown back.</li>
            <li> Coming from someone with VERY thin eyebrows, I love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a decent product for beginners that want to try and spend little money.</li>
            <li> Usually eyebrow kits are a little to light for me but not this one.</li>
            <li> At first I used too much and it appeared a little too dark or heavy, but that was just a brief &#x27;learning curve&#x27; for me!</li>
            <li> I guess small, medium and large.</li>
            <li> My 3 STAR rating is based on the rest of the kit - the templates are pretty flimsy, the tweezers are useless and the brow brush is too soft (it barely holds the powder).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and won&#x27;t rub off it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eyebrow kit for a long time that had stencils that weren&#x27;t so big and fat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never put makeup on my brows since mine are pretty thick</li>
            <li> I live this little palette</li>
            <li> Also, shade color is described as dark, it is a little light for me personally, but I do have very dark hair..</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is nearly black, and I now use henna and indigo to keep it that way.</li>
            <li> My brows are naturally near black in color as well.</li>
            <li> I applied them with a thin angled brush (not the one included) and blended with spoolie and my brows looked 100% natural and very put</li>
            <li> the stencils are super thin in width, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d use them on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I never found a pencil that was satisfactory after the first few uses, no matter what brand or cost they just do not sharpen properly and go to waste.  </li>
            <li> Brushes fine, tweezers lame.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and usually use a light black pencil on my brows</li>
            <li> I tried to manipulate the placement of the stencil just to outline my natural brow, but it came out looking a little clownish.</li>
            <li> Brow powders shouldn&#x27;t actually have too much color payoff or they can be a little too harsh in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You Pluck a chicken and Tweeze a brow\\&quot; : )</li>
            <li> The tweezers are made out of some foil-like material....totally cheap and useless.  </li>
            <li> One, the eyebrow stencils are just not natural to me.  </li>
            <li> so if you have larger hands, it&#x27;s harder to hold &amp; control these tweezers.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit lighter than I expected but there are three different shades in the pack</li>
            <li> and they are way too long.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a complete brow kit..</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try a powder instead of the usual eyebrow pencil i normally use.</li>
            <li> I have long fingers</li>
            <li> It lasts all day as long as I use a wax pencil over it.</li>
            <li> so long eyebrow penciles!</li>
            <li> Brow makeup works well, but I agree with other postings stating this would be nicer if it came in a smaller version that you could put in a purse and take with you.  </li>
            <li> should however, add that I also agree with another review about the stencils, they are not useful,unless of course you want extremely thin brows; my brows are unfortunately thin from years of over tweezing, these stencils are even thinner than my own...</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a brunette (dark brown, to black hair) and the blacks are to blue based or grey, and the dk browns always have way TOO MUCH of a red undertone that looks unnatural and stands out against my hair.  </li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that I have a smaller than average physique (size 4, 125 lbs).</li>
            <li> Therefore, I think my head/face/facial features are smaller than average.</li>
            <li> (I have blonde eyebrows but dark brown hair</li>
            <li> It stays on all day, and you have 3 different shades of dark brown/black.</li>
            <li> it came on time, I was kind of disappointed because it seemed darker than it is in the pictures.</li>
            <li> reviews are true: the stencils are useless.</li>
            <li> Also, the templates are not very real in shape and width.</li>
            <li> It has lasted so long!!</li>
            <li> I dye it blue black and was concerned it wasn&#x27;t dark enough for me</li>
            <li> If you have black hair you can only use the darkest one but</li>
            <li> The eye brow stencils are ridiculous unless you want that high of an arch on your brow.</li>
            <li> I have very dark eyebrows, the actual hair is close to black, so I thought I would need the middle color.</li>
            <li> and this has a little different concept and gives me three color choices.  </li>
            <li> It adds a little extra \\&quot;umph\\&quot; to my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My order arrived with a protective bag tied with a little red ribbon and a thank-you from the seller.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this little thing came 2 days after I ordered them, 4 days prior to the prediction!</li>
            <li> Idk about the other ladies who gave it low ratings, but as a black woman with a medium brown skin tone, it worked for me.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the product, luckily enough the brown worked for my eyebrows, but that was luck, all in all I really like this product and Ill</li>
            <li> The powders are not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> It was a bit darker than I expected</li>
            <li> but the tweezers are flimsy and not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I used it only few times.</li>
            <li> And while I only had it on for a few seconds, I know it lasts well because it took awhile to take off with make-up remover!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the last few days, and I like it.</li>
            <li> Oh&#x27; well no use of crying over spilled milk... just would have to search for a different eyebrow kit &amp; hopefully it will give me the look i&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> I have some empty spots that need filling and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Out of the 4 provided, none of them remotely resembled the shape of my eyebrow &amp; because I have a narrow face, the length of these stencils would have my eyebrow extending all the way to my temple further making it unnatural.</li>
            <li> It comes with 3 shades that will definitely match your color if you have brown or even black hair!</li>
            <li> the dark was a little too dark so next time I will use medium.  </li>
            <li> you have a small face and petite facial features, this might not be the kit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even at the $7 price I paid, I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again simply because of the size of the case.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small enough to carry in your purse or jacket.  </li>
            <li> , this review applies to the other product</li>
            <li> all the other reviewers have stated, the stencials are plastic paper and are pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> so I use one to do my eyebrows and the other as eye shadow</li>
            <li> Keeps my brows looking sharp,  and I haven&#x27;t noticed any fall when applying the powder.</li>
            <li> The other shades don&#x27;t suit me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to eyebrow coloring, and I feel weird if they look too dark or noticeably different, so maybe I&#x27;m just being sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I like the case too because it slightly snaps closed.  </li>
            <li> It is stiff  but soft,  not all hard like some brow powder applicators.  </li>
            <li> My natural eyebrows are very thin &amp; short.</li>
            <li> Powder is very loose and soft, the pigment doesn&#x27;t stay, tweezers are dull, the brush itself is thick can&#x27;t shape your eyebrow with it.</li>
            <li> There are three powders (a medium, dark, very dark shades), a spooley brush, a small eyebrow brush, tweezers, and various plastic brow stencils.</li>
            <li> It is advertised as dark, and the model on the case is shown with a brownish-black eye brow.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, but it looks too severe if I use either of the darker colors here.</li>
            <li> The colors are too dark but blendable for a desired result.</li>
            <li> FYI, I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> Not useful.</li>
            <li> The darkest color in this kit isn&#x27;t as dark as it could be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using a pencil to fill in my brows and decided to try this in the dark.</li>
            <li> They are travel size and not really useful.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the tweezers.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not worth the money and not the quality I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The dark is really dark.  </li>
            <li> and I needed those dark colors for my eyebrows, but</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It took me a LONG time to try this after I purchased it, I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> The only thing negative about this product is that after a while (like 7 months) it starts to clump on the brush and doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I have dark brows</li>
            <li> I have really dark hair</li>
            <li> skin.&lt;br /&gt;I picked the color dark brown.</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark brown.  </li>
            <li> Fixed my broken ass eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding brow shadow because everything for brunettes is too red and the products intended for black hair are too dark.</li>
            <li> I have been using black all these years</li>
            <li> I have medium skin and black eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers before me, I found the stencils laughable (they nearly reached my temple!)</li>
            <li> Works for me because my brows are black.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair and the color</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s half done</li>
            <li> The stencils were oddly shaped so I have not used them.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t mess your eyebrows up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem so dark or harsh on my face</li>
            <li> The little eye shadow-looking brush broke in less than three days.</li>
            <li> And there is little to no wait getting this product.</li>
            <li> Its a little darker than I thought so</li>
            <li> so it works, just a little pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little brush, tweezers, applicator and stencils.</li>
            <li> the brushes and tweezers are very small and pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply, the cut out brows are hard to hold and apply at the same time.  </li>
            <li> they are very dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on different stuff from $5 to $30 and this isn&#x27;t expensive and it works..</li>
            <li> but I did not like it for a few reasons.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers are cheap and worthless.</li>
            <li> so I use it everyday to get my eyebrows to match.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I was never the one to fill in my eyebrows but with this product I do it everyday.</li>
            <li> But I just check up on it every few hours or so, no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It comes with a brush, brow stencil and a few eyebrow tools.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I prefer a stiff, thin brush when using brow powders, but that&#x27;s personal preference.</li>
            <li> Give the fake eyebrow look and doesn&#x27;t last half a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a black woman, it is hard to find an inexpensive brow kit that will match both my eyebrow &amp; skin tone.  </li>
            <li> after applying run the small brush through it, it&#x27;s perfect!I</li>
            <li> For years I have been using an eyebrow pencil on-and-off for my eyebrows and was never really satisfied with how unnatural it looked.</li>
            <li> I have a small face so the eye brow stencils don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble, and just buy the Anastasia products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and convenient to carry to places.</li>
            <li> there are 3 colors inside with a small applicator and tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too small for my liking...</li>
            <li> I do use the spooly and small brush that came with it.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too small</li>
            <li> Really not sure of those brows stencils tho.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have noted that the stencils are not great</li>
            <li> The tracking said it was bundled with another order but box only had the other order this item was missing :(</li>
            <li> I hardly have any eyebrows</li>
            <li> All of the stencils are for thin brows, and my kit was actually missing the angled brush.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a bit slow it took 12 days to come.</li>
            <li> Plastic strips too thin and not easy to use.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews mentioned the eyebrow stencils were useless</li>
            <li> If you want that glamour shaped eyebrows shop no more, this is it!</li>
            <li> Cannot apply like a professional :(</li>
            <li> In addition to that, the packaging is ridiculously over sized.</li>
            <li> Seriously - find some way to condense everything.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and brows, and my brows are very thin.</li>
            <li> Not too bad actually.</li>
            <li> But I never loved the darken eyebrows and the way it looks.</li>
            <li> I have always used brow pencils, but never liked the way they would darken the skin behind the brow making my brows look anything but natural.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I decided to try this kit.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for pimple prone oily skin tough.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time trying to fill my brows with brow pencils, tried a lot of brands but everything looked unnatural and weird on me.</li>
            <li> The others were too thin.</li>
            <li> Please note I have never used the stencils as they appear to THIN in my opinion</li>
            <li> Maybe people with thicker brows have hair to hold it in place, I have thin brows</li>
            <li> One evening I was too tired to remove makeup from my face -- when I awoke in the morning</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Frustrating every time I need to apply this product...</li>
            <li> but I think the templates are unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I bought this and when it came it was broken and the eyeshadow was everwhere.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product, you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> With age our brows thin out.</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair and have found trying to match my hair color very difficult.</li>
            <li> but it was way too dark (and I&#x27;m dark complected) and looked horrible.  </li>
            <li> Stencils were useless.</li>
            <li> The powder make your eyebrows look unrealistic.</li>
            <li> I am not extremely impressed but it works.</li>
            <li> stars because the tweezer is basically useless.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to use.</li>
            <li> However the stencils are completely useless.</li>
            <li> &amp; sadly I did not.</li>
            <li> Buy buy buy, you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit to see if I could fill in the really thin spots and even blend it all over the brow to get a fuller look, and it worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> Instead, it&#x27;s rather flat and makes it terrible at getting stray hairs.</li>
            <li> This product is very poor quality.</li>
            <li> and they are all very thin brows so not of any use for me.</li>
            <li> I have very thin wispy brows and the coverage with this product</li>
            <li> I have very thin almost non-existent eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to be disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> I went by the reviews and wasn&#x27;t the least bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t no for some reason it made a few hairs fall off bad product !</li>
            <li> Stencils are useless unless you have those crazy sharpie eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The brush is horrible and the powder is just like any other brand.</li>
            <li> so it seems to stay on longer …but not look so artificial like a pencil.</li>
            <li> You can easily go crazy with this stuff.</li>
            <li> The packaging is awkward.</li>
            <li> Product works well without the eyebrow stencils which were awkward to use,&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smudge and its merely impossible to get the look they are advertising using this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still bad.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are bad though, but they aren&#x27;t the reason why I bought this.</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t any wax included in the product.</li>
            <li> What did get me upset is that the brush didn&#x27;t come in my kit :(</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be disappointed</li>
            <li> Was not in package :(</li>
            <li> but I hate when they look blocky.</li>
            <li> I tried to use the brow templates, but I must be too retarded -</li>
            <li> The tweezers are awful.</li>
            <li> IM ADDICTED ALREADY!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that I have a smaller than average physique (size 4, 125 lbs). Therefore, I think my head/face/facial features are smaller than average. This kit comes with three stencils - I guess small, medium and large. Even the smallest one was FAR to big/long for my face. I tried to manipulate the placement of the stencil just to outline my natural brow, but it came out looking a little clownish. Maybe I just need more practice. The color palette is fine, I guess, but the main reason I bought this was for the stencils, which in my book is a fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a small face and petite facial features, this might not be the kit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/28/16: I&#x27;ve learned to just use the powder (the darkest one) to go over my natural brow and it comes out looking very natural and realistic. I don&#x27;t use the stencils at all.</li>
            <li> Shades are very complimentary and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> it came on time, I was kind of disappointed because it seemed darker than it is in the pictures. Overall, it is a really good product for a good price, I have it to my friend with lighter brows</li>
            <li> Thank order came quickly&lt;br /&gt;and this is what I need</li>
            <li> i really like this product.  I used to used eye shawdow for my brows.  I like the angle of the brush but it seems to be losing the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this!! Helped shape my brows perfectly.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product . it fit perfectly,  it&#x27;s act fit on nicely and doesn&#x27;t get easily removed.</li>
            <li> I never used these types of kits before for my eyebrows, but the large  stencil came out good. The others were too thin.</li>
            <li> Super product! Don&#x27;t even need the forms.</li>
            <li> I really love things product...wish it had didn&#x27;t stencils but other then that you will love it..good price also !</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for the price. I have dark eyebrows and this makes them look clean and really nice. The stencils don&#x27;t really work for anything but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> This is a great eyebrow kit.  It comes with three shades of brown powder, a soft angle brush, a bristle brush, tweezers (which I didn&#x27;t think I would use but are actually pretty good quality and good and plucking small eyebrow hairs) and eyebrow stencils.  I would recommend this kit to anyone.  The price I great too!</li>
            <li> Love love love.  Use every day for both brows and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This product had the potential to be great,  but I did not like it for a few reasons.  One, the eyebrow stencils are just not natural to me.  Out of the 4 provided, none of them remotely resembled the shape of my eyebrow &amp; because I have a narrow face, the length of these stencils would have my eyebrow extending all the way to my temple further making it unnatural. Although I have my own tweezers, to me, the tweezers that come with this kit are short so if you have larger hands, it&#x27;s harder to hold &amp; control these tweezers. This wasn&#x27;t a breaking point, but it was something I noticed.  My BIGGEST problem is with the color palette for the brow powder.  It is advertised as dark, and the model on the case is shown with a brownish-black eye brow.  However, when I used the powder on my brownish-black brow, the color barely showed up on my skin.  Maybe this product was not designed for non-white users? Or maybe it&#x27;s not designed for darker skin? Being a black woman, it is hard to find an inexpensive brow kit that will match both my eyebrow &amp; skin tone.  I was trying to find a powder to use instead of the pencil I use because I think powder would give a more natural brow appearance.  Even the darkest color in this palette appears light brown on my skin, so this product gets 2 thumbs down for me.</li>
            <li> Loved it all that I had wanted.  Correct description.</li>
            <li> Nice set, almost a cream-like powder so it seems to stay on longer …but not look so artificial like a pencil.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, looks very natural....after applying run the small brush through it, it&#x27;s perfect!I should however, add that I also agree with another review about the stencils, they are not useful,unless of course you want extremely thin brows; my brows are unfortunately thin from years of over tweezing, these stencils are even thinner than my own...HOWEVER, don&#x27;t let that be a deciding factor on rather to purchase this kit because, the powders are very nice..I taught at a cosmetology school for many years, the one piece of advice I can give you is NOT to go darker that your hair color; it looks too hard and will most definitely age you...Cosmetology school also teaches, \\&quot; You Pluck a chicken and Tweeze a brow\\&quot; : )</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I had never used a brow powder before. I have always used brow pencils. But I never loved the darken eyebrows and the way it looks. I wanted to have a very nice natural look. And a friend of mine told me about this product. I try it at home with her and it looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt; The powder and brushes come with it and stencils too. The power shades are wonderful. You can easily blend the dark and the medium colors to achieve a natural looking dark brown color. I will definitely re-order this kit again, just for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;If you are ordering this kit mainly for the stencils, don&#x27;t waist your money. They are an absolute joke. Unless, you have eyebrows with an extremely high arch they probably won&#x27;t work for you either.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was</li>
            <li> works well , but needs the wax with it also . smears kinda easy ,not water proof</li>
            <li> it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> Great price with nice choice of colors. Brushes fine, tweezers lame. Pattern things--way over-sized.</li>
            <li> Seemed very cheap to me, kind of regret wasting my money.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product works great I hardly have any eyebrows n this eyebrow kit helped me fill in the gaps!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have eyebrows but just fall short at the ends. And the powder is easier and looks more natural than using the pencil. I will definitely by this product again. And there is little to no wait getting this product. It said it would be more than a week before receiving it, but I got it in 5days.</li>
            <li> Help me learn how make my eye brows perfect and realist</li>
            <li> Great product I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> For years I have been using an eyebrow pencil on-and-off for my eyebrows and was never really satisfied with how unnatural it looked. I used the cameo set yesterday and LOVED it. Some of the other reviews mentioned the eyebrow stencils were useless but I find them very useful to guide my arch! The powder is very natural looking and still looked good after working out for an hour- LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I have black hair and brows, and my brows are very thin. I had a hard time trying to fill my brows with brow pencils, tried a lot of brands but everything looked unnatural and weird on me. This product works like magic, it&#x27;s very easy to apply and looks natural. And the color is just perfect for me. The best brow product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Realistic looking and easy to use. (I have blonde eyebrows but dark brown hair and it looks like my eyebrows actually match my hair now) thanks</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, but it looks too severe if I use either of the darker colors here. I love filling in my brows with the lightest shade though! Looks great, apply once in the morning and you&#x27;re good for the day. I also love the tweezers (they&#x27;re actually high quality, not the crap kind) and the brushes. Stencils were useless.</li>
            <li> Product itself is pretty good....I give it a 4-5 STAR. The powder is true to color, has a nice, soft feel, it goes on easily and it lasts all day. My 3 STAR rating is based on the rest of the kit - the templates are pretty flimsy, the tweezers are useless and the brow brush is too soft (it barely holds the powder). In addition to that, the packaging is ridiculously over sized. Seriously - find some way to condense everything. This case doesn&#x27;t fit in my travel makeup bag. Even at the $7 price I paid, I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again simply because of the size of the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into experimenting with my brows and this is awesome for a beginner, just what I needed, thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  It was easy to use and my brows looked so good that I actually had several people comment that I have nice brows!!!</li>
            <li> Love the color...definitely worth the money...wish they had thicker eyebrow shapes (I like my eyebrows thick not thin).</li>
            <li> I cant leave the house without doing my eyebrows. These kit is the only thing i use on my eyebrows, no need for eyebrow pencil or clear mascara. Using just this kit alone gives it a more natural look. I love it.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. It matches my eyebrow color perfectly. Usually eyebrow kits are a little to light for me but not this one. I gave it 4 stars only because the stencils don&#x27;t match my eyebrow type.</li>
            <li> Oh my this product is awesome. it makes my eyes brow look great and natural love it</li>
            <li> Enjoying my brow makeup! Quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> First of all, this was packaged well, and arrived in a timely manner.. The product is quite nice, and goes on well.  And it lasts!!  The price was an added bonus!  I like the fact it can be blended, to give your brows a more natural look.  I ordered one for my sister too, and she loves it!  I&#x27;m a happy customer, and will purchase this again....</li>
            <li> Not a very big fan of this. The brush was stiff &amp; the powder didn&#x27;t stick to it very well so you could apply it to your eyebrow area. I did love the eyebrow brush and the tweezers &amp; I definitely consider those a plus. The stencils were okay but it was like I could never get them the same way on each eye. Maybe it&#x27;s just the way I was doing it.</li>
            <li> I love the Perfect Brow.  It has everything you need to create the perfect brow and it&#x27;s small enough to carry in your purse or jacket.  Also love the fact that it gives you step by step directions on how to make and keep your eyebrows looking nice.  Gave it a five star because it arrived early on top of how much I am satisfied with this product.  Will definitely continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> I have a small face so the eye brow stencils don&#x27;t work for me. I just apply over my thinning eye brows and it looks good.  Wish they came in smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit lighter than I expected but there are three different shades in the pack so I stick to the darkest one which works perfectly for me. The color stays and it&#x27;s easy to apply. Please note I have never used the stencils as they appear to THIN in my opinion, this review applies to the other product</li>
            <li> The powder in this product are reliable, but I think it&#x27;s only good for eyebrows that are still full. It may be harder to have a natural look with eyebrows that are scarce. The tweezers are awful. Other than that I think the brow powder, the angled brush, and the brow tamer are pretty decent. I use this almost every day. I just had to buy separate tweezers.</li>
            <li> They have lots of templates for the brow but I just like it for the shadows. It fills in perfectly.</li>
            <li> The packaging is ohkay and I was disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t any wax included in the product. The colors are too dark but blendable for a desired result.The stencils are completely unusable because they are not naturally shaped at all and they are way too long.The instructions are helpful and the tools can be useful.</li>
            <li> Love this, colors are perfect</li>
            <li> I like thus product and would order again</li>
            <li> the light brown gives me perfect color matching for my complexion. the brush that came with it came apart the moment i took it out of the package, but a little super glue fixed that. The arch stencil will only work if you have an amazonian head, the brow is super long &amp; the arch is super high.</li>
            <li> I used to use Clinique and this one is softer than Clinique.  In addition, I can mix 3 shades.  The price is good so I ordered another one for my sister.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars on behalf of the brow powder. It does not leave powder everywhere and is easy to apply and stays on the entire day. I like this better than the brow pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all the other reviewers have stated, the stencials are plastic paper and are pretty much useless. Unless you are willing to take your time and tape the stencils to your brows so you can outline them then the stencils will be of no use to you. In addition, all the stencils are pretty much for extremely thin eyebrows. The tweezers work okay but are not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I say the product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See attatched picture below. (Note that the shape of my eye brows were from the stencils. I used the thickest stencil so take a good look).</li>
            <li> The little eye shadow-looking brush broke in less than three days. Not bad other than that but I apparently have to find another one now. Also, shade color is described as dark, it is a little light for me personally, but I do have very dark hair..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it,, u get out u pay for,,,, never again&lt;br /&gt;-MERICA.J</li>
            <li> Colors do not match the picture , they were lighter. Seems like a good idea with a neat little eyebrow kit all in one place, but i wouldnt reccomend.</li>
            <li> Good for thining brows. Use it every day.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING YOU NEED!, PLENTY OF POWDER, SPOOLIE, TWEEZERS, BRUSH AS WELL AS TEMPLATES. AGREAT VALUE.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a stocking stuffer for my daughter. She used mine and liked it. I thought I would have to use the darkest color but turns out the lightest worked best. FYI, I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> This product is very poor quality. The powders are not very pigmented. All of the stencils are for thin brows, and my kit was actually missing the angled brush. I ended up going out and spending about $40 on the Anastasia stencils and powder. Save yourself the trouble, and just buy the Anastasia products! I was trying to be cheap, but knew better.</li>
            <li> The product is okay, it is not my go-to kit but it still gets some use. I would recommend it based on the price.</li>
            <li> This has lasted me for quite some time now and I love the look my eyebrows get from the products. (:</li>
            <li> I like this product. Though I rarely use the plastic guide, the color is good, it does not smudge and its easy to apply.</li>
            <li> i love this little kit,just got it today. i have the thinnest eyebrows in the world, but you&#x27;d never know!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to filling in my eyebrows with brow liner pencils but I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I love how you get 3 colors to choose from (i use the darkest) and it comes with a brow brush and tweezers. I was worried about the pigmentation but its very good and stays on all day with a few touch ups every now and then. I wish they sold these in stores. it looks so natural and you cant even feel it on. I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t (and still don&#x27;t) know how to use the stencils for the life of me. I use everything else though. Overall it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. I totally recommend this product. it is worth it, worth it. very convenient...... hbh;i;iv hbgkv hbk bkjb jbk</li>
            <li> I love this kit, though the plastic stencils are of no use to me. I&#x27;ve been using it every day, it stays much better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> LOVE !!! So easy to use….Matches my brow perfectly.</li>
            <li> Blends well with my brows! Only thing I wish is that there were more of the eyebrow guides provided as none of the ones provided work for my shape and I have to free hand.</li>
            <li> I luv it! Especially the stencils..very helpful</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at this brow enhancer.  I have been using black all these years and this has a little different concept and gives me three color choices.  All three look amazing as well.  I remember the good ole days when I didn&#x27;t have to wear anything in my brows...those days are gone and now this product is my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow palette I have tried yet, I tried the too faced one and you get so much more product with this opne and its 50 dollars cheaper</li>
            <li> I was trying to find something similar to dip brow for a better price. I love this little set. It has everything I need and it stays on great.</li>
            <li> I use this for my eyebrows and sometimes as eye shadow- its lasted me forever!</li>
            <li> Super helpful like it</li>
            <li> The powder make your eyebrows look unrealistic. I did not like it.</li>
            <li> This is great.. goes on light so you don&#x27;t mess your eyebrows up. I am not extremely impressed but it works.</li>
            <li> Well, first off the stencils are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the powders and spoolie are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for the angled brush or tweezers. I prefer a stiff, thin brush when using brow powders, but that&#x27;s personal preference. This one seemed a bit flimsy. The tweezers were a bit too thick and didn&#x27;t grab and hold many hairs at all. However, that&#x27;s not what I bought this for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When swatched on my hand, the powders seemed very silky (not chalky whatsoever), but not very opaque. But when applied to brows, they look fine. Brow powders shouldn&#x27;t actually have too much color payoff or they can be a little too harsh in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only really use the darkest shade, sometimes the middle one. I never use the lightest one, though some people may find some use for it. I applied them with a thin angled brush (not the one included) and blended with spoolie and my brows looked 100% natural and very put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li> Wow I really like this. Never knew how people got the perfect eyebrow look but now I know!!! Definitely will be doing my own eyebrow styling from now on. Cute!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I don&#x27;t use the stencils but this kit works better than eyebrow pencils</li>
            <li> Product was not convenient. Rip off! The stencils do not work</li>
            <li> I thought this would give me perfect eyebrows but instead it gave me thick bushy eyebrows that didn&#x27;t fit my face so I don&#x27;t think this item is for me</li>
            <li> The compact offers three colors to choose from.  I mix the colors for the best blend for my brows.  It takes a little trial and error to get the color you want but the powder stays put all day and my brows look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow kit for the price the tools are handy.. And can easily be taken on the go.. Will be buying more.. And also fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product that helps make bomb proof eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Not bad...my brows are shaping up! :)</li>
            <li> I love this!  It goes on smooth and blends in with my natural eyebrows.  I love the brushes.  I don&#x27;t use the stencils or the tweezers, but the blendable colors and brushes make this kit more than worth it.  Definitely buying this again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need the stencils because they were too large for my face, however I do use all three of the shades. The tools and the brow powder make for a very beautiful and natural affect. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> You can easily go crazy with this stuff. It works great!</li>
            <li> Great product. I just ordered one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Got it on time and I really like it</li>
            <li> I love love loooove this product! It adds a little extra \\&quot;umph\\&quot; to my eyebrows. Best eyebrow product that I have tried! I loved that it came with stencils even though I probably won&#x27;t use them much. I used it as soon as I got it &amp; instantly fell in love. You won&#x27;t regret buying this! :)</li>
            <li> It works great and it makes your eyebrows look normal. You can use different colors and it easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use the stencils it comes with, but I am a newbie at brow stuff- the colours are great, it is easy to apply. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome because the powder lasts almost all day even through this weather that been in the 90°&#x27;s and 100°&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!! Helped me get my eyebrows in perfect shape</li>
            <li> I have now had this brow kit for over two years and this is my second review of the product. I only use one of the colors on the palette and even after two years I&#x27;m no where near finished with the powder. It has lasted so long!! It truly does give a natural look and it was worth the money, when I run out I do intend on buying this product again. It stays on through sleep, rain, snow, no matter what it&#x27;s always there. I don&#x27;t even need to reapply it throughout the day which is incredible. Honestly if you were going to gamble on any makeup product this is the one to do it on. It&#x27;s really hard to be disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> The stencils and utensils are great but the powder does not last at all. Overall for the price its good to dust over liner.</li>
            <li> liked the brow color selection and tools. the only downside was it only came with one type of brow stencil. Would have loved if it came with more options, would have made this 100%</li>
            <li> The colors are good and the things that come with it are good but the eyebrow shaper things suck, don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> The tweezers didn&#x27;t work very well for me but it didn&#x27;t matter to me because I have good tweezers already.  I love this item. Helped with my eyebrow dilemma of shaping my brows.</li>
            <li> I have some really great looking brow now</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but this kit is self explanatory so it&#x27;s not like ull make a mistake. Colors are very nice!!</li>
            <li> Everything you need for the perfect brow!!</li>
            <li> This Product is a JOKE!&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers don&#x27;t pull out hair at all and they are so flimsy. The eye brow stencils are ridiculous unless you want that high of an arch on your brow. I will not be buying this again and I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> This thing made shaping and coloring in my brows easier than ever! So glad I purchased it! My brows don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re drawn on, either when I use this product, it just adds more definition to it. My eyebrows look completely natural, still, while using this. Absolutely love this. Once I run out I&#x27;m definitely buying another one!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be. it does not blend well and also it does not come out like in the picture!</li>
            <li> 5 stars!! I love everything about this product!! Idk why everyone is complaining about the stencils they work better than the Ardell Brow Perfection Stencils I bought for six dollars. This is way better and it comes with mini makeup brush and a brow comb plus matte brow powders!! I will def. order again when I run out!! Honest seller. Thankyou!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for perfectly shaped brows you don&#x27;t have to look anywhere else this product does&lt;br /&gt;that and more it makes you&#x27;re eyebrows look like pure perfection .</li>
            <li> Love this!!! The stencils are sooo good, my eyebrows are on FLEEEEEK , I used the Kiss eyebrow kit previously, but this will be my new go to, trust me it is worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and usually use a light black pencil on my brows but I was looking for something more natural. I have a hard time finding brow shadow because everything for brunettes is too red and the products intended for black hair are too dark. These colors are perfect though! The color lasts all day, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with smudges. The angle brush and mascara like brush are great tools. The tweezers are cheap and worthless. The case is cardboard and the lower corner is magnetic to hold the tweezers to it sort of like a pallet. The stencils will make you look like Ronald McDonald so please don&#x27;t buy this for them. I also use the powder to darken my scalp in my hair part and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I love it! The colors are nice and dark and with the brush, it is VERY easy to apply. It goes on smoothly and looks great. I have no problems with smearing or anything really. It&#x27;s also great that it comes with eyebrow clippers as well. Very good buy for me.</li>
            <li> I loved this product it looked great on my brows and blended well. It was a bit darker than I expected but I mixed the middle color and the lightest color and it was perfect. I had it for a while now and i still have quite a bit of product left. Shipping was a bit slow it took 12 days to come.</li>
            <li> Great product works wonders on ur brows</li>
            <li> I love this. It looks exactly as it does in the picture. Everyone is right about the stencils that it comes with. They&#x27;re just not practical. I live this little palette and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the different color of the eyebrow shades, the only thing that I have to complain about is the stencils. It is all in the same shape and those are not my shape. But I still use the shades for my eyebrow. It works better than the ones I buy from my drug store.</li>
            <li> l don&#x27;t like it atalllllllllll</li>
            <li> Easy to use, stays on &amp; looks good. The price is better than the Dior Brow pencil I had been using. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the middle brown color, Looks natural on me</li>
            <li> Love this product. It gives my brows that something extra!</li>
            <li> its is a little messy, the powder falls on your face but overall its good</li>
            <li> daughter had wanted this and loves it, thanks for a nice product and great deal</li>
            <li> I have medium skin and black eyebrows. The brown is a bit too light brown, but blends in surprisingly well. I love the little brush and applicator. I threw out the &amp;#34;stencils&amp;#34; on day one. Not useful.</li>
            <li> This is just a great little eyebrow kit.  It comes with stencils, a brush, tweezers, and brush.  The colors are natural and the instructions on the inside are easy and helpful.  I really liked the outcome of the product and for the price, will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I love doing my brows but I hate when they look blocky.This brow kit makes them look natural and really good.</li>
            <li> Where has this been my entire life !</li>
            <li> I have one from urban decay and I&#x27;ll say that the palette from urban decay last in water and throughout the day. This one is really good but if I&#x27;m not careful the powder from my eyebrows comes off throughout the day. I love the brush better than the one I received from urban decay and the stencils that comes with the product are great but depends on the person. My eyebrows were already similarly close to one of the stencils so I use it everyday to get my eyebrows to match. I was glad because I have my bangs sweep to one side so I never truly worried getting them to look exactly the same since one eyebrow is exposed all the time. Now they look exactly the same and i think it is great for the price it is. Since I have a problem of the powder not staying on, I use my urban decay palette and use all of the other products that this one offers. If you don&#x27;t have another eyebrow palette I would still use this one but probably use a brown pencil to get the powder to stay on as well or just check on your eyebrows throughout the day to not have a problem. Carry a brown pencil with you or the case itself. It&#x27;s small and convenient to carry to places.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyebrow kit. I was amazed at how much better the powder looks than the eyebrow pencil I was using. It is very easy to apply and there are three shades to chose from. I used the lightest one. It lasts the entire day and looked just as good 8 hours after I applied it. The brush is very easy to use too. I applied the powder and then brushed the brow with the brush that was also included and boy, did the eyebrows look fantastic!! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I went by the reviews and wasn&#x27;t the least bit disappointed. The price is excellent too. I highly recommend this product and would give it ten stars if I could!!</li>
            <li> Very good.. like a lot</li>
            <li> I ordered this and I just knew it would work in luew of usingmy eyebrow pencil all the time. The shipping was really fast and it was wrapped really nice , packaged well. Everything looks just like the picture above.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this kit when I run out of my normal brow kit as a &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; until I repurchase my regular. I have to say, I&#x27;m not a huge fan. The darkest color in this kit isn&#x27;t as dark as it could be. I like my brows very defined and using this powder alone, I still have to use a pencil to add definition and more color because of how &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; the dark color is (I have dark hair, brown/black). Another thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the fall out while you apply the powder to your brows. Even after giving my brow brush that I use for application a few good &amp;#34;knocks&amp;#34; to rid the excess product on my brush, there is still dark powder all over my face when I&#x27;m done. Some fall out, yeah normal, but this leaves A LOT. I also use brow wax before application to help the powder adhere even better and it&#x27;s still bad. If you&#x27;re not a huge make-up head and will barely use this or you will use it  to just help fill in your brows a bit, this may work fine for you. But if you like definition and rich pigment to blend into your brows because you have thin brows and want to make them full, this kit isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Love the different shades I&#x27;m a darker completion so I use one to do my eyebrows and the other as eye shadow</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the stencil but the powder is easy to apply and build up. Quality tools</li>
            <li> i only use the middle brown, which is the medium brown. also, i like the templates i love the arch</li>
            <li> This is NOT a complete brow kit.. sure it gives you everything you need (minus a wax or brow mascara) but the brush is flimsy and hardly holds any powder, the stencils a thin which to many is a problem, for me personally my problem was that all 3 were the exact same shape...why in the cosmos would you need 3 of the same? I thought they would be different shapes or something but nope, the spoolee (mascara brush) fell apart literally, like brush tip from handle. On the bright side, nice tweezers.. if this brand effed up tweezers  I&#x27;d lose hope for humanity. Now for the powders, they aren&#x27;t super pigmented and feel kind silky so they glide on...and glide right back off. Maybe people with thicker brows have hair to hold it in place, I have thin brows so this was a no-go by it&#x27;s self. I resorted to using gel liner and setting it with the powder so it would stay on.. so my personal opinion is to get a different kit if you&#x27;re looking for an all-in-one.. but if you have thicker brows and something to hold the powder in place..buy with caution</li>
            <li> stencils only helped with the first time shaping. the brushes and tweezers are very small and pretty much useless. BUT the colors are perfect. I will buy again when I run out just for them.</li>
            <li> I love the stencils, the color, the only thing that it does not stay. I have been using the stencils and brushes only.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! its worth the money tbh</li>
            <li> My order arrived with a protective bag tied with a little red ribbon and a thank-you from the seller. The product is brand new and is awesome!</li>
            <li> What a big difference eyebrows make.</li>
            <li> I was initially unimpressed with the cheap little brush and tweezers that came with the product but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  The color was good, and it went on smooth, but immediately flaked all over my cheek.  After dusting all that off, I used the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; color under my brow as it instructed to define the brow... but it was way too dark (and I&#x27;m dark complected) and looked horrible.  I&#x27;ll be returning the product and sticking to my brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Hi, I ordered this for a friend and she and some other friends liked this so much that I placed another order for more. It&#x27;s long lasting and won&#x27;t rub off it that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re wondering. I think this is definitely the future for eyebrow makeup...so long eyebrow penciles!</li>
            <li> Great and will use it</li>
            <li> This was my first venture into powder brow liner. The 3 shades included are perfect and I even managed to use it as an eyeliner on occasion. I tried to use the brow templates, but I must be too retarded - so I do it free-hand and it turns out wonderful. What I do is use a pencil to softly mark the lower line of the brow and then fill-in the remainder of the shape with the powder -- that way it looks so natural. And, I was surprised at how long-lasting it is. One evening I was too tired to remove makeup from my face -- when I awoke in the morning I still looked freshly made up.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product it is hard to apply and too light for me.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect! It gives my brows just the shading I needed, love it!</li>
            <li> My fave eyebrow! I love it</li>
            <li> I am caramel with dark hair and this powder doesn&#x27;t even show up in am pretty sure I received the darkest shade it is a miss for me</li>
            <li> Long wearing, natural looking stay,  my eyebrow was singed by a fire but is now in process of growing back.  This helps to draw my other eyebrow in until it has completely grown back. I have no complaints at all! Last all day even when sweating or in water at a water park, for which outside of my daily activities i Have tested that statement lol. Does come off easy with water and soap, however my facial cleanser also has make up remover in it. I&#x27;m not sure if that effects the easy removal process or not.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Will buy again. Price is reasonable and the product is of high quality. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The kit was fine, I just had to give it away because it was too slim for the shape of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Really good brow powder it beats my nyx brow powders. Love this much more paired with my revlon brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Very nice however if the box had a snap to keep it close it would keep the brushes in place other than that I love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this powder and received it exactly 1 week later. I&#x27;m really glad I ordered another stencil set because I would never use any of the stencils that come in this set (they are all highly arched and do not fit my face at all), but I wasn&#x27;t ordering for the stencils so that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me. The powder is good, I&#x27;ve used it once so far and will have to practice a little bit to find the right mix of colors, but I like that it has 3 options so you can get the perfect match, and the brush that comes in this kit works just fine. Overall, i&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I will order this again for the powder.</li>
            <li> Its a really good shade palette and gives a perfect look. I would not recommend it for pimple prone oily skin tough.</li>
            <li> Great eye brow makeup. However, I wish there had been an option for one of the colors to be cream. They are all pressed powder.</li>
            <li> I love this brow makeup. It stays on all day, and you have 3 different shades of dark brown/black. It goes on very nicely, and does not flake off. I will be a returning customer!</li>
            <li> JUSTO LO QUE BUSCABA .</li>
            <li> I still have to get used to powders. Cannot apply like a professional :(</li>
            <li> This apply smoothly with a brush, and will survive sweating.</li>
            <li> Like the stencils. There are three colors- they are very dark. I can only use the lightest color on my brunette eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Luv this item..matched my color perfectly. Tweetzers aren&#x27;t the greatest, I recommend a different pair.</li>
            <li> I had been using a brow pencil for quite a while and was looking for something that made my sparse eyebrows look more natural, and I came upon this. I ordered this product in the darkest shades in September, it is now January and I still have a good bit left from the one color I use to fill in my eyebrows. I came back to reorder and decided to write this review. It&#x27;s a great product for a great price, however, I was not a fan of the flat eyebrow brush and used one of my own, I also neglected to use the eyebrow stencils, but overall the actual product itself is great.</li>
            <li> I never knew such witchcraft existed but it does and I am SO impressed. I have never filled in my own eye brows before this and i Must say it is a GREAT started kit.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this product</li>
            <li> Love the colors and stays on all day.  Perfect size to travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using a pencil to fill in my brows and decided to try this in the dark. My hairs black, and this color matches perfect for my eye brows in the dark brown. I wish I would&#x27;ve tried this sooner. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for that just right color of brow makeup for quite awhile. I have fuller brows that have a couple of sparse spots along the arch. My natural hair color is nearly black, and I now use henna and indigo to keep it that way. My brows are naturally near black in color as well. I&#x27;ve gone through countless different colored brow pencils and gels, and most are too light for me. Prior to buying this product, I was using a Black/Brown brow pencil. Using that pencil was so touchy. I either sported a not quite full enough brow, or I looked like the iconic artist Frida Kahlo! But then I found this product! My search is over! Like other reviewers before me, I found the stencils laughable (they nearly reached my temple!), I only use the top color on my brows, spoolie brush is quite short and pretty cheaply made, the tweezers are useless (they won&#x27;t grab ONE hair - not in my brows, not even on my head), and the brush is pretty cheap. All that said, I still give it a 5 for the the color - it&#x27;s perfect! I don&#x27;t need the stencils, I actually used the two other colors as an eyeshadow, the spoolie brush is good for travel, I use my favorite Tweezerman brand tweezers, and the little brush actually works. On top of that, the product is very inexpensive compared to so many other products out there that I have tried and been disappointed with.</li>
            <li> great product other than the tweezers are worthless, Brushes are good and the colors are good. I don&#x27;t use the stencils.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be a good kit but turns out it&#x27;s amazing and I had it for a year and I&#x27;m about to buy another!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very Happy this my second time ordering this.</li>
            <li> The price was excellent, the picture is exactly what I had received. Looks very natural on, if applied correctly. Good product</li>
            <li> i am such a beginner and it is perfect for that. i use it daily. only thing i dont like is the stencils are so similar instead of being super different. but i do love it</li>
            <li> Price is wonderful and the product it wonderful.  Never had better eyebrows in my life.</li>
            <li> Good product. . Awesome bargain</li>
            <li> I was not given a choice of colors and I wanted light brown.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t stay in your face. It smudge and its merely impossible to get the look they are advertising using this product. This ruined my trip.</li>
            <li> Great brow kit. Recommend</li>
            <li> there are 3 colors inside with a small applicator and tweezers. The stencils are very small,I used my ow, but the colors are perfect. This is an add product. So, you must added to an open order. Can not purchased by itself.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my darker skin.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Looks natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! All I can say. It lasts long and makes brows look natural unlike most brow makeup I&#x27;ve used and the shipping was also great</li>
            <li> I just received the product and I&#x27;m impressed. It has an imam in the edges so close perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Frustrating every time I need to apply this product...</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It gives me the control I needed to get the look I wanted without it looking like it was drawn on by the end of the day. Very natural colors as well.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Will order another set for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I love it! The shades of browns are perfect, and it&#x27;s easy to apply! Compared to a lot of other brow products, the Cameo Perfect Brow Makeup is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Great.  Brow makeup works well, but I agree with other postings stating this would be nicer if it came in a smaller version that you could put in a purse and take with you.  The size and container it comes in doesn&#x27;t really work to take with you.</li>
            <li> When you fill in with an eyebrow pencil there always seem to be spaces and both eyebrows can never look the same. I love this product because it always fills evenly and smoothly. I wish there was a black in the set for dark hair but the darkest brown works just fine.</li>
            <li> I love the powder, looks great. the tweezers aren&#x27;t really great but I have enough tweezers anyway. I wish the eyebrow stencils were a little more durable, stiffer but the one I use works fine</li>
            <li> Works well! Do not use the tensils to shape my brows tho, dont need it.... No complaints!  Would recommend to friends and family for sure!</li>
            <li> Everything is compact which is nice but the tweezers are flimsy and not what I expected.  They are travel size and not really useful.</li>
            <li> The tweezers aren&#x27;t the greatest but it is cheap so just buy new ones for about $10. The rest of the product is good though. Would recommend buying clear gel to go along with it.</li>
            <li> I like this but have not been able to hold the shaper on in the right place and apply color at the same time</li>
            <li> Like the powder but I think the templates are unnecessary. Also, I would rather have just purchased one color. I can&#x27;t use the light color at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure but I didn&#x27;t really like it. I used it only few times. I like the texture of the powder, it&#x27;s soft and fills in smoothly but I didn&#x27;t like the look of my brows, the brow pencil still gives me the look I want.</li>
            <li> I love this kit!  The color was perfect.  I was going from light blonde (my natural color) to dark brown and I was nervous that my eyebrows wouldn&#x27;t look natural - but I was pleasantly surprised!  It covered better - and looked better - than putting hair dye on my brows ever did!  The stencils are kind of a joke, but it&#x27;s not hard to apply this makeup without them.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, and I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> I love this kit! I have black hair and this matches perfectly, doesn&#x27;t look too dark and the brush makes it so easy to shape your eyebrows the way you want it. A must have!!</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, especially for someone like me who knows nothing about makeup. Really it&#x27;s as easy as brushing the color on, which I think might take more precision with an eyebrow pencil. I have very dark eyebrows, the actual hair is close to black, so I thought I would need the middle color. I ended up using the lightest shade there, so if your eyebrow hair is that color you may want to consider something lighter. I&#x27;m new to eyebrow coloring, and I feel weird if they look too dark or noticeably different, so maybe I&#x27;m just being sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because the tweezer is basically useless.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product- definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to figure out what technique worked best with my brows and skin when it came to using this product. By lining my brows first then filling them with the brow powder this product works perfectly for me. I would definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li> I like it! It just got here and I tried it immediately. I used the darkest one and it applied easily. I&#x27;m a newbie at make-up, but I think this looked pretty natural. And while I only had it on for a few seconds, I know it lasts well because it took awhile to take off with make-up remover!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the tweezers. I&#x27;m sure everyone has a pair, but mine was recently trashed and I was looking forward to this one being decent. Instead, it&#x27;s rather flat and makes it terrible at getting stray hairs. The powder and brushes? A+. Tweezers are no biggy, but the rest is great!</li>
            <li> Too difficult to use. Plastic strips too thin and not easy to use. Also, the templates are not very real in shape and width.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s all you&#x27;d need to create a perfect looking but natural eye brows. The stencils gave me a better idea how to shape them</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this purchase. It&#x27;s very simple the use, and the results are very natural looking. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not worth the money and not the quality I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and though there are many, many choices to use for eyebrows, this inexpensive product is great.  It is a powder applied with a slanted brush and comes with three choices of colors in various shades of the color you choose.  It works well and is easy to use.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This kit is very versatile and easy to use.  The brush is pretty nice and makes good outlines of the brow.  The colors also are pretty - matches very well if you have dark brown hair and eyes.</li>
            <li> Wow..great price nice product.  I used light shade first then dark..the dark was a little too dark so next time I will use medium.  I put one on my wish list so I have an extra.  I was paying a lot for Cliniques version..this is just as good.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  I don&#x27;t use too often</li>
            <li> At this price, it cannot be beaten. The three colors are great for blending to make a natural brow. The stencils are nice for newer brow users that don&#x27;t know what shape to use. The tweezers are bad though, but they aren&#x27;t the reason why I bought this.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow fill in.&lt;br /&gt;I like choice of colors to mix for more natural effect.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for the brushes, I use a eyeliner brush I had, it is softer and the product can be applied in a lighter fashion.</li>
            <li> This stuff really sticks!  I have eyebrows and needed something to fill in and I really wanted something that would last all day.  This powder set is perfect with 3 colors to choose from and it is small which makes it great for travel.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.  I don&#x27;t really have eyebrows (they&#x27;re tattooed) and the powder didn&#x27;t stay in place.  It might work better on real eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Not too bad actually. I like the colors. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last few days, and I like it. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge unless I&#x27;m really sweating and rubbing.</li>
            <li> Great kit! Used it on myself as well as my two teens. Makes a wonderful difference and so easy to use!</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect! Everything in it is just right except the stencils but those aren&#x27;t really important. I love this!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I want! I have just now gotten to the age where I realize my eyebrows are slowly disappearing :) I love the Sephora brow kit, but I can never justify spending that much extra when I have to have my other makeup necessities. Love the color selection, the brush goes on well and the tip of the brush is the perfect size to get the thinner edges of your brow.</li>
            <li> I like this makeup but have a couple of improvements I&#x27;d like to see. The box is really big and it doesn&#x27;t have a latch to keep it from flying open and I wish it came with eyebrow wax. The powder goes on well amd lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I already gave pretty good eyebrows, and never used a brow powder before.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg to try a powder. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was, and how &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; it made my eyebrows look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product has such good reviews. The brush is horrible and the powder is just like any other brand.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.. If you have black hair you can only use the darkest one but thats fine with me. .I love the brow brush too</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the best out there but I definitely recommend for beginners because of easy application and price.  From the start my product had an almost unnoticeable amount of glitter. (I would have preferred it more if it had been glitter free.)</li>
            <li> Just wonderful if you have gray eyebrows with no shape.</li>
            <li> Okay for filling in, but didn&#x27;t care for it much for definition of the brow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the stencils but the rest of the item is great. I love the color and the powder is great quality.</li>
            <li> I didnt like the powder</li>
            <li> Great set. Lighter brown blends great.</li>
            <li> in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast shipment and great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheaply made entirely. None of the shades matched my brow color and the included tools were to very very cheap. Would not recommend this to anyone serious about having great eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, good selection of colors for the powder.  The only thing I would have liked was more stencils.  There are only 3 and they are all very thin brows so not of any use for me.</li>
            <li> Smooth application, quality shadow! Bought another soon after 1st one. STAYS ON ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> While this is a great product, I think I like the pencils a lot better. It doesn&#x27;t seem so dark or harsh on my face</li>
            <li> Just perfect. You need to know how to use it.</li>
            <li> great stuff would buy again, yes the templates are useless but still this powder in 3 shades is great</li>
            <li> Love this product. I love the brush that comes with it. I love the colors, they match great!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I never thought in a million years that I would use Brow makeup. But, after my wedding I realized how great they looked in pictures and had to get my own kit!! My mom loves my brow kit sooooo much I have to order her own.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great product for price.  The dark is really dark.  Works for me because my brows are black.  Looks great and really helping me reshape my brows.</li>
            <li> This was his i learned to do eyebrows. Very good for starters!</li>
            <li> The kit was very good for me, mainly because Im inexperienced with doing eyebrows, each stencil does its job nothing bad to say about them, only misleading thing is the color in the display photo, it shows darker colors which i was looking for  because my hair is very dark and I needed those dark colors for my eyebrows, but right before it was delivered  I found out through one of the customer pictures, Thats it actually really lighter than I had wanted in the first place and it really threw me off and I was going to be upset because I paid good money for something that might not actually be what the photo shows. When I recieved the product, luckily enough the brown worked for my eyebrows, but that was luck, all in all I really like this product and Ill continue to keep using it.</li>
            <li> How did I live my life without this product? The brush is perfect! I LOVE this.&lt;br /&gt;The kit would be better if the lid had a small mirror on it for when I carry it in my purse. Would cost more to build, of course - but use your own mirror. You&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li> This is a really great brow powder for dark hair (even medium tones could use this). I have dark brown hair and dark eyebrows. There are three powders (a medium, dark, very dark shades), a spooley brush, a small eyebrow brush, tweezers, and various plastic brow stencils. It is bulky, in that it takes up space if you were to carry it in your purse, but at home it works great.</li>
            <li> Is really good for its price I like it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says love it</li>
            <li> so easy i dont know what id do without it.!!! will buy another when its over!</li>
            <li> Like it says \\&quot; Perfect Brow \\&quot; ! I used this on my girlfriends eye brows and she loved the way it made her brows more pronounced and the perfect shape and color . Can&#x27;t really say more than that since I don&#x27;t use it on mine : -)</li>
            <li> I bought this and when it came it was broken and the eyeshadow was everwhere. I opened it &amp; the pieces went all over my carpet.</li>
            <li> My go to brow kit now, I love that I can mix colors to get my perfect shade and my eyebrows always look so fresh!</li>
            <li> love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brow product.  I have black hair and the color works well,  but it could be used for even brown brows as there is a lighter color that I don&#x27;t use.  Keeps my brows looking sharp,  and I haven&#x27;t noticed any fall when applying the powder. I also really like the application brush included.  It is stiff  but soft,  not all hard like some brow powder applicators.  I like it  :)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it that much yet, but the colors are nice the little tools work really well. The price was great for a product like this.</li>
            <li> very unnatural looking. I&#x27;ll stick to the nyx eyebrow cake powder</li>
            <li> Just what I like in my makeup, inexpensive and does the job.</li>
            <li> PERFECT COLOR ARRANGEMENT.</li>
            <li> I love this kit! I get so many compliments when I use it. I love the stencils because they&#x27;re shapped perfectly to match my brows and I love the different shoes they have. Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> I had never used a brow powder before. I have always used brow pencils, but never liked the way they would darken the skin behind the brow making my brows look anything but natural.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I decided to try this kit. I absolutely love the brow powders and brushes. I have very dark brown hair and have found trying to match my hair color very difficult. The power shades are wonderful. You can easily blend the dark and the medium colors to achieve a natural looking dark brown color. I will definitly re-order this kit again, just for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;If you are ordering this kit mainly for the stencils, don&#x27;t waist your money. They are an absolute joke. Unless, you have eyebrows with an extremely high arch they probably won&#x27;t work for you either.</li>
            <li> For how cheap this product is it is absolutely amazing! My eyebrows look great!</li>
            <li> i like it very much &amp;#62;&amp;#62; THANK YOU AMAZON &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Powder is very loose and soft, the pigment doesn&#x27;t stay, tweezers are dull, the brush itself is thick can&#x27;t shape your eyebrow with it. the stencils are super thin in width, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d use them on my eyebrows. They&#x27;re very 90&#x27;s-ish. Not happy with the product, you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is cheep. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Perfect kit. I haven&#x27;t used the stencils but love the powder.</li>
            <li> Love it. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I needed. It&#x27;s a perfect color for my eyebrows, I thought it would be too dark but it suits me fine. Since I have thin eyebrows, the stencils actually work for me, which is surprising because there were so many complaints on them. I am very pleased with my order and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Although the tone is a bit lighter than I thought, I is perfect with the color of my skin and my hair color. It is easy to apply and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> The best i have used.</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE IT!! So natural and perfect for my jet black hair!!</li>
            <li> thank you so much and came here and immaculant condition and it was more than what I expected and I cannot wait to have perfect eyebrows now all the time thank you so much for the product and I will always keep one handy and it came right on time you all are great thank you and you have a good day</li>
            <li> With age our brows thin out. This was a perfect product for me to bring my brows back to life.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Really fills in where my eyebrows are scarce.  Great Product!</li>
            <li> I like my eyebrows a bit darker/thicker than they are. This brow powder is perfect. It gives you a natural look...as opposed to that drawn on look an eyebrow pencil gives you. It lasts all day. I love the brow brush, powder brush and tweezer. Just the right size. I didn&#x27;t need the shaper stencils they give you. I basically ordered for the powder. Not disappointed at all. Ordered two more.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, natural looking and lasts.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> The stencils are a great tool in shaping your brow and the brow powder once applied looks very natural and gives a nice definition and finish to your looks.</li>
            <li> its a great product. getting another one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time purchasing this product. Garbage</li>
            <li> I love everything except the stencils ._. What did get me upset is that the brush didn&#x27;t come in my kit :(</li>
            <li> CHEAP! Brushes &amp; Product my own fault though since it was totally inexpensive. Give the fake eyebrow look and doesn&#x27;t last half a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sticking with Mac and BareMinerals for the essentials</li>
            <li> Works well, great price and fast delivery... It comes with all you need to have great brows, I just suggest to get small pair of scissors for your brows and brow fabulosity will happen!</li>
            <li> So much better than my old eyebrow pencil!!</li>
            <li> This works well for me. I have tried many brow makeups and most have either been too dark or too light. This one offers three different colors and the one color is the closest match I have tried. It is easy to apply and looks fairly natural. I do not use the stencils that are enclosed.</li>
            <li> It took me a LONG time to try this after I purchased it, I&#x27;m not sure why. It arrived packaged perfectly, but I was already using other brow products and doubted that it would be a &amp;#34;game changer&amp;#34; in my routine since the price is so amazing....all I can say is I WISH I TRIED THIS AS SOON AS I RECEIVED IT, IT&#x27;S ALL I USE.  It comes in the three shades as pictured, a great spooly, great brush and a cute tweezer-but it&#x27;s too small for my liking...Anyway, what makes this stand out is the coloring of these eyebrow shades...they are PERFECT.  Just the PERECT ASHINESS THAT MAKES IT BLEND SEAMLESSLY WITH EYEBROW HAIR.  I have all kinds of eyebrow products from high end to low end and the problem is ALWAYS THE SAME, I&#x27;m a brunette (dark brown, to black hair) and the blacks are to blue based or grey, and the dk browns always have way TOO MUCH of a red undertone that looks unnatural and stands out against my hair.  I can&#x27;t believe how NATURAL these color are.  On days when I want something quick I use this kit:  I use the lightest shade at the front of my brow, then I change to the medium shade for a bit in the middle and I finish the tail with the darkest shade.  My brows are fuller, gaps filled, and you&#x27;d never know it.  I do use the spooly and small brush that came with it.  I have Anastasia dipbrow products that I love for their longetivity, but even the dark brown dip brow has that annoying red undertone and it takes FOREVER to apply perfectly...the dipbrow is NOT something you can rush.  I never heard of this company, but I&#x27;m so glad I bought from them and I hope they keep making this stuff.  Better than ANY DRUG STORE BRAND INCLUDING NYX, REVLON, MAYBELLINE ETC. Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try a powder instead of the usual eyebrow pencil i normally use. I didn&#x27;t have too many expectations, as I&#x27;ve never used a powder before, so I have nothing to compare it too...but i love this! I won&#x27;t be going back to a pencil though for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Color is perfect for someone with dark brown hair. application brush is great, tweezers are lacking, and the stencils i find pointless.&lt;br /&gt;But great buy for like $6 or whatever it was.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve always had extremely light eyebrows like my mom.  I got this because I&#x27;m very self conscious about it and using a pencil has been getting on my nerves and it&#x27;s not looking as natural as I would like.  This product is great.  I don&#x27;t even need to use the guide because I just want to darken what I have, they are already in a shape I can deal with.  I just take the brush that came in the pack and mix the colors a bit then I&#x27;m good for the whole day, even if I rub my face...which would mess up my brows when I penciled them over.  I like the case too because it slightly snaps closed.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me all these years to give up on eyebrow pencils and go for this cake makeup.  I never found a pencil that was satisfactory after the first few uses, no matter what brand or cost they just do not sharpen properly and go to waste.  But this &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; product is great...takes  a few times to get used to just how much to put on, but the combination of three graduated colors makes it easy to combine just the right shade for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere for a good eyebrow kit, and this one is absolutely perfect! Works great, and makes it look natural</li>
            <li> Just got it today and my lady is loving it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this ! Looks so natural , looks just like the picture and the price is just amazing (:</li>
            <li> Receive my package on time and no problems with the seller. I would recommend this seller and purchase again.  I love this brow kit, its just perfect and I get a lot of compliments.  It looks natural. . Try it for yourself.. Thanks much!</li>
            <li> One of the colors matched perfectly. The guides that come with it were too flimsy and none worked with my shape brow. The brushes helped though. All in all, great kit, but don&#x27;t expect to use all of it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I highly recommend it. I for one do not know how to apply makeup to my eyebrows, but this makes it very easy! Shipping was hassle free.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and perfect make up.</li>
            <li> A must have for that on the run woman, you can shape groom and color your brow very quickly and perfectly, I love the stencils included for that perfect shape.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  Brilliant little case to keep everything in as well.</li>
            <li> works wonders!! love love love</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t no for some reason it made a few hairs fall off bad product !</li>
            <li> However the stencils are completely useless. ): The powders are great though, and made the money I spent worthwhile. I may purchase again just for that reason.</li>
            <li> love ordered a year ago and still works good</li>
            <li> Goes great with my skin tone and super easy to use. Although the plucker kind of suck I didn&#x27;t buy them for that so I don&#x27;t see that as worth losing a star.</li>
            <li> This brow kit is better than anything I have tried. Easy to use , natural looking brows stay on for hours. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love it, so worth it!! The most perfect eyebrow kit I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> I think the product is same as its description! so I love it!  Thank you very much! I will come back!</li>
            <li> Love the product but, the stencil doesn&#x27;t fit my brow shape, it&#x27;s too small and so I just free hand the lines.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smooth color match all....</li>
            <li> Great stuff was perfect color went on easy  recommended  very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this!  Other reviewers have noted that the stencils are not great and I agree but I didn&#x27;t plan on using them anyway.  Love the brush and spoolie that comes with the kit and the color is perfect.  I don&#x27;t leave the house without  using this eyebrow powder.  Love and will order again.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are made out of some foil-like material....totally cheap and useless.  The powder looks ok, but this is not a package worth buying overall.</li>
            <li> Awesome. So much lighter and better than using eye shadow or a pencil, which would come out to dark sometimes or look fake. I like the shades of brown because it allows me to make my eyebrows look more natural. Also I can do a day eyebrow and a night eyebrow Hahahaha light heavier makeup for the club etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your buying this for tweezers you&#x27;ll be disappointed but I have my own tools, I literally bought this&lt;br /&gt;For the powder and eyebrow brush so im happy</li>
            <li> This worked wonders for me! It blends in great and is good for beginners. It really helps when it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve had my brows arched. Idk about the other ladies who gave it low ratings, but as a black woman with a medium brown skin tone, it worked for me. The only thing negative about this product is that after a while (like 7 months) it starts to clump on the brush and doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> love this its easy to apply and great product</li>
            <li> I have dark brows and it&#x27;s hard to find a good match. These work great. The stencils are useless, as are the tweezers, but the powder brush is awesome (just the right amount of stiffness) and the other brush works as could be expected. I plan on ordering this again.</li>
            <li> This product is full of parabens.  If you are trying to stay healthy and avoid breast cancer, avoiding parabens and halides will help.  Many companies are removing parabens from their products.  Avoid this one.</li>
            <li> it looks so natural and easy too use! all my friends use it and they love it also! this is one of the best eyebrow products i have ever used.</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work this well and I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon......  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I love it.  I use it everyday.  It looks much nicer than pencil alone.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was nervous to buy it but it turned out to be great. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I must say this particular product I ordered came back in no time. I was very excited to receive this eyebrow kit or whatever you would like to call it... I never was blessed with full thick eyebrows, so I thought this would give me the look I was going for. My natural eyebrows are very thin &amp; short. Basically, nonexistent so I thought Cameo Perfect Brow would give me just what I was looking for. Long story short, I was very disappointed with the product. When I applied Cameo to my eyebrows I thought I was going to see a difference &amp; sadly I did not. If I could go back &amp; choose another eyebrow kit I most definetly would. Oh&#x27; well no use of crying over spilled milk... just would have to search for a different eyebrow kit &amp; hopefully it will give me the look i&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow set, it goes on pretty well. The only thing about it that I don&#x27;t really like is the brush it comes with to set it with because it can make it go everywhere.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Great! I have really dark hair bc I dye it blue black and was concerned it wasn&#x27;t dark enough for me but it marched perfectly and has yet to ever come off even in the snow!</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose abd the colors are nicely blending</li>
            <li> perfect to get the right shade, and stays all day.</li>
            <li> Love the different shades and the quality very good.</li>
            <li> Only slightly darker than expected, love this product, use it everyday. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are tattooed on and I loved it when I first got it done, but as of recently they need to be redone. I ordered this because it was the perfect in between fix! I fill in the blanks with this stuff every morning! I love how natural it looks.</li>
            <li> Love the color. That exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! It comes with 3 shades that will definitely match your color if you have brown or even black hair! I love how the powder goes on so smooth and looks so natural. For the money, this product is wonderful and I recommend it to anyone that is new to doing their brows!</li>
            <li> I have pretty full eyebrows, so I don&#x27;t need to fill in a lot, thus I cannot tell exactly how the product would perform on bare skin.&lt;br /&gt;I picked the color dark brown. I use the darkest shade of the trio, and it works fine on my black eyebrows. I like the fact that there are 3 stencils to help you understand where to draw the arch (if you&#x27;re a beginner like me). The angled brush is not very stiff, so it is a little difficult to draw precisely, but it works decently for laying the product. I&#x27;ve tried using the tweezers, and I feel they&#x27;re not that great.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a decent product for beginners that want to try and spend little money.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.  The price was amazing.  i will re order it.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, easy to apply,  stays on for long time, no mess, good price too !</li>
            <li> Fixed my broken ass eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The powder is nice. The eyebrow shaper things are not helpful if you have thicker eyebrows already, like myself.</li>
            <li> Love the colors although I wish the darkest was a bit darker. The angeled brush that comes with it is great for precision. Overall great product</li>
            <li> 1. They are a great value&lt;br /&gt;2. Many colors for blending.  Darker for the ends and light for the front.&lt;br /&gt;3. Come with an eyebrow brush, tweezers, eyebrow stencils and the shadow brush for brows.&lt;br /&gt;4. Love love that its in a little box I can just stick in my make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;5. I use these more often that my other eyebrow shadow</li>
            <li> Hard to apply, the cut out brows are hard to hold and apply at the same time.  Plastic is flimsy.  I didn&#x27;t like the colors once applied.</li>
            <li> For all the ladies that have over-plucked their eyebrows at some point in their lives and go through a horrible stage trying to grow them back in without looking like a weirdo........this is perfect!  It&#x27;s easy to use, the 3 different shades are great and it fills in the scraggly areas where I need it!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never put makeup on my brows since mine are pretty thick and I don&#x27;t mind the shape. But I see now how it ties everything together nicely and takes your look up a notch. Good product for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li> The color is not for me</li>
            <li> Best powder eyebrow color I have tried.  It looks natural, stays on, and is easy to apply.  I didn&#x27;t bother with the stencil at all.</li>
            <li> not bad for the price, stencils were did not work for my eyebrow shape.</li>
            <li> Love the color choices and brush. Easy to use even without the stencils.</li>
            <li> Its a little darker than I thought so I would recommend getting a lighter shade but overall they are great! I love them !!!</li>
            <li> If you want that glamour shaped eyebrows shop no more, this is it! Finally I have the perfect eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I love this shadows, just the color that I&#x27;ve been looking for for so long.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I was never the one to fill in my eyebrows but with this product I do it everyday. And the colorsvare spot on.</li>
            <li> Most amazing brow makeup ever! Buy buy buy, you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> So  much better than the pencil I used before,</li>
            <li> I heard about this perfect eyebrow kit and its a great brow kit perfect for everyday use or for any special occasion&lt;br /&gt;Great communication and great seller</li>
            <li> Like the makeup.  The packaging is awkward.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use</li>
            <li> Perfect!Absolutely beautiful.The colors were beautiful just like in the picture.Really good quality,good product and great price! I will be buying more in the future.I highly recommend this company.Thanks:)</li>
            <li> Was not in package :( The tracking said it was bundled with another order but box only had the other order this item was missing :(</li>
            <li> This is the  best eyebrow makeup, it stays on all day and you need very little to apply to get the desired result.</li>
            <li> This is a must have, really fills in areas, love it!</li>
            <li> Woahh dudes! Let me tell you, this little thing came 2 days after I ordered them, 4 days prior to the prediction! I am very impressed as far as shipping wise.&lt;br /&gt;The product it&#x27;s self, everything is pretty good to me, the stencils look good on me, I don&#x27;t know where other people are getting those negative thoughts from.  I only use the darkest shade because it shows up best on me, being a orange tanned color.  The other shades don&#x27;t suit me.  The brushes are fine, tweasers work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;One complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on me like everyone says, I am a professional acrobat with oily skin, the oil and sweat pretty much just melts it off at work.  By the time I get home it&#x27;s half done lol.  But I just check up on it every few hours or so, no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a beginner because the stencils could really help you shape if you don&#x27;t know what your doing.&lt;br /&gt;Also to those who don&#x27;t have a athletic job.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. I love the powder I use it everyday. I prefer to use it over my eyebrow liner/eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;The stencils don&#x27;t work like they&#x27;re suppose to and they&#x27;re too think of a brow anyways. My boyfriend laughed at me when I used the stencils.. Because I came out looking like I had a couple caterpillars on my face &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;I EVEN USED THE SMALLEST STENCIL!! Lol!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews are true: the stencils are useless. No one WANTS eyebrows or has eyebrows in those shapes. Toss them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powders are great. The three different colors allow you to play around with the shading. Best cheap eyebrow set! LOVE LOVE LOVE it. I would recommend it to a friend. Heck, I would recommend it to a stranger.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.. I bought a few and none did what this product does, so pigmented that don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> Took some practice but achieved the look in wanted since chemo has taken my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Love it.. the eye brow shapes makes my eye brows look almost perfect :P.. fast delivery.</li>
            <li> good quality stencils just too large for my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eyebrow kit for a long time that had stencils that weren&#x27;t so big and fat.  There are three stencils and they are a reasonable size.  The brow powder stays in place with two powders the same color, the one I&#x27;ll use the most, and a lighter powder.  This was an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Nice color eye brow liner but not as dark pigmented as I like. Some people like lighter color eye brows, I prefer darker color eye brows. The brushes are a perfect size for eye brows but the case itself feels cheaply made. The eye shadow palettes were all crooked. Overall, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Great kit, useful for everyday. 😁</li>
            <li> They need different eyebrow shapes...</li>
            <li> The powder works like a charm, if there was a bigger pallet of it without the tweezers and brush, I would buy it. The tools are tiny. I have long fingers so it works, just a little pain in the butt. Stencils are useless unless you have those crazy sharpie eyebrows. For a starter, it&#x27;s a good product, but if you just want powder, find just the powder!</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is not too great. The powder is smooth and applies great. The brow brush is a lovely addition to this. Shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> I Loved It &#x27; ! Really Works &amp; Makes Eyebrows Look Natural ! ThankYouuu !</li>
            <li> So I bought this a month ago and I am in love with this. The stencils are of no use because they are flimsy and doesn&#x27;t match up to my facial structure. So if you are buying this for the stencil then I would recommend you not to because mine it doesn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;But the other brow kit are perfect. I have tan Hawaiian kind of skin so the color of the brows matched perfectly with my skin to hair ratio. But if you are a light skin girl with non black hair color, then I would not recommend this item as it might be too dark and might give you a drag queen kinda look :P. But if you have a tanned skin tone I think this is the perfect shade.</li>
            <li> OMG......I JUST RECEIVED THIS EYE BROW KIT,AND I COULDN&#x27;T WAIT TO TRY IT. THIS IS THE BEST!AND I MEAN THE BEST EYE BROW KIT EVER MADE, BAR NONE. I ACTUALLY JUST PUT ANOTHER ONE IN MY CART FOR MY NEXT ORDER...IM ADDICTED ALREADY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So easy to use with out the pattern too.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, packed very well.  Product works well without the eyebrow stencils which were awkward to use,&lt;br /&gt;That is why the four stars.</li>
            <li> Perfect kit for my brows anyone with brown mid-brown or dark eyebrows I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Coming from someone with VERY thin eyebrows, I love this product. It is easy to apply and comes in a variety of shades. The only suggestion I have to the company is to come up with a formula that can endure sweat. When it is hot or I sweat it comes off too easily.</li>
            <li> GREAT, easy to use and looks very natural.  At first I used too much and it appeared a little too dark or heavy, but that was just a brief &#x27;learning curve&#x27; for me!</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery and incredible price</li>
            <li> The shadows are a joke on darker complexions. The only thing i actually use are the tweezers..Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Just had to try it right away. Perfect for me.. I can actually make my eyebrows darker to match my dyed hair. Made them look even and fuller. The 3 tools included are prefect size when dealing with eyebrows.. Very happy with my purchase... I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on different stuff from $5 to $30 and this isn&#x27;t expensive and it works.. Thank you so much for giving me beautiful eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have finally found a brow powder that I&#x27;m satisfied with.  I ordered the dark brown.  It comes with two shades so you can blend or just use one of the colors.  It comes with a brush, brow stencil and a few eyebrow tools.  Quick application.  I have very thin wispy brows and the coverage with this product is great.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have very thin almost non-existent eyebrows. I purchased this kit to see if I could fill in the really thin spots and even blend it all over the brow to get a fuller look, and it worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> nice to have more than one color</li>
            <li> This eyebrow powder rocks. I have some empty spots that need filling and this does the trick. Finish it off with a little eyebrow/eyelash gel and your brows will look great all day long</li>
            <li> This is a really cool set!  It has everything you need to make the perfect brow.  Since, I kind of stink at making the proper outline for my brows, the templates have been a Godsend.  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> so much better then a pencil.  Not as harsh as long as you use the right color.  Three to choice from.</li>
            <li> nice product for the price. i use it all the time for a night out, and it does great, and the stencil is nice.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much, it comes with the essentials&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No alergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x60;m so happy.</li>
            <li> Better than most similar products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very think and full eyebrows so i tend to use makeup to fill them in.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using pencils to fill my eyebrows in but i find it doesn&#x27;t look natural enough and doesn&#x27;t stay for 8+ hours at a time.&lt;br /&gt;So I needed something that would define and fill in my brows and last for a whole day. I bought this on a whim and was happy i did. Its a nice set. Although i have no use for the stencils i am happy with the rest of the set!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this! Great colors for brows, applies smooth, stays on all day!</li>
            <li> Received it damaged so I couldnt tell you !</li>
            <li> After getting this yesterday, I tried it and its ok. The instructions could&#x27;ve been better and the brushes are kind of hard to hold on to especially at certain angles. Other than that its a good product that does what it says</li>
            <li> This is amazing. It comes with three stencils and your brows will look so amazing after the first use. Very natural look in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I finally have fuller brows!!!! Absolutely love this product. Will order again for sure. Really not sure of those brows stencils tho.</li>
            <li> This came in three different shades to blend perfectly and applies easily. It lasts all day as long as I use a wax pencil over it. It comes with a little brush, tweezers, applicator and stencils. The stencils were oddly shaped so I have not used them. Overall great product for such a small price!</li>
            <li> I like the eyebrow stencils!</li>
            <li> Gives the perfect eyebrow arch each and every time. In love with this kit!</li>
            <li> Its a great product. Love it</li>
            <li> It is good ! I like :)</li>
