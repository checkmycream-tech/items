    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfectly lined, smokey eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not supposed to, but I use it as an eye liner too and it works awesomely for both eye shadow and eye liner.</li>
            <li>I used the pointed tip to draw a perfect line on the lash line, and then used the fatter part of the applicator to smudge it a bit.</li>
            <li>I found the formula to be very good.</li>
            <li>I did not have great expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never done well with eyeliners and I am REALLY happy with this one.</li>
            <li>, this would be a great product for you.</li>
            <li>fabulous*!!!</li>
            <li>The price is nice as well!</li>
            <li>well if I successfully do a thin/narrow line.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal didn&#x27;t do good with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever</li>
            <li>It did blend out fairly well, but I had to use a blending shadow brush not just my finger.</li>
            <li>Good luck, recommended.</li>
            <li>Yes, I think it is a good value:  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, no tugging, and looks great.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try some more of their eye products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magical!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love it!</li>
            <li>It gives a nice accent to a smoky eye that way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This also has some fallout, so that Q-tip will come in handy in cleaning up some of the powder from your cheeks.  </li>
            <li>It came out nice for me.</li>
            <li>The liner itself lasts all day and it looks nice when I get the width I like.  </li>
            <li>This kind of eye liner is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I absolutley love L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics</li>
            <li>and it did not go on well on top of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I have to stop halfway through applying the line to get more powder on the sponge.</li>
            <li>This is more like an eye crayon than an eye liner.  </li>
            <li>(and I’ve been lining all the way around for more years than I care to count) without looking like a raccoon who’d been punched in the eye.</li>
            <li>stick contains the powder itself in the cap, so each time you use it, more product is dispensed onto the sponge-like applicator tip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better if you prefer a thicker line.  </li>
            <li>I applied at 7 am and most of the product wore off by noon.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>I trust L&#x27;Oreal more than most drug store cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>I like the smokey eyes look, and I have tried many products to achieve it.</li>
            <li>This “eyeliner” is really more of an eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy this in the store and was able to try via Vine.</li>
            <li>This is what bugged me the most:</li>
            <li>so we have more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, this can be a feature or a problem depending.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a longtime fan of L&#x27;Oreal makeup (the Lumi foundation is an all time favorite), so I was very excited to try this.</li>
            <li>the applicator is soft, the color is great, it smudges easily to create a good line and it removes easily.  </li>
            <li>That big tip is cushy and somehow holds the product in it without getting all clumpy.  </li>
            <li>It easily washed off with soap and water at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>its supposed to be easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Infallible Smokissime is supposed to be a “gel-powder” eyeliner with a “precision foam tip for easy application.”</li>
            <li>Easy to apply it automatically</li>
            <li>Does glide on easily.  </li>
            <li>It also comes off easily with the makeup removing wipes I use for taking off eye</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It smudges easily and comes off easily with makeup remover</li>
            <li>No worries, it comes off easily with a swipe of my eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>The color is good and I like the sponginess, but honestly, the applicator is way to big.</li>
            <li>The first use was a very light smudge, but when you put the cap on, there&#x27;s a spring inside that pushes more product (the shadow) to the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But that is fine</li>
            <li>Talk about quick glamour!</li>
            <li>I think it works best with a little eye shadow over it, and followed up by mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the “precision” foam tip is huge.  </li>
            <li>It also skips some, which isn&#x27;t a huge deal, since you have to blend anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ended up using a brush to apply, which kind of defeats the purpose of this whole product.</li>
            <li>Smooth going on and gives eyes a smoky look.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d say to skip this; instead of making a smokey eye quick and easy, it ends up taking longer since you have to clean up the powder</li>
            <li>make.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money!</li>
            <li>It lasted on my oily lids until the end of the night without any creasing or fading, in fact, it looked better than when I first applied</li>
            <li>The powder is very fine and stays on very well once you get it on, that would be the gel-like part</li>
            <li>Each time I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve also had to clean powder from my vanity table since it leaves a bit of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>* liked how this looked - my better half cleans up pretty well (unlike me), and i was quite pleased and most honored to have her beside me on our evening out</li>
            <li>With all the hype about this product, I was super excited to try it</li>
            <li>I love creating smokey eyes, and was eager to try this out since it seemed like it would make a smokey eye much easier to do.  </li>
            <li>tip feels more like an eyeshadow brush than an eyeliner pencil, and I actually really like the size -</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice smoky natural looking line.</li>
            <li>I really like the color of this liner is more like a charcoal.  </li>
            <li>From the illustrations on the product page, it looked like this should be pretty easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The applicator is pretty fat but comes to a fine tip.  </li>
            <li>This is a dark smoky eye make-up; however, for me it is a great alternative to the pencil from L&#x27;Oreal that I have been &amp;#34;smudging&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply, with its large foam tip that is made for smudgetastic smudges.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite eyeliner!  </li>
            <li>but the results are not usually school appropriate.)</li>
            <li>This unassuming little stick is all you need for a great smokey eye.</li>
            <li>So I didn’t feel comfortable using it as a shadow over my whole lid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too old to be able to carry off that raccoon-eyes look, but I do like a smudgy line on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>I am not really crazy about is the applicator.  </li>
            <li>You get a big blob of color instead of a nice tapered line.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re going for the smudged look (and in lieu of the sponge while I was using it), nothing else will create the right effect: not your finger, tissue or cotton ball.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>I really liked it though because it was ONE STEP, without using my loose powder which can get every where.</li>
            <li>It is actually very much like some powdered shadow products.  </li>
            <li>hing First of all, I really like that the application end of this eyeliner is soft and that the eyeliner itself is just right for my hand (easy to hold and manipulate).  </li>
            <li>product is in the cap so once you do one eye you have to put the lid back on to get more product.  </li>
            <li>I managed to line the top of my eyes and get a darker line by the lashes, and a smokier line above it.  </li>
            <li>, I am not a big lower lid liner, or I use a super fine brush to do</li>
            <li>You really need that makeup sponge!</li>
            <li>will most likely &#x27;be used again&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, on my part</li>
            <li>I think we&#x27;d both love the same product with a thinner sponge applicator</li>
            <li>you like heavy eyeliner, the sponge applicator is good for smudging.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this cleans up pretty easily with some makeup removed applied to a Q-tip, but it does make a bit of a mess, even when you use the very tip of the sponge to try to get a fine line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even when going for a thick cat eye on my top lid, I found the tip to be anything but precise, giving me a nice taper on one eye and a big splotch on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just ok, don&#x27;t know how long it would last, it seems like I have to push to get more pigment.</li>
            <li>according to my in-house tester, this eye shadow applied easily, was easy to smudge, but was &#x27;a bit heavier line&#x27; - however, &#x27;it is a bold look&#x27; and a &#x27;soft black&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, and I love L&#x27;Oreal products in general, but this just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>The color is a muted black that&#x27;s really a nice addition to a makeup table.&lt;br /&gt;--  </li>
            <li>The eyeliner goes on very smoothly and smudges easily to create a continuous line -- it is forgiving if you (like me) have a hard time drawing a straight line, BUT, it does get on my lower lid if I close my eye to apply it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like the blendable, longwear formula, but I prefer the control of a brush over this large sponge applicator.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I really like the color.  </li>
            <li>I did not think it came out that intense</li>
            <li>So much easier than blending.</li>
            <li>But it really lingers on.</li>
            <li>so there isn&#x27;t much precision involved.  </li>
            <li>and you will really have to work to get that gap between lid and lash line.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;m not an expert at doing the whole &amp;#34;smoky eye&amp;#34; thing</li>
            <li>The brown, taupe and purple are much easier to work with.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner, but I want to start by mentioning that I&#x27;ve been practicing the application all day.</li>
            <li>If your makeup starts to go light during application, you&#x27;ll want to put the cap back on to reload the pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway - it works really well.</li>
            <li>This product was really disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The thing that really makes this unwearable for me is that because the liner is powder, it &amp;#34;drifts&amp;#34; to the rim of my lower eyelids and from there gets into my eyes.  </li>
            <li>real question is would I purchase this item:  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The color itself goes on smoothly and gets dark quickly, so use a gentle touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect if you want a dark, edgy look.</li>
            <li>I would also highly suggest you use a primer before applying them, it goes on MUCH smoother.</li>
            <li>Also cannot get the product to apply evenly; it deposits more in some areas and less in others.</li>
            <li>I love the pigment of all of them, but I won&#x27;t purchase the black again.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE eyeliner is Urban Decay&#x27;s 24/7, which does last through swimming and working out.</li>
            <li>I can get a medium width line, but it is not as easy to do as with other eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT stay on for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>as other reviewers have noted, the applicator is far too large for any detailed line.</li>
            <li>If I try to line with a fine tip liner instead, yikes, it never goes on evenly, partially because being older (sadly), the skin is a bit more flexible and pulls,so it just never goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It takes quite a bit of practice to get it looking right, and I&#x27;ve been using various eyeliners for ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is very soft and bulbous</li>
            <li>I really like the soft applicator and the ability to control how dark my liner is by simply putting the cap back on (which applies more liner to the spongy applicator!)  </li>
            <li>I was surprised with this product, it looks crazy big to use, but make lining the top of the eyes pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion and usually wear brown eye liner, but I do like the look of this particular black.  </li>
            <li>I think if the applicator were a little smaller it would be easier to have better control.  </li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s huge, and somewhat messy.</li>
            <li>My version of smoky eyes has the smoke effect much narrower towards my inner eyes, and I can&#x27;t do it that way with this sponge liner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This goes on SO MUCH SMOOTHER than a regular pencil liner.  </li>
            <li>It is nearly Infallible.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t too harsh looking.  </li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t use primer or have sensitive eyes don&#x27;t even think about it.</li>
            <li>(My 14 year old loves to play with it</li>
            <li>I had to press down on the eye lid to get any to stick, then put the cap back on to get some more before finally make a go of it.</li>
            <li>Of course, you can add some mascara for some extra spark, but no more lining and smudging, lining and more smudging.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the applicator was a little smaller too, but putting it on with very light, short strokes and then building it up works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very good at applying eyeliner so this was easy for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The black is just too hard to get a good look with.</li>
            <li>applicator is pretty big, and it works great for smoking out the upper eyelid, but, because it&#x27;s so thick, I have a really hard time controlling the look on my lower lash line.  </li>
            <li>Granted the desired effect is a smoky eye, but if you no longer have tight wrinkle free eyelids, or if your eyes have a shape that makes the lids protrude, the fat part of the applicator is going to apply the liner above your lash line</li>
            <li>The eyeliner itself is great, but I have to agree with other reviewers that the sponge applicator is too large and awkward.</li>
            <li>it is much more powdery and messy than i expected.</li>
            <li>smudges although I&#x27;m not so steady handed and use a thin brush to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long these cosmetic &#x27;markers&#x27; last laying around, but on your eyes, for me they are not irritating, greasy, runny, or smudgy.  </li>
            <li>to that, the powder was barely there when I tried putting it on.</li>
            <li>This applicator doesn&#x27;t require a heavy hand at all, so pulls the skin less, making it go on better.  </li>
            <li>Then, once it finally got on (more like heavy black eyeliner), it faded away in an hour.</li>
            <li>so you can make a disaster that is so hard to clean, the tip is not aacurate enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so necessary, it should really come on the other end of the pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sponge tip applicator is bigger than I would have liked, so it&#x27;s difficult to apply evenly especially towards the inner corners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly much easier to do a smokey eye with black shadow and a gel/liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I did NOT use this product on the whole eyelid, just at the lash line and a little smudge.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Infallible Smokissime is supposed to be a “gel-powder” eyeliner with a “precision foam tip for easy application.”</li>
            <li> Easy to apply it automatically</li>
            <li> Does glide on easily.  </li>
            <li> It also comes off easily with the makeup removing wipes I use for taking off eye</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It smudges easily and comes off easily with makeup remover</li>
            <li> No worries, it comes off easily with a swipe of my eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> The color is good and I like the sponginess, but honestly, the applicator is way to big.</li>
            <li> The first use was a very light smudge, but when you put the cap on, there&#x27;s a spring inside that pushes more product (the shadow) to the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But that is fine</li>
            <li> Talk about quick glamour!</li>
            <li> I think it works best with a little eye shadow over it, and followed up by mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the “precision” foam tip is huge.  </li>
            <li> It also skips some, which isn&#x27;t a huge deal, since you have to blend anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up using a brush to apply, which kind of defeats the purpose of this whole product.</li>
            <li> Smooth going on and gives eyes a smoky look.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d say to skip this; instead of making a smokey eye quick and easy, it ends up taking longer since you have to clean up the powder</li>
            <li> make.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> It lasted on my oily lids until the end of the night without any creasing or fading, in fact, it looked better than when I first applied</li>
            <li> The powder is very fine and stays on very well once you get it on, that would be the gel-like part</li>
            <li> Each time I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve also had to clean powder from my vanity table since it leaves a bit of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * liked how this looked - my better half cleans up pretty well (unlike me), and i was quite pleased and most honored to have her beside me on our evening out</li>
            <li> With all the hype about this product, I was super excited to try it</li>
            <li> I love creating smokey eyes, and was eager to try this out since it seemed like it would make a smokey eye much easier to do.  </li>
            <li> tip feels more like an eyeshadow brush than an eyeliner pencil, and I actually really like the size -</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice smoky natural looking line.</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this liner is more like a charcoal.  </li>
            <li> From the illustrations on the product page, it looked like this should be pretty easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The applicator is pretty fat but comes to a fine tip.  </li>
            <li> This is a dark smoky eye make-up; however, for me it is a great alternative to the pencil from L&#x27;Oreal that I have been &amp;#34;smudging&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to apply, with its large foam tip that is made for smudgetastic smudges.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> but the results are not usually school appropriate.)</li>
            <li> This unassuming little stick is all you need for a great smokey eye.</li>
            <li> So I didn’t feel comfortable using it as a shadow over my whole lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old to be able to carry off that raccoon-eyes look, but I do like a smudgy line on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I am not really crazy about is the applicator.  </li>
            <li> You get a big blob of color instead of a nice tapered line.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going for the smudged look (and in lieu of the sponge while I was using it), nothing else will create the right effect: not your finger, tissue or cotton ball.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> I really liked it though because it was ONE STEP, without using my loose powder which can get every where.</li>
            <li> It is actually very much like some powdered shadow products.  </li>
            <li> hing First of all, I really like that the application end of this eyeliner is soft and that the eyeliner itself is just right for my hand (easy to hold and manipulate).  </li>
            <li> product is in the cap so once you do one eye you have to put the lid back on to get more product.  </li>
            <li> I managed to line the top of my eyes and get a darker line by the lashes, and a smokier line above it.  </li>
            <li> , I am not a big lower lid liner, or I use a super fine brush to do</li>
            <li> You really need that makeup sponge!</li>
            <li> will most likely &#x27;be used again&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, on my part</li>
            <li> I think we&#x27;d both love the same product with a thinner sponge applicator</li>
            <li> you like heavy eyeliner, the sponge applicator is good for smudging.</li>
            <li> Luckily, this cleans up pretty easily with some makeup removed applied to a Q-tip, but it does make a bit of a mess, even when you use the very tip of the sponge to try to get a fine line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when going for a thick cat eye on my top lid, I found the tip to be anything but precise, giving me a nice taper on one eye and a big splotch on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just ok, don&#x27;t know how long it would last, it seems like I have to push to get more pigment.</li>
            <li> according to my in-house tester, this eye shadow applied easily, was easy to smudge, but was &#x27;a bit heavier line&#x27; - however, &#x27;it is a bold look&#x27; and a &#x27;soft black&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, and I love L&#x27;Oreal products in general, but this just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> The color is a muted black that&#x27;s really a nice addition to a makeup table.&lt;br /&gt;--  </li>
            <li> The eyeliner goes on very smoothly and smudges easily to create a continuous line -- it is forgiving if you (like me) have a hard time drawing a straight line, BUT, it does get on my lower lid if I close my eye to apply it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like the blendable, longwear formula, but I prefer the control of a brush over this large sponge applicator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I really like the color.  </li>
            <li> I did not think it came out that intense</li>
            <li> So much easier than blending.</li>
            <li> But it really lingers on.</li>
            <li> so there isn&#x27;t much precision involved.  </li>
            <li> and you will really have to work to get that gap between lid and lash line.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m not an expert at doing the whole &amp;#34;smoky eye&amp;#34; thing</li>
            <li> The brown, taupe and purple are much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner, but I want to start by mentioning that I&#x27;ve been practicing the application all day.</li>
            <li> If your makeup starts to go light during application, you&#x27;ll want to put the cap back on to reload the pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway - it works really well.</li>
            <li> This product was really disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing that really makes this unwearable for me is that because the liner is powder, it &amp;#34;drifts&amp;#34; to the rim of my lower eyelids and from there gets into my eyes.  </li>
            <li> real question is would I purchase this item:  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The color itself goes on smoothly and gets dark quickly, so use a gentle touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect if you want a dark, edgy look.</li>
            <li> I would also highly suggest you use a primer before applying them, it goes on MUCH smoother.</li>
            <li> Also cannot get the product to apply evenly; it deposits more in some areas and less in others.</li>
            <li> I love the pigment of all of them, but I won&#x27;t purchase the black again.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE eyeliner is Urban Decay&#x27;s 24/7, which does last through swimming and working out.</li>
            <li> I can get a medium width line, but it is not as easy to do as with other eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT stay on for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> as other reviewers have noted, the applicator is far too large for any detailed line.</li>
            <li> If I try to line with a fine tip liner instead, yikes, it never goes on evenly, partially because being older (sadly), the skin is a bit more flexible and pulls,so it just never goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It takes quite a bit of practice to get it looking right, and I&#x27;ve been using various eyeliners for ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is very soft and bulbous</li>
            <li> I really like the soft applicator and the ability to control how dark my liner is by simply putting the cap back on (which applies more liner to the spongy applicator!)  </li>
            <li> I was surprised with this product, it looks crazy big to use, but make lining the top of the eyes pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion and usually wear brown eye liner, but I do like the look of this particular black.  </li>
            <li> I think if the applicator were a little smaller it would be easier to have better control.  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s huge, and somewhat messy.</li>
            <li> My version of smoky eyes has the smoke effect much narrower towards my inner eyes, and I can&#x27;t do it that way with this sponge liner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This goes on SO MUCH SMOOTHER than a regular pencil liner.  </li>
            <li> It is nearly Infallible.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t too harsh looking.  </li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t use primer or have sensitive eyes don&#x27;t even think about it.</li>
            <li> (My 14 year old loves to play with it</li>
            <li> I had to press down on the eye lid to get any to stick, then put the cap back on to get some more before finally make a go of it.</li>
            <li> Of course, you can add some mascara for some extra spark, but no more lining and smudging, lining and more smudging.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the applicator was a little smaller too, but putting it on with very light, short strokes and then building it up works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at applying eyeliner so this was easy for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The black is just too hard to get a good look with.</li>
            <li> applicator is pretty big, and it works great for smoking out the upper eyelid, but, because it&#x27;s so thick, I have a really hard time controlling the look on my lower lash line.  </li>
            <li> Granted the desired effect is a smoky eye, but if you no longer have tight wrinkle free eyelids, or if your eyes have a shape that makes the lids protrude, the fat part of the applicator is going to apply the liner above your lash line</li>
            <li> The eyeliner itself is great, but I have to agree with other reviewers that the sponge applicator is too large and awkward.</li>
            <li> it is much more powdery and messy than i expected.</li>
            <li> smudges although I&#x27;m not so steady handed and use a thin brush to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long these cosmetic &#x27;markers&#x27; last laying around, but on your eyes, for me they are not irritating, greasy, runny, or smudgy.  </li>
            <li> to that, the powder was barely there when I tried putting it on.</li>
            <li> This applicator doesn&#x27;t require a heavy hand at all, so pulls the skin less, making it go on better.  </li>
            <li> Then, once it finally got on (more like heavy black eyeliner), it faded away in an hour.</li>
            <li> so you can make a disaster that is so hard to clean, the tip is not aacurate enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so necessary, it should really come on the other end of the pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sponge tip applicator is bigger than I would have liked, so it&#x27;s difficult to apply evenly especially towards the inner corners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly much easier to do a smokey eye with black shadow and a gel/liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I did NOT use this product on the whole eyelid, just at the lash line and a little smudge.</li>
            <li> It is a muted, smokey black, not harsh at all, not like liquid liners can be.  </li>
            <li> The fine part of the tip is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> is thinking about purchasing......don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Tip is huge and sloppy line not like the other eyeliner they</li>
            <li> It put on way too much product, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> The pen is simply too thick to be accurate - at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not think it lasted for 14 hours, by the end of a long night it was noticeably lighter.</li>
            <li> It lasts 14 hours as long as you&#x27;re not swimming or working out.  </li>
            <li> The powder is in the cap and the long part is just an applicator with a sponge tip.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured that applying the eyeliner with that broad tip would make me look like a 4 year old put liner on me with a crayon in their weak hand.  </li>
            <li> just enough black around the eyes to make me look like a punch-drunk boxer.</li>
            <li> the price, this product is alright, but I think that using regular eye shadow is easier to use and gets the same effect with a lot less mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge and I and my daughter found it awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> And even still, a few hours later I&#x27;ve got a transfer mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall opinion is that this is for a heavy smoked eye with a medium-dark tone eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> I like the wide spongy applicator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too rounded to try a narrow line just above my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> So, loved the color, the texture and staying power but hated the applicator.</li>
            <li> I found myself reaching automatically for the other eye, only to see that little or nothing</li>
            <li> Because of the shape of the applicator it is hard to get it into the inner corner of the eye without making a big mess of things.</li>
            <li> As it is, it&#x27;s not great for this older mom.  </li>
            <li> I would buy the other colors.</li>
            <li> I can use it on just the extreme outer corners of my eye and then lining over it.  </li>
            <li> I put it on the inside part of my eye above the lower lash, and it stays put - not sure if I cry.  </li>
            <li> The powder is in the cap and the applicator wand is on the other part of this pen.</li>
            <li> Although the applicator has a tip on it, it expands out quickly to a really wide, rounded section and that is why it’s hard to use at the inner eye section.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The second application was very heavy because it was loaded with shadow, so it comes out dark.</li>
            <li> The tip of this pencil is hardly a &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; being that it&#x27;s enormous.  </li>
            <li> The product, once on, doesn&#x27;t last very long without adding some primer as a base first.</li>
            <li> only way I can use this eyeliner at all is to apply a thick line and then use a cotton swab dipped in eye makeup remover to erase the bottom half of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the reality is that there&#x27;s a learning curve when you&#x27;ve previously used a pencil and shadow + brush combo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The “gel-powder” formula has a slight greasy feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a black eye look, and not a sultry look.  </li>
            <li> Black Smoke color is a soft black, so if you blend it out, you can make the look less dramatic.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll buy all but the black again.</li>
            <li> The pen is a bit thick and difficult to hold to make the right lines.</li>
            <li> In the past I have not liked the durability of felt tip type liners, but this one is different.  </li>
            <li> , I had to do a few layers</li>
            <li> Have tried this a few times</li>
            <li> My skin is rather pale now in the winter</li>
            <li> it is not easy to apply and it spread all over the lid easely</li>
            <li> This product goes on thick and dark.</li>
            <li> One little swoop and voila!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big and bulky for me, making it difficult to find a middle ground a thin line and a thick smudge.  </li>
            <li> Well, it really wasn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what delivery system L&#x27;Oreal is using, but it isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This eyeliner tip was a lot thicker than I expected - my bad, because it actually looks just like the picture - for some reason I just THOUGHT it would be thin.</li>
            <li> Even on the lid it was way too thick.</li>
            <li> Back then it was done with a black eyeliner from Eckerds, and you would apply it and use your fingers to smudge the crap out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> (Not a good look.)</li>
            <li> Because it was so dusty and flaky, it irritated my eyes</li>
            <li> Then if you run too hard it looks bad</li>
            <li> So, for my tastes and needs, it is the wrong</li>
            <li> I failed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price for that is transfer to my lid from the line of the eye.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all, these aren&#x27;t that bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutley love L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Smokissime Eyeliner! Talk about quick glamour! This unassuming little stick is all you need for a great smokey eye. One little swoop and voila! You&#x27;re done! Perfectly lined, smokey eyes. Of course, you can add some mascara for some extra spark, but no more lining and smudging, lining and more smudging.  And it lasts! I was getting compliments all day! It easily washed off with soap and water at the end of the day. The price is nice as well! Can&#x27;t wait to try some more of their eye products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old to be able to carry off that raccoon-eyes look, but I do like a smudgy line on my eyelids.  From the illustrations on the product page, it looked like this should be pretty easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I really like the color.  It is a muted, smokey black, not harsh at all, not like liquid liners can be.  It stays well, not like \\&quot;crayon\\&quot; liners.  In fact it stays so well that it takes some effort to remove when the time comes, whether I use soap and water (tested it on my wrist, not my eyelids) or eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem for me is the applicator.  I can get a medium width line, but it is not as easy to do as with other eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried.  If I do try to smudge it a bit, it doesn&#x27;t smudge as I&#x27;d like and goes where I don&#x27;t want.  It takes quite a bit of practice to get it looking right, and I&#x27;ve been using various eyeliners for ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try the raccoon eyes look, like on the product page, just to see how well it would work even though the look is not for me.  The problem here is that the product does not go on evenly, so the look is inconsistent. So, for my tastes and needs, it is the wrong eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging says \\&quot;Infallible\\&quot; and \\&quot;NEVER FAIL.\\&quot;  I failed.</li>
            <li> I know how to wear a smoky eye, I have been perfecting it for 20 something years. Back then it was done with a black eyeliner from Eckerds, and you would apply it and use your fingers to smudge the crap out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Smokissime Eyeliner is made just for the smoky look. The gel formula is supposed to last up to 14 hours...its supposed to be easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply, with its large foam tip that is made for smudgetastic smudges. I did not think it came out that intense, I had to do a few layers and it did not go on well on top of eyeshadow. I did not think it lasted for 14 hours, by the end of a long night it was noticeably lighter. I really liked it though because it was ONE STEP, without using my loose powder which can get every where. I would buy the other colors.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal didn&#x27;t do good with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever is thinking about purchasing......don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Tip is huge and sloppy line not like the other eyeliner they make.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money!😢</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not supposed to, but I use it as an eye liner too and it works awesomely for both eye shadow and eye liner. So much easier than blending.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite eyeliner!  I really like the soft applicator and the ability to control how dark my liner is by simply putting the cap back on (which applies more liner to the spongy applicator!)  It lasts 14 hours as long as you&#x27;re not swimming or working out.  It is not waterproof.  My FAVORITE eyeliner is Urban Decay&#x27;s 24/7, which does last through swimming and working out.</li>
            <li> Infallible isn&#x27;t quite the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I am especially challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the reality is that there&#x27;s a learning curve when you&#x27;ve previously used a pencil and shadow + brush combo.  The tip of this pencil is hardly a &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; being that it&#x27;s enormous.  And it&#x27;s a sponge, not a pencil that can be sharpened back to a point.  My version of smoky eyes has the smoke effect much narrower towards my inner eyes, and I can&#x27;t do it that way with this sponge liner.  I can, but it involves erasing with a Q-Tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on SO MUCH SMOOTHER than a regular pencil liner.  The shadow/gel is kept in the lid.  Unfortunately, the price for that is transfer to my lid from the line of the eye.  So I have needed to overdo the shadow.  And even still, a few hours later I&#x27;ve got a transfer mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall opinion is that this is for a heavy smoked eye with a medium-dark tone eye shadow.  So this is not for regular eyeryday use for everyone.  But I&#x27;ll keep it and pack it away with my night-time makeups.</li>
            <li> Have tried this a few times and I&#x27;ve used eyeliner for years, but, as other reviewers have noted, the applicator is far too large for any detailed line. Also cannot get the product to apply evenly; it deposits more in some areas and less in others. I have to stop halfway through applying the line to get more powder on the sponge. Not sure what delivery system L&#x27;Oreal is using, but it isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I can use this eyeliner at all is to apply a thick line and then use a cotton swab dipped in eye makeup remover to erase the bottom half of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like heavy eyeliner, the sponge applicator is good for smudging. Maybe on the upper lid . . . or on the lower if you&#x27;re into Goth. Nothing &amp;#34;infallible&amp;#34; about this!!!</li>
            <li> Infallible Smokissime is supposed to be a “gel-powder” eyeliner with a “precision foam tip for easy application.” I didn’t find that to be the case, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the “precision” foam tip is huge.  This is more like an eye crayon than an eye liner.  I couldn’t line my bottom lid at all (and I’ve been lining all the way around for more years than I care to count) without looking like a raccoon who’d been punched in the eye. Even when going for a thick cat eye on my top lid, I found the tip to be anything but precise, giving me a nice taper on one eye and a big splotch on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is in the cap so once you do one eye you have to put the lid back on to get more product.  This felt clunky to me.  Anyone who uses pencil eyeliners isn’t used to the extra step.  I found myself reaching automatically for the other eye, only to see that little or nothing was getting applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The “gel-powder” formula has a slight greasy feel to it.  So I didn’t feel comfortable using it as a shadow over my whole lid. I can use it on just the extreme outer corners of my eye and then lining over it.  It gives a nice accent to a smoky eye that way.  I won’t get the product again, but this gives me a way to use what’s left.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover well. Then if you run too hard it looks bad</li>
            <li> it is much more powdery and messy than i expected.</li>
            <li> The easiest eyeliner in the world to use! Easy to apply it automatically smudges although I&#x27;m not so steady handed and use a thin brush to smooth it out. It&#x27;s magical!</li>
            <li> it is not easy to apply and it spread all over the lid easely so you can make a disaster that is so hard to clean, the tip is not aacurate enough. But it really lingers on.</li>
            <li> no problems with this product</li>
            <li> I did not have great expectations for this product.  I figured that applying the eyeliner with that broad tip would make me look like a 4 year old put liner on me with a crayon in their weak hand.  Well, it really wasn&#x27;t bad.  That big tip is cushy and somehow holds the product in it without getting all clumpy.  I managed to line the top of my eyes and get a darker line by the lashes, and a smokier line above it.  If I try to line with a fine tip liner instead, yikes, it never goes on evenly, partially because being older (sadly), the skin is a bit more flexible and pulls,so it just never goes on smoothly.  This applicator doesn&#x27;t require a heavy hand at all, so pulls the skin less, making it go on better.  Now, as for the lower lash line.  Forget it.  It put on way too much product, at least for me.  Gives me a black eye look, and not a sultry look.  But that is fine, I am not a big lower lid liner, or I use a super fine brush to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was surprised with this product, it looks crazy big to use, but make lining the top of the eyes pretty easy. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love creating smokey eyes, and was eager to try this out since it seemed like it would make a smokey eye much easier to do.  However, I&#x27;d say to skip this; instead of making a smokey eye quick and easy, it ends up taking longer since you have to clean up the powder left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick contains the powder itself in the cap, so each time you use it, more product is dispensed onto the sponge-like applicator tip.  Not enough comes out to do two eyes, so I&#x27;ve found that I have to re-load the product by screwing it back into the cap to do my second eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is pretty big, and it works great for smoking out the upper eyelid, but, because it&#x27;s so thick, I have a really hard time controlling the look on my lower lash line.  Luckily, this cleans up pretty easily with some makeup removed applied to a Q-tip, but it does make a bit of a mess, even when you use the very tip of the sponge to try to get a fine line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also has some fallout, so that Q-tip will come in handy in cleaning up some of the powder from your cheeks.  Each time I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve also had to clean powder from my vanity table since it leaves a bit of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this product is alright, but I think that using regular eye shadow is easier to use and gets the same effect with a lot less mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime fan of L&#x27;Oreal makeup (the Lumi foundation is an all time favorite), so I was very excited to try this. I found the formula to be very good. It lasted on my oily lids until the end of the night without any creasing or fading, in fact, it looked better than when I first applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Black Smoke color is a soft black, so if you blend it out, you can make the look less dramatic. It did blend out fairly well, but I had to use a blending shadow brush not just my finger. The sponge tip applicator is bigger than I would have liked, so it&#x27;s difficult to apply evenly especially towards the inner corners. It also skips some, which isn&#x27;t a huge deal, since you have to blend anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like the blendable, longwear formula, but I prefer the control of a brush over this large sponge applicator.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings on this, maybe because it wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;innovative&amp;#34; as it sounded.  It is actually very much like some powdered shadow products.  The powder is in the cap and the long part is just an applicator with a sponge tip.  The powder is very fine and stays on very well once you get it on, that would be the gel-like part I guess.  The applicator is pretty fat but comes to a fine tip.  Unfortunately it is very soft and bulbous so there isn&#x27;t much precision involved.  Granted the desired effect is a smoky eye, but if you no longer have tight wrinkle free eyelids, or if your eyes have a shape that makes the lids protrude, the fat part of the applicator is going to apply the liner above your lash line and you will really have to work to get that gap between lid and lash line.  I ended up using a brush to apply, which kind of defeats the purpose of this whole product. So, loved the color, the texture and staying power but hated the applicator.</li>
            <li> Steep learning curve on this product. Granted, I&#x27;m not an expert at doing the whole &amp;#34;smoky eye&amp;#34; thing so I was hopeful that this applicator would help. Well, it&#x27;s huge, and somewhat messy. The product, once on, doesn&#x27;t last very long without adding some primer as a base first. I really wanted to like this, and I love L&#x27;Oreal products in general, but this just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> The fine part of the tip is difficult to use.  It&#x27;s better if you prefer a thicker line.  Does glide on easily.  I applied at 7 am and most of the product wore off by noon.</li>
            <li> Smooth going on and gives eyes a smoky look. will purchase again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long these cosmetic &#x27;markers&#x27; last laying around, but on your eyes, for me they are not irritating, greasy, runny, or smudgy.  I love L&#x27;Oreal.  This is a dark smoky eye make-up; however, for me it is a great alternative to the pencil from L&#x27;Oreal that I have been &amp;#34;smudging&amp;#34;.  I put it on the inside part of my eye above the lower lash, and it stays put - not sure if I cry.  It is nearly Infallible.  If you like a thinner line below your bottom lashes, you have a point to dot on a bit of color.  I trust L&#x27;Oreal more than most drug store cosmetics.  They have pigment, and I know how to control it.  After having it on for several hours, I find that I still have bedroom eyes.  In the past I have not liked the durability of felt tip type liners, but this one is different.  Good luck, recommended.</li>
            <li> With all the hype about this product, I was super excited to try it and I bought one in each color. I love the pigment of all of them, but I won&#x27;t purchase the black again. It&#x27;s honestly much easier to do a smokey eye with black shadow and a gel/liquid eyeliner. The black is just too hard to get a good look with. The brown, taupe and purple are much easier to work with. All of them do have some fall out though, so I would suggest you do your face after you have done your eyes. I would also highly suggest you use a primer before applying them, it goes on MUCH smoother. All of them lasted 5-6 hours before they needed to be touched up. I do wish the applicator was a little smaller too, but putting it on with very light, short strokes and then building it up works well. All-in-all, these aren&#x27;t that bad and I&#x27;ll buy all but the black again.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner, but I want to start by mentioning that I&#x27;ve been practicing the application all day. The first use was a very light smudge, but when you put the cap on, there&#x27;s a spring inside that pushes more product (the shadow) to the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second application was very heavy because it was loaded with shadow, so it comes out dark. If your makeup starts to go light during application, you&#x27;ll want to put the cap back on to reload the pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip feels more like an eyeshadow brush than an eyeliner pencil, and I actually really like the size - it&#x27;s perfect if you want a dark, edgy look. (That&#x27;s the point of this pencil - a smoky eye.) I take a star off for ease of application (it definitely takes some getting used to) and lack of makeup sponge. It&#x27;s so necessary, it should really come on the other end of the pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re going for the smudged look (and in lieu of the sponge while I was using it), nothing else will create the right effect: not your finger, tissue or cotton ball. You really need that makeup sponge! Otherwise, I love it!</li>
            <li> The eyeliner itself is great, but I have to agree with other reviewers that the sponge applicator is too large and awkward.</li>
            <li> There are things I like about this L&#x27;Oreal eyeliner, and things I don&#x27;t.  I do like the eyeliner itself.  It goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t too harsh looking.  I have a fair complexion and usually wear brown eye liner, but I do like the look of this particular black.  It&#x27;s soft and goes on easily.  It also comes off easily with the makeup removing wipes I use for taking off eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am not really crazy about is the applicator.  It&#x27;s too big and bulky for me, making it difficult to find a middle ground a thin line and a thick smudge.  I think if the applicator were a little smaller it would be easier to have better control.  I will definitely use this eyeliner regularly, but without trying to create a smokey look with the rounded part of the applicator.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner tip was a lot thicker than I expected - my bad, because it actually looks just like the picture - for some reason I just THOUGHT it would be thin. Anyway - it works really well. It leaves a nice smoky natural looking line. I&#x27;ve never done well with eyeliners and I am REALLY happy with this one. Very easy to apply, no tugging, and looks great.</li>
            <li> I like the smokey eyes look, and I have tried many products to achieve it. This kind of eye liner is easy to use. I used the pointed tip to draw a perfect line on the lash line, and then used the fatter part of the applicator to smudge it a bit. Then I used eye shadow over that. I did NOT use this product on the whole eyelid, just at the lash line and a little smudge. I think it works best with a little eye shadow over it, and followed up by mascara. It came out nice for me.</li>
            <li> according to my in-house tester, this eye shadow applied easily, was easy to smudge, but was &#x27;a bit heavier line&#x27; - however, &#x27;it is a bold look&#x27; and a &#x27;soft black&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and will most likely &#x27;be used again&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, on my part - *i* liked how this looked - my better half cleans up pretty well (unlike me), and i was quite pleased and most honored to have her beside me on our evening out - she looked *fabulous*!!!</li>
            <li> The color is good and I like the sponginess, but honestly, the applicator is way to big. I put it on yesterday and I looked like I was joining the goth subculture. Even on the lid it was way too thick. I think this has potential, but they need to work on the design.</li>
            <li> This “eyeliner” is really more of an eyeshadow. It is a powder formulation. The powder is in the cap and the applicator wand is on the other part of this pen. This product goes on thick and dark. It takes some practice to get used to using it. Because of the shape of the applicator it is hard to get it into the inner corner of the eye without making a big mess of things. You get a big blob of color instead of a nice tapered line. Although the applicator has a tip on it, it expands out quickly to a really wide, rounded section and that is why it’s hard to use at the inner eye section. In any case, practice, practice, practice.&lt;br /&gt;The color itself goes on smoothly and gets dark quickly, so use a gentle touch.&lt;br /&gt;The color stays put all day. It comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This product was really disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I tried following the instructions for smoky eye. It didn&#x27;t work out so well. The pen is a bit thick and difficult to hold to make the right lines. The pen is simply too thick to be accurate - at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that, the powder was barely there when I tried putting it on. I had to press down on the eye lid to get any to stick, then put the cap back on to get some more before finally make a go of it. Then, once it finally got on (more like heavy black eyeliner), it faded away in an hour. That is not an exaggeration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy this in the store and was able to try via Vine.</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;- I like the wide spongy applicator. I&#x27;m not very good at applying eyeliner so this was easy for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;- It smudges easily and comes off easily with makeup remover wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- This is what bugged me the most: It does NOT stay on for more than a few hours. It&#x27;s powder but different than eye shadow so that for some reason it doesn&#x27;t stick. By lunch time there&#x27;s no makeup on but just enough black around the eyes to make me look like a punch-drunk boxer. (Not a good look.) As others have said, try it if you already have primer.&lt;br /&gt;- Because it was so dusty and flaky, it irritated my eyes A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;- Kinda weird to dip the applicator in the lid to get more powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;If you already use primer and you like the smoky eye look, this would be a great product for you. However, if you don&#x27;t use primer or have sensitive eyes don&#x27;t even think about it.</li>
            <li> This L&#x27;Oreal SMOKISSIME EYELINER comes in a thinner tube that&#x27;s a convenient size. That said, what isn&#x27;t convenient is the applicator tip.  It&#x27;s huge and I and my daughter found it awkward to use.  I think we&#x27;d both love the same product with a thinner sponge applicator so we have more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The color is a muted black that&#x27;s really a nice addition to a makeup table.&lt;br /&gt;--  Is not waterproof.  In fact it comes off with water rather nicely.&lt;br /&gt;-- Smudges well.  Okay, this can be a feature or a problem depending.  But my daughter and I see it as a feature.  It stays put unless you &#x27;push&#x27; it around.&lt;br /&gt;-- Long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m neutral on this eyeliner.  If it came with a smaller sponge applicator I would buy it again.  As it is, it&#x27;s not great for this older mom.  (My 14 year old loves to play with it but the results are not usually school appropriate.)</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this liner is more like a charcoal.  My skin is rather pale now in the winter so this eyeliner works well if I successfully do a thin/narrow line.  The applicator is almost like a spongy pea with a point at the end.  It&#x27;s too rounded to try a narrow line just above my eyelashes.  The liner itself lasts all day and it looks nice when I get the width I like.  Just ok, don&#x27;t know how long it would last, it seems like I have to push to get more pigment.</li>
            <li> I got the eyeliner several days ago and have been &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; with it every morning since. hing First of all, I really like that the application end of this eyeliner is soft and that the eyeliner itself is just right for my hand (easy to hold and manipulate).  The eyeliner goes on very smoothly and smudges easily to create a continuous line -- it is forgiving if you (like me) have a hard time drawing a straight line, BUT, it does get on my lower lid if I close my eye to apply it. No worries, it comes off easily with a swipe of my eye makeup remover.  The thing that really makes this unwearable for me is that because the liner is powder, it &amp;#34;drifts&amp;#34; to the rim of my lower eyelids and from there gets into my eyes.  My advice:  I think if I applied a primer before applying the eyeliner it would stay put, so that&#x27;s my next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real question is would I purchase this item:  Yes, I think it is a good value:  the applicator is soft, the color is great, it smudges easily to create a good line and it removes easily.  If you are taking the time to apply eye makeup (including primer) every day, this will work for you.</li>
