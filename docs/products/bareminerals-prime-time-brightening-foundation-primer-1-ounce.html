            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>Excellent alone or with foundation.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>I thought because it cost the most, it would be the best</li>
            <li>Helps make-up stay put and can even be worn alone for a nice glow plus sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I like this primer because it provides a good surface for my foundation.</li>
            <li>LOVE It!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It is a nice product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>the consistency is nice.  </li>
            <li>Primer Bare Escentuals is non-greasy and, as an added bonus, my hands feel like silk too after applying this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Works great and really smoothes over the skin!</li>
            <li>and I took the top off.</li>
            <li>I use prime time without the color in it and love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and she said she would try it and see if it worked better for her.</li>
            <li>I love the BE products and use them exclusively.  </li>
            <li>I took the top off and stirred the contents of the bottle with the spray/pump attached to the lid.  </li>
            <li>It has pumped out a better consistency since I stirred it up.  </li>
            <li>my foundation looks a lot better.  </li>
            <li>They are sending me another one at no charge, hopefully it&#x27;s better and comes from a batch that isn&#x27;t defective.</li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>This is the best primer I have personally used.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>i like it a lot and will order more when its used up</li>
            <li>The sparkles in it don&#x27;t seem to do anything, but I love it because of its texture and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and cause acne.</li>
            <li>I shook some more, and the tube in the container acts as a mixer when I shake it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice and light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>The tone in the primer might look dark when it comes out of the pump but when on the skin it blends perfectly and makes the skin feel healthy!</li>
            <li>I liked the brilliance of it and it goes on easy and light.</li>
            <li>it squeezes out in perfect little gobs out of the pump and feels nice on your skin.</li>
            <li>I will stick to the original from now on!</li>
            <li>Nicely shipped and processed quickly.</li>
            <li>It feels silky (not oily) and is perfect for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>this is a great product at a great price its hard to find at times so love being able to get it soon</li>
            <li>It is not the best for anti-aging (not that it claims to be) - but this product in particular is cost effective and definitely improves the look of any makeup you apply thereafter.</li>
            <li>So Easy</li>
            <li>It is a great primer for use with Bare Minerals powder.</li>
            <li>However, I received a sample of product when I was looking for something to keep makeup from settling into my fine lines (Im in my 40&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>I tried the Bare Minerals original primer, and it feels great in your hands, but once I put it on my face</li>
            <li>has a light gold brightner ...</li>
            <li>Both parts are wonderfully smooth and silky, by the way.  </li>
            <li>Great sheer feeling/touch.</li>
            <li>Apply after moisturizer; beautifully light and glides on.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>Chalk this up as a loss, and hope and pray they keep making the original prime time.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this and the original primer for a couple years</li>
            <li>I just started online shopping and have been very pleased with my experiences thus far.</li>
            <li>This primer is lightweight and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Came very fast!</li>
            <li>so I rarely do touch ups.</li>
            <li>Glides right onto my face.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product to use before applying your Bare Mineral make up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been more dissapointed in a Bare Escentuals product...</li>
            <li>, it is a little different than the normal primer, and I think I like the normal primer better just by preference, but this product is great!</li>
            <li>And, as always, ordering thru Amazon is super fast and cheaper.</li>
            <li>when you first use it, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>remember to shake it the first use, it does settle.</li>
            <li>First...</li>
            <li>at first, i thought it was probably just me and stress, however i have good skin, and my face usually doesnt break out.</li>
            <li>A more than half full bottle should not be cakey like that.</li>
            <li>I was having trouble getting some out of more than 1/2 full bottle</li>
            <li>Just feels like a greasier, and yet very watered-down version with sparkles thrown in to make it seem &#x27;new and exciting&#x27;.    </li>
            <li>It Really Helps To Hide Large Pores...</li>
            <li>I am an absolute believer in primer</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t seem to mix together very well in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It holds their foundation really well too - it&#x27;ll stay on all day when I used this primer.</li>
            <li>I felt very itchy.</li>
            <li>I was able to squeeze some of it out to put in an empty makeup jar</li>
            <li>This really does seem to brighten.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any difference from the original except that the size is smaller.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it seems a bit unstable and instantly gets runny if it&#x27;s not kept cool.</li>
            <li>(I love these little jars-they are miniatures of the eyeshadow containers</li>
            <li>This product came fast, I think two days, and was exactly what I had viewed online and even went back to the manufacturers website to confirm.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I can see where a young person would think it &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; but for older skin it adds a bit of needed glow.  </li>
            <li>Upon first use, it shot out watery tannish-colored fluid.  </li>
            <li>This was a complete lie, because it helped keep my foundation on longer, but putting it on my bare face, and leaving it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>After about a week, her face began to break out also, and mine began to clear up as i stopped using it.</li>
            <li>however, since the beginning, i didn&#x27;t really notice the difference between using regular primer, and this \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; primer which the saleslady said \\&quot;brightens up your face\\&quot; and works</li>
            <li>that gives  a soft glow .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took off the top and all I could see was thick, gooey globby.  </li>
            <li>I drove out to the Bare Escentuals store today to look at the new cream concealers and</li>
            <li>first clue should have been when the sales rep pumped hers out onto her finger, it splattered all over her clothes (so lucky it missed mine) and made a really big mess!  </li>
            <li>I will stick to the regular Prime Time, which I have used for about a year and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>, its thin application doesn&#x27;t leave my skin soft or silky and I really don&#x27;t see any significant effect from the sparkles in this greasy-feeling product.  </li>
            <li>Bought it by mistake, but glad I did as it has the same feel of regular Prime Time but gives face a little extra coverage.</li>
            <li>This stuff is must have for those of us that use the bare minerals foundation powder.</li>
            <li>I agree that it&#x27;s disappointing but the product is so awesome that I hardly care about that.</li>
            <li>This is honestly a terrible product, and if you want to buy a good primer buy the original.</li>
            <li>I love everything Bare Minerals and this is the first time I have been disappointed.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and do have to agree that this product&#x27;s major downfall is that the consistency needs to be fixed somehow.</li>

            <li> I read the other reviews and do have to agree that this product&#x27;s major downfall is that the consistency needs to be fixed somehow.</li>
            <li> I have used the most expensive primers and also the other bare minerals primer without the brightening element.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle illuminating effect, but it does try out some patches on my face right after application.</li>
            <li> I got mine home, opened it and pushed down on the pump, and all I got was the clear oily ingredient.  </li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals has improved it over the last few years but they still need to fix it.</li>
            <li> Noticed my Bare Minerals foundation sticks onto my face (meaning, I use less product).</li>
            <li> I love my BE, don&#x27;t get me wrong!    </li>
            <li> This product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps give a smooth base prior to application of any foundation.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals store takes 45 minutes to get there in heavy traffic and frankly, not worth my time or gas to return it, so I will use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other primers and like them, and I like the silkiness of this primer.  </li>
            <li> what used to be perfect little gobs becomes runny, and glittery liquid on your hand which made me extremely angry because personally, i use makeup mostly everyday, and a primer going bad after 1 week of use obviously made me really angry.     </li>
            <li> after 4-5 uses, and when i say uses i mean just simply pumping out the primer, it begins to become extremely watery and splatters all over your hand.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the bottle is too small.</li>
            <li> In all that thickness, no way will I ever see that little tube again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for quite a few years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  </li>
            <li> Gives makeup a little boost!  </li>
            <li> That was one of the first things that angered me about this product.    </li>
            <li> I am giving it 5 stars because of how unbelievably well it works, but they do still need to fix its consistency.</li>
            <li> this was a common problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not have a skin reaction but it felt like my skin did not want this thick primer on my face.</li>
            <li> It seems like there are two parts to this primer, the thin watery part</li>
            <li> This product causes irritation to my eyes and I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> but i was completely wrong.     </li>
            <li> lastly, this primer made my face break out TERRIBLY.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using a primer.  </li>
            <li> BE needs to know how flawed this design is</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love my BE, don&#x27;t get me wrong!    For those of you who have used regular Prime Time, this product is NOTHING like it.  It is so watery, with every pump it splats all over hands and clothes, its thin application doesn&#x27;t leave my skin soft or silky and I really don&#x27;t see any significant effect from the sparkles in this greasy-feeling product.  Just feels like a greasier, and yet very watered-down version with sparkles thrown in to make it seem &#x27;new and exciting&#x27;.    Sigh.  Chalk this up as a loss, and hope and pray they keep making the original prime time.  Which I want to get back in my makeup bag as soon as I can afford to.</li>
            <li> I love everything Bare Minerals and this is the first time I have been disappointed. I was having trouble getting some out of more than 1/2 full bottle and I took the top off. It was gross - all cakey, not liquid that would go through the spout. When I touched it is did melt into a spreadable product but it should not be that way. A more than half full bottle should not be cakey like that. I will stick to the original from now on! This was not a product for me.</li>
            <li> I use prime time without the color in it and love it. This product causes irritation to my eyes and I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this and the original primer for a couple years and I love it. Occasionally I get a defective bottle but I just open the lid to put it on a make up sponge. This stuff is must have for those of us that use the bare minerals foundation powder. LOVE It!</li>
            <li> I just started online shopping and have been very pleased with my experiences thus far. This product came fast, I think two days, and was exactly what I had viewed online and even went back to the manufacturers website to confirm. I like the brightener, it is a little different than the normal primer, and I think I like the normal primer better just by preference, but this product is great!</li>
            <li> this is a great product at a great price its hard to find at times so love being able to get it soon</li>
            <li> please please PLEASE take this advice from me. i&#x27;m a teenager and buy makeup and primers 24/7 like there is no tomorrow. out of all the primers i have, this one has been the most expensive. I thought because it cost the most, it would be the best but i was completely wrong.     when you first use it, it works pretty well. it squeezes out in perfect little gobs out of the pump and feels nice on your skin. however, since the beginning, i didn&#x27;t really notice the difference between using regular primer, and this \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; primer which the saleslady said \\&quot;brightens up your face\\&quot; and works so well you don&#x27;t have makeup. This was a complete lie, because it helped keep my foundation on longer, but putting it on my bare face, and leaving it did absolutely nothing. That was one of the first things that angered me about this product.    after 4-5 uses, and when i say uses i mean just simply pumping out the primer, it begins to become extremely watery and splatters all over your hand. what used to be perfect little gobs becomes runny, and glittery liquid on your hand which made me extremely angry because personally, i use makeup mostly everyday, and a primer going bad after 1 week of use obviously made me really angry.     lastly, this primer made my face break out TERRIBLY. at first, i thought it was probably just me and stress, however i have good skin, and my face usually doesnt break out. This was the final draw, and i gave this primer to my friend because i said i didn&#x27;t want it and she said she would try it and see if it worked better for her. After about a week, her face began to break out also, and mine began to clear up as i stopped using it. This is honestly a terrible product, and if you want to buy a good primer buy the original. I&#x27;ve never been more dissapointed in a Bare Escentuals product...</li>
            <li> I love the BE products and use them exclusively.  I use Prime Time and thought I would try the Brightening Primer.  Upon first use, it shot out watery tannish-colored fluid.  I took the top off and stirred the contents of the bottle with the spray/pump attached to the lid.  It has pumped out a better consistency since I stirred it up.  However, the product feels greasy on my face and has an oily appearance.  The consistancy is different from regular Prime Time and I do not like the feel of this.  I will stick to the regular Prime Time, which I have used for about a year and highly recommend.  This product was disappointing and I do not plan on using it.</li>
            <li> This primer is lightweight and dries quickly. It seems to improve the length of time that my foundation powder stays put during the day so I rarely do touch ups. I gave it 4 stars because it seems a bit unstable and instantly gets runny if it&#x27;s not kept cool.</li>
            <li> Excellant. Used for 2 yrs now. The best feel ever.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product to use before applying your Bare Mineral make up. It works well with covering up facial flaws and keeps your make up on longer without the look of it showing worn away look.</li>
            <li> I used Smashbox when it 1st came out.  The cost is twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;This has a light gold brightner ...that gives  a soft glow .&lt;br /&gt;It is the only one a purchase now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using a primer.  Initially it seemed like just another expense.  However, I received a sample of product when I was looking for something to keep makeup from settling into my fine lines (Im in my 40&#x27;s).  I am an absolute believer in primer now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that when I use this primer under my makeup my foundation looks a lot better.  My make up stayed put throughout the day, and looked smoother.  It is not the best for anti-aging (not that it claims to be) - but this product in particular is cost effective and definitely improves the look of any makeup you apply thereafter.</li>
            <li> Came very fast! Nicely shipped and processed quickly. The tone in the primer might look dark when it comes out of the pump but when on the skin it blends perfectly and makes the skin feel healthy! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I am a faithful lover of this product, now on my third bottle, will recommend without any hesitation, see u.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem, it splatters all over the place, even if you shake it before pumping it.  I bought mine on-line through BareMinerals.  They are sending me another one at no charge, hopefully it&#x27;s better and comes from a batch that isn&#x27;t defective.</li>
            <li> I love this product . remember to shake it the first use, it does settle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for quite a few years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  It is a great primer for use with Bare Minerals powder.</li>
            <li> I like this primer because it provides a good surface for my foundation. The only thing which I don&#x27;t like is that it can make my skin appear greasy.</li>
            <li> This product was what I expected. I liked the brilliance of it and it goes on easy and light. It is a nice product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and do have to agree that this product&#x27;s major downfall is that the consistency needs to be fixed somehow. It seems like there are two parts to this primer, the thin watery part and then the thicker lotion-like part, and they don&#x27;t seem to mix together very well in the bottle. Both parts are wonderfully smooth and silky, by the way.  I noticed that after several uses, and instead of using the pump (which didn&#x27;t work well), I mixed it and got it out manually by dipping the bottom of the pump. Bare Escentuals has improved it over the last few years but they still need to fix it. I agree that it&#x27;s disappointing but the product is so awesome that I hardly care about that. This is the best primer I have personally used. It brightens my face A TON and it makes me look years younger, when used with their foundation. (I would say 7 to 8 years younger, and I am not kidding.) It holds their foundation really well too - it&#x27;ll stay on all day when I used this primer. I have used the most expensive primers and also the other bare minerals primer without the brightening element. None of them even come close to the performance of this product. I am giving it 5 stars because of how unbelievably well it works, but they do still need to fix its consistency.</li>
            <li> Gives makeup a little boost!  Bought it by mistake, but glad I did as it has the same feel of regular Prime Time but gives face a little extra coverage. Love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  It makes my skin feel like silk and brightens my face.  I apply it all over my face, except under my eyes, where my concealer goes.  I also apply it along my jaw lines and neck.  This is done is preparation for the foundation powder that I use and I apply that to my neck as well.  This Prime Time Brightening Foundation Primer Bare Escentuals is non-greasy and, as an added bonus, my hands feel like silk too after applying this wonderful product.  I will try to NEVER run out of this ESSENTIAL part of my make up!</li>
            <li> i like it a lot and will order more when its used up</li>
            <li> I tried the Bare Minerals original primer, and it feels great in your hands, but once I put it on my face I felt very itchy. I did not have a skin reaction but it felt like my skin did not want this thick primer on my face. After a couple days, I noticed it was starting to make me break out. I went back to the store and they gave me a trial amount of this brightening primer and I love it!! It feels silky (not oily) and is perfect for my dry skin. However, I would not recommend this for someone with oily skin since it has the consistency of moisturizer. The sparkles in it don&#x27;t seem to do anything, but I love it because of its texture and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and cause acne.</li>
            <li> Prime Time works with ANY foundation! It definitely helps give a smooth base prior to application of any foundation.</li>
            <li> IT Makes My Makeup Glide On My Face So Easy After Applying The Prime Time First...It Really Helps To Hide Large Pores...It Is A Must Have!!!</li>
            <li> This is different than their regular primer, which I like; but I also like that this gives a bit of color/glow.  I can see where a young person would think it &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; but for older skin it adds a bit of needed glow.  And, as always, ordering thru Amazon is super fast and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great sheer feeling/touch. Glides right onto my face. Noticed my Bare Minerals foundation sticks onto my face (meaning, I use less product). I like the subtle illuminating effect, but it does try out some patches on my face right after application. I recommend using a moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference from the original except that the size is smaller.</li>
            <li> I drove out to the Bare Escentuals store today to look at the new cream concealers and the sales rep pitched this product.  I&#x27;ve used other primers and like them, and I like the silkiness of this primer.  BUT....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first clue should have been when the sales rep pumped hers out onto her finger, it splattered all over her clothes (so lucky it missed mine) and made a really big mess!  I did buy it, because I like how it feels and how it helped my foundation.  I hadn&#x27;t read these reviews beforehand so I had no idea this was a common problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got mine home, opened it and pushed down on the pump, and all I got was the clear oily ingredient.  I took off the top and all I could see was thick, gooey globby.  I stirred, I shook, and then the tube that attaches to the pump fell off, into the container.  In all that thickness, no way will I ever see that little tube again.  The pump is rendered useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bare Escentuals store takes 45 minutes to get there in heavy traffic and frankly, not worth my time or gas to return it, so I will use it.  I shook some more, and the tube in the container acts as a mixer when I shake it.  I do like it-the consistency is nice.  I was able to squeeze some of it out to put in an empty makeup jar (I love these little jars-they are miniatures of the eyeshadow containers and I use them for traveling) and I will just dip my finger in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-do NOT buy this product.  BE needs to know how flawed this design is and I plan to leave feedback on their website about this as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Apply after moisturizer; beautifully light and glides on. Follow with concealer, etc.Helps make-up stay put and can even be worn alone for a nice glow plus sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Works great and really smoothes over the skin!</li>
            <li> This really does seem to brighten.  I am 40 and use it under my BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  Excellent alone or with foundation.  Goes on light and non-greasy.  Only complaint is that the bottle is too small.</li>
