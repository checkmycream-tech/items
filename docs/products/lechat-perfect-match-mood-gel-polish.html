            <li>Love love love this color</li>
            <li>Love this polish.</li>
            <li>I tried this polish a couple of weeks ago in a salon in Atlanta and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Lasted more than two weeks</li>
            <li>fun polish!!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this nail polish in the gel/uv form!</li>
            <li>It looks purple and goes on purple but quickly turns fucia, which is the warm color.</li>
            <li>this dried perfectly using my UV light and Gelish foundation and Top Coat.  </li>
            <li>I own all twelve colors of the MOOD polishes that were released first time around.</li>
            <li>Very pretty!  </li>
            <li>Got her like 4 of these with a UV Light.</li>
            <li>This polish goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>Must have a UV light to cure, but I think it says that in the product description.</li>
            <li>I have the CND uv light system and set each coat for 180 seconds.</li>
            <li>My new favorite color!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>So much fun and such great colors.</li>
            <li>The warm color is a nice pink</li>
            <li>I saw it in Nails magazine and got on Amazon right away to buy it!</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Frost color goes from bright pink to purple.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>A beautiful pink color normally</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real conversation topic at parties and so fun!</li>
            <li>In reality, it is a light fuchsia at most, and even pink to some.</li>
            <li>Just as described and fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>the picture I attached isn&#x27;t quite color correct but pretty close...</li>
            <li>The quality is consistent.</li>
            <li>Love it, even works in the warm weather, I never get tired of this color change polish.</li>
            <li>Large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>It would of been nice if it would of came with a top base coat to make it shine more</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m very picky about pink - this reminds me of my old favorite OPI La Paz-Itively Hot</li>
            <li>and it really is different and fun!</li>
            <li>polish went on nice and smooth and while a little thicker than what I&#x27;m used to (other polishes need 2-4 coats)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s intriguing to watch the color variations with temperature changes sometimes the tips are purple and the rest pink its fun to watch I.</li>
            <li>The warm color is a bright iridescent pink and the cold color</li>
            <li>It is not as reactive to the cold change as some of the others,  but still works and is still beautiful.  </li>
            <li>It does turn the light purple pictured when ice is applied, but that is all, it does not go as dark as the picture shows.</li>
            <li>and I was expecting a light purple and dark purple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun and the color changes as soon as the nail gets warm or cold.  </li>
            <li>takes long to dry, but not bad</li>
            <li>Still, if you can get past the color not really being midnight at all, it is really a fun product, and the color actually is pretty.</li>
            <li>was really hoping that with long nails, the tips would gradually become purple while the rest would be pink.</li>
            <li>The only time my nails look like the picture is if I am cold, but I love it!</li>

            <li> It is seriously so much fun, but seriously, the color in the picture is of purple that goes really dark purple.</li>
            <li> So the shade shown is a little different than pictured, the pink is brighter, not as purple pink, and it is a little shimmery, perhaps a bit young for me.</li>
            <li> It is a really dark purple when cold and a soft hot pink when warm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It will change instantly under hot or cold water.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes just the tips turn dark purple.</li>
            <li> I am so hard on my nails that a regular manicure is chipped in a day so about a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get other colors!</li>
            <li> Not true colors from picture</li>
            <li> Yes the purple is a little darker then shown but</li>
            <li> It only changes colors when you put your hand in really cold things.</li>
            <li> At room temp my nails are fuchsia with purple tips and dark purple when they&#x27;re cold.  </li>
            <li> but the color turns dark purple when you are cold!</li>
            <li> unfortunately  </li>
            <li> Purple is the cold color.</li>
            <li> Was shocked it worked but a must try!</li>

            <li> Fast Delivery.  Great Product!!! Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> This polish goes on so smooth. It cures great! The color is different than the picture though. It is a really dark purple when cold and a soft hot pink when warm.&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping that with long nails, the tips would gradually become purple while the rest would be pink. It doesn&#x27;t tend to work that way though.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with this product though! I saw it in Nails magazine and got on Amazon right away to buy it! You get quite a bit if polish and it really is different and fun!</li>
            <li> My new favorite color!  The warm color is a nice pink (I&#x27;m very picky about pink - this reminds me of my old favorite OPI La Paz-Itively Hot unfortunately  I am so hard on my nails that a regular manicure is chipped in a day so about a year and a half ago I bought myself a no chip kit and never looked at regular nail polish again!) the cold color is a nice purple - the picture I attached isn&#x27;t quite color correct but pretty close... the color on my nail is after 1 coat I believe... polish went on nice and smooth and while a little thicker than what I&#x27;m used to (other polishes need 2-4 coats) this dried perfectly using my UV light and Gelish foundation and Top Coat.  Thrilled!</li>
            <li> Love this polish. Changes from a beautiful deep.purple to a fuschia that reminds me of pompei purple.</li>
            <li> I have several colors from this company. This color is a fuscia when warm and purple when cold. It is not as reactive to the cold change as some of the others,  but still works and is still beautiful.  Perfect color for spring. Must have a UV light to cure, but I think it says that in the product description.</li>
            <li> So the shade shown is a little different than pictured, the pink is brighter, not as purple pink, and it is a little shimmery, perhaps a bit young for me. The deeper color is very nice, bluer than shown.</li>
            <li> I tried this polish a couple of weeks ago in a salon in Atlanta and absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s so fun and the color changes as soon as the nail gets warm or cold.  At room temp my nails are fuchsia with purple tips and dark purple when they&#x27;re cold.  It will change instantly under hot or cold water.  It&#x27;s a real conversation topic at parties and so fun!</li>
            <li> It only changes colors when you put your hand in really cold things. Doesn&#x27;t change with your body temperature like the kind my sister ordered.</li>
            <li> On time delivery and product as described</li>
            <li> I own all twelve colors of the MOOD polishes that were released first time around. The quality is consistent. Application, removal, and wear time is exceptional. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Mood nail Gel polish? AWESOME! It is seriously so much fun, but seriously, the color in the picture is of purple that goes really dark purple. In reality, it is a light fuchsia at most, and even pink to some. It does turn the light purple pictured when ice is applied, but that is all, it does not go as dark as the picture shows.

            <li> No chipping for weeks!  Love the color change!</li>
            <li> Frost color goes from bright pink to purple. Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Love the color change! Try it!</li>
            <li> Yes the purple is a little darker then shown but all in all it&#x27;s still and awesome product I love it !</li>
            <li> Not true colors from picture</li>
            <li> Really nice color. Took it to my bail place had it applied with gel. Lasted more than two weeks</li>
            <li> The warm color is a bright iridescent pink and the cold color Is a deep purple. Both colors are great.  It&#x27;s intriguing to watch the color variations with temperature changes sometimes the tips are purple and the rest pink its fun to watch I. The winter when your hands are cold from being outdoors as they begin to warm and the color starts to change.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the cutest warm color yet!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this nail polish in the gel/uv form! As soon as I got it I used it and I was expecting a light purple and dark purple. Not at all what I got...but I love it! It looks purple and goes on purple but quickly turns fucia, which is the warm color. Purple is the cold color. I have the CND uv light system and set each coat for 180 seconds. The only time my nails look like the picture is if I am cold, but I love it!</li>
