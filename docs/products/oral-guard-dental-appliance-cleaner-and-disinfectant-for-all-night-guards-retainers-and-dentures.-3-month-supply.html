            <li>This stuff is amazing ...</li>
            <li>This stuff is really amazing.  </li>
            <li>It had a lot of plaque/calcium deposits on it because brushing it with toothpaste just wasn&#x27;t effective.  </li>
            <li>And so they have outstanding and friendly customer service on top of a great product!</li>
            <li>After soaking for 24 hours the mouth guards were extremely clean and looked great.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Then I put it in my mouth and it tastes sweet!!  </li>
            <li>I am hoping with periodic cleaning they will look good and clean until they wear out.&lt;br</li>

            <li>They smell better and feel better.</li>
            <li>I thought, maybe I need to try one more overnight.</li>
            <li>Great cleaner that works very well.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even think it would need more than a rinse off or maybe some soap and water to freshen it</li>
            <li>but the mouth guard it is fresher and somewhat cleaner, and I would hope most of the germs are gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure that you rinse your retainers well since the solution has a antiseptic-type taste and smell (smells like hydrogen peroxide</li>
            <li>but they cost significantly more.  </li>
            <li>Pretty remarkable stuff.</li>
            <li>this stuff works MUCH better than the stuff I got at the drug store.</li>
            <li>and they got even better.  </li>
            <li>Much better than what the orthodontist had recommended</li>
            <li>This is interesting stuff.  </li>
            <li>gladly offered them.</li>
            <li>Kudos to the manufacturer for offering an outstanding product for home use.</li>
            <li>My dentist commented on how clean my ancient mouthguard is!</li>
            <li>And is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel so much better having a clean dental guard each night before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>It came very quickly as described.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product.</li>
            <li>I do use tooth paste for my mouth guard and it seems to do just fine.</li>
            <li>This product amazingly worked overnight on a very stained device.</li>
            <li>After my dentist confirmed what I already knew,</li>
            <li>I was so happy this with the results, especially since I didn&#x27;t have to buy</li>
            <li>Love it so much that I&#x27;m ordering a 6-month supply!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what the dentist says, this is what I will use from this point forward to keep my bite guard clean.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my night guard.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner gets my night guard, literally, squeaky clean with no after-taste or after-smell.</li>
            <li>No scent, just a clean retainer.</li>
            <li>I used it to clean my nite guard.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this product to clean my night guard.  </li>
            <li>I needed something to clean the plaque off my nightguard that wouldn&#x27;t damage or weaken it in any way.</li>
            <li>If you use it as directed, it will clean the heck out of a mouth guard.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how clean your device will be after using this product.</li>
            <li>used this several years always with good, clean results</li>
            <li>I have plenty of packets left, so this was a good buy.</li>
            <li>I clean and make a fresh solution every Sunday and drop my night guard into every morning.</li>
            <li>night guard is clean and fresh and feels like something I would want in my mouth now.</li>
            <li>Keeps my mouth guard clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It keeps my night guard sparkling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I wear a TAP dental appliance every night and have found NOTHING on the market that keeps my appliance as fresh and clean as the Oral Guard Cleaner.  </li>
            <li>At bedtime, I take it out of the solution give it a quick rinse</li>
            <li>This actually worked better for me than another product I purchased that was suppose to be better...</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and as advertized.</li>
            <li>I had not given my tooth guard a good cleaning in a long while.  </li>
            <li>Fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>Really easy to use, and if you use each packet for 10 days you&#x27;re really getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I have a nice glass mason jar and tight fitting lid</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think it is worth it though, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>There are some other brands that do the same excellent job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced right</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really clean it too much.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how good this actually worked.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this to clean mouth guards.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has a night guard, no matter now old it is, to keep it clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I kept the guard in the solution for the 20 minutes as explained in the intructions.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it purports to do.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts at first though.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>The first product I used was called Retainer Brite.</li>
            <li>I used it anyway and within the lifespan of the first packet (10 days)</li>
            <li>I put my appliance in the cleaner every morning when I take out off and in the evening, with just a rinse of water, it is fresh and ready to wear overnight.  </li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and soaked my mouth guard all day in the solution for the first day and wore my mouth guard that night.  </li>
            <li>After about four days, my nite guard was sparkling clean - all of the deposits were completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Although I would prefer using a fresh mixture daily, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to using the Oral Guard mix 5-7 days, storing the mixture in a plastic container with a secure lid.</li>
            <li>The packets are easy to open, no weird smells.</li>
            <li>It had built up for a long time and it seems most of it is still there....</li>
            <li>My appliance was over $1000, so trusting a solution to keep it fresh and clean without harming it was crucial.  </li>
            <li>also like that I can use this product for multiple uses- makes it easy when I am at home.</li>
            <li>The directions are right on the packet, and they are very clear.</li>
            <li>ty so much.</li>
            <li>thank ou, very . .</li>
            <li>much</li>
            <li>and it is ready to go.  </li>
            <li>And he told me how much it would cost.</li>
            <li>While this seems to work I do not think it got that much of the gunk that was on the appliance.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had found this product much sooner.</li>
            <li>this product cleans well, however it tastes very salty....</li>
            <li>If you use a nightguard every night like I do, (thanks to me grinding my teeth)</li>
            <li>This worked really well, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>my appliances showed real improvement.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a difference in the outcome of using this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a standard denture cleaner to clean my bite guard.</li>
            <li>Amazon seems to only have 2 products that clean nightguards.</li>
            <li>My night guard had accumulated so much grit that I was ready to ask my dentist to make me a new one.  </li>
            <li>For about 2 years, I&#x27;d kept at as clean as I could by thoroughly rinsing it in water, but is steadily turned really yellow.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, you must cleanse and brush your partial, denture or retainer thoroughly prior to placing it in the reusable mix so it stays clean and fresh for that many reuses.</li>
            <li>and it is not only very gentle, but so simple and so easy to use....</li>
            <li>Really cleans the night guard and keeps it looking new.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The product did not clean my bite guard as most of the reviews said it did for theirs.</li>
            <li>Will try the retainer brights, since they got a little better</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell a little bit better on the two star note.</li>
            <li>My mouth guard always feels clean and fresh everyday.</li>
            <li>This product really removed the coffee, tea and iron vitamin stains from my retainers in about 20 minutes so that they are clear again.  </li>
            <li>you open the packet of this cleaner and pour it into the water, you can smell its minty fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I tried everything I knew of to get my sleep apnea device  looking like new again-peroxide, bleach, baking soda and even, yes, oxyclean, to no avail.</li>
            <li>Makes it look almost new.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think my guard will ever look brand new (because of visible abrasions, etc)</li>
            <li>ordered this stuff to try to avoid buying a new guard-</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to throw away my nightguard and buy a new one from my dentist.</li>
            <li>But the result was a shiny, new looking nightguard.</li>
            <li>a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I was about to order a kit to make a new one $80</li>
            <li>My tooth guard looks brand new.</li>
            <li>It looks almost new.</li>
            <li>Cleans like new.</li>
            <li>Since then (10 more days) there is very little yellowing.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I love my dental guard, and after using it for a few months, all pain (ALL PAIN!)</li>
            <li>First product that I;ve used on my nightguard that actually works.</li>
            <li>I think it cleans better than the tablets I&#x27;ve used in the past though.</li>
            <li>After a few uses early on I wondered if rinsing it warm water would be enough to fully clean the dental guard as I noticed a build-up of something white on the back of the guard.</li>
            <li>I used to brush my nightguard with my toothbrush using toothpaste and that was fine for a little while.</li>
            <li>In my sonic machine like twice and do some minor brushing only because I don&#x27;t prefer the solution it is not a desired taste for me and after brushing with the water they feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li>After soaking it overnight as directed for a stained appliance, it came out clear once again.</li>
            <li>Now I put it in the solution for about a half hour each morning and it stays completely clean.  </li>
            <li>After 2 times using this stuff, it is crystal clear.</li>
            <li>Then, I scrubbed it with a soft brush.</li>
            <li>After soaking in Oral Guard for just one week, it&#x27;s the crusting is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Please note I have had this professionally made mouth guard for 3 years already.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a little after taste in your mouth, but does clean the appliance.</li>
            <li>Back to square one, I tried many powder cleaners, other than traditional tablets such as Polident, none of which compared to Sonic Brite&#x27;s - until now!</li>
            <li>, it is just about back to looking new color-wise.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use daily and does not damage oral appliances.  </li>
            <li>Not cheap but worth it to me.</li>
            <li>that I was night grinding and wearing down my teeth, I was willing to try a night guard.</li>
            <li>I leave it for a half hour if I remember to pull it out, or the whole day if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Not only did my Invisalign retainers not get cleaned, this left behind a strong chemical aftertaste.</li>

            <li> No scent, just a clean retainer.</li>
            <li> I used it to clean my nite guard.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product to clean my night guard.  </li>
            <li> I needed something to clean the plaque off my nightguard that wouldn&#x27;t damage or weaken it in any way.</li>
            <li> If you use it as directed, it will clean the heck out of a mouth guard.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how clean your device will be after using this product.</li>
            <li> used this several years always with good, clean results</li>
            <li> I have plenty of packets left, so this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I clean and make a fresh solution every Sunday and drop my night guard into every morning.</li>
            <li> night guard is clean and fresh and feels like something I would want in my mouth now.</li>
            <li> Keeps my mouth guard clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It keeps my night guard sparkling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I wear a TAP dental appliance every night and have found NOTHING on the market that keeps my appliance as fresh and clean as the Oral Guard Cleaner.  </li>
            <li> At bedtime, I take it out of the solution give it a quick rinse</li>
            <li> This actually worked better for me than another product I purchased that was suppose to be better...</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and as advertized.</li>
            <li> I had not given my tooth guard a good cleaning in a long while.  </li>
            <li> Fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> Really easy to use, and if you use each packet for 10 days you&#x27;re really getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I have a nice glass mason jar and tight fitting lid</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think it is worth it though, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> There are some other brands that do the same excellent job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced right</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really clean it too much.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how good this actually worked.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this to clean mouth guards.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has a night guard, no matter now old it is, to keep it clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I kept the guard in the solution for the 20 minutes as explained in the intructions.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it purports to do.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts at first though.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> The first product I used was called Retainer Brite.</li>
            <li> I used it anyway and within the lifespan of the first packet (10 days)</li>
            <li> I put my appliance in the cleaner every morning when I take out off and in the evening, with just a rinse of water, it is fresh and ready to wear overnight.  </li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and soaked my mouth guard all day in the solution for the first day and wore my mouth guard that night.  </li>
            <li> After about four days, my nite guard was sparkling clean - all of the deposits were completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Although I would prefer using a fresh mixture daily, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to using the Oral Guard mix 5-7 days, storing the mixture in a plastic container with a secure lid.</li>
            <li> The packets are easy to open, no weird smells.</li>
            <li> It had built up for a long time and it seems most of it is still there....</li>
            <li> My appliance was over $1000, so trusting a solution to keep it fresh and clean without harming it was crucial.  </li>
            <li> also like that I can use this product for multiple uses- makes it easy when I am at home.</li>
            <li> The directions are right on the packet, and they are very clear.</li>
            <li> ty so much.</li>
            <li> thank ou, very . .</li>
            <li> much</li>
            <li> and it is ready to go.  </li>
            <li> And he told me how much it would cost.</li>
            <li> While this seems to work I do not think it got that much of the gunk that was on the appliance.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had found this product much sooner.</li>
            <li> this product cleans well, however it tastes very salty....</li>
            <li> If you use a nightguard every night like I do, (thanks to me grinding my teeth)</li>
            <li> This worked really well, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> my appliances showed real improvement.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference in the outcome of using this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a standard denture cleaner to clean my bite guard.</li>
            <li> Amazon seems to only have 2 products that clean nightguards.</li>
            <li> My night guard had accumulated so much grit that I was ready to ask my dentist to make me a new one.  </li>
            <li> For about 2 years, I&#x27;d kept at as clean as I could by thoroughly rinsing it in water, but is steadily turned really yellow.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, you must cleanse and brush your partial, denture or retainer thoroughly prior to placing it in the reusable mix so it stays clean and fresh for that many reuses.</li>
            <li> and it is not only very gentle, but so simple and so easy to use....</li>
            <li> Really cleans the night guard and keeps it looking new.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product did not clean my bite guard as most of the reviews said it did for theirs.</li>
            <li> Will try the retainer brights, since they got a little better</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell a little bit better on the two star note.</li>
            <li> My mouth guard always feels clean and fresh everyday.</li>
            <li> This product really removed the coffee, tea and iron vitamin stains from my retainers in about 20 minutes so that they are clear again.  </li>
            <li> you open the packet of this cleaner and pour it into the water, you can smell its minty fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I tried everything I knew of to get my sleep apnea device  looking like new again-peroxide, bleach, baking soda and even, yes, oxyclean, to no avail.</li>
            <li> Makes it look almost new.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think my guard will ever look brand new (because of visible abrasions, etc)</li>
            <li> ordered this stuff to try to avoid buying a new guard-</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to throw away my nightguard and buy a new one from my dentist.</li>
            <li> But the result was a shiny, new looking nightguard.</li>
            <li> a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I was about to order a kit to make a new one $80</li>
            <li> My tooth guard looks brand new.</li>
            <li> It looks almost new.</li>
            <li> Cleans like new.</li>
            <li> Since then (10 more days) there is very little yellowing.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I love my dental guard, and after using it for a few months, all pain (ALL PAIN!)</li>
            <li> First product that I;ve used on my nightguard that actually works.</li>
            <li> I think it cleans better than the tablets I&#x27;ve used in the past though.</li>
            <li> After a few uses early on I wondered if rinsing it warm water would be enough to fully clean the dental guard as I noticed a build-up of something white on the back of the guard.</li>
            <li> I used to brush my nightguard with my toothbrush using toothpaste and that was fine for a little while.</li>
            <li> In my sonic machine like twice and do some minor brushing only because I don&#x27;t prefer the solution it is not a desired taste for me and after brushing with the water they feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li> After soaking it overnight as directed for a stained appliance, it came out clear once again.</li>
            <li> Now I put it in the solution for about a half hour each morning and it stays completely clean.  </li>
            <li> After 2 times using this stuff, it is crystal clear.</li>
            <li> Then, I scrubbed it with a soft brush.</li>
            <li> After soaking in Oral Guard for just one week, it&#x27;s the crusting is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Please note I have had this professionally made mouth guard for 3 years already.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a little after taste in your mouth, but does clean the appliance.</li>
            <li> Back to square one, I tried many powder cleaners, other than traditional tablets such as Polident, none of which compared to Sonic Brite&#x27;s - until now!</li>
            <li> , it is just about back to looking new color-wise.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use daily and does not damage oral appliances.  </li>
            <li> Not cheap but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> that I was night grinding and wearing down my teeth, I was willing to try a night guard.</li>
            <li> I leave it for a half hour if I remember to pull it out, or the whole day if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not only did my Invisalign retainers not get cleaned, this left behind a strong chemical aftertaste.</li>
            <li> The plaque was gone by the seventh day (or sooner, I can&#x27;t remember), but I kept soaking it because I like stretching out the use of products for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> After 20 minutes in the ultrasonic machine, my partial is sparkling white; gone are the coffee and tea stains.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;; however, my partial has several porcelain teeth which are not at all adversely effected by this cleaner.</li>
            <li> It even had a black stain that my dentist didn&#x27;t remove on my last visit.  </li>
            <li> Lately I been noticing that they were pretty grimy, even though we brush them everyday.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say except that the product works well in cleaning stains as it should.</li>
            <li> Half of a packet (using half of the water as well) is enough liquid for my relatively small retainers so that this product will last twice as long for me.  </li>
            <li> However, Retainer Brite was not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Small discolorations in grooves hard to get without really working at it.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers-</li>
            <li> I use the cleaner every other month, just to use.</li>
            <li> But with a lot less water, I find that the retainers are cleaner, clearer.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is a bit odd, but there was nothing in the ingredient list that you wouldn&#x27;t recognize if you&#x27;re an ingredient reader.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to mess with bleach or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> after a few days...</li>
            <li> It did take a few soakings, as I soaked mine overnight as per instructions.</li>
            <li> I think I may use a packet perhaps once or twice a month so that I am not soaking/cleaning my nightguard everyday, but maybe 1 to 2 weeks per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What size is small?</li>
            <li> No more gunk in the crevices.  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t find where the ingredients are listed on the package, so not sure if hydrogen peroxide is included or not).  </li>
            <li> It took some of the surface gunk off the nightguard but certainly not most of the yucky stuff.</li>
            <li> Within a short period of time, it started to look a little dirty.</li>
            <li> I continue to use it every day now for at least 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was desperate for something that actually got the iced tea stains out of my appliances.</li>
            <li> After two years of use, it was caked so badly with plaque, that I could barely get it on my teeth....</li>
            <li> I put my daughters retainers in a very small bowl.</li>
            <li> I have just a small couple of dots of plague on my mouth guard, so it is nothing serious, just wanted to remove those!</li>
            <li> In ONE NIGHT, it took off all the plaque, killed all the nasty stuff and the appliance looked brand new again.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong about that.</li>
            <li> It made me uncomfortable to put in my mouth</li>
            <li> But after some time, the gunk that built up on the nightguard would not come off merely using a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that my mouth guard was dirty until it came out of this solution</li>
            <li> Therefore I am disappointed in the product but still using it as it did make some improvement to my bite guard.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed with this product, and I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d be stupid not to buy it.  </li>
            <li> and doesnt taste awful...</li>
            <li> Nasty!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried everything I knew of to get my sleep apnea device  looking like new again-peroxide, bleach, baking soda and even, yes, oxyclean, to no avail. This product amazingly worked overnight on a very stained device. What a find!</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, and if you use each packet for 10 days you&#x27;re really getting your money&#x27;s worth. My mouth guard always feels clean and fresh everyday.</li>
            <li> The powder works, but I had to make an adjustment to the instructions. I put my daughters retainers in a very small bowl. What size is small? Think a tiny crystal bowl for mints. I add just enough water to cover the retainers. I pour the powder in and stir well. The instructions call for a lot of water. I tried it with that amount of water and wasn&#x27;t convinced the product was doing what it said it would. But with a lot less water, I find that the retainers are cleaner, clearer. They smell better and feel better. And that&#x27;s why I bought the product.</li>
            <li> If you have a night guard, then you NEED TO BUY this, period!  My night guard had accumulated so much grit that I was ready to ask my dentist to make me a new one.  It even had a black stain that my dentist didn&#x27;t remove on my last visit.  (Gross, I know.)  But after one 12-hour bath with Oral Guard and a couple of shorter ones, even the stain is gone!  Deposits are gone, too.  This stuff is amazing ... you&#x27;d be stupid not to buy it.  Oral Guard has saved me hundreds of dollars, and now I can&#x27;t wait to tell my dentist on my next visit about it.</li>
            <li> I gave the two stars because of the fast-shipping and my guard does smell better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the reviews and description, \\&quot;it cleans and removes plague.\\&quot; It didn&#x27;t do this. I tried the instructions once for several hours. Then, I scrubbed it with a soft brush. Nothing. I thought, maybe I need to try one more overnight. Still nothing. I have just a small couple of dots of plague on my mouth guard, so it is nothing serious, just wanted to remove those! Will try the retainer brights, since they got a little better review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell a little bit better on the two star note.</li>
            <li> ty so much. its wonderful, perfect cleaning utensil detergent. It works great. and doesnt taste awful... thank ou, very . . much</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  I have a bite guard that I wear every night and was told to only wash it with soap and water.  After two years of use, it was caked so badly with plaque, that I could barely get it on my teeth....and it appeared something else was growing in a part of it that I could not even reach with a toothbrush.  Nasty!!  After trying both toothpaste and denture cleaners, I got this.  In ONE NIGHT, it took off all the plaque, killed all the nasty stuff and the appliance looked brand new again.  I don&#x27;t care what the dentist says, this is what I will use from this point forward to keep my bite guard clean.</li>
            <li> The product did not clean my bite guard as most of the reviews said it did for theirs. Therefore I am disappointed in the product but still using it as it did make some improvement to my bite guard. I may contact the company for suggestions.</li>
            <li> Great cleaner that works very well.  Gentle enough to use daily and does not damage oral appliances.  Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not much to say except that the product works well in cleaning stains as it should. It&#x27;s priced right and I would have on problem in recommending it.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my night guard.  So simple.  I just drop it in the solution in the morning.  I keep a jar with the solution in it in my medicine cabinet.  At bedtime, I take it out of the solution give it a quick rinse and it is ready to go.  The cleaner gets my night guard, literally, squeaky clean with no after-taste or after-smell.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy.  It cleans the night guard rather well.  No more gunk in the crevices.  Makes it look almost new.</li>
            <li> After my dentist confirmed what I already knew, that I was night grinding and wearing down my teeth, I was willing to try a night guard. I figured I&#x27;ve got the best dental insurance so why not use it. Except that it didn&#x27;t cover it. And he told me how much it would cost. Discouraged, I thought of Amazon in his parking lot and got a great fitted night guard there at a great price. Didn&#x27;t even think it would need more than a rinse off or maybe some soap and water to freshen it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong about that. Within a short period of time, it started to look a little dirty. Small discolorations in grooves hard to get without really working at it. It made me uncomfortable to put in my mouth each night.&lt;br /&gt;So, I read the reviews and picked up this product. I have a nice glass mason jar and tight fitting lid I clean and make a fresh solution every Sunday and drop my night guard into every morning. I leave it for a half hour if I remember to pull it out, or the whole day if I don&#x27;t. I rinse and it air dries until I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My night guard is clean and fresh and feels like something I would want in my mouth now. I don&#x27;t have to mess with bleach or harsh chemicals. The packets are easy to open, no weird smells. No fuss. Good price. Works for me.</li>
            <li> This cleaner has worked great on my night guard. I had cleaned my mouth guard with a different cleaner before I purchased Oral Guard Dental Appliance Cleaner &amp; Disinfectant and my night guard had some yellowing in one spot. After soaking it overnight as directed for a stained appliance, it came out clear once again. I&#x27;m very happy with this cleaner and will continue to use it to keep my mouth guard clean and looking good.</li>
            <li> I did not see any warning label when I purchased this product. I cannot use it on my night guard, because it will discolor my crowns .</li>
            <li> used this several years always with good, clean results</li>
            <li> While this seems to work I do not think it got that much of the gunk that was on the appliance.  It had built up for a long time and it seems most of it is still there....but the mouth guard it is fresher and somewhat cleaner, and I would hope most of the germs are gone.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it is worth it though, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My night guard had tons of built up plaque and whatnot that NOTHING would remove. I tried everything. This product worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> This product really removed the coffee, tea and iron vitamin stains from my retainers in about 20 minutes so that they are clear again.  Make sure that you rinse your retainers well since the solution has a antiseptic-type taste and smell (smells like hydrogen peroxide but I couldn&#x27;t find where the ingredients are listed on the package, so not sure if hydrogen peroxide is included or not).  Half of a packet (using half of the water as well) is enough liquid for my relatively small retainers so that this product will last twice as long for me.  There are some other brands that do the same excellent job but they cost significantly more.  I wish I had found this product much sooner.</li>
            <li> This actually worked better for me than another product I purchased that was suppose to be better... not my opinion though... I also like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to change the solution so often.  Just run my invisaligns In my sonic machine like twice and do some minor brushing only because I don&#x27;t prefer the solution it is not a desired taste for me and after brushing with the water they feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li> I use a night guard to prevent teeth grinding.  For about 2 years, I&#x27;d kept at as clean as I could by thoroughly rinsing it in water, but is steadily turned really yellow.  After seeing this product on Amazon, I thought that I&#x27;d give it a try.  It works great!  And is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I kept the guard in the solution for the 20 minutes as explained in the intructions.  Even that short a time resulted in a visible difference.  So, the next day, I kept the guard in the solution for probably 6 hours or so - What it difference it&#x27;s made!  While I don&#x27;t think my guard will ever look brand new (because of visible abrasions, etc), it is just about back to looking new color-wise.  99% of the gunk is gone.  I continue to use it every day now for at least 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I had not given my tooth guard a good cleaning in a long while.  It was crusted with plaque.  After soaking in Oral Guard for just one week, it&#x27;s the crusting is almost completely gone.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I soak my retainer daily in this cleaner.  Use a packet for about ten days and replace.  No scent, just a clean retainer.</li>
            <li> I suffer from bruxism and wear a night gaurd when i sleep. this product does a wonderful job keeping the night gaurd clean.</li>
            <li> Pretty remarkable stuff. Does exactly what it purports to do. My dentist commented on how clean my ancient mouthguard is! Very easy to use. Not cheap but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff is really amazing.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this actually worked.  I had my doubts at first though.  I used it to clean my nite guard.  It had a lot of plaque/calcium deposits on it because brushing it with toothpaste just wasn&#x27;t effective.  So I put it in for 24 hours and it didn&#x27;t really clean it too much.  However, I decided to keep trying and and would put my nite guard in the solution in the morning and not take it out until I was going to bed at night.  After about four days, my nite guard was sparkling clean - all of the deposits were completely gone.  Now I put it in the solution for about a half hour each morning and it stays completely clean.  I plan to keep using this product and would recommend it to anybody else wanting something that actually works.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers- this stuff works MUCH better than the stuff I got at the drug store. I didn&#x27;t realize that my mouth guard was dirty until it came out of this solution a sparking white. I will be buying this again.t</li>
            <li> I love my dental guard, and after using it for a few months, all pain (ALL PAIN!) in my jaw is gone. After a few uses early on I wondered if rinsing it warm water would be enough to fully clean the dental guard as I noticed a build-up of something white on the back of the guard. Thankfully I learned of this great cleaner &amp; disinfectant.  After just one soaking / cleaning I saw the white matter disappear.  I feel so much better having a clean dental guard each night before going to bed.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product.  Works great on my night gaurd.  I also have retainers that I soak in the solution.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Keeps my mouth guard clean and fresh. I put it in the solution in the morning and leave it in until just before bedtime, rinse it off and good to go.  I have been using the product for about 6 months and have been changing the solution every 10 days with no issues.Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> this product cleans well, however it tastes very salty.... after a few days...&lt;br /&gt;not so great</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product to clean my night guard.  It keeps my night guard sparkling clean and fresh.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I had been using a standard denture cleaner to clean my bite guard. My bite guard yellowed with age.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this stuff to try to avoid buying a new guard- it cleaned/whitened my guard in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that I can use this product for multiple uses- makes it easy when I am at home.</li>
            <li> If you use a nightguard every night like I do, (thanks to me grinding my teeth) this product is a must. I used to brush my nightguard with my toothbrush using toothpaste and that was fine for a little while. But after some time, the gunk that built up on the nightguard would not come off merely using a toothbrush. Amazon seems to only have 2 products that clean nightguards. The first product I used was called Retainer Brite. However, Retainer Brite was not strong enough. It took some of the surface gunk off the nightguard but certainly not most of the yucky stuff. I thought I would have to throw away my nightguard and buy a new one from my dentist. As many of you know when you order your nightguard from your dentist, who orders the nightguard specifically from the molding of your teeth, they are quite expensive. Unsatisfied, I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between these two products are like night and day. Holy cow! This stuff cleaned virtually ALL of the gunk off my nightguard! It did take a few soakings, as I soaked mine overnight as per instructions. But the result was a shiny, new looking nightguard. I was so happy this with the results, especially since I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you open the packet of this cleaner and pour it into the water, you can smell its minty fresh scent. According to the instructions, one packet of this stuff is good for 7-10 days. And that&#x27;s what I did. I think I may use a packet perhaps once or twice a month so that I am not soaking/cleaning my nightguard everyday, but maybe 1 to 2 weeks per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no damage to the nightguard or making the nightguard itself \\&quot;soft.\\&quot; And so you can soak with confidence. This looks like something that dental professionals would use. I would highly recommend this product. In addition, I had an issue with the delivery and the company promptly took care of the issue. And so they have outstanding and friendly customer service on top of a great product! Can&#x27;t get much better than that!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have had mouth guards for 15 years.  About every 5 years we replaced them.  Lately I been noticing that they were pretty grimy, even though we brush them everyday.  I was about to order a kit to make a new one $80+ dollars each or $500 each at the dentist.  I saw Oral Guard Dental Appliance Cleaner and gave it a shot.  After soaking for 24 hours the mouth guards were extremely clean and looked great.  The next week I soaked them another 24 hours and they got even better.  Of course you brush the mouth guards prior and after the soaking.  I am hoping with periodic cleaning they will look good and clean until they wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to clean mouth guards.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  My tooth guard looks brand new. Yellow stains and tartar buildup are gone.  Will definitely keep ordering.</li>
            <li> I have a mouth guard that I actually stopped using because of the odor. I used toothpaste and mouthwash, and it still had an odor to it. When I told my dentist why I stopped using it, he recommended I try this product. I love it! After soaking for 20 minutes in the morning, that \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot; odor is gone. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this just didn&#x27;t work for me. Not only did my Invisalign retainers not get cleaned, this left behind a strong chemical aftertaste. Quite disappointed with this product, and I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! First product that I;ve used on my nightguard that actually works. It looks almost new. Through the years (I&#x27;ve had nightguards for 20 years) I&#x27;ve tried many products, this is the easiest and Works!</li>
            <li> Much better than what the orthodontist had recommended</li>
            <li> Good product and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product. I needed something to clean the plaque off my nightguard that wouldn&#x27;t damage or weaken it in any way. This worked really well, in my opinion. I followed the directions, kept the solution in a sealable container and would leave my nightguard in it by day (about a 12 hour soak). I would then take it out by night, rinse off any solution, then wear the nightguard for the night. Rinse, repeat for ten days. The plaque was gone by the seventh day (or sooner, I can&#x27;t remember), but I kept soaking it because I like stretching out the use of products for as long as possible. It didn&#x27;t seem to hurt the nightguard. I think I finally threw out the solution when the 14th day hit. I have plenty of packets left, so this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is as great as the reviews. If you use it as directed, it will clean the heck out of a mouth guard. My husband&#x27;s mouth guard was yellow and growing plaque. After 2 times using this stuff, it is crystal clear.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. You won&#x27;t believe how clean your device will be after using this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves a little after taste in your mouth, but does clean the appliance.</li>
            <li> Oral Appliance Cleaner is great&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and works!.  Really cleans the night guard and keeps it looking new. I would recommend this to anyone who has a night guard, no matter now old it is, to keep it clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is interesting stuff.  It reviewed well and I was desperate for something that actually got the iced tea stains out of my appliances. The packaging has no ingredients listed which raised a red flag.  I used it anyway and within the lifespan of the first packet (10 days) my appliances showed real improvement.  I wrote to the company about the ingredients and a representative gladly offered them. The smell of the product is a bit odd, but there was nothing in the ingredient list that you wouldn&#x27;t recognize if you&#x27;re an ingredient reader.  It works. I&#x27;m on my second order.</li>
            <li> This product is a winner. Several years ago I purchased a &amp;#34;Sonic Brite&amp;#34; ultrasonic, battery operated dental cleaner as well as the Sonic Brite powder cleaner, but it appears that this company has gone out of business. Back to square one, I tried many powder cleaners, other than traditional tablets such as Polident, none of which compared to Sonic Brite&#x27;s - until now! Oral Guard&#x27;s product is exceptional AND, I use it in my Sonic Brite container. After 20 minutes in the ultrasonic machine, my partial is sparkling white; gone are the coffee and tea stains. When traveling, I just use the mixture in a plastic container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral Guard is indeed exceptional. Although I would prefer using a fresh mixture daily, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to using the Oral Guard mix 5-7 days, storing the mixture in a plastic container with a secure lid. Obviously, you must cleanse and brush your partial, denture or retainer thoroughly prior to placing it in the reusable mix so it stays clean and fresh for that many reuses. Of note, the product description mentions that it, &amp;#34;May discolor ceramic teeth...&amp;#34;; however, my partial has several porcelain teeth which are not at all adversely effected by this cleaner. Kudos to the manufacturer for offering an outstanding product for home use. Love it so much that I&#x27;m ordering a 6-month supply!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, thinking it was a daily cleaner, but it last for, I belive a month. I really don&#x27;t see a difference in the outcome of using this product. I do use tooth paste for my mouth guard and it seems to do just fine. I use the cleaner every other month, just to use.</li>
            <li> I wear a TAP dental appliance every night and have found NOTHING on the market that keeps my appliance as fresh and clean as the Oral Guard Cleaner.  I put my appliance in the cleaner every morning when I take out off and in the evening, with just a rinse of water, it is fresh and ready to wear overnight.  My appliance was over $1000, so trusting a solution to keep it fresh and clean without harming it was crucial.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for months and it is not only very gentle, but so simple and so easy to use....I will buy nothing else.  This product does everything it says!</li>
            <li> I have found this to be an excellent product. The directions are right on the packet, and they are very clear. The solution keeps my mouthguard very clean, and it is very easy to use. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This really works! Cleans like new. I use it and then put it in a cup of water with sugar sweetener for awhile. Then I put it in my mouth and it tastes sweet!!  You don&#x27;t have too, but I don&#x27;t care for the taste.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a week tomorrow. It came very quickly as described. It&#x27;s SO nice to use now that it is clean!</li>
            <li> Very impressed! Cleans perfectly.</li>
            <li> The product works great at cleaning a nightguard. I didn&#x27;t like that one packet is a 7-10 day supply, therefore you have to always have a container sitting out. When I used tablets I could leave it in the container for 20 min., then rinse and put everything away. I think it cleans better than the tablets I&#x27;ve used in the past though.</li>
            <li> It has been over tens days since I received this product and it really works.  I followed the directions and soaked my mouth guard all day in the solution for the first day and wore my mouth guard that night.  After rinsing and brushing my mouth guard post soaking, there was no taste!  Also almost all of the staining was gone too.  Since then (10 more days) there is very little yellowing.  Please note I have had this professionally made mouth guard for 3 years already.  Will buy this product again.  Shipped quickly and as advertized.</li>
