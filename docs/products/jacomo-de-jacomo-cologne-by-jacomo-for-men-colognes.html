            <li> wow that was a long time ago like 24 years..</li>
            <li> Thirty years ago I used to buy the entire Jacomo line,especially the cologne and deodorant, but you can&#x27;t find the other items anymore.</li>
            <li> but this time it looks like stored for a very long time</li>
            <li> It was a gift for someone who tries other colognes and keeps coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I wore this back in the 80&#x27;s, had a hard time finding it since then, found it here, ordered it</li>
            <li> the scent might be a little sharp at the beginning  </li>
            <li> it mellows out after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I will not buy it again sorry.</li>

            <li> I bought some of this in Hong Kong years ago.  Nice aroma. Bought some recently: smells like menthol and eucalyptus.  Must not be the same stuff.</li>
            <li> Takes me back to my college days I Can&#x27;t believe I found it here. It&#x27;s a classic scent. the scent might be a little sharp at the beginning  it mellows out after a few minutes. It&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li> I use to wear this in the 80&#x27;s back in north Carolina when hammer was saying you can&#x27;t touch this and Charlotte had the hornets...wow that was a long time ago like 24 years.. wow ..I thought they stopped making it I now live in Philly and I have searched for this cologne forever now I have found it...it has a warm spicy type smell that I love I turned my youngest son on to it and he loves it now I gotta buy more just to keep in stash</li>
            <li> My husband did not like the smell. Until now it&#x27;s not being used.</li>

            <li> A familiar scent that still gets compliments.  It was a gift for someone who tries other colognes and keeps coming back to this one. It is not musky and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache when I am in an enclosed area with the person wearing it.</li>
            <li> this is my all-time favorite fragrance - enjoyed thru the 1980&#x27;s - great smell and not over barring - will buy it long as they make</li>
