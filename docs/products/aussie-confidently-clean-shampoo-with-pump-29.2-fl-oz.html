            <li>Awesome design improvement.nd</li>

            <li>Family girls are very happy!</li>
            <li>the pump works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This has excellent conditioning even though it&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
            <li>The bottles are good size with sealed pumps and has that grape kiwi scent I remember!!</li>
            <li>Great value, great product!</li>
            <li>Wait, you just told me that I had beautiful, wonderful hair in great condition.</li>
            <li>Still a great product, just not made to keep the greasies away.</li>
            <li>the size is great.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>I love Aussie products and the price is great!  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s good that I had to search for a cheaper shampoo and conditioner, otherwise  I would not have found this product.  </li>
            <li>Good shampoo with good price.</li>
            <li>I went a good 6 months without using Aussie before deciding to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>And it smells good.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect shampoo to use, just the right &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; and smells very nice.</li>
            <li>I love Aussie products!</li>
            <li>love the pump!  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>works great and the pump makes it so  easy to use.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel great and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Love it! :)</li>
            <li>This shampoo is excellent at removing hair product (as the Citrifier did) and it leaves my Denver-dehydrated hair naturally curly again.  </li>
            <li>i love this shampoo its amazing &amp;&amp; it really helps your hair and the price is great</li>
            <li>Not only do they work wonders in your hair, they smell great as well!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, more like 2-3 times a week, and feel that&#x27;s healthier for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the lite smell.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I will deffinatly be getting more of this.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Even with my Wella Brilliance shampoo, I was crushing up aspirin with a mortar and pestle and adding it to my shampoo to get more flakes off of my scalp.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews before making the purchase, I was hopeful that this product would assist in my hair becoming oily after just one day of washing.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and this one makes my hair its best.</li>
            <li>One of the ingredients is desert lime, so I think that the citric acid works very well as a clarifying agent, and it&#x27;s just amazing.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel better about not being able to afford my \\&quot;usual\\&quot; shampoo, because now this bargain-priced brand has become my new \\&quot;usual.\\</li>
            <li>With Aussie Confidently Clean Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Ordered confidently clean shampoo and instead they sent the 2 in 1 shampoo plus conditioner, I ordered conditioner also, so now I have to reorder just the shampoo...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so long (below my waist) and healthy!</li>
            <li>I figured this product would really help clean out all the gunk from my roots.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product</li>
            <li>So easy for the entire family to use.</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes this brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li>She also really likes the pump, it makes it easier in the shower.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty normal, it can be a tad bit on the oily side.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my scalp was completely flake-free for the first time in my life since I was thirteen</li>
            <li>I decided to try Confidently Clean which states it&#x27;s for essentially any hair.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of shampoo and holy cow, for the price who can beat it?  </li>
            <li>As you can probably guess, I spent more than that on these 2 bottles of shampoo and they will cost a lot more than three dollars to ship back (as I also bought the conditioner - that&#x27;s 4 big bottles totaling twenty-one dollars).</li>
            <li>I also want to mention that these large bottles are shaped with a thin profile so they fit perfectly on your bathtub or shower ledge, and that&#x27;s a big plus for me, especially when I&#x27;ve had 30-ounce shampoo bottles fall on my feet in the shower before because they were too big for the ledge.  </li>
            <li>I can use them because I love the Aussie products, but kind of disappointing that it is not what is pictured.</li>
            <li>I have very soft straight hair, it&#x27;s been compared to &amp;#34;doll&#x27;s hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t really get oily, so a shampoo that is more \\&quot;clarifying\\&quot; isn&#x27;t something I would usually choose.</li>
            <li>I used all the store brands--including dandruff shampoos, deep conditioners, salon brands, and had resorted to paying 30 dollars a bottle for expensive salon shampoo and conditioner that was the best thing I could find to keep away the constant flakes.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>However, nothing got rid of them completely.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has suffered from dry scalp for my whole life, I have tried every shampoo under the sun.</li>
            <li>And when I tell them that I use Aussie, and have for years, the general response begins something like, &amp;#34;Oh noes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and it still works just as well as when I first used it!  </li>
            <li>As an added bonus, this leaves my hair so soft and tangle-free that I can run my fingers through my  hair with zero tangles for two days, even after letting it air dry and sleeping on it!</li>

            <li> This shampoo made my hair limp, without curls and greasy.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s saying a lot, because I have very thick hair that has a lot of different textures and thicknesses in it, so usually air-drying my hair</li>
            <li> So using any shampoos that leave moisturizer or volumizers behind tend to make my hair look greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> No more fumbling with a slippery bottle in the shower!</li>
            <li> product is useless to us since we do not use conditioners.  </li>
            <li> but it must have all kinds of bad things that will eventually damage your hair!!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> then I go home and wash all of their salon crap out of my hair.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s terrible for your hair!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting.</li>

            <li> I love Aussie products! Not only do they work wonders in your hair, they smell great as well! And the pump on the bottle is awesome! No more fumbling with a slippery bottle in the shower!</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes this brand of shampoo. She also really likes the pump, it makes it easier in the shower.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair limp, without curls and greasy. It feels like my hair hasn&#x27;t been washed for a few days, not clean. It feels almost like it&#x27;s not well rinsed, which it is! Won&#x27;t buy this again. Also takes a lot to make a lather.</li>
            <li> Best &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; shampoo I&#x27;ve found. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, more like 2-3 times a week, and feel that&#x27;s healthier for my hair. This is the perfect shampoo to use, just the right &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; and smells very nice. I&#x27;d twice bought this at Grocery Outlet, but can&#x27;t count on them to continue carrying it. And Amazon had this deal I couldn&#x27;t refuse!</li>

I used all the store brands--including dandruff shampoos, deep conditioners, salon brands, and had resorted to paying 30 dollars a bottle for expensive salon shampoo and conditioner that was the best thing I could find to keep away the constant flakes. However, nothing got rid of them completely.  Usually something would work the first time I used it, then it would stop working altogether, if it ever worked at all.  Even with my Wella Brilliance shampoo, I was crushing up aspirin with a mortar and pestle and adding it to my shampoo to get more flakes off of my scalp.  I guess it&#x27;s good that I had to search for a cheaper shampoo and conditioner, otherwise  I would not have found this product.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for umpteen million years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go to the salon for a cut or whatever, and they all say, &amp;#34;What wonderful hair you have! it&#x27;s so long (below my waist) and healthy! (I never blow dry) Don&#x27;t you want to buy some of our expensive salon hair products to make sure it stays so beautiful!?!?!&amp;#34; And when I tell them that I use Aussie, and have for years, the general response begins something like, &amp;#34;Oh noes! But that&#x27;s terrible for your hair!&amp;#34; Wait, you just told me that I had beautiful, wonderful hair in great condition. &amp;#34;Well, yes, but it must have all kinds of bad things that will eventually damage your hair!!!!&amp;#34; But I&#x27;ve been using it for 20-some-odd years. &amp;#34;Oh . . . Oh. Well. OK!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I go home and wash all of their salon crap out of my hair. With Aussie Confidently Clean Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo with good price.</li>
            <li> I was traveling to the US and this was the firs request to bring home. Family girls are very happy!</li>
            <li> I am definitely hooked on this shampoo.I have long hair down to my waist.Love the way it makes my hair feel!</li>

            <li> I had previously tried the moisturizing shampoo which made my hair extremely oily after about a month of use. I decided to try Confidently Clean which states it&#x27;s for essentially any hair. My hair is pretty normal, it can be a tad bit on the oily side. I figured this product would really help clean out all the gunk from my roots. I went a good 6 months without using Aussie before deciding to purchase this product. After just 4 DAYS my hair was unbearably oily. It looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered in 2 weeks. Absolutely disgusting. I tried calling them up to get a refund, on the recording they say they&#x27;ll only reimburse you up to five dollars for the product and three dollars for the shipping. As you can probably guess, I spent more than that on these 2 bottles of shampoo and they will cost a lot more than three dollars to ship back (as I also bought the conditioner - that&#x27;s 4 big bottles totaling twenty-one dollars). I guess I should have purchased the product from a store before trying to save money and buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of shampoo and holy cow, for the price who can beat it?  I would recommend to anyone and I an definitely going to be reordering.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews before making the purchase, I was hopeful that this product would assist in my hair becoming oily after just one day of washing. It helped some,  but not like I expected. Still a great product, just not made to keep the greasies away.</li>

            <li> Great value, great product!</li>
            <li> does what it states and the size is great. the pump works perfectly. Great product and I know I will use again and again</li>
            <li> Your description of this product is misleading since it does not include the fact that this is a CONDITIONING shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This product is useless to us since we do not use conditioners.  I tried to return it on the Amazon website, but was unable.&lt;br /&gt;Will no longer trust your product descriptions.</li>
            <li> This is for the 2-1 shampoo/conditioner NOT the shampoo.  I have ordered it twice and both times the 2-1 was shipped.  I can use them because I love the Aussie products, but kind of disappointing that it is not what is pictured.</li>
            <li> I love Aussie products and the price is great!  I have tried other brands and this one makes my hair its best.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic! This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry, like some other shampoos can do. This has excellent conditioning even though it&#x27;s shampoo. Don&#x27;t need conditioner with this. And it smells good.</li>
            <li> Wow! I forgot about this shampoo I used in the 80s so had to buy!! The bottles are good size with sealed pumps and has that grape kiwi scent I remember!! Love it! :)</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo its amazing &amp;&amp; it really helps your hair and the price is great i would recomend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I chose this shampoo because I used to use Aussie Citrifier Shampoo (which they no longer make).  This shampoo is excellent at removing hair product (as the Citrifier did) and it leaves my Denver-dehydrated hair naturally curly again.  Love it!</li>
