            <li>I tan very easily</li>
            <li>This lotion is by far the best Ive used.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have been tanning for years and this lotion by far is the best ever!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, good smell, nice deep bronze tan in no time at all, and I&#x27;m very fair skin type.</li>
            <li>I Love the first 2 all was great with the lotion .</li>
            <li>The lotion glides on smoothly making it easy to get good coverage.  </li>
            <li>After just those 2 days I could already see a huge difference!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been awhile since I found a bronzer that I love.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>One of the best by Designer Skin, I would definitely recommend but it is pricey.</li>
            <li>it was something else for sure .</li>
            <li>(they wanted $140) on amazon :))))</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>i am turning a very beautiful bronze color now finally found what i wanted.i would recommend this product for everyone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>They always charge way more than you can find online</li>
            <li>gotta love my first diamond ;) Great product, and buying on Amazon opposed to tanning salons saves hundreds!!!</li>
            <li>that is why I bought 2 bottles off Amazon for way better price then my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>better</li>
            <li>It is pretty good , I would say it met my expectations.</li>
            <li>This is a great tanning lotion it dont have any of the after tanning smell and it leaves your skin very soft</li>
            <li>I Love the dark color I get,  Best product.  </li>
            <li>Got it exactly when I was suppose to !! :)</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your hands after application, bronzers are VERY powerful.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever gotten so many compliments on my tan!</li>
            <li>: The texture is lightweight, non-greasy, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The smell was so strong</li>
            <li>Hands down one of the best bronzers I have ever used by Designer Skin.</li>
            <li>I am no stranger to designer skin products and actually really like most of their products!</li>
            <li>and it goes on very smoothly and gives your skin a nice soft feel.</li>
            <li>It smells like self-tanner and is very strong at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap when it comes to buying lotions</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>The light tan color I got using this worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and makes your skin look good.</li>
            <li>It gives good color, but not dark enough and it doesn&#x27;t smell that great either.</li>
            <li>It has significantly reduced the amount of time needed in the tannjng bed as well.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Definitley worth the money!</li>
            <li>the original one</li>
            <li>The smell right after you tan is just like every other lotion, but it has the fragrance time release so within 30 minutes it smells very good.</li>
            <li>Received really fast &amp; the lotion was the exact kind you buy in the salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and already see amazing results.</li>
            <li>This has got to be my absolute favorite bronzing lotion.</li>
            <li>However, the tan enhancers, bronzers and moisturizers in Elusive are much more intense.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the color Ive got after one application only.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is don&#x27;t shower for several hours after applying this lotion, and use a good after tanning lotion to lock in that color.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, very thick, great bronzers.  </li>
            <li>Recieved the product quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, as I just got it today, but after just one use I got super good results!</li>
            <li>After tanning the scent was very fresh and clean smelling, not like most other tanning lotions which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>I love that it has a nice smell as well, so I dont have to run home to shower it off immediately like the other smelly lotions.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for a nice bronzy tan &amp; fast results.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how anyone can get good results with this product unless you don&#x27;t mind the streaking!</li>
            <li>Love it so far!</li>
            <li>The smell of Elusive is nice... a little floral without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY greasy feeling and the smell reminds me of cheap tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>This bottle was filled with straight self tanner.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the time and money.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think its worth the price</li>
            <li>I have used by far cheaper products with better results.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but oh so worth it.</li>
            <li>So far this one is my favorite and the best.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I have been using designer skin&#x27;s tanning lotion for years now, but this by far is my FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>Neutral smell more on the masculine side.</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>Right after I bought it</li>
            <li>I would recommend Black Grease way, way better, and much better</li>
            <li>Nice thick consistency, goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>I have light skin and live in the rainy NW.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth all the hype at all.</li>
            <li>This lotion will get you results fast!</li>
            <li>Will return to buy more again in the future.</li>
            <li>This lotion is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>My honest opinion is this lotion is more like a cheap fake tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use people asked me if I got a spray tan because it gives me that much color!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more (:</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it makes you darker after second tanning</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty pleasant, it does not smell like the usual tanning lotion smell.</li>
            <li>I would stock way up on this product if your serious about great color.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly &amp; looks great but unfortunately does not smell fresh.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care much about that</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but I really had to say something about this .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>Really like this lotion ..</li>
            <li>the ones bought at the store makes me wonder whats really in it</li>
            <li>Washes off fast.</li>
            <li>and I turned straight orange and had streaks all over my legs.</li>
            <li>Also not to mention my finger nails and cuticles are so freaken orange from rubbing this lotion on and smell like straight self tanner.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this tanning lotion and now I am scared to buy any from amazon.</li>
            <li>Any bottle you purchase will most likely be old and or tampered.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unsure if you want this or any other lotion then buy a sample packet or 2 to test it out :)</li>
            <li>I have used many products from Designer Skin, and lots from other companies.  </li>
            <li>Little pricey but worth it, you&#x27;ll get amazing color in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>It not only gets you bronze super fast</li>
            <li>I usually use Diamond status by Devoted which is also 100% amazing .</li>
            <li>I like the color that Black Ink better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Arrived early &amp; was an even better product than I expected!</li>
            <li>Love the color it gives , but a little greasy and oily leaves ur skin oily/ greasy</li>
            <li>It smells great, BUT the formula is very thick which I dislike!</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about the fragrance -- just the same old &amp;#34;I went tanning smell&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and absolutely not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I tried this lotion as a sample at the tanning salon, but it was too expensive to buy a full one there, so I ordered it on Amazon, because I thought it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product  DARK, DARK, DARK</li>
            <li>The lotion also is tinted which is nice if you want a little bit of instant color</li>
            <li>Package arrived brand new sealed.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to lotion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty basic smelling</li>
            <li>I got this for a fraction of the price my salon sold it and it was exactly the same as I tested a bottle from them as well.</li>
            <li>The only con is it can easily stain your hands if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li>, I got the same color from it, and the smell is a little better to me.</li>
            <li>Seems the lotion is old or else</li>
            <li>, this is definitely the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion twice so far</li>
            <li>Compared to the $145 the tanning salon tries to charge the price on here is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Because it gets dark so quickly, I alternate this with another brand&#x27;s non-bronzer lotion to avoid looking too dark.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again and if others are looking for a fast acting bronzer from Designer Skin I strongly suggest Luminary instead.</li>
            <li>Worth buying even though it&#x27;s a little bit spendy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing but smells weird</li>
            <li>I had gotten pretty dark, but was sitting still at the level I was at.  </li>
            <li>and I got dark on the first use.</li>
            <li>I paid over $60 less than I did on my first bottle at salon and quality</li>
            <li>The color I get from Elusive is deeper, darker and lasts MUCH longer than the color I get from any other lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works extremely well, has lots of bronzer in it, and you don&#x27;t need much to see a difference in your tanning results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>At first reading some of the reviews I had saw that customers were getting ones that were used , or expired so I was a little stingy of ordering tanning lotion off of Amazon .</li>

            <li> Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> The savings are over the top!</li>
            <li> It gives a nice bronze colored tan, with no orange color whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent that amplifies after tanning.</li>
            <li> price was awesome aND shipping was fast</li>
            <li> and it goes on nice also.</li>
            <li> It works as any bronzer does and my skin felt nice and didn&#x27;t smell after use.</li>
            <li> Perfect,  fast delivery.</li>
            <li> so I got super happy</li>
            <li> I tan very easily</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far the best Ive used.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years and this lotion by far is the best ever!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, good smell, nice deep bronze tan in no time at all, and I&#x27;m very fair skin type.</li>
            <li> I Love the first 2 all was great with the lotion .</li>
            <li> The lotion glides on smoothly making it easy to get good coverage.  </li>
            <li> After just those 2 days I could already see a huge difference!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since I found a bronzer that I love.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> One of the best by Designer Skin, I would definitely recommend but it is pricey.</li>
            <li> it was something else for sure .</li>
            <li> (they wanted $140) on amazon :))))</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> i am turning a very beautiful bronze color now finally found what i wanted.i would recommend this product for everyone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> They always charge way more than you can find online</li>
            <li> gotta love my first diamond ;) Great product, and buying on Amazon opposed to tanning salons saves hundreds!!!</li>
            <li> that is why I bought 2 bottles off Amazon for way better price then my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> better</li>
            <li> It is pretty good , I would say it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning lotion it dont have any of the after tanning smell and it leaves your skin very soft</li>
            <li> I Love the dark color I get,  Best product.  </li>
            <li> Got it exactly when I was suppose to !! :)</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your hands after application, bronzers are VERY powerful.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever gotten so many compliments on my tan!</li>
            <li> : The texture is lightweight, non-greasy, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best bronzers I have ever used by Designer Skin.</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to designer skin products and actually really like most of their products!</li>
            <li> and it goes on very smoothly and gives your skin a nice soft feel.</li>
            <li> It smells like self-tanner and is very strong at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap when it comes to buying lotions</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> The light tan color I got using this worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and makes your skin look good.</li>
            <li> It gives good color, but not dark enough and it doesn&#x27;t smell that great either.</li>
            <li> It has significantly reduced the amount of time needed in the tannjng bed as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Definitley worth the money!</li>
            <li> the original one</li>
            <li> The smell right after you tan is just like every other lotion, but it has the fragrance time release so within 30 minutes it smells very good.</li>
            <li> Received really fast &amp; the lotion was the exact kind you buy in the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and already see amazing results.</li>
            <li> This has got to be my absolute favorite bronzing lotion.</li>
            <li> However, the tan enhancers, bronzers and moisturizers in Elusive are much more intense.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the color Ive got after one application only.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is don&#x27;t shower for several hours after applying this lotion, and use a good after tanning lotion to lock in that color.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell, very thick, great bronzers.  </li>
            <li> Recieved the product quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, as I just got it today, but after just one use I got super good results!</li>
            <li> After tanning the scent was very fresh and clean smelling, not like most other tanning lotions which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I love that it has a nice smell as well, so I dont have to run home to shower it off immediately like the other smelly lotions.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for a nice bronzy tan &amp; fast results.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how anyone can get good results with this product unless you don&#x27;t mind the streaking!</li>
            <li> Love it so far!</li>
            <li> The smell of Elusive is nice... a little floral without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY greasy feeling and the smell reminds me of cheap tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This bottle was filled with straight self tanner.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think its worth the price</li>
            <li> I have used by far cheaper products with better results.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but oh so worth it.</li>
            <li> So far this one is my favorite and the best.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I have been using designer skin&#x27;s tanning lotion for years now, but this by far is my FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> Neutral smell more on the masculine side.</li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> Right after I bought it</li>
            <li> I would recommend Black Grease way, way better, and much better</li>
            <li> Nice thick consistency, goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> I have light skin and live in the rainy NW.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth all the hype at all.</li>
            <li> This lotion will get you results fast!</li>
            <li> Will return to buy more again in the future.</li>
            <li> This lotion is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> My honest opinion is this lotion is more like a cheap fake tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use people asked me if I got a spray tan because it gives me that much color!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more (:</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it makes you darker after second tanning</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty pleasant, it does not smell like the usual tanning lotion smell.</li>
            <li> I would stock way up on this product if your serious about great color.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly &amp; looks great but unfortunately does not smell fresh.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care much about that</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> but I really had to say something about this .</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> Really like this lotion ..</li>
            <li> the ones bought at the store makes me wonder whats really in it</li>
            <li> Washes off fast.</li>
            <li> and I turned straight orange and had streaks all over my legs.</li>
            <li> Also not to mention my finger nails and cuticles are so freaken orange from rubbing this lotion on and smell like straight self tanner.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this tanning lotion and now I am scared to buy any from amazon.</li>
            <li> Any bottle you purchase will most likely be old and or tampered.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure if you want this or any other lotion then buy a sample packet or 2 to test it out :)</li>
            <li> I have used many products from Designer Skin, and lots from other companies.  </li>
            <li> Little pricey but worth it, you&#x27;ll get amazing color in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> It not only gets you bronze super fast</li>
            <li> I usually use Diamond status by Devoted which is also 100% amazing .</li>
            <li> I like the color that Black Ink better.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Arrived early &amp; was an even better product than I expected!</li>
            <li> Love the color it gives , but a little greasy and oily leaves ur skin oily/ greasy</li>
            <li> It smells great, BUT the formula is very thick which I dislike!</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about the fragrance -- just the same old &amp;#34;I went tanning smell&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and absolutely not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion as a sample at the tanning salon, but it was too expensive to buy a full one there, so I ordered it on Amazon, because I thought it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product  DARK, DARK, DARK</li>
            <li> The lotion also is tinted which is nice if you want a little bit of instant color</li>
            <li> Package arrived brand new sealed.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to lotion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty basic smelling</li>
            <li> I got this for a fraction of the price my salon sold it and it was exactly the same as I tested a bottle from them as well.</li>
            <li> The only con is it can easily stain your hands if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li> , I got the same color from it, and the smell is a little better to me.</li>
            <li> Seems the lotion is old or else</li>
            <li> , this is definitely the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion twice so far</li>
            <li> Compared to the $145 the tanning salon tries to charge the price on here is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Because it gets dark so quickly, I alternate this with another brand&#x27;s non-bronzer lotion to avoid looking too dark.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again and if others are looking for a fast acting bronzer from Designer Skin I strongly suggest Luminary instead.</li>
            <li> Worth buying even though it&#x27;s a little bit spendy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing but smells weird</li>
            <li> I had gotten pretty dark, but was sitting still at the level I was at.  </li>
            <li> and I got dark on the first use.</li>
            <li> I paid over $60 less than I did on my first bottle at salon and quality</li>
            <li> The color I get from Elusive is deeper, darker and lasts MUCH longer than the color I get from any other lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works extremely well, has lots of bronzer in it, and you don&#x27;t need much to see a difference in your tanning results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> At first reading some of the reviews I had saw that customers were getting ones that were used , or expired so I was a little stingy of ordering tanning lotion off of Amazon .</li>
            <li> , Id rather use DOWN RIGHT DARK</li>
            <li> Not only did I get super dark after one use, I also got a little pink after second day!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I use it in a high UVA bed and within one session I am a few shades darker.</li>
            <li> will see instant results and color stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> but I waited too long and decided to open it.</li>
            <li> The bottle I got was old was odd coloured...</li>
            <li> Since it does give you instant color just be careful you put it on evenly</li>
            <li> I used a cheaper one in past years that smelled like melted caramels and had no after tan odor, but it was discontinued - naturally!</li>
            <li> recommendation is put this lotion on before going to the tanning salon, it&#x27;s hard to spread, much thicker than other DS lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The ONLY down side..</li>
            <li> After trying different one, Ive got a keeper AND for over half price of the tanning salon</li>
            <li> but I personally like Black Ink</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and this bottle was not right .</li>
            <li> This lotion gives me great color and doesn&#x27;t have a horrible scent to it.</li>
            <li> It came faster then expected.</li>
            <li> I never really gave it a chance.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it is worth it if you can afford it.  </li>
            <li> Plus the bottle is so stiff that it&#x27;s hard to get the lotion out n for as much as I paid for this lotion</li>
            <li> Well I got one in July 2015 and I half to say something was not right about the lotion it did not smell the same</li>
            <li> Not an overpowering smell, but does not have a bad after smell like many other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> And, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> has been out in extreme temperature conditions.</li>
            <li> The scent seems like any other tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I used a sticker and I definitely got a few shades darker after tanning one time with this lotion!</li>
            <li> Item came in plastic wrapping and looked sharp.  </li>
            <li> Elusive is a total joke and waste of money!</li>
            <li> , he couldn&#x27;t believe how dark I got after using it just one time.</li>
            <li> The only negative about it is it washes off.</li>
            <li> Too dark for winter use.</li>
            <li> I would look so dark then get in shower and down the drain it went.</li>
            <li> plus its half the price</li>
            <li> Well I read previous comments about this product and should say this tanning lotion is</li>
            <li> It gives off an orange hue, not bright orange, but it&#x27;s the only DS I&#x27;ve ever used that caused that to happen.</li>
            <li> I was using the Black before this and was getting a little color with it.</li>
            <li> I was so dark!</li>
            <li> I am very dark just after 5 tans and this will not turn you orange.</li>
            <li> Clearly, a waste of my time n</li>
            <li> I used it everyday</li>
            <li> The smell is very faint when smelling it from the bottle, when you put it on it&#x27;s not an overpowering scent at all which I really like.</li>
            <li> and it makes my husband very dark and is rubbing it in my face!  </li>
            <li> From the way it goes on to the way it smells after tanning there is nothing to not love about this lotion.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy from this seller again .I</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is but its extremely thick and does not blend as well as</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to squeeze lotion out the bottle...</li>
            <li> I was DARK!!!</li>
            <li> The smell and feel seemed to be the same, but it gave a weird color, and eventually game me a rash.  </li>
            <li> for beginner.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick, &amp; my skin drank it up.</li>
            <li> This bottle is just the same as the very Expensive bottle I purchased from the salon.</li>
            <li> I take my tanning quite seriously</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to ANYONE who is serious about tanning with Designer Skin products.</li>
            <li> And makes my tan look fake and uneven.</li>
            <li> I feel like I got ripped off buying the last bottle :(</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s way to expensive in the salon.</li>
            <li> I hope they are not selling fake Items .</li>
            <li> It was in the correct bottle just the wrong product inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> Now I know why it was kinda expensive</li>
            <li> smelt weird nothing like eluisive.</li>
            <li> I know that is expensive</li>
            <li> I thought it was a fake product</li>
            <li> but it was the advertising and the label on the wrapped package that was just wrong.</li>
            <li> hate to write negative comments about sellers</li>
            <li> I was so mad</li>
            <li> I was totally mad and disappointed</li>
            <li> Including my face (but not quite as bad as my legs).</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about this seller before I bought the 1st bottle  :(</li>
            <li> I tan every Winter/Spring to get a base color started.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed for the cost :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful I. Tan with it and took a bath  couple hours</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> So disgusted!</li>
            <li> The Hype - Very Disappointed!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works perfect darkest tan I ever had. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Arrived early &amp; was an even better product than I expected!</li>
            <li> best tanning lotion ever</li>
            <li> Love the color it gives , but a little greasy and oily leaves ur skin oily/ greasy</li>
            <li> bought for great price and met every expectation I had. It came faster then expected. I would use this seler again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I never really gave it a chance.</li>
            <li> Designer skin does not authorize the sale of it&#x27;s lotion online. Any bottle you purchase will most likely be old and or tampered. Elusive is not supposed to streak or turn orange at all. Take your bottle into a tanning salon and see the difference.</li>
            <li> It leaves yellow between fingers and around feet</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I was using the Black before this and was getting a little color with it. Within 2 visits with Elusive I was so dark! I tan very easily but this lotion helps take it to the next level. The smell right after you tan is just like every other lotion, but it has the fragrance time release so within 30 minutes it smells very good. I will definitely purchase again!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly &amp; looks great but unfortunately does not smell fresh. Seems the lotion is old or else has been out in extreme temperature conditions. Very disappointed for the cost :(</li>
            <li> I have wanted this lotion sense it came out! But it&#x27;s way to expensive in the salon. I love the color it gives! The scent seems like any other tanning lotion it&#x27;s pretty basic smelling but I don&#x27;t care much about that, I couldn&#x27;t be more happy I found this on here, 100 dollars cheeper than in the salon! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Although it does give you good color I really don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth all the hype at all. It&#x27;s VERY greasy feeling and the smell reminds me of cheap tanning lotion. When I put it on I noticed it was going on and didn&#x27;t seem to be rubbing in. I thought it might just take a minute to absorb into my skin but all I did was slip and slide all over the tanning bed. After I got out I felt like I had a sticky coating all over my body. I&#x27;ll keep it and use it up but would never purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far the best Ive used. It gives a nice bronze colored tan, with no orange color whatsoever. I love that it has a nice smell as well, so I dont have to run home to shower it off immediately like the other smelly lotions. It has significantly reduced the amount of time needed in the tannjng bed as well. I will be sticking with this lotion for sure!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion! It not only gets you bronze super fast but it is also good for your skin. It has a nice scent that amplifies after tanning. It was a great choice and I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the lotion!</li>
            <li> I tried a sample packet of this at my salon and 1 of those packets lasts me 2 days. After just those 2 days I could already see a huge difference! I was ecstatic. I&#x27;m cheap when it comes to buying lotions haha but I&#x27;m considering buying the bottle of this. If you&#x27;re unsure if you want this or any other lotion then buy a sample packet or 2 to test it out :) it&#x27;s worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> Package arrived brand new sealed. The color and scent matches the lotion in salon perfectly if anyone is weary about buying online, this is definitely the real stuff. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, as I just got it today, but after just one use I got super good results! I used a sticker and I definitely got a few shades darker after tanning one time with this lotion! My husband even noticed the difference when I got home, he couldn&#x27;t believe how dark I got after using it just one time. The smell is very faint when smelling it from the bottle, when you put it on it&#x27;s not an overpowering scent at all which I really like. After tanning the scent was very fresh and clean smelling, not like most other tanning lotions which is a huge plus! Already love this lotion! And the price on amazon compared to the 145$ in salon is a steal of a deal! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Tried this at the Tanning Salon, works well.  They wanted to charge $175 for this product!  I like the bronzer that is in he lotion.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion! Will never use anything else again! Definitley worth the money!</li>
            <li> Received really fast &amp; the lotion was the exact kind you buy in the salon. I am so tan now!!! This lotion will get you results fast! Will return to buy more again in the future.</li>
            <li> Awesome product  DARK, DARK, DARK</li>
            <li> Item came in plastic wrapping and looked sharp.  On time shipping and great price (compared to salons)! I love this lotion, good smell, nice deep bronze tan in no time at all, and I&#x27;m very fair skin type. BONUS: this item came with a packet of lotion!!</li>
            <li> From the way it goes on to the way it smells after tanning there is nothing to not love about this lotion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this lotion!!! I have purchased this lotion 4 times &amp; it&#x27;s my favorite!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t smell flowery or fruity, so is good for both males and females.</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion !</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion!  The best bronzer I have ever used! Got it exactly when I was suppose to !! :)</li>
            <li> Works great. Sold for twice this in salon.</li>
            <li> It smells great, BUT the formula is very thick which I dislike! Plus the bottle is so stiff that it&#x27;s hard to get the lotion out n for as much as I paid for this lotion I wanna use every last drop, which probably won&#x27;t happen unless I cut the dang thing open. Ohh and it left a streak on my arm which I have never had a lotion do before. I take my tanning quite seriously so I definitely won&#x27;t be using elusive again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> This gives a wonderful tan really!  Highly recommend for a nice bronzy tan &amp; fast results.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This lotion gives me great color and doesn&#x27;t have a horrible scent to it. The only con is it can easily stain your hands if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since I found a bronzer that I love. Love this lotion! Definitely recommend! The lotion also is tinted which is nice if you want a little bit of instant color</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is fantastic!  It is a good bronzer. It feels soft and makes your skin look good. It is expensive, but it is worth it if you can afford it.  One does not have to use a lot, too.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion and I did like it, but I don&#x27;t think its worth the price, Id rather use DOWN RIGHT DARK be Ed Hardy, I got the same color from it, and the smell is a little better to me. plus its half the price</li>
            <li> I Love the dark color I get,  Best product.  Save your money and but it from Amazon, not your tanning salon.</li>
            <li> This lotion is mediocre at best. It gives off an orange hue, not bright orange, but it&#x27;s the only DS I&#x27;ve ever used that caused that to happen. Follow the directions and wash your hands ASAP after applying because it does stain. It has a chemical smell. I don&#x27;t know where the &amp;#34;Ozonic Lily&amp;#34; scent comes into play.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The texture is lightweight, non-greasy, and easy to apply. The results were also visible on me within one session. Because it gets dark so quickly, I alternate this with another brand&#x27;s non-bronzer lotion to avoid looking too dark.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again and if others are looking for a fast acting bronzer from Designer Skin I strongly suggest Luminary instead.</li>
            <li> I work for a tanning salon company and have used tons of different brands of lotion. This is probably one of the best lotions I have ever used. I used it one time and got instant color and I am still getting darker. The ONLY down side.. it smells..bad. It smells like self-tanner and is very strong at first but you forget about it after a while. Since it does give you instant color just be careful you put it on evenly and it may stain between your fingers if you don&#x27;t wipe it off. One of the best by Designer Skin, I would definitely recommend but it is pricey.</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to designer skin products and actually really like most of their products! I however WILL NOT be buying this one again! It leaves steaks all over my body. Including my face (but not quite as bad as my legs). And makes my tan look fake and uneven. I have used by far cheaper products with better results. My honest opinion is this lotion is more like a cheap fake tanning lotion. I am not sure how anyone can get good results with this product unless you don&#x27;t mind the streaking! Wish I could post a picture!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this Lotion 3 times now from amazon . I Love the first 2 all was great with the lotion . Well I got one in July 2015 and I half to say something was not right about the lotion it did not smell the same did not work the same and it was not sealed like all the others I have purchased and the cap were you pour the lotion out would not stay in the bottle . I feel like I got ripped off buying the last bottle :( I won&#x27;t what I paid for and I don&#x27;t think I got Elusive in the Bottle it was something else for sure . I have been using this product for a long time and this bottle was not right . Not sure I will buy from this seller again .I hate to write negative comments about sellers but I really had to say something about this . I hope they are not selling fake Items .</li>
            <li> I switched to this lotion about a month ago from a different type of Designer Skin and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference.  Compared to the $145 the tanning salon tries to charge the price on here is well worth it.  Nice smell, very thick, great bronzers.  I&#x27;m finding it doesn&#x27;t turn me the orange and it makes my husband very dark and is rubbing it in my face!  And, a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s lasting longer than my last bottle.</li>
            <li> Really like this lotion .. price was awesome aND shipping was fast</li>
            <li> It gives good color, but not dark enough and it doesn&#x27;t smell that great either. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I do like the smell and it goes on nice also. The only negative about it is it washes off. I would look so dark then get in shower and down the drain it went. But if you want to get a extra boosta to go out on a date then this is it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!  Will place another order when needed!!!</li>
            <li> YUK, STREAKING, DID NOT COVER WELL!!!! NOT A FAN.</li>
            <li> This has got to be my absolute favorite bronzing lotion. I use it in a high UVA bed and within one session I am a few shades darker. It is pricey, but oh so worth it. Whenever I use people asked me if I got a spray tan because it gives me that much color!</li>
            <li> Well I read previous comments about this product and should say this tanning lotion is great!!!!Every summer I do research on tanning lotions. So far this one is my favorite and the best.&lt;br /&gt;You will see instant results and color stays for a long time. Worth buying even though it&#x27;s a little bit spendy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful I. Tan with it and took a bath  couple hours and it washed off  I was so mad but this seller was great and  fast don&#x27;t waste your money on the tan stuff</li>
            <li> I thought I had hit the lotion jackpot when I discovered Designer Skin&#x27;s Luminary. It was the best I had tried. However, the tan enhancers, bronzers and moisturizers in Elusive are much more intense. The color I get from Elusive is deeper, darker and lasts MUCH longer than the color I get from any other lotion.</li>
            <li> Imposter!! Front label was removed from&lt;br /&gt;Bottled. I was duped. Don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is but its extremely thick and does not blend as well as the ones bought at the store makes me wonder whats really in it</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the color Ive got after one application only. It did not dry out my skin, I got increasingly darker as days went by. The smell is pretty pleasant, it does not smell like the usual tanning lotion smell. After trying different one, Ive got a keeper AND for over half price of the tanning salon (they wanted $140) on amazon :))))</li>
            <li> It is pretty good , I would say it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Bronzers are great, no tingle.  Leaves skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Great Lotion @ 1/2 of the price that you pay @ the salon!!! Can tell the difference in my tan after just one use. Will order again!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Leaves you orange. Washes off fast.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion twice so far and I swear I&#x27;m 4 shades darker, this lotion is so great&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is put this lotion on before going to the tanning salon, it&#x27;s hard to spread, much thicker than other DS lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from east west beauty and it&#x27;s 100% authentic!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works great!</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; works fabulously!!!</li>
            <li> Love it so far! Not an overpowering smell, but does not have a bad after smell like many other lotions I&#x27;ve used. Make sure you wash your hands after application, bronzers are VERY powerful. Nice thick consistency, goes on very smooth. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Got sample packet w the &amp;#34;illuminary&amp;#34; I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve for Cherokee Indian in me &amp; never burn. Not only did I get super dark after one use, I also got a little pink after second day!&lt;br /&gt;Not for beginner.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick, &amp; my skin drank it up. First time I&#x27;ve ever gotten so many compliments on my tan! Makes my bottle of illuminary &amp; conceited seem like garbage lol</li>
            <li> I have been using designer skin&#x27;s tanning lotion for years now, but this by far is my FAVORITE. must buy!</li>
            <li> it smells like rub on tanner</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> I got this for a fraction of the price my salon sold it and it was exactly the same as I tested a bottle from them as well. It works as any bronzer does and my skin felt nice and didn&#x27;t smell after use.</li>
            <li> I tan every Winter/Spring to get a base color started.  I have used many products from Designer Skin, and lots from other companies.  This by far is the best product I have ever used.  Within two sessions I was darker than I ever have been.  I had gotten pretty dark, but was sitting still at the level I was at.  This broke through that barrier.  The smell is awesome.  My suggestion is don&#x27;t shower for several hours after applying this lotion, and use a good after tanning lotion to lock in that color.  I would stock way up on this product if your serious about great color.</li>
            <li> Neutral smell more on the masculine side. Doesn&#x27;t stain your hands on application. All around great lotion</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Great smell and also works great!!</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion. Arrived on time and lotion was in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and already see amazing results. The scent is light and absolutely not overpowering at all. I am so happy I discovered this lotion. I usually use Diamond status by Devoted which is also 100% amazing . This is my new go to lotion.</li>
            <li> You want one of the best bronzes out there? This is it!</li>
            <li> This bottle was filled with straight self tanner. The smell was so strong and I turned straight orange and had streaks all over my legs. Also not to mention my finger nails and cuticles are so freaken orange from rubbing this lotion on and smell like straight self tanner. I compared it to the one at the tanning salon I go to and the smell and color was totally off. It was in the correct bottle just the wrong product inside the bottle. I was totally mad and disappointed cause I really wanted this tanning lotion and now I am scared to buy any from amazon.</li>
            <li> I have heard nothing but good things about this lotion, I tried a pkt of it and I liked it, got great color from it. I bought the bottle and i swear within 3 seasons I was DARK!!! Hands down one of the best bronzers I have ever used by Designer Skin. I would recommend this to ANYONE who is serious about tanning with Designer Skin products. Now I know why it was kinda expensive, you get what you pay for. LOVED IT!!! Will be buying again for sure!!!</li>
            <li> So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. The bottle I got was old was odd coloured...smelt weird nothing like eluisive. I still gave it a try after reading the posts. Clearly, a waste of my time n I am returning it.</li>
            <li> One of the best tanning bed lotions I have ever used! The savings are over the top! I paid over $60 less than I did on my first bottle at salon and quality was just as great. Wish I knew about this seller before I bought the 1st bottle  :(</li>
            <li> i am turning a very beautiful bronze color now finally found what i wanted.i would recommend this product for everyone</li>
            <li> The lotion glides on smoothly making it easy to get good coverage.  I have light skin and live in the rainy NW.  The light tan color I got using this worked well for me.  There is nothing special about the fragrance -- just the same old &amp;#34;I went tanning smell&amp;#34;.  I used a cheaper one in past years that smelled like melted caramels and had no after tan odor, but it was discontinued - naturally! I was hoping for something similar with this product. It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> I have been using designer skin products for years and they never disappoint. The smell of Elusive is nice... a little floral without being overwhelming. I also like that it gives me a bronze look without making me look orange or streak-y. This will not turn your hands orange and it goes on very smoothly and gives your skin a nice soft feel. Would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Never buy this at a tanning salon.  They always charge way more than you can find online (Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;Tanning Salon Price: $149&lt;br /&gt;Amazon: $59&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works extremely well, has lots of bronzer in it, and you don&#x27;t need much to see a difference in your tanning results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying it from amazon.</li>
            <li> Too dark for winter use.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion as a sample at the tanning salon, but it was too expensive to buy a full one there, so I ordered it on Amazon, because I thought it was amazing.  I don&#x27;t know if the seller did something to this, but I did not like the one I got here. The smell and feel seemed to be the same, but it gave a weird color, and eventually game me a rash.  I would recommend Black Grease way, way better, and much better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is way over-priced.</li>
            <li> gotta love my first diamond ;) Great product, and buying on Amazon opposed to tanning salons saves hundreds!!!</li>
            <li> I was at my tanning salon and I was out of tanning lotion so I bought one of these. I paid $ 110.00 for it. I know that is expensive that is why I bought 2 bottles off Amazon for way better price then my tanning salon. I used it everyday and I got dark on the first use. I found this bronzer to work on on me really good except the lower part of my legs. Which I was told by different people the legs are the hardest to tan because we shave. Yes I would recommend this bronzer.</li>
            <li> Right after I bought it I regret ed it because the title says 30x and there is no such thing as elusive 30x bronzer. I wanted to return it as soon as I got it but I waited too long and decided to open it. Turns out it is 50x and the original one so I got super happy I didn&#x27;t return it. I used it and I loved it! I thought it was a fake product but it was the advertising and the label on the wrapped package that was just wrong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing but smells weird</li>
            <li> Recieved the product quick. Smell great. Hopefully it works as well as it smells.</li>
            <li> Def one of the best lotions on the market!! Gives an awesome tan and you see results after one time!!!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I decided to give it a try. It stained and streaked my skin. I was already tan from Private Reserve. I should of stuck with it. Elusive is a total joke and waste of money! So disgusted! Save your $ !!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!! Just after 2 tans I could see a remarkable difference!!! I am very dark just after 5 tans and this will not turn you orange.</li>
            <li> Not everything it is hyped up to be.  The price does not reflect the quality.</li>
            <li> This is not elusive. I work at a tanning salon, this product is a different color and smells very different. I used it and it came off in my shower.</li>
            <li> Greatest lotion ever! I have been tanning for years and this lotion by far is the best ever! Little pricey but worth it, you&#x27;ll get amazing color in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> This bottle is just the same as the very Expensive bottle I purchased from the salon.</li>
            <li> At first reading some of the reviews I had saw that customers were getting ones that were used , or expired so I was a little stingy of ordering tanning lotion off of Amazon . Too be honest ordering off here and selecting elusive tanning lotion was the best decision I made ! I&#x27;ve only been tanning twice this week and color is showing up so well! So worth the money. My legs are always the last to get tan with using elusive I&#x27;m already starting to see color ! I will definitely be ordering more (:</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it makes you darker after second tanning but it&#x27;s hard to squeeze lotion out the bottle...a pump would be helpful</li>
            <li> Perfect,  fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This Lotion DID Not Hold Up To ALL The Hype - Very Disappointed!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just another tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer.....love it</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning lotion it dont have any of the after tanning smell and it leaves your skin very soft but I personally like Black Ink better I like the color that Black Ink better.</li>
