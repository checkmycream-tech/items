    <ol>
            <li>But I like it best because a week is 7 days and</li>
            <li>Best pill cutter I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I have oblong shaped pills to cut and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This works great !!</li>
            <li>This is the best pill cutter I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This one works great, you DO have to put the piece in that</li>
            <li>Some people have had great luck with it, so maybe it is a quality control issue - hit or miss.</li>
            <li>I purchased this EZY dose pill cutter at a good price for myself.</li>
            <li>It looked good through the package, so I opened it.</li>
            <li>It works great, very easy to use and it has a latch lock in case</li>
            <li>The Apex Deluxe is a much better splitter than the Apex Ultra.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
            <li>but at top holds the pill in place as you cut,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always cut pill with two even halfs but does better than others.</li>
            <li>Even better, I&#x27;d love to have one</li>
            <li>I tested it on pills that are usually easy to cut.</li>
            <li>I can easily cut a pill to four</li>
            <li>so it cuts pills easily and with clean lines.</li>
            <li>but I would preferring spend more money if a good model actually existed</li>
            <li>So far (about a month in), this tablet cutter has worked in a superior fashion, although I can&#x27;t figure out how the safety lock works.  </li>
            <li>maybe 30% of the time I get a good split, and the rest of the time I have to divide up crumbs (and maybe cut some more pieces so that I&#x27;ll have crumbs to divide) to try to get equal doses.</li>
            <li>I wanted a better pill-cutter, and this one is very much like the one I was replacing.</li>
            <li>The cutter makes clean cuts.</li>
            <li>More times than not, I end up with very lopsided pieces.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t really need it, it doesn&#x27;t matter much to me, but it would be nice if there were a picture or instructions on how to use the lock.  </li>
            <li>lock is great for little kids.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>After complaining about the item to Amazon and the seller, they quickly replaced the item with a different pill cutter that is better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other pill cutters including the Apex Ultra Pill Splitter and the EZY Dose is more accurate.  </li>
            <li>It is ok; but I can now find them easily at my local drug store.</li>
            <li>but I feel like one that cost much more would do the same.  </li>
            <li>The true test will now be, &amp;#34;How durable is it with normal use?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my old stand by, the Apex Deluxe Pill Splitter.  </li>
            <li>I like its light weight and small size; it doesn&#x27;t store many pills</li>
            <li>This little pill cutter works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t going to work very well...</li>
            <li>Did you ever wonder why the 75 mg tablets cost twice as much as the 150 mg ones?  </li>
            <li>If it eventually stops working as well as it does now, it&#x27;s cheap enough to get another one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for pill cutting.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a splitter that had a mechanism to hold the blade vertical during the splitting operation.</li>
            <li>really need.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, though, it sure beats the heck out of trying to cut my pulls with a knife.</li>
            <li>I really like a couple of features of this particular pill cutter.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the blade will continue to cut as cleanly as it does now.  </li>
            <li>I would still like to have found one a little more customizable for my needs - but it may not exist.</li>
            <li>I chose this particular tablet cutter because it seemed to be the only one available that holds the tablets firmly in place and allows for a clean cut.</li>
            <li>It works, and is easy to clean, but like some reviewers have said, it takes a little work to get the pill lines up just right to get it to cut mostly in half.</li>
            <li>The locking cover is great to keep small fingers away from the sharp blade.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s very hard for me to make sure my cat is getting the right dose every day.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the blade isn&#x27;t sharp enough or this is the way most cheap pill cutters work, but definitely doesn&#x27;t make a clean cut.</li>
            <li>It has a nice sharp blade and requires minimal pressure to cut tablets.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m low income and was signed up to recieve a reduced price for my Lexapro , however after my first prescription came , they said the program was discontinued .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple other similar cutters and this one is probably better than the others</li>
            <li>The pill halves are very uneven many times.  </li>
            <li>so I buy the 150 mg ones and cut them in half at a huge savings.  </li>
            <li>The blade doesn&#x27;t look to be easily replaceable, but having used this for a few months already without issue, it&#x27;s paid for itself.</li>
            <li>makes it lock, but I&#x27;ve been using it over 2 months and it works perfectly, nothing is weaker and the blade still sharp, and I chop in half 5 pills a day, small ones at that.</li>
            <li>Unlike the other reviewer, I couldn&#x27;t find this exact model at the drugstore, and I really wanted the locking one.</li>
            <li>The red \\&quot;V\\&quot; that holds the tablets is a rubbery material, so it really grips.  </li>
            <li>It cuts through soft pills like they weren&#x27;t even there.  </li>
            <li>Hard pills give it a little resistance but with a little more pressure they cut quickly and accurately.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered these in the past but for some reason they are not cutting that pills very well.</li>
            <li>When I fill my weekly pill case I always have an extra half a tablet left over and it stays safely in the \\&quot;tray\\&quot; section in the cutter, rather than trying to put it back into the pill bottle and then trying to fish it out</li>
            <li>I had one of these before and it worked fine, but after a year of use, the blade got dull</li>
            <li>they often break up, and you seldom get anything close to an exact half of a pill.</li>
            <li>I have cut micro sized pills to horse sized supplement pills, I get exact halfed pills and can quarter then with another cut to the half pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally have to squeeze open the rubber bit to get the pill bits out.</li>
            <li>Since I had a good experience with the old one, I got the same brand, but this one cuts worse than my dull blade.</li>
            <li>Rubber makes the pills stick where they are, sometimes a little TOO much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Rubber makes the pills stick where they are, sometimes a little TOO much</li>
            <li> It easily splits relatively small, round pills into quarters.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d recommend it over them, but unless you&#x27;re only cutting pills in half (works good for that)</li>
            <li> I have use it for several months and it does a fairly good job at cutting pills in half.</li>
            <li> At first I did like this cutter, but soon realized that the hinge was very loose which made it impossible to get an accurate cut on the pills.</li>
            <li> Had to get new one which i did get within a few days of notifying them.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it does a lousey job of cutting pills...</li>
            <li> The only thing I have against it is that it sometimes holds the pill a little too well</li>
            <li> I finally broke the little hook that holds it closed after a few years</li>
            <li> This pill splitter works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> The blade is razor sharp</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the other one, so it&#x27;s not user error.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and look at other pill cutters.  </li>
            <li> Blade has remained sharp and design catches cut pills and even stores pills as well.  </li>
            <li> only downside I&#x27;ve seen is that it doesn&#x27;t work as well for small caplet shaped tablets as it does for round tablets, but that just means a few extra seconds of getting the pill lined</li>
            <li> I tried so hard to ensure that I was lined up in the center, but it would cut it 3/4 and 1/4 instead of 1/2 and 1/2, or the pill would splinter into several pieces.  </li>
            <li> It grips the pill very well so it doesn&#x27;t move around prior to cutting.</li>
            <li> Because of the nice &amp;#34;rubberized&amp;#34; base and sides which hold the tablet firmly in place, I get an even and uniform cut with each use.  </li>
            <li> This little thing is not perfect but it is pretty close.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s $7 down the drain.</li>
            <li> but then it doesn&#x27;t allow the pill to slide down into the \\&quot;holder\\&quot; after a cut.</li>
            <li> Pills do not slip and cut exactly in half.  </li>
            <li> It cuts even the smallest pills exactly in half.  </li>
            <li> I would order this again, and I recommend it to those who need to half their pills.</li>
            <li> I am cutting a small uncoated tablet for my cat, and the split starts in the right place, but the thin blade must tilt, because the cut slants to one side, with one of the pieces much larger than the other.</li>
            <li> Like the ability to close and lock this little item.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it sometimes leaves a little powder when it cuts</li>
            <li> Cutting the pills resulted in a piece larger than half, while the other piece was consistently crushed.  </li>
            <li> They always come out uneven.</li>
            <li> This little pill cutter cuts my smallest pills!  </li>
            <li> ( sorry for venting about the drug co. , couldn&#x27;t hold it back ) .</li>
            <li> you have small children around.  </li>
            <li> I take 1/4-1/2 of a small 25mcg thyroid tablet at a time, and the splitter did a worse job of cutting the tiny tablets in half than I did by breaking it along the score line on the edge of the counter.</li>
            <li> and I have to knock it against the counter rather hard to get the cut pill to come out.  </li>
            <li> pill cutter became dull after years of use.  </li>
            <li> Trying to line the blade up with the score line (which helps it cut cleaner) is also difficult due to the rubbery blue base to hold the pill; it makes it hard to spin the little tablet..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made from very thin plastic and looks like it probably cost less than 10 cents to make.</li>
            <li> Amazon should stop doing business with companies that don&#x27;t stand behind their products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  </li>
            <li> Something is wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Imprecise cutting mechanism.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Imprecise cutting mechanism. It&#x27;s better than nothing but I would preferring spend more money if a good model actually existed</li>
            <li> Like the ability to close and lock this little item.  Slot for split pills to be stored.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a couple of these off of amazon after my local store stopped selling the ones that lock.  Couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere!  This one works great, you DO have to put the piece in that makes it lock, but I&#x27;ve been using it over 2 months and it works perfectly, nothing is weaker and the blade still sharp, and I chop in half 5 pills a day, small ones at that. Rubber makes the pills stick where they are, sometimes a little TOO much and I have to tap on the plastic as I pull on a side of the rubber to make it let go, but how can I deduct a star for it holding on to the pill like it&#x27;s supposed to?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> It is ok; but I can now find them easily at my local drug store.</li>
            <li> I really like a couple of features of this particular pill cutter.  It has a nice sharp blade and requires minimal pressure to cut tablets.  The red \\&quot;V\\&quot; that holds the tablets is a rubbery material, so it really grips.  The locking cover is great to keep small fingers away from the sharp blade.  But I like it best because a week is 7 days and 4 x 2 halves is 8 halves. When I fill my weekly pill case I always have an extra half a tablet left over and it stays safely in the \\&quot;tray\\&quot; section in the cutter, rather than trying to put it back into the pill bottle and then trying to fish it out later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve seen is that it doesn&#x27;t work as well for small caplet shaped tablets as it does for round tablets, but that just means a few extra seconds of getting the pill lined up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought.  I finally broke the little hook that holds it closed after a few years - it was my fault, not the cutter&#x27;s.  Unlike the other reviewer, I couldn&#x27;t find this exact model at the drugstore, and I really wanted the locking one.</li>
            <li> I knew as soon as I saw this thing it wasn&#x27;t going to work very well... it&#x27;s made from very thin plastic and looks like it probably cost less than 10 cents to make. Sure enough, it does a lousey job of cutting pills... they often break up, and you seldom get anything close to an exact half of a pill.</li>
            <li> Best pill cutter I have ever had.  Worth every penny.  Pills do not slip and cut exactly in half.  Wish I had this cutter years ago</li>
            <li> I take 1/4-1/2 of a small 25mcg thyroid tablet at a time, and the splitter did a worse job of cutting the tiny tablets in half than I did by breaking it along the score line on the edge of the counter.

            <li> I bought this because I have oblong shaped pills to cut and this works perfectly. It grips the pill very well so it doesn&#x27;t move around prior to cutting.</li>
            <li> Horrible. This doesn&#x27;t cut pills well at all. They always come out uneven. I&#x27;ve resorted to just using a knife over using this pill cutter .</li>
            <li> This little thing is not perfect but it is pretty close.  The only thing I have against it is that it sometimes holds the pill a little too well and I have to knock it against the counter rather hard to get the cut pill to come out.  Yes, it sometimes leaves a little powder when it cuts but I feel like one that cost much more would do the same.  After all, the cutter blade is essentially a razor blade.  I don&#x27;t have any issue with the size of a pill but rather the hardness.  It cuts through soft pills like they weren&#x27;t even there.  Hard pills give it a little resistance but with a little more pressure they cut quickly and accurately.  What else should it do?</li>
            <li> I have some 1000 ml pills that my Doctor told me to use 500 instead. The cutter makes clean cuts. it was a lot cheaper then replacing the pills.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the blade isn&#x27;t sharp enough or this is the way most cheap pill cutters work, but definitely doesn&#x27;t make a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other pill cutters including the Apex Ultra Pill Splitter and the EZY Dose is more accurate.  It cuts even the smallest pills exactly in half.  I like its light weight and small size; it doesn&#x27;t store many pills but I only cut them as I use them.  The blade is uncovered but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with that.  The only downside is the somewhat fragile locking mechanism.</li>
            <li> This pill splitter works extremely well.  It easily splits relatively small, round pills into quarters.  On a cost vs effectiveness basis, I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This pill cutter does as it advertises. The blade is razor sharp so it cuts pills easily and with clean lines. The blade doesn&#x27;t look to be easily replaceable, but having used this for a few months already without issue, it&#x27;s paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I had one of these before and it worked fine, but after a year of use, the blade got dull and I needed another. It would crush instead of cut the pill. Since I had a good experience with the old one, I got the same brand, but this one cuts worse than my dull blade. I tried so hard to ensure that I was lined up in the center, but it would cut it 3/4 and 1/4 instead of 1/2 and 1/2, or the pill would splinter into several pieces.  I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the other one, so it&#x27;s not user error. Something is wrong with this one. That&#x27;s $7 down the drain. Oh well. Some people have had great luck with it, so maybe it is a quality control issue - hit or miss.</li>
            <li> Boy do the drug co. know when to bail on you !! I&#x27;m low income and was signed up to recieve a reduced price for my Lexapro , however after my first prescription came , they said the program was discontinued . So now for a cheaper price , I have to get the next dose mg , from 5 to 10 mg , so I needed a pill splitter !!! This works great !! I can get the bottle and split all the pills at once , and the job is done ! ( sorry for venting about the drug co. , couldn&#x27;t hold it back ) .</li>
            <li> At first I did like this cutter, but soon realized that the hinge was very loose which made it impossible to get an accurate cut on the pills. The pill halves are very uneven many times.  I&#x27;m going back to my old stand by, the Apex Deluxe Pill Splitter.  The Apex Deluxe is a much better splitter than the Apex Ultra.</li>
            <li> It works, and is easy to clean, but like some reviewers have said, it takes a little work to get the pill lines up just right to get it to cut mostly in half. I like thy the rubber but at top holds the pill in place as you cut, but then it doesn&#x27;t allow the pill to slide down into the \\&quot;holder\\&quot; after a cut. I generally have to squeeze open the rubber bit to get the pill bits out. Other than that, though, it sure beats the heck out of trying to cut my pulls with a knife.</li>
            <li> Did you ever wonder why the 75 mg tablets cost twice as much as the 150 mg ones?  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me- so I buy the 150 mg ones and cut them in half at a huge savings.  This little pill cutter works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> This little pill cutter cuts my smallest pills!  It works great, very easy to use and it has a latch lock in case you have small children around.  It seems to be well made.  I would order this again, and I recommend it to those who need to half their pills.</li>
            <li> I purchased this EZY dose pill cutter at a good price for myself. I have use it for several months and it does a fairly good job at cutting pills in half. It doesn&#x27;t always cut pill with two even halfs but does better than others. I would reccomend this item.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these in the past but for some reason they are not cutting that pills very well. Had to get new one which i did get within a few days of notifying them.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00008LUPZ EZY Dose Adult-Lock Safety Tablet Cutter, Crystal Clear]]&lt;br /&gt;My pill cutter became dull after years of use.  I bought this one to replace it.  It arrived with a sticker:  \\&quot;If this product is opened it is non-returnable\\&quot;.  It looked good through the package, so I opened it. I tested it on pills that are usually easy to cut. Cutting the pills resulted in a piece larger than half, while the other piece was consistently crushed.  This is a piece of junk! Do yourself a favor and look at other pill cutters.  Amazon should stop doing business with companies that don&#x27;t stand behind their products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  After complaining about the item to Amazon and the seller, they quickly replaced the item with a different pill cutter that is better.  It pays to complain!</li>
            <li> So far (about a month in), this tablet cutter has worked in a superior fashion, although I can&#x27;t figure out how the safety lock works.  Since I don&#x27;t really need it, it doesn&#x27;t matter much to me, but it would be nice if there were a picture or instructions on how to use the lock.  I use this cutter to split smallish, oval-shaped tablets with tapered ends.  Because of the nice &amp;#34;rubberized&amp;#34; base and sides which hold the tablet firmly in place, I get an even and uniform cut with each use.  One of the side holders has moved a bit, but if I position the tablet properly by eyeballing it, the tablet still stays put and splits evenly.  I don&#x27;t know how long the blade will continue to cut as cleanly as it does now.  If it eventually stops working as well as it does now, it&#x27;s cheap enough to get another one.  I chose this particular tablet cutter because it seemed to be the only one available that holds the tablets firmly in place and allows for a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Item works as described. The true test will now be, &amp;#34;How durable is it with normal use?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for pill cutting. I can easily cut a pill to four pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lock is great for little kids.</li>
            <li> I have taken over 30 pills a day for years.  This is the best pill cutter I have ever used.  It was recommended by two RNs and now I know why.  Rubber funnel grips and holds pills in position.  Blade has remained sharp and design catches cut pills and even stores pills as well.  I have cut micro sized pills to horse sized supplement pills, I get exact halfed pills and can quarter then with another cut to the half pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pete</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple other similar cutters and this one is probably better than the others so I&#x27;d recommend it over them, but unless you&#x27;re only cutting pills in half (works good for that) I would still like to have found one a little more customizable for my needs - but it may not exist.</li>
            <li> I wanted a better pill-cutter, and this one is very much like the one I was replacing. I can&#x27;t find a different model anywhere. More times than not, I end up with very lopsided pieces. I am cutting a small uncoated tablet for my cat, and the split starts in the right place, but the thin blade must tilt, because the cut slants to one side, with one of the pieces much larger than the other. So it&#x27;s very hard for me to make sure my cat is getting the right dose every day. I really wanted a splitter that had a mechanism to hold the blade vertical during the splitting operation. Even better, I&#x27;d love to have one that quarters tablets, which is what I really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe 30% of the time I get a good split, and the rest of the time I have to divide up crumbs (and maybe cut some more pieces so that I&#x27;ll have crumbs to divide) to try to get equal doses.</li>
