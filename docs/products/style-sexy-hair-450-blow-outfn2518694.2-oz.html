            <li> I have frizzy dry hair</li>
            <li> Once applied, I then blow dry and then straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> and I use this with wet hair, dry hair, before and after styling</li>
            <li> You put it in your hair when wet, and blow dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the same, and isn&#x27;t shiny and taming of my hair like previous orders.  </li>
            <li> I personally feel like it takes me half the time to blow dry my hair and half the time to straighten it afterwards because its not as frizzy.</li>
            <li> but I expected this spray to be greasy.</li>
            <li> and it does not make it look flat and limp.</li>
            <li> Holy cow</li>
            <li> and it never makes my hair feel greasy or heavy with product.</li>
            <li> Love the product but delivery was awful.</li>

            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used. I actually use it more as a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; product. A squirt or two and my naturally curly locks are easily detangled leaving the hair so soft!</li>
            <li> great product....will continue to use!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Keeps me hair shiny</li>

            <li> This is a great product, keeps your hair smooth, shiny and frizz free! I Love this product very very much!</li>
            <li> Got this in a makeup subscription bag. It&#x27;s AMAZING! Buying the full version for sure!</li>
            <li> Review from Burkey&#x27;s Wife: A friend of mine that is in the beauty business gave me a sample of this. I don&#x27;t know why but I expected this spray to be greasy. It is not. I have an oily scalp with fine color treated blond hair and it gives it a nice shine and body. I will definitely purchase the full size. I am very pleased with this product when I blow dry my hair and it does not make it look flat and limp.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the product I thought I ordered. I thought it was. 450 blowout 7/1. And it was 450 5/4 or something. It doesn&#x27;t do what I thought. I guess it is my fault. I don&#x27;t see real well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fairly new, but it works amazing. You put it in your hair when wet, and blow dry. I personally feel like it takes me half the time to blow dry my hair and half the time to straighten it afterwards because its not as frizzy. I squirt a lot in and it does NOT make my hair feel greasy or oily at all. I feel like its actually protecting my hair because my hair doesnt get to hot to touch when blow drying or flat ironing. I have fine hair but a lot of it, and this really works for me. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Best hair spray oil for curling your hair ! Spray on , curl hair and your curls do not look fuzzy .</li>
            <li> I got a a sample of this in my ipsy this month... Holy cow my hair looks like I just got a salon blow out! When the sample runs out I will DEFINITELY be getting more!</li>
            <li> Love the product but delivery was awful.</li>
            <li> I first tried this through a sample in my Ipsy subscription box. I love how my hair is softer, smoother, and more manageable when I used then on it.  Once applied, I then blow dry and then straighten my hair. There is a big difference on the days I use that and the days I don&#x27;t.  If some gets on your bathroom floor while spraying, it will make it slippery.</li>
            <li> This bottle of product is nothing like the product.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same, and isn&#x27;t shiny and taming of my hair like previous orders.  Pretty sill move considering I won&#x27;t purchase hair care products from Amazon any longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I use in combination with s factor lusterizer and blow my hair out almost every day. I feel like my style holds better when I use this. Smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of this in an Ipsy bag and HAD to buy it.  It is amazing!  It keeps my hair soft after blow drying/straightening, prevents frizzing and just overall makes my hair easier to manage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  It smells wonderful and it makes my hair so shiny.  I would highly recommend this product if you straighten your hair.  My hair is so smooth after using it and stays smooth all day.</li>
            <li> I love this product, great price.</li>
            <li> Speedy. Accurate. Thanks!</li>
