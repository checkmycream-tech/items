            <li>It smells great, makes my hair super soft, and next time I will get a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair nice and silky, but as far as intense treatment, I think it is just a thicker shampoo, didn&#x27;t see much difference as far as repair goes.</li>
            <li>I do a deep condition with this treatment and it keeps my hair from drying out and becoming damage.  </li>
            <li>This is my new deep conditioner LOVE it</li>
            <li>and my hair was so much softer &amp;silkier.</li>
            <li>I could really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt like straw and no matter how much I cut, it still felt frayed at the ends.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d get a better price on here, not really.</li>
            <li>Very affective for restoring mass to bleached/damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair that breaks easily, &amp; yet I still like to color eat every now &amp; then, &amp; this shampoo really combats the dryness &amp; breakage</li>
            <li>It worked ok, but not worth the money.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend it for those who are looking for a smoothing product that maintains the keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>I use several of the Paul Mitchell Wild Ginger products and they keep my colored, blow dry and flat iron fine hair looking healthy.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive and makes my hair soft, shiny, and very manageable.</li>
            <li>Not sure why it feels that way when wet, but once my hair was dry it was awesome!  </li>
            <li>One expects with the Paul Mitchel reputation and my satisfaction with other items by same that this would live up to some level of greater surprise...</li>
            <li>I use this combined with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo &amp; my hair feels like silk now!  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>Takes the frizz out of my naturally curly, colored hair.</li>
            <li>Will use again but didn&#x27;t have the wow factor I was expecting.</li>
            <li>&amp; then I flat-iron it on LOW-HEAT setting, &amp; my hair is soft &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li>first I was disapointed with it because my hair didn&#x27;t feel very soft after rinsing out the conditioner, but once I used my normal hair products &amp; blow dried it</li>
            <li>I have long hair &amp; used this way too fast.</li>
            <li>No other products are needed.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my chemically straightened, highlighted hair and it smoothes and shines my hair like no other.</li>
            <li>When you use it, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s very moisterizing, but man, can I tell the difference when my hair is dry &amp; styled!</li>
            <li>It really is a must if you have ever straightened or regularly use a curling iron or flat iron your hair.</li>
            <li>My roots are straight and my hair is soft and bouncy after I use these products, blow dry and flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li>I used this tx and it really made my hair softer,i have coarse African American hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced compared to other deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>My hair has seen better days and due to some over coloring in the past year, it needed help.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the Paul Mitchell awapuhi wild ginger shampoo and cream rinse since late July or early August.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female and I usually get my hair relaxed/retouched every 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> and my hair was dry</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in the texture of my hair and my ends aren&#x27;t as damage and dry.  </li>
            <li> all to correct my dry overpermed damage.</li>
            <li> (my hair is really dry).  </li>
            <li> A must for individuals with dry, treated hair!</li>
            <li> I have very dry and damage hair steaming from coloring and perming.  </li>
            <li> After I styled my hair as usual, the shine was like no other product I have every used.  </li>
            <li> I workout a lot, and I have to wash my African American hair at least twice a week and every week.  </li>
            <li> trying other products in this line too.</li>
            <li> My ends were a little dry and</li>
            <li> Now It&#x27;s very minimal.  </li>
            <li> My frizz was down.</li>
            <li> Noticed less breakage after using one time.</li>
            <li> A little advice?</li>
            <li> However, you can&#x27;t go wrong if you buy this because it&#x27;s has keratin in it, and I believe the wow factor will be revealed after continued usage.</li>
            <li> Dirty label with &#x27;New&#x27; typed on it.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure whether it was this product or the shampoo that changed the texture of my hair, but after using it twice, I found my hair ends to be fuzzy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure about product&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month</li>
            <li> I would suggest doing it at least twice a month.</li>
            <li> Considering the price I just had to rate it lower than my norm as it represents a poor value for the money.</li>
            <li> It was outdated or something.</li>
            <li> This product has made a dramatic difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I need this bad when I run out and its so expensive in store.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is great. My curls tightened up (this is what usually happens when my hair is protein treated, it streghtens my curl pattern, which is great). My frizz was down. My hair was softer and it literally FELT thickened .</li>
            <li> This product received great reviews in my local newspaper so, having bleached and permed hair, I decided to try it. It perhaps is a good product for some types of hair but I did not like the results when I used it. Regrettably, I used it with the Paul Mitchell shampoo so I am not sure whether it was this product or the shampoo that changed the texture of my hair, but after using it twice, I found my hair ends to be fuzzy. I discontinued the use of these two products and the situation was corrected.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 years. I am completely satisfied with it. I have tried others through the years but nothing else compares with Paul Mitchell Awapuhi...love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I used this tx and it really made my hair softer,i have coarse African American hair,i had a dominican blow out before I applied this tx and my hair was dry,i went back and had a blow out after applying tx and my hair was so much softer &amp;silkier.I would suggest doing it at least twice a month.</li>
            <li> I use several of the Paul Mitchell Wild Ginger products and they keep my colored, blow dry and flat iron fine hair looking healthy.  Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> This cream rinse is great.  When you use it, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s very moisterizing, but man, can I tell the difference when my hair is dry &amp; styled! I use this combined with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo &amp; my hair feels like silk now!  I have dry hair that breaks easily, &amp; yet I still like to color eat every now &amp; then, &amp; this shampoo really combats the dryness &amp; breakage I was getting from my recent highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was disapointed with it because my hair didn&#x27;t feel very soft after rinsing out the conditioner, but once I used my normal hair products &amp; blow dried it (like I always do) felt AMAZING.  I could really tell the difference.  Not sure why it feels that way when wet, but once my hair was dry it was awesome!  I will most definitely keep using this product &amp; buy more.</li>
            <li> A must for individuals with dry, treated hair! I&#x27;ll never go back to anything else! It really is a must if you have ever straightened or regularly use a curling iron or flat iron your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has seen better days and due to some over coloring in the past year, it needed help. My hair felt like straw and no matter how much I cut, it still felt frayed at the ends. I used this after the KeraTriplex Treatment the first time and once a week since. My ends feel great and my hair is even les frizzy overall. I can run my fingers thru it without running into a million sticky tangles. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> I have very dry and damage hair steaming from coloring and perming.  I used Paul Mitchell Ginger Keratin Intensive Treatment as a deep conditioner.  I used the product along with argon oil and a plastic bag for 20 mins.  After I styled my hair as usual, the shine was like no other product I have every used.  I can see a difference in the texture of my hair and my ends aren&#x27;t as damage and dry.  I workout a lot, and I have to wash my African American hair at least twice a week and every week.  I do a deep condition with this treatment and it keeps my hair from drying out and becoming damage.  This is my new deep conditioner LOVE it and you will to.</li>
            <li> Not any different than similar products,but shampoo is great.</li>
            <li> I used it once yet so I&#x27;m not sure about product&#x27;s quality. But over all, It was not  bad. I hope my hair would be healthy.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best conditioner ever! Super fast shipping. I need this bad when I run out and its so expensive in store.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this but I have not seen a difference and I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now</li>
            <li> It was nice,&lt;br /&gt;Worked out some frizz and it smells good. But i have lots of hair and it is a bit coastly and there is a serum paul mitchell using in the solon followed by this conditoner that works well together to get the best results.</li>
            <li> I use the other products in the line, and I am in love! I am a brunette with light caramel/blonde highlights and keratin in my hair. This is a great product! i use it as a conditioner in the shower (I leave it in for about 3-5 min). It is great! HIGHLY recommend it for those who are looking for a smoothing product that maintains the keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome!!! It leaves your hair nice and silky, but as far as intense treatment, I think it is just a thicker shampoo, didn&#x27;t see much difference as far as repair goes.</li>
            <li> Best product for bleached hair ever.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Kind of pricey but perfect size for travel.</li>
            <li> Compliments the shampoo.  Detangling is okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not salon quality.  A little advice? Don&#x27;t buy your hair products online. Go to ulta or Sallys or somewhere.... I could tell the difference when I squeezed the product into my hand. It was outdated or something.</li>
            <li> This product worked great!  Really helped my hair feel stronger &amp; the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this entire line of products. Takes the frizz out of my naturally curly, colored hair. Amazing</li>
            <li> My sister raved about this, so I brought it. I used it once, and it made my hair soft but nothing spectacular. Will use again but didn&#x27;t have the wow factor I was expecting. However, you can&#x27;t go wrong if you buy this because it&#x27;s has keratin in it, and I believe the wow factor will be revealed after continued usage.</li>
            <li> works well, will order more. trying other products in this line too. But this (intensive treatment) may be the best one if you only try one thing.</li>
            <li> It worked ok, but not worth the money. I have long hair &amp; used this way too fast. Might work for someone with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Loved this product and smells so good!  Would definetly recommend this to anyone who needs some moisture in there hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Paul Mitchell so I decided to try this out and am so glad I did. My hair always feels amazing after I use this. I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because at a hair salon it was the brand that was&lt;br /&gt;used to correct my overpermed damaged hair condition. (It worked well in the&lt;br /&gt;salon, leaving it shiny and manageable).  Well, this wasn&#x27;t the&lt;br /&gt;same for some reason. It simply gummed up my hair in places and did nothing&lt;br /&gt;at all to correct my dry overpermed damage. I really don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;simply return it.</li>
            <li> Noticed less breakage after using one time. So far I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this deep conditioner! It smells great, makes my hair super soft, and next time I will get a bigger bottle so it lasts longer!</li>
            <li> I get this at the mall and I thought I&#x27;d get a better price on here, not really. But still a great conditioner, the whole Awapuhi line is great! Especially the finishing spray.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month and I was having a lot of shedding.  Now It&#x27;s very minimal.  I love the smell and I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for my frizzy hair. Along with the Awapuhi shampoo, it keeps my hair in good shape.</li>
            <li> One expects with the Paul Mitchel reputation and my satisfaction with other items by same that this would live up to some level of greater surprise...but it did not impress me as doing anything special. Considering the price I just had to rate it lower than my norm as it represents a poor value for the money.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and makes my hair soft, shiny, and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female and I usually get my hair relaxed/retouched every 10 weeks. My hair is also color treated. I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the Paul Mitchell awapuhi wild ginger shampoo and cream rinse since late July or early August. I have not had a retouch in 20 weeks!!!! This product has made a dramatic difference in my hair. My roots are straight and my hair is soft and bouncy after I use these products, blow dry and flat iron my hair. No other products are needed. And I consider myself a hair product &amp;#34;junkie&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s worth every penny to try these products.</li>
            <li> No other deep conditioner works as good as this. I have been using it on my chemically straightened, highlighted hair and it smoothes and shines my hair like no other.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair nicely conditioned. Smells nice. Use this once a week to keep hair in top shape. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Dirty label with &#x27;New&#x27; typed on it. DOES NOT SMELL LIKE PRODUCT AT SALON</li>
            <li> Love this stuff &amp; will be buying more!!  I don&#x27;t even rinse out this intensive treatment &amp; just leave it in my hair.  (my hair is really dry).  This smooths out my hair &amp; then I flat-iron it on LOW-HEAT setting, &amp; my hair is soft &amp; silky.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels after using this product. My hair is so silky, shiny and smooth. I don&#x27;t think the scent of the treatment is overpowering or anything. I would definitely recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night. My ends were a little dry and after using this product, I felt like I had just gotten my hair cut. It definitely worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as part of the Keratriplex Treatment, as well as on its own. Very affective for restoring mass to bleached/damaged hair. I also find that it leaves it feeling silky. It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced compared to other deep conditioners. Obviously it&#x27;s protein-heavy, so it IS possible to overuse this product.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, but after reading reviews and watching YouTube raves about it, I was expecting to be blown away. It&#x27;s only okay. It does leave my hair smoother and softer and it smells nice, but I can&#x27;t really tell if it has a lasting effect or not. I only notice the difference on the days that I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may buy it again. I&#x27;d rather save my money and buy macadamia oil or moroccan oil products. But my boyfriend loves using this stuff on his beard.</li>
            <li> the Awaphuhi line is thee BeST for thick course hair.</li>
