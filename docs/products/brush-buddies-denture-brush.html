    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Good grip</li>
            <li>It has a good grip and light weight, but the usage of it is dissappointing.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, but I use the sides of the brush rather than the full bruh as I am concerned of removing the outer coat of my dentures.</li>
            <li>Got this for our cleaning lady and she was pleased.  </li>
            <li>She uses it for cleaning, not dentures, however :)</li>

            <li>Okay brushes, needed something larger and firmer brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The user should be interested in the is brush, given the ease of mailing.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>While this brush was a decent buy, it has very soft bristles and therefore won&#x27;t clean your teeth or denture residue like a normal one would.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a quality brush, much better than I expected.</li>

            <li>Bristles are way too soft.</li>
            <li>soft as it needs to be not to harm the denture, yet cleans well.</li>

            <li> Found a brush designed to clean my dentures. They work really well. Easy to work with. I would recommend to anyone who has dentures</li>
            <li> For one of us that wears a Bengal bridge, this brush meets his needs. However, the bristles could be a bit stiffer.

            <li> Did not care for this item. It did not specify whether the brush a soft and firm brush. I would have preferred firm.</li>
            <li> I needed a new denture brush  but I kept forgetting to get one until I was ordering something else and checked on the brush and found out it was an add on item so I added it on. It&#x27;s a quality brush, much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> That being said , I would still recommend the brush. The brush does a rather decent job with average effort. So the okay rating.</li>

            <li> Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> BRUSH IS FINE BUT THE HANDLE IS HARD FOR ME TO DEAL WITH.  SO JUST EXTEND THE HANDLE ANOTHER INCH AND THE PRODUCT WILL BE A FOUR STAR.</li>
