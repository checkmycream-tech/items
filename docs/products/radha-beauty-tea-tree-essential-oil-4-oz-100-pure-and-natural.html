            <li>Sure, it smells...</li>

            <li>Arrived safely as promised.</li>
            <li>You have a satisfied customer</li>
            <li>but okay.</li>

            <li>I believe you will find many uses for it,</li>
            <li>I was able to test this product out for my review.</li>
            <li>This is an EXCELLENT product for multiple uses!!</li>
            <li>But I still give it 5 starts as it works magic on my blackheads</li>
            <li>LOVE the fact that&#x27;s</li>

            <li>I love that it comes with a dropper</li>
            <li>You get a lot of tea tree oil in the bottle because most bottle have 1 oz</li>
            <li>I received this tea tree oil for free to review and give my honest feedback about it.</li>
            <li>Love Radha Tea tree Oil.</li>
            <li>and I love the jars and dropplers.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hopeful, this oil can be use in many ways</li>
            <li>And I love the color of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I received this bottle of tea tree oil for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li>so it’s more of a preventative treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some of the many home uses for tea tree oil include: using it in soaps, fight mildew, laundry booster, use as an all purpose cleaner, freshen carpet, etc.</li>
            <li>While I have tried many of these uses and loves the results of using tea tree oil for all personally my favorite way to use tea tree oil is when I make homemade soaps and bath products.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this Tea Tree oil.</li>
            <li>So I went to the store and there were so many warnings: &amp;</li>
            <li>I had received this product from Radha and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several store brands through the years and this quality and amount can&#x27;t be best:)</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I also make my own vinegar based household cleaning products, and a splash of tea tree oil always makes it smell clean and refreshing (and helps hide the vinegar).</li>
            <li>Will be coming back for more!!!</li>
            <li>Too soon to evaluate effectiveness, but nobody mentioned how MUCH this stuff smells !!!!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff....</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is the smell, Tea Tree tends to be very pungent and strong, but the smell for the Radha is definitely bearable, even pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an EO expert, but the scent was pleasant and about what I&#x27;ve experienced with other tea tree oils.  </li>
            <li>So excited to receive my tea tree oil!  </li>
            <li>I have used tea tree products for many years, however, from many sellers, and I enjoy the unusual but to me pleasant aroma of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to receive this Radha Tea Tree Oil in the mail!!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, not like other brands I&#x27;ve tried that smell more chemicalized.</li>
            <li>It is a large bottle and is of good quality.</li>
            <li>Very good quality overall.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s incredibly relieving to finally know what works.</li>
            <li>Smells great and is a natural healing aid.</li>
            <li>SO FAR WORKS GREAT ON HAIR</li>
            <li>It is great for dabbing on a q-tip and applying directly to acne, or places healing on your skin.</li>
            <li>And I LOVE the beautiful cobalt blue glass bottle it comes</li>
            <li>it adds a nice fresh smell to my house</li>
            <li>fast shipment, good amount for money.</li>
            <li>Good product @ reasonable price.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping, great value.</li>
            <li>Hope to have a positive report to add to this; I&#x27;m optimistic!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s topical, smells good (to me) &amp; is so much better than putting a pill in my body!  </li>
            <li>The pure and natural aspect to it means that it has been much more effective on my daughters skin and very effective in preventing head-lice.</li>
            <li>other than that very happy with this TTO</li>
            <li>Very pure, nice smell, not as strong as others in the market.</li>
            <li>Comes with a glass dropper which makes application easy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>A SLEEP EASILY WITH THIS TEA TREE OIL</li>
            <li>The bottle was packed well and the dropper was easy to snap together.  </li>
            <li>I wash out the tea tree oil with my shampoo and it seems it wash out easy.</li>
            <li>After testing this tea tree oil out for myself I have to say it&#x27;s really a great product with many different uses and benefits!!</li>
            <li>This tea tree only is made by steam distillation of fresh leaves, which is really awesome!!</li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor</li>
            <li>Well, the trademark smell isn&#x27;t quite as strong as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend buying from these folks.</li>
            <li>I HAVE A STRONG HOPE</li>
            <li>If you have never used tea tree oil before you may be caught off guard by the strong odor.  </li>
            <li>Strong odor.</li>
            <li>Strong odor so use sparingly.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting the strong scent.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell but all tea tree oils have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It might have a strong smell, but it is not offensive and fades after about an hour.</li>
            <li>I am so appreciative to have a natural product that works so effectively.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong to me as the tea tree oil</li>
            <li>The Radha brand is high quality and pure and a very good value.</li>
            <li>TO BE HONEST AROMA IS PRETTY STRONG</li>
            <li>First time user and loving all of the benefits that this oil can do.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best that I have found for treating her skin.</li>
            <li>Pure, love the bottle and the option for the dropper!</li>
            <li>I see so many 5-star reviews, so I&#x27;m open to learning because I really want to like this product - the prices are outstanding!!!</li>
            <li>It is really light and easily added to products.  </li>
            <li>I love this tree oil and will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li>The oil itself is light and clear and smells faintly of a pleasant citrus.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For the price you get a huge bottle</li>

            <li>Amazing product--really nice scent which is a bit more subtle than most tea tree oils that I have tried!</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;d pay 10x that with no complaint because it would be worth it, but the super affordable cost just makes me love it that much more.</li>
            <li>Goes down nice and smooth,  pleasant aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>I love the rich texture and fresh scent of Radha TTO.</li>
            <li>This has a really strong smell, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>The colbalt blue bottle the oil comes in is very nice too.</li>
            <li>The attachment is very useful.</li>
            <li>It has proved to be very effective with my scalp problem, properly mixed with the carrier oil jojoba.</li>
            <li>of my favourite uses is to put three drops into a tub of very warm water, sit back, and relax.</li>
            <li>Very nice pure quality, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I brush all over inside my mouth and know I&#x27;m getting a quality clean, free from bacteria, etc.</li>
            <li>Main difference is that the nice 4oz.</li>
            <li>I can use it freely and it&#x27;s such a  nice quality!</li>
            <li>You will not need to use too much as this stuff is very strong.</li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant, just strong and distinctive.</li>
            <li>Also added to warm water in wash basin, and after cleansing and&lt;br /&gt;rinsing areas, and applied with warm wash cloth &amp; let dry.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about contact with the seller in sharing information on the many wonderful uses for the essential oils she carries.  </li>
            <li>Super quick delivery!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to add Radha&#x27;s tea tree oil to my collection.</li>
            <li>Have used other brands and this is superior!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed with this purchase and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Since I am trying to be more environmentally aware</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for dry scalp and it works great for that.</li>
            <li>Gives a clean aroma.</li>
            <li>It smells clean, gets things clean, and helps to disinfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like something I would clean my kitchen floor with.</li>
            <li>: I ALSO USE IT TO CLEAN BATHROOM</li>
            <li>Buying a larger amount is more cost effective.</li>
            <li>What is it about this Tea Tree Essential Oil, that makes it so pleasant to smell?</li>
            <li>on smooth and light absorbed fast:)</li>
            <li>Radha Tea Tree Oil is of high quality and as good as any other good tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil at a good price with a good-quality dropper – a better deal than the other tea tree oils I could find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Takes the itch right out!</li>
            <li>They have amazing prices, and the smell isn&#x27;t so far &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; to discourage me from buying again.</li>
            <li>Pretty intense smell, kind of like Vicks vapor rub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>Am going to use it to clear up some mold &amp; mildew in our sleeping cabin from too warm of a winter.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced for top of the line products.</li>
            <li>Only had it a week but seems like good quality tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>and so much good they bring to our daily lives!</li>
            <li>I’ll go into it a bit more haha.</li>
            <li>Packaging was terrific; bottle is gorgeous and even came with a glass dropper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess the sunblocks and humidity wasn&#x27;t cool according to my nose.</li>
            <li>and I love that there is so much of it.  </li>
            <li>this is good quality, and 4oz should last me a while.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it is effective for skin tags.</li>
            <li>glad I found a place that I can get this product fast</li>
            <li>and that was when I started to think it wasn&#x27;t true Tea Tree Oil.  </li>
            <li>True to listing</li>
            <li>Most uses you would dilute it with a carrier so the smell would not be as much of an issue.</li>
            <li>Unlike many other tea tree oils I have tried this is a very good oil for sensitive</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, and the item was packaged very well, and arrived safely.</li>
            <li>I love tea tree oil and am so glad to find a high quality oil for a reasonable price</li>

            <li>And bottle is very big and cute :)</li>
            <li>The seller was super in letting me know it was on the way and asked if I had any problems.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quick.</li>
            <li>a while,,sorry forgot to get back to the review, basically because I wasn&#x27;t impressed at bit,,used the entire bottle</li>
            <li>This oil arrived quickly and the glass bottle was packed well with both bubble wrap and a separate interior box besides their outer padded mailer.</li>
            <li>My tea tree oil shipped quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>Love the product, highly recommended</li>
            <li>Georgia is hot, humid, and has huge bug issues.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the Tea Tree Essential Oil and the customer service.</li>
            <li>The prices are amazing, because I&#x27;ve been paying 2-3 times more than this from any other company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smelled more piney, like the janitorial smell in a newly disinfected lavatory.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast with status updates, product exactly as described, satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>The size for the price is beyond a bargain and the smell is very soft and lovely.  </li>
            <li>Also, the blue bottle is awesome!!one more thing!</li>
            <li>, I cannot recommend this product any higher!</li>
            <li>Really like the Tea Tree Oil!!  </li>
            <li>I was certain the 4 ounce bottle was filled with a substandard product.</li>
            <li>Leaves nothing but crisp clean fresh breath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but honestly pure Tea oil from local drugstore smells better.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, low price, and a good amount.</li>
            <li>It has been most effective on skin issues that I&#x27;ve had to deal with, like dermatitis, cellulitis, acne breakouts, to name a few.</li>
            <li>Great size and dropper helps reduce waste.</li>
            <li>It has a distinctly noticeable smell with a hint of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>This product is doing just as I expected which is good.  </li>
            <li>Smells so fresh and invigorating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it, and it seems to work as expected, so that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can also use this as an ingredient in actual effective hand sanitizer because yea it helps with that too.</li>
            <li>For example, mixing it with rosehip or argan oil with make the oil more easier to wear for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far I love the bottle and</li>
            <li>i liked the larger size and dropper</li>
            <li>After my initial review the company reached out to me and offered to refund my money upon return of the product...very nice of them</li>
            <li>I rarely give reviews but this product is a must-have for anyone with acne-prone skin like me.</li>
            <li>Radha&#x27;s Tea Tree is top notch-- definitely worth the 5 stars rating given by nearly everyone.</li>
            <li>Would like more info of the various uses of the oil and also more details on if and when to add water and how much.  </li>
            <li>When her elementary school had an outbreak of head lice, I put two or three drops in her hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad of the results so far.</li>
            <li>, one of them is as an anti fungal, so my next use will be my husband&#x27;s gym shoes, I got it discounted in exchange of my honest opinion</li>
            <li>Some of the many beauty uses include: using tea tree oil to help heal and soothe sunburns, smell helps with opening sinuses and bronchial tubes for easier breathing, can be used as a natural antiseptic, use it to heal skin infections, use it to prevent lice, use it to prevent fleas, use it as a treatment for warts and insect bites, use it to treat acne, use it to treat dandruff, etc.</li>
            <li>#34;Very potent, don&#x27;t get it directly on your skin without a buffer&amp;#34; or &amp;</li>
            <li>It should actually be right along with your cosmetics and or first aid kit!</li>
            <li>/&gt;results were very positive and almost immediate.</li>
            <li>Great product-tried it on oncoming acne, it&#x27;s dried my skin right away and prevented the acne from surfacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>am sure there many other uses for Tea Tree Oil and when you go on line you get a lot of suggestions as well.</li>
            <li>I use essential oils regularly and this one is high quality and the price is great!</li>
            <li>It may have all the benefits of other tea tree oils -- for all I know, it may be superior in that respect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it for a couple of other things the company mentioned it was good for.</li>
            <li>Right now I don&#x27;t have any skin issues</li>
            <li>Takes the itch right out of a  mosquito bite.</li>
            <li>AND AT THE RIGHT PRICE</li>
            <li>It also has a glass dropper to help you use just the right amount of oil.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Radha Tea Tree Oil and so far am pleased.</li>
            <li>Good value, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I use it for so much, but mostly for pest repellant (I live in the country...</li>
            <li>I got it for all the many uses, but have been dropping a little into the bath water with some lavender and it makes the whole bathroom smell nice.  </li>
            <li>live in a large city where &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; and health food products are abundant and are extremely high quality, so I feel like I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li>You do not want pure tea tree oil on you, it&#x27;s very pungent, so the dropper is very useful.  </li>
            <li>I initially gave this tea tree oil 5 stars with a great review before actually trying it.  </li>
            <li>I have been on several different antibiotics &amp; creams through my derm &amp; have not found that they do a great job</li>
            <li>Smells nice , normally not a fan of tea tree</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have natural, 100% pure oils to use, as I am a person with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Very fast n</li>
            <li>Product came very fast</li>
            <li>and they did very fast because of this</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and the product</li>
            <li>Large bottle well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is pure and useful</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived super fast, well packaged, in a pretty blue glass bottle and a separate dropper top.</li>
            <li>This bottle contains a generous amount and can be utilized for so many different things.</li>
            <li>I also personally love this brand, as I have used several products from Radha Beauty</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I said, it&#x27;s hot and humid.</li>

            <li>After many years experimenting with countless skincare products and scalp treatments-</li>
            <li>For people who are trying tea tree oil for the first time I recommend mixing it with a carrier oil first.</li>
            <li>First time trying this.</li>
            <li>Received my order extremely fast, I will never order from any where else again!</li>
            <li>I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found so many different uses for this oil.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite use is adding it to my shampoo as a solution to an itchy scalp from dandruff.</li>
            <li>First time trying tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>i love the blue glass bottle and the included dropper.</li>

            <li>Definitely going to reorder:)</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased Radha Brand.  </li>
            <li>Did exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Love this for a several reasons.</li>
            <li>very informative!</li>
            <li>I love the blue bottle the tea tree oil came in.</li>
            <li>Most commercial tea tree oils are not.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen multiple Dermatologists and have used many prescription creams without relief.</li>
            <li>But I like, first I&#x27;m trying.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the future.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought oils from this brand before, so for my first aid kit I wanted to have some tea tree oil</li>
            <li>As someone that loves the many different uses of tea tree oil</li>
            <li>This tea tree oil for many beauty benefits can be mixed with carrier oils such as fractionated coconut oil &amp; more.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of lavender, and this oil is definitely on target with that.</li>
            <li>Most days I straighten my hair, but this dries out my scalp, and I have some oil for my hair, but it only seems to help the bottom ends.</li>
            <li>The smell can be a little overwhelming, but it doesn&#x27;t stink - it&#x27;s just really strong.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this if you suffer from dry, itchy scalp or if you just want silky, shiny, great smelling hair.</li>
            <li>First things first this has absolutely nothing to do with this oil</li>
            <li>The instant I opened this bottle, I thought, wow this smells nice</li>
            <li>This bottle comes with a regular screw top as well as a screw-on eye dropper, which is very convenient for&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many other oils in the past, but this one has a great quality.</li>
            <li>I received the oil in return for my positive review of the product.  </li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops on the rug in my classroom and the entire room immediately smells good!</li>
            <li>even the most irritated zits are calmed by morning, if not completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it in my DIY beard oils and in many other useful ways.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, beings that it is 100% it is very strong but just a drop from a qtip does just fine - sometimes I will use it over moisturizer if I apply to a delicate area.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers has pointed out the oil is very strong and therefore you will not need a lot.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit like pine and with the dropper is easy to apply topically or to place in water, etc.</li>
            <li>The dropper also makes for such easy application.</li>
            <li>Also, this tea tree oil does not seem to be strong enough at all</li>
            <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s not quite as strong as the last brand I bought.</li>
            <li>Large bottle included dropper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sold that this is as pure as the claim is.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li>100% pure tea tree oil as advertised.</li>
            <li>the Radha ingredients says 100% pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same quality of the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; names at a far more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree oil in particular is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>Very high quality tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>I use it in combo with unrefined shea butter and pure coconut oil as a moisturizer, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a reasonable price for a large 4oz bottle which allows me to experiment without worrying about the cost.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to receiving this large supply with an eyedropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this point, i&#x27;m making my own little oil collection</li>
            <li>the Radha brand tea tree oil seems to be pretty high quality.</li>
            <li>The sink is light and very relaxing actually.</li>
            <li>But the one thing that really helped show an improvement was Radha tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>but this variety smells much lighter ...</li>
            <li>This tea tree oil is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I use it to help with my gums since I have dental issues and it works very well.</li>
            <li>The tips that accompany the oil are very informative.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>You can tell this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for the last 6 years for my eczema, so I know genuine tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I am using it in combination with Radha&#x27;s Lavender oil to apply on acne and it has been working very well.</li>
            <li>I make up a mixture of oils with coconut (carrier) oil - tea tree, peppermint, eucalyptus, rosehip and my whole family</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working very well.</li>
            <li>Very aromatic.  </li>
            <li>Really helped my scalp issue</li>
            <li>I really like the teared oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for toe nail fungus and seems to be working real well.</li>
            <li>Geat product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really feel that this is something that everyone should have in their medicine</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, it worked on the tags.</li>
            <li>done!&lt;br /&gt;i bought this because it was discounted but also because i really like the Radha brand.</li>
            <li>But it really does help.  </li>
            <li>the real deal..</li>
            <li>My whole family uses tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>i soaked them 3 times a day for 3 weeks and absolutely nothing at all changed</li>
            <li>Stunk up the whole house.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed much healthier skin with fewer blemishes.</li>
            <li>Really attacks breakouts.</li>
            <li>The bottle that I received does not have much of a scent.  </li>
            <li>That alone convinces one to feel like it is really working.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Came really fast.</li>
            <li>Very psyched to have found this use for the oil.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how much it has helped.</li>
            <li>Very happe with the tea tree oil</li>
            <li>Just dont really care for the smell..</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>It shipped in 2 days thanks to amazon prime, too.</li>
            <li>Working very well is relieve the summer insect bites and itches.  </li>
            <li>The Radha Tee Tree Oil comes very well packaged</li>
            <li>I like to use it straight, on my scalp and hair for dandruff and scalp itch.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it really works</li>
            <li>/look in my hair like using too much hair product can do.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little bit strong but fades away quickly, and the stinginess is bearable.</li>
            <li>While the Radha oils are on the pricy side of essential and mixed oils I have been impressed so far with each if their products that I have tried and would be willing to pay the extra the next time I run out.</li>
            <li>Large bottle, decent smell.</li>
            <li>Most essential oils are highly volatile and will evaporate completely, leaving no oil stain on the paper.</li>
            <li>Lice is a big problem in elementary school and this oil does the job!</li>
            <li>The price is better or comparable to other tea tree oils on here and ones I&#x27;ve seen in store.</li>
            <li>Other than that, seems ok.</li>
            <li>Works better than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>It smells better than other brands I have used</li>
            <li>There was a bit of a leakage in my shipment but was probably due to the hot weather, left a nice scent in the cardboard and eventually my room haha.</li>
            <li>I have used tea tree oil from several other brands before and in comparison this smells much richer and purer, hands down the best tea tree oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, high quality as described.  </li>
            <li>Not as strong as the Young Living Essential oils,</li>
            <li>Did pretty well on skin tags---you have to apply frequently.  </li>
            <li>I was instantly obsessed with this particular tea tree oil, which I now describe as a miracle product because it single handed has become the most effective remedy for any/all skin/scalp issues, and it&#x27;s by far the fastest most effective treatment for seriously sore muscles.</li>
            <li>It has so many other uses!</li>
            <li>I wish the smell was a little lighter but it is expected to have a great concentration of tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>I used a few drops on my dry scalp and it resulted in itch free head very quickly!</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Army, I live in Georgia.</li>
            <li>It seems to already be less itchy and not so many flakes.</li>
            <li>but I just love the deep blue bottle it’s packaged in…moving on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was told that Tea Tree Oil mixed with the shampoo called Free and Clear would do the trick.</li>
            <li>Currently my main use is to mix it with non-alcohol mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I bought this a few weeks ago on a whim, just to try it, since it is good for multiple healing abilities.</li>
            <li>I hope it was not processed under high heat.</li>
            <li>You can tell this is high quality Tea Tree Oil</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Or highly diluted?</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to our friends and others.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommendable product.</li>
            <li>High quality tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to keep in your medicine cabinet at all times</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely a high quality tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>few drops here in bath or shampoo ,great for skin ,kills fungus on feet and cures scabies ,relieves itch ,read other reviews and be amazed.</li>
            <li>It is great for toe fungus, dry scalps, cold sores and so much more.  </li>
            <li>The oil is 100% pure and natural and from steamed leaves.</li>
            <li>I was genuinely surprised at the size of the model and the large quantity I received.</li>
            <li>I recently have two new additional piercings and it has helped tremendously with the healing time.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on other reviews and it broke me out because it was too strong.</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic, especially for such a large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Why didn&#x27;t I give 5 stars?</li>
            <li>Having 4 young boys around makes it get used fast though.</li>
            <li>, normally tea tree oil tingles a bit, but this oil burned.  </li>
            <li>I love its antibacterial and antiseptic properties and I don&#x27;t think this product will ever go missing from my medicine cabinet/beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li>The dropper/applicator makes it easy to apply, especially on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li>So far I like the results of this oil for treating mild toenail fungus and sporadic facial outbreaks.</li>
            <li>I placed a drop on my wrist and initially the fragrance was quite strong with an undertone reminiscent of cleaning product.</li>
            <li>It is of superior quality and has eased my dry skin in just a few days where as others have taken weeks.</li>
            <li>I use tea tree oil regularly, and right from the start this had an off aroma.  </li>
            <li>If I stop using tea tree oil this way it comes right back</li>
            <li>Scent lasts a long time and kills any&lt;br /&gt;bacteria, infections quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to for tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>We still want the oil, and wish Amazon or Radha would just replace us with a new bottle instead of having to go through a process of returning it and re-buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to tea tree oil</li>
            <li>New at this.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>it was on PRIME, but this stuff has so many uses I am glad I paid the extra few bucks &amp; got 4oz !!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be checking here first, before purchasing essential oils elsewhere...</li>
            <li>I bought a lot of tea tree oil before this is the first one I&#x27;ve had that has a different smell.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The dispenser came completely shattered and unusable so upset!</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised by that!</li>
            <li>Smells a bit different than all of the other tea tree oils I have had, more like pine sol, but it works well.</li>
            <li>Everything else in the box that the oil came with was fine, but the oil in the Radha Tea Tree Oil bottle has leaked and spilled about half a bottle.</li>
            <li>Radha and the first thing I noticed was the smell was slightly different.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>In less than a week it has reduced skin tags size tremendously and I expect within 2 weeks they will be gone!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new “in” fad for health and wellness has been oil with all the forefront on natural and therapeutic methods to relieving our issues without medication.</li>
            <li>All the same, the dropper is cool and convenient except one critical problem:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to incorporate the oil into my beauty routine as well as daily dental hydene, the uses are truly endless!</li>
            <li>I can see the positive effects in only 3 days.</li>
            <li>and the price is pretty unbelievable for being a super cure for stubborn skin and sore muscle issues.</li>
            <li>You can add drops of essential oils to give your cleaner a certain smell if you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>This premium tea tree oil is 100% pure &amp; natural essential oil therapeutic grade</li>
            <li>I have learned that you can put Tea Tree oil on a cotton ball and put it in your ear when you or one of your family members has an earache and it will help lessen the pain and clear it up.  </li>
            <li>It keep my skin clear, and it does NOT burn while doing so.</li>
            <li>The next day, after I showered, I could really feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m sensitive, but I would go with another trusted brand if I were you.</li>
            <li>I like that they always give you complete information on what you can do with each product.  </li>
            <li>I expect a half-dollar sized patch on my elbow will be completely gone in another week.</li>
            <li>I have been really getting into the different oils and this is one I had never heard of.</li>
            <li>Biggest bottle I&#x27;ve seen in the market to far</li>
            <li>So far I have put it on every night before bed</li>
            <li>has not dried my scalp out either.</li>
            <li>came very well boxed and with both a regular cap as well as a dropper style lid.  </li>
            <li>So far it seems to be just what I needed.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use it to treat different skin issues, and it treates each very well.</li>
            <li>THE CONTENTS OF THE BOTTLE ARE COMPLETELY IMPOTENT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The swelling was completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I was completely over joyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
            <li>For two years I have had a very itchy scalp which four different dermatologists have prescribed medications, but no relief.  </li>
            <li>I also use it as a natural odor eliminator in my bathrooms, basement, and footwear.  </li>
            <li>I put it directly on my scalp and put 20 drops each into my shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair came out soft and silky and my scalp is improving after one use.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used it as a spot treatment for blemishes.</li>
            <li>I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>so much so I decided to buy a larger bottle!</li>
            <li>and wow did it do the job.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use until this fungus is completely gone.</li>
            <li>so I do not waste the product.</li>
            <li>As far a healing athletes foot</li>
            <li>I have had all sorts of tea tree oil, this is by far my fave.</li>
            <li>It normally comes in a brown glass bottle and has a slightly yellowish hue to it, a distinct pungent odor, and an unmistakeable sting to it when it disinfects wounds.</li>
            <li>NO MORE STRONG SCENT )&lt;</li>
            <li>I know I was the first time; however, you become accustomed to it fairly quickly, especially if you use less than called for at first.  </li>
            <li>Seriously this stuff is a magic potion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try for other uses, too, but it worked well on skin, especially during my breakout.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer of this particular product NEEDS to remove &amp;#34;can be used for FLAVORING&amp;#34; on the back of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It’s not a cure, and it only works as often as I use it for my particular condition.</li>
            <li>Received in a timely manner and so far it&#x27;s going well as I use it for my eyes![[ASIN:B00VKHKH8C Tea Tree Essential Oil - Big 4 oz - 100% Pure &amp; Natural Melaleuca Therapeutic Grade - PREMIUM QUALITY from Australia for acne and skin tag removal]]</li>
            <li>Thick, rich, high quality, well priced, with a good-grade glass dropper.  </li>
            <li>I have also used on my face for acne and it does not over dry and really has helped my skin clear up.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is as strong as other tea tree oils I have had which depending on your use can be a good thing or a bad thing</li>
            <li>So far I have used it for general purpose cleaning and odor removal.</li>
            <li>Super concentrated will last a long time only takes a dab.</li>
            <li>I recently got a new job, a &#x27;fancy&#x27; desk job for that matter, so I now have to do something with myself in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Use if daily in the morning and evening and ever since i&#x27;ve noticed some very clear improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>First off, this tea tree oil does not smell like any other tea tree oil that I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it smells all wrong, which bothered me from the start, and the eyedropper doesn&#x27;t fit right on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I also put a little in a spray bottle of water to calm itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I use this for my nail fungus which I had for a LONG TIME since high school junior year.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>You might even want to dilute to use in general.  </li>
            <li>This tea tree oil can be used for general cleaning, aromatherapy, disinfection, etc.</li>
            <li>It was soft and my scalp actually felt moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me preface this by saying the seller was very prompt in living up to their satisfaction guarantee, so there is not much risk in trying this product to see if you like it.</li>
            <li>The delivery was impressively fast and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several days and so far it seems to be shrinking my skin tags already.</li>
            <li>I have used it once so far, although the jury is still out, it initially seems to work.</li>
            <li>I put the oil directly on it after my bath and to my surprise tonight after only 8 hours, the mark was almost gone.</li>
            <li>So far I have used the tea tree oil for dandruff on my scalp, for bug bits, for my boyfriend&#x27;s eczema, and for blemishes left by acne.</li>
            <li>I plan to use this as my main hair rinse because I believe the chemicals in shampoo are causing my scalp to be so dry.</li>
            <li>This essential oil is strong, so remember that a little bit does go a long way.</li>
            <li>Is very comparable to other tea tree oil products</li>
            <li>I am very encouraged with my progress and plan to start branching out and using the oil for other things.  </li>
            <li>They have endless uses and are much preferred to buying chemical-based health products (which may or may not be beneficial).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a 41 year old female who has moderate hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li>It did not improve my social status either.</li>
            <li>The other tea tree oils I&#x27;ve had have all smelled pretty much the same, with slightly varying degrees of potency and purity.</li>
            <li>Then I spray the same solution in the bathtub after using to make sure nothing is spreads, next it is the kitchen I wipe down the sink several times a week with Tea Tree and olive oil that keep the sink with a glow and the germs down to a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to it in a diaper rash cream for my youngest son a little over 5 years ago and began to research it</li>
            <li>I found it was a little strong &amp; burned the skin on my face slightly when trying to use it to soothe some irritated skin &amp; acne.</li>
            <li>I use it directly on my skin, mixed with some skin products that I regularly use and/or mixed with my bath water.</li>
            <li>bottle is quite large and should last you for quite awhile if used in diffusers and for simple other therapies.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I&#x27;ll quickly mix a few drops with a few drops EVOO and rub directly onto a rash, sting, bite, burn, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helps acne, I apply a little to my skin before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m discovering new ways to use it all the time, credit due to your informational download .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong but that is due to its purity and once on, you hardly smell it.</li>
            <li>But I used this to help clear up the bump that had appeared and within a few days it was completely gone.</li>

            <li> Sure, it smells...</li>

            <li> Arrived safely as promised.</li>
            <li> You have a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> but okay.</li>

            <li> Plus safe for the environment.</li>
            <li> Love the dropper.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of the 4oz bottles because I use tea tree oil for so many things.</li>
            <li> the price was great for the 4 oz bottles and each bottle comes with a dropper which is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this</li>
            <li> the top - drives you out of the room.</li>

            <li> There are so many more uses as well.</li>
            <li> I believe you will find many uses for it,</li>
            <li> I was able to test this product out for my review.</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT product for multiple uses!!</li>
            <li> But I still give it 5 starts as it works magic on my blackheads</li>
            <li> LOVE the fact that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Will tell my camping friends they need to get some as it works much better that most itch relief creams.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a dropper</li>
            <li> You get a lot of tea tree oil in the bottle because most bottle have 1 oz</li>
            <li> I received this tea tree oil for free to review and give my honest feedback about it.</li>
            <li> Love Radha Tea tree Oil.</li>
            <li> and I love the jars and dropplers.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hopeful, this oil can be use in many ways</li>
            <li> And I love the color of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I received this bottle of tea tree oil for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> so it’s more of a preventative treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the many home uses for tea tree oil include: using it in soaps, fight mildew, laundry booster, use as an all purpose cleaner, freshen carpet, etc.</li>
            <li> While I have tried many of these uses and loves the results of using tea tree oil for all personally my favorite way to use tea tree oil is when I make homemade soaps and bath products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Tea Tree oil.</li>
            <li> So I went to the store and there were so many warnings: &amp;</li>
            <li> I had received this product from Radha and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several store brands through the years and this quality and amount can&#x27;t be best:)</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I also make my own vinegar based household cleaning products, and a splash of tea tree oil always makes it smell clean and refreshing (and helps hide the vinegar).</li>
            <li> Will be coming back for more!!!</li>
            <li> Too soon to evaluate effectiveness, but nobody mentioned how MUCH this stuff smells !!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff....</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is the smell, Tea Tree tends to be very pungent and strong, but the smell for the Radha is definitely bearable, even pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an EO expert, but the scent was pleasant and about what I&#x27;ve experienced with other tea tree oils.  </li>
            <li> So excited to receive my tea tree oil!  </li>
            <li> I have used tea tree products for many years, however, from many sellers, and I enjoy the unusual but to me pleasant aroma of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive this Radha Tea Tree Oil in the mail!!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, not like other brands I&#x27;ve tried that smell more chemicalized.</li>
            <li> It is a large bottle and is of good quality.</li>
            <li> Very good quality overall.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s incredibly relieving to finally know what works.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is a natural healing aid.</li>
            <li> SO FAR WORKS GREAT ON HAIR</li>
            <li> It is great for dabbing on a q-tip and applying directly to acne, or places healing on your skin.</li>
            <li> And I LOVE the beautiful cobalt blue glass bottle it comes</li>
            <li> it adds a nice fresh smell to my house</li>
            <li> fast shipment, good amount for money.</li>
            <li> Good product @ reasonable price.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping, great value.</li>
            <li> Hope to have a positive report to add to this; I&#x27;m optimistic!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s topical, smells good (to me) &amp; is so much better than putting a pill in my body!  </li>
            <li> The pure and natural aspect to it means that it has been much more effective on my daughters skin and very effective in preventing head-lice.</li>
            <li> other than that very happy with this TTO</li>
            <li> Very pure, nice smell, not as strong as others in the market.</li>
            <li> Comes with a glass dropper which makes application easy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> A SLEEP EASILY WITH THIS TEA TREE OIL</li>
            <li> The bottle was packed well and the dropper was easy to snap together.  </li>
            <li> I wash out the tea tree oil with my shampoo and it seems it wash out easy.</li>
            <li> After testing this tea tree oil out for myself I have to say it&#x27;s really a great product with many different uses and benefits!!</li>
            <li> This tea tree only is made by steam distillation of fresh leaves, which is really awesome!!</li>
            <li> It does have a strong odor</li>
            <li> Well, the trademark smell isn&#x27;t quite as strong as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend buying from these folks.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A STRONG HOPE</li>
            <li> If you have never used tea tree oil before you may be caught off guard by the strong odor.  </li>
            <li> Strong odor.</li>
            <li> Strong odor so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting the strong scent.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell but all tea tree oils have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> It might have a strong smell, but it is not offensive and fades after about an hour.</li>
            <li> I am so appreciative to have a natural product that works so effectively.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong to me as the tea tree oil</li>
            <li> The Radha brand is high quality and pure and a very good value.</li>
            <li> TO BE HONEST AROMA IS PRETTY STRONG</li>
            <li> First time user and loving all of the benefits that this oil can do.</li>
            <li> It is hands down the best that I have found for treating her skin.</li>
            <li> Pure, love the bottle and the option for the dropper!</li>
            <li> I see so many 5-star reviews, so I&#x27;m open to learning because I really want to like this product - the prices are outstanding!!!</li>
            <li> It is really light and easily added to products.  </li>
            <li> I love this tree oil and will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> The oil itself is light and clear and smells faintly of a pleasant citrus.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For the price you get a huge bottle</li>
            <li> I enjoy finding holistic approaches that apply to my life, instead of always seeking a chemical solution.</li>

            <li> The bottle is big &amp; the price is great.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff</li>
            <li> Second day I noticed a great improvement.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and will probably buy again.  </li>
            <li> Great product with multiple benefits.</li>
            <li> The soothing bath is great for giving her instant relief and coating her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> As soon as I gathered my dropped jaw at the price, cynicism and doubt filled my mind.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is great to mix with fractionated coconut oil to make remedies.  </li>
            <li> If you enjoy smelling like pine sol</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brand of tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> The amount for th money is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This seems to be genuine tea tree oil; it smells like it and gives that &amp;#34;tea tree tingle&amp;#34; if you touch it to your lip.</li>
            <li> received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> Big bottle, smells great.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Chose Radha over many others for low cost + good customer service reports.</li>
            <li> So many different uses, good value for the size.</li>
            <li> Amazing product--really nice scent which is a bit more subtle than most tea tree oils that I have tried!</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;d pay 10x that with no complaint because it would be worth it, but the super affordable cost just makes me love it that much more.</li>
            <li> Goes down nice and smooth,  pleasant aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> I love the rich texture and fresh scent of Radha TTO.</li>
            <li> This has a really strong smell, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> The colbalt blue bottle the oil comes in is very nice too.</li>
            <li> The attachment is very useful.</li>
            <li> It has proved to be very effective with my scalp problem, properly mixed with the carrier oil jojoba.</li>
            <li> of my favourite uses is to put three drops into a tub of very warm water, sit back, and relax.</li>
            <li> Very nice pure quality, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I brush all over inside my mouth and know I&#x27;m getting a quality clean, free from bacteria, etc.</li>
            <li> Main difference is that the nice 4oz.</li>
            <li> I can use it freely and it&#x27;s such a  nice quality!</li>
            <li> You will not need to use too much as this stuff is very strong.</li>
            <li> It is not unpleasant, just strong and distinctive.</li>
            <li> Also added to warm water in wash basin, and after cleansing and&lt;br /&gt;rinsing areas, and applied with warm wash cloth &amp; let dry.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about contact with the seller in sharing information on the many wonderful uses for the essential oils she carries.  </li>
            <li> Super quick delivery!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to add Radha&#x27;s tea tree oil to my collection.</li>
            <li> Have used other brands and this is superior!</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed with this purchase and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Since I am trying to be more environmentally aware</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for dry scalp and it works great for that.</li>
            <li> Gives a clean aroma.</li>
            <li> It smells clean, gets things clean, and helps to disinfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like something I would clean my kitchen floor with.</li>
            <li> : I ALSO USE IT TO CLEAN BATHROOM</li>
            <li> Buying a larger amount is more cost effective.</li>
            <li> What is it about this Tea Tree Essential Oil, that makes it so pleasant to smell?</li>
            <li> on smooth and light absorbed fast:)</li>
            <li> Radha Tea Tree Oil is of high quality and as good as any other good tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil at a good price with a good-quality dropper – a better deal than the other tea tree oils I could find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Takes the itch right out!</li>
            <li> They have amazing prices, and the smell isn&#x27;t so far &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; to discourage me from buying again.</li>
            <li> Pretty intense smell, kind of like Vicks vapor rub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> Am going to use it to clear up some mold &amp; mildew in our sleeping cabin from too warm of a winter.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced for top of the line products.</li>
            <li> Only had it a week but seems like good quality tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> and so much good they bring to our daily lives!</li>
            <li> I’ll go into it a bit more haha.</li>
            <li> Packaging was terrific; bottle is gorgeous and even came with a glass dropper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess the sunblocks and humidity wasn&#x27;t cool according to my nose.</li>
            <li> and I love that there is so much of it.  </li>
            <li> this is good quality, and 4oz should last me a while.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it is effective for skin tags.</li>
            <li> glad I found a place that I can get this product fast</li>
            <li> and that was when I started to think it wasn&#x27;t true Tea Tree Oil.  </li>
            <li> True to listing</li>
            <li> Most uses you would dilute it with a carrier so the smell would not be as much of an issue.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other tea tree oils I have tried this is a very good oil for sensitive</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, and the item was packaged very well, and arrived safely.</li>

            <li> The prices are amazing, because I&#x27;ve been paying 2-3 times more than this from any other company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smelled more piney, like the janitorial smell in a newly disinfected lavatory.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast with status updates, product exactly as described, satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> The size for the price is beyond a bargain and the smell is very soft and lovely.  </li>
            <li> Also, the blue bottle is awesome!!one more thing!</li>
            <li> , I cannot recommend this product any higher!</li>
            <li> Really like the Tea Tree Oil!!  </li>
            <li> I was certain the 4 ounce bottle was filled with a substandard product.</li>
            <li> Leaves nothing but crisp clean fresh breath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but honestly pure Tea oil from local drugstore smells better.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, low price, and a good amount.</li>
            <li> It has been most effective on skin issues that I&#x27;ve had to deal with, like dermatitis, cellulitis, acne breakouts, to name a few.</li>
            <li> Great size and dropper helps reduce waste.</li>
            <li> It has a distinctly noticeable smell with a hint of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> This product is doing just as I expected which is good.  </li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and invigorating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it, and it seems to work as expected, so that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can also use this as an ingredient in actual effective hand sanitizer because yea it helps with that too.</li>
            <li> For example, mixing it with rosehip or argan oil with make the oil more easier to wear for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far I love the bottle and</li>
            <li> i liked the larger size and dropper</li>
            <li> After my initial review the company reached out to me and offered to refund my money upon return of the product...very nice of them</li>
            <li> I rarely give reviews but this product is a must-have for anyone with acne-prone skin like me.</li>
            <li> Radha&#x27;s Tea Tree is top notch-- definitely worth the 5 stars rating given by nearly everyone.</li>
            <li> Would like more info of the various uses of the oil and also more details on if and when to add water and how much.  </li>
            <li> When her elementary school had an outbreak of head lice, I put two or three drops in her hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad of the results so far.</li>
            <li> , one of them is as an anti fungal, so my next use will be my husband&#x27;s gym shoes, I got it discounted in exchange of my honest opinion</li>
            <li> Some of the many beauty uses include: using tea tree oil to help heal and soothe sunburns, smell helps with opening sinuses and bronchial tubes for easier breathing, can be used as a natural antiseptic, use it to heal skin infections, use it to prevent lice, use it to prevent fleas, use it as a treatment for warts and insect bites, use it to treat acne, use it to treat dandruff, etc.</li>
            <li> #34;Very potent, don&#x27;t get it directly on your skin without a buffer&amp;#34; or &amp;</li>
            <li> It should actually be right along with your cosmetics and or first aid kit!</li>
            <li> /&gt;results were very positive and almost immediate.</li>
            <li> Great product-tried it on oncoming acne, it&#x27;s dried my skin right away and prevented the acne from surfacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> am sure there many other uses for Tea Tree Oil and when you go on line you get a lot of suggestions as well.</li>
            <li> I use essential oils regularly and this one is high quality and the price is great!</li>
            <li> It may have all the benefits of other tea tree oils -- for all I know, it may be superior in that respect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it for a couple of other things the company mentioned it was good for.</li>
            <li> Right now I don&#x27;t have any skin issues</li>
            <li> Takes the itch right out of a  mosquito bite.</li>
            <li> AND AT THE RIGHT PRICE</li>
            <li> It also has a glass dropper to help you use just the right amount of oil.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Radha Tea Tree Oil and so far am pleased.</li>
            <li> Good value, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I use it for so much, but mostly for pest repellant (I live in the country...</li>
            <li> I got it for all the many uses, but have been dropping a little into the bath water with some lavender and it makes the whole bathroom smell nice.  </li>
            <li> live in a large city where &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; and health food products are abundant and are extremely high quality, so I feel like I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> You do not want pure tea tree oil on you, it&#x27;s very pungent, so the dropper is very useful.  </li>
            <li> I initially gave this tea tree oil 5 stars with a great review before actually trying it.  </li>
            <li> I have been on several different antibiotics &amp; creams through my derm &amp; have not found that they do a great job</li>
            <li> Smells nice , normally not a fan of tea tree</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have natural, 100% pure oils to use, as I am a person with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Very fast n</li>
            <li> Product came very fast</li>
            <li> and they did very fast because of this</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and the product</li>
            <li> Large bottle well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is pure and useful</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived super fast, well packaged, in a pretty blue glass bottle and a separate dropper top.</li>
            <li> This bottle contains a generous amount and can be utilized for so many different things.</li>
            <li> I also personally love this brand, as I have used several products from Radha Beauty</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I said, it&#x27;s hot and humid.</li>

            <li> After many years experimenting with countless skincare products and scalp treatments-</li>
            <li> For people who are trying tea tree oil for the first time I recommend mixing it with a carrier oil first.</li>
            <li> First time trying this.</li>
            <li> Received my order extremely fast, I will never order from any where else again!</li>
            <li> I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found so many different uses for this oil.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite use is adding it to my shampoo as a solution to an itchy scalp from dandruff.</li>
            <li> First time trying tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> i love the blue glass bottle and the included dropper.</li>

            <li> Definitely going to reorder:)</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased Radha Brand.  </li>
            <li> Did exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Love this for a several reasons.</li>
            <li> very informative!</li>
            <li> I love the blue bottle the tea tree oil came in.</li>
            <li> Most commercial tea tree oils are not.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen multiple Dermatologists and have used many prescription creams without relief.</li>
            <li> But I like, first I&#x27;m trying.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more in the future.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought oils from this brand before, so for my first aid kit I wanted to have some tea tree oil</li>
            <li> As someone that loves the many different uses of tea tree oil</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil for many beauty benefits can be mixed with carrier oils such as fractionated coconut oil &amp; more.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of lavender, and this oil is definitely on target with that.</li>
            <li> Most days I straighten my hair, but this dries out my scalp, and I have some oil for my hair, but it only seems to help the bottom ends.</li>
            <li> The smell can be a little overwhelming, but it doesn&#x27;t stink - it&#x27;s just really strong.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this if you suffer from dry, itchy scalp or if you just want silky, shiny, great smelling hair.</li>
            <li> First things first this has absolutely nothing to do with this oil</li>
            <li> The instant I opened this bottle, I thought, wow this smells nice</li>
            <li> This bottle comes with a regular screw top as well as a screw-on eye dropper, which is very convenient for&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many other oils in the past, but this one has a great quality.</li>
            <li> I received the oil in return for my positive review of the product.  </li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on the rug in my classroom and the entire room immediately smells good!</li>
            <li> even the most irritated zits are calmed by morning, if not completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in my DIY beard oils and in many other useful ways.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, beings that it is 100% it is very strong but just a drop from a qtip does just fine - sometimes I will use it over moisturizer if I apply to a delicate area.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers has pointed out the oil is very strong and therefore you will not need a lot.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit like pine and with the dropper is easy to apply topically or to place in water, etc.</li>
            <li> The dropper also makes for such easy application.</li>
            <li> Also, this tea tree oil does not seem to be strong enough at all</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s not quite as strong as the last brand I bought.</li>
            <li> Large bottle included dropper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sold that this is as pure as the claim is.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> 100% pure tea tree oil as advertised.</li>
            <li> the Radha ingredients says 100% pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same quality of the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; names at a far more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree oil in particular is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Very high quality tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> I use it in combo with unrefined shea butter and pure coconut oil as a moisturizer, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a reasonable price for a large 4oz bottle which allows me to experiment without worrying about the cost.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this large supply with an eyedropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this point, i&#x27;m making my own little oil collection</li>
            <li> the Radha brand tea tree oil seems to be pretty high quality.</li>
            <li> The sink is light and very relaxing actually.</li>
            <li> But the one thing that really helped show an improvement was Radha tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> but this variety smells much lighter ...</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I use it to help with my gums since I have dental issues and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The tips that accompany the oil are very informative.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> You can tell this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for the last 6 years for my eczema, so I know genuine tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> really</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I am using it in combination with Radha&#x27;s Lavender oil to apply on acne and it has been working very well.</li>
            <li> I make up a mixture of oils with coconut (carrier) oil - tea tree, peppermint, eucalyptus, rosehip and my whole family</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working very well.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic.  </li>
            <li> Really helped my scalp issue</li>
            <li> I really like the teared oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for toe nail fungus and seems to be working real well.</li>
            <li> Geat product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really feel that this is something that everyone should have in their medicine</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, it worked on the tags.</li>
            <li> done!&lt;br /&gt;i bought this because it was discounted but also because i really like the Radha brand.</li>
            <li> But it really does help.  </li>
            <li> the real deal..</li>
            <li> My whole family uses tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> i soaked them 3 times a day for 3 weeks and absolutely nothing at all changed</li>
            <li> Stunk up the whole house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed much healthier skin with fewer blemishes.</li>
            <li> Really attacks breakouts.</li>
            <li> The bottle that I received does not have much of a scent.  </li>
            <li> That alone convinces one to feel like it is really working.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Came really fast.</li>
            <li> Very psyched to have found this use for the oil.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell you how much it has helped.</li>
            <li> Very happe with the tea tree oil</li>
            <li> Just dont really care for the smell..</li>
            <li> Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> It shipped in 2 days thanks to amazon prime, too.</li>
            <li> Working very well is relieve the summer insect bites and itches.  </li>
            <li> The Radha Tee Tree Oil comes very well packaged</li>
            <li> I like to use it straight, on my scalp and hair for dandruff and scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it really works</li>
            <li> /look in my hair like using too much hair product can do.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit strong but fades away quickly, and the stinginess is bearable.</li>
            <li> While the Radha oils are on the pricy side of essential and mixed oils I have been impressed so far with each if their products that I have tried and would be willing to pay the extra the next time I run out.</li>
            <li> Large bottle, decent smell.</li>
            <li> Most essential oils are highly volatile and will evaporate completely, leaving no oil stain on the paper.</li>
            <li> Lice is a big problem in elementary school and this oil does the job!</li>
            <li> The price is better or comparable to other tea tree oils on here and ones I&#x27;ve seen in store.</li>
            <li> Other than that, seems ok.</li>
            <li> Works better than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It smells better than other brands I have used</li>
            <li> There was a bit of a leakage in my shipment but was probably due to the hot weather, left a nice scent in the cardboard and eventually my room haha.</li>
            <li> I have used tea tree oil from several other brands before and in comparison this smells much richer and purer, hands down the best tea tree oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, high quality as described.  </li>
            <li> Not as strong as the Young Living Essential oils,</li>
            <li> Did pretty well on skin tags---you have to apply frequently.  </li>
            <li> I was instantly obsessed with this particular tea tree oil, which I now describe as a miracle product because it single handed has become the most effective remedy for any/all skin/scalp issues, and it&#x27;s by far the fastest most effective treatment for seriously sore muscles.</li>
            <li> It has so many other uses!</li>
            <li> I wish the smell was a little lighter but it is expected to have a great concentration of tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> I used a few drops on my dry scalp and it resulted in itch free head very quickly!</li>
            <li> Thanks to the Army, I live in Georgia.</li>
            <li> It seems to already be less itchy and not so many flakes.</li>
            <li> but I just love the deep blue bottle it’s packaged in…moving on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was told that Tea Tree Oil mixed with the shampoo called Free and Clear would do the trick.</li>
            <li> Currently my main use is to mix it with non-alcohol mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago on a whim, just to try it, since it is good for multiple healing abilities.</li>
            <li> I hope it was not processed under high heat.</li>
            <li> You can tell this is high quality Tea Tree Oil</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Or highly diluted?</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to our friends and others.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommendable product.</li>
            <li> High quality tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to keep in your medicine cabinet at all times</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely a high quality tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> few drops here in bath or shampoo ,great for skin ,kills fungus on feet and cures scabies ,relieves itch ,read other reviews and be amazed.</li>
            <li> It is great for toe fungus, dry scalps, cold sores and so much more.  </li>
            <li> The oil is 100% pure and natural and from steamed leaves.</li>
            <li> I was genuinely surprised at the size of the model and the large quantity I received.</li>
            <li> I recently have two new additional piercings and it has helped tremendously with the healing time.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews and it broke me out because it was too strong.</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic, especially for such a large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Why didn&#x27;t I give 5 stars?</li>
            <li> Having 4 young boys around makes it get used fast though.</li>
            <li> , normally tea tree oil tingles a bit, but this oil burned.  </li>
            <li> I love its antibacterial and antiseptic properties and I don&#x27;t think this product will ever go missing from my medicine cabinet/beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> The dropper/applicator makes it easy to apply, especially on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> So far I like the results of this oil for treating mild toenail fungus and sporadic facial outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I placed a drop on my wrist and initially the fragrance was quite strong with an undertone reminiscent of cleaning product.</li>
            <li> It is of superior quality and has eased my dry skin in just a few days where as others have taken weeks.</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil regularly, and right from the start this had an off aroma.  </li>
            <li> If I stop using tea tree oil this way it comes right back</li>
            <li> Scent lasts a long time and kills any&lt;br /&gt;bacteria, infections quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to for tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> We still want the oil, and wish Amazon or Radha would just replace us with a new bottle instead of having to go through a process of returning it and re-buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to tea tree oil</li>
            <li> New at this.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> it was on PRIME, but this stuff has so many uses I am glad I paid the extra few bucks &amp; got 4oz !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be checking here first, before purchasing essential oils elsewhere...</li>
            <li> I bought a lot of tea tree oil before this is the first one I&#x27;ve had that has a different smell.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The dispenser came completely shattered and unusable so upset!</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised by that!</li>
            <li> Smells a bit different than all of the other tea tree oils I have had, more like pine sol, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Everything else in the box that the oil came with was fine, but the oil in the Radha Tea Tree Oil bottle has leaked and spilled about half a bottle.</li>
            <li> Radha and the first thing I noticed was the smell was slightly different.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> In less than a week it has reduced skin tags size tremendously and I expect within 2 weeks they will be gone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new “in” fad for health and wellness has been oil with all the forefront on natural and therapeutic methods to relieving our issues without medication.</li>
            <li> All the same, the dropper is cool and convenient except one critical problem:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to incorporate the oil into my beauty routine as well as daily dental hydene, the uses are truly endless!</li>
            <li> I can see the positive effects in only 3 days.</li>
            <li> and the price is pretty unbelievable for being a super cure for stubborn skin and sore muscle issues.</li>
            <li> You can add drops of essential oils to give your cleaner a certain smell if you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This premium tea tree oil is 100% pure &amp; natural essential oil therapeutic grade</li>
            <li> I have learned that you can put Tea Tree oil on a cotton ball and put it in your ear when you or one of your family members has an earache and it will help lessen the pain and clear it up.  </li>
            <li> It keep my skin clear, and it does NOT burn while doing so.</li>
            <li> The next day, after I showered, I could really feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m sensitive, but I would go with another trusted brand if I were you.</li>
            <li> I like that they always give you complete information on what you can do with each product.  </li>
            <li> I expect a half-dollar sized patch on my elbow will be completely gone in another week.</li>
            <li> I have been really getting into the different oils and this is one I had never heard of.</li>
            <li> Biggest bottle I&#x27;ve seen in the market to far</li>
            <li> So far I have put it on every night before bed</li>
            <li> has not dried my scalp out either.</li>
            <li> came very well boxed and with both a regular cap as well as a dropper style lid.  </li>
            <li> So far it seems to be just what I needed.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use it to treat different skin issues, and it treates each very well.</li>
            <li> THE CONTENTS OF THE BOTTLE ARE COMPLETELY IMPOTENT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The swelling was completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I was completely over joyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
            <li> For two years I have had a very itchy scalp which four different dermatologists have prescribed medications, but no relief.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a natural odor eliminator in my bathrooms, basement, and footwear.  </li>
            <li> I put it directly on my scalp and put 20 drops each into my shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair came out soft and silky and my scalp is improving after one use.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used it as a spot treatment for blemishes.</li>
            <li> I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> so much so I decided to buy a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> and wow did it do the job.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use until this fungus is completely gone.</li>
            <li> so I do not waste the product.</li>
            <li> As far a healing athletes foot</li>
            <li> I have had all sorts of tea tree oil, this is by far my fave.</li>
            <li> It normally comes in a brown glass bottle and has a slightly yellowish hue to it, a distinct pungent odor, and an unmistakeable sting to it when it disinfects wounds.</li>
            <li> NO MORE STRONG SCENT )&lt;</li>
            <li> I know I was the first time; however, you become accustomed to it fairly quickly, especially if you use less than called for at first.  </li>
            <li> Seriously this stuff is a magic potion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try for other uses, too, but it worked well on skin, especially during my breakout.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer of this particular product NEEDS to remove &amp;#34;can be used for FLAVORING&amp;#34; on the back of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It’s not a cure, and it only works as often as I use it for my particular condition.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and so far it&#x27;s going well as I use it for my eyes![[ASIN:B00VKHKH8C Tea Tree Essential Oil - Big 4 oz - 100% Pure &amp; Natural Melaleuca Therapeutic Grade - PREMIUM QUALITY from Australia for acne and skin tag removal]]</li>
            <li> Thick, rich, high quality, well priced, with a good-grade glass dropper.  </li>
            <li> I have also used on my face for acne and it does not over dry and really has helped my skin clear up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is as strong as other tea tree oils I have had which depending on your use can be a good thing or a bad thing</li>
            <li> So far I have used it for general purpose cleaning and odor removal.</li>
            <li> Super concentrated will last a long time only takes a dab.</li>
            <li> I recently got a new job, a &#x27;fancy&#x27; desk job for that matter, so I now have to do something with myself in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Use if daily in the morning and evening and ever since i&#x27;ve noticed some very clear improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> First off, this tea tree oil does not smell like any other tea tree oil that I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it smells all wrong, which bothered me from the start, and the eyedropper doesn&#x27;t fit right on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I also put a little in a spray bottle of water to calm itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I use this for my nail fungus which I had for a LONG TIME since high school junior year.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> You might even want to dilute to use in general.  </li>
            <li> This tea tree oil can be used for general cleaning, aromatherapy, disinfection, etc.</li>
            <li> It was soft and my scalp actually felt moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying the seller was very prompt in living up to their satisfaction guarantee, so there is not much risk in trying this product to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> The delivery was impressively fast and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several days and so far it seems to be shrinking my skin tags already.</li>
            <li> I have used it once so far, although the jury is still out, it initially seems to work.</li>
            <li> I put the oil directly on it after my bath and to my surprise tonight after only 8 hours, the mark was almost gone.</li>
            <li> So far I have used the tea tree oil for dandruff on my scalp, for bug bits, for my boyfriend&#x27;s eczema, and for blemishes left by acne.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this as my main hair rinse because I believe the chemicals in shampoo are causing my scalp to be so dry.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is strong, so remember that a little bit does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Is very comparable to other tea tree oil products</li>
            <li> I am very encouraged with my progress and plan to start branching out and using the oil for other things.  </li>
            <li> They have endless uses and are much preferred to buying chemical-based health products (which may or may not be beneficial).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a 41 year old female who has moderate hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li> It did not improve my social status either.</li>
            <li> The other tea tree oils I&#x27;ve had have all smelled pretty much the same, with slightly varying degrees of potency and purity.</li>
            <li> Then I spray the same solution in the bathtub after using to make sure nothing is spreads, next it is the kitchen I wipe down the sink several times a week with Tea Tree and olive oil that keep the sink with a glow and the germs down to a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to it in a diaper rash cream for my youngest son a little over 5 years ago and began to research it</li>
            <li> I found it was a little strong &amp; burned the skin on my face slightly when trying to use it to soothe some irritated skin &amp; acne.</li>
            <li> I use it directly on my skin, mixed with some skin products that I regularly use and/or mixed with my bath water.</li>
            <li> bottle is quite large and should last you for quite awhile if used in diffusers and for simple other therapies.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I&#x27;ll quickly mix a few drops with a few drops EVOO and rub directly onto a rash, sting, bite, burn, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really helps acne, I apply a little to my skin before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m discovering new ways to use it all the time, credit due to your informational download .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong but that is due to its purity and once on, you hardly smell it.</li>
            <li> But I used this to help clear up the bump that had appeared and within a few days it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair because its dry and I have major dermatitis on my scalp.</li>
            <li> There are lots of other uses for tea tree oil, but I haven’t really tried any of them because my main purpose of purchasing and using any brand now or in the past has been for my scalp.</li>
            <li> Normally, I&#x27;d have to pour it out and would wind up with it spilling down the side of the bottle and getting on my hands.</li>
            <li> I previously bought a 2oz bottle that definitely didn&#x27;t last as long as i wanted it to, and I think that might have been because there was no way to gauge how much was coming out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be ordering some of your other oils in the near future.</li>
            <li> then I looked at the ingredients and found that my old tea tree oil had other things in it.</li>
            <li> I actually like the aroma and it does not last a really long time.</li>
            <li> It smells so strongly and so horrible that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use it.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t use it long enough to see a change in my skin tags</li>
            <li> I use this is a spray with a little coconut oil/vinegar and spray it on my dogs to keep things away in the yard we live in a woody area</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 days and the redness and itching has gone down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Live it, added a few drops to my shampoo and wwow</li>
            <li> Maybe this is a bad batch, or maybe it&#x27;s a different kind of extraction.</li>
            <li> The company asks that you email them directly if your review is less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The antibacterial and antifungal properties typical of tea tree oil are completely nonexistent here.</li>
            <li> The glass dropper arrived broken but the seller sent me a replacement quite quickly.</li>
            <li> a few drops with my night cream and my face is clear and refreshed in the morning!</li>
            <li> I suggest mixing it with a little bit of an unscented carrier oil if you have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> This might be a very good product, but it smells HORRIBLE, maybe all tea tree oil does, but I won&#x27;t use it as I can&#x27;t take the smell</li>
            <li> a few drops on my cat&#x27;s beds to help keep fleas away and as an overall general room scent.</li>
            <li> Minor cuts and scrapes benefit from tea tree oils antimicrobial effects</li>
            <li> for acne use a q-tip and add a few drops to it, put it directly on pimples</li>
            <li> From cleaning wounds to killing mold &amp; mildew naturally it&#x27;s a must have in your green arsenal.</li>
            <li> family has used tea tree oil for all sorts of things for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I use it for acne, minor cuts, and cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp when I get an ingrown hair from a short military cut.</li>
            <li> My wife had been buying tea tree oil from her hairdresser; the Paul Mitchell brand was super expensive and really no different from the product we purchased from Radha.  </li>
            <li> oil, though, smells quite different from any other brand I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be going back to the other brand.</li>
            <li> I also throw in other oils into the mouthwash mix such as clove oil, peppermint oil, sage oil and eucalyptus oil.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this product again and try other Radha beauty products.</li>
            <li> As in other oils that I have tried, it takes a month or so for a total removal.</li>
            <li> Please note that this WILL dry your hair and face after you rinse.</li>
            <li> Also on my head if I have a dry ichy spot.</li>
            <li> The itchy dry skin plagues her.</li>
            <li> Well, my moral compass will no longer allow me to do this, especially since I heavily rely on reviews before purchasing a product.</li>
            <li> , like I said I’m not sure if it should be in your make up bag or your first aid kit, might want to get a few bottles to carry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil was more liquid than other tea tree oils, and the aroma was quite different -- to me, quite unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is very weak and doesn&#x27;t have tea tree oil&#x27;s sweet woody scent in addition to an antiseptic scent.  </li>
            <li> you cant loose.</li>
            <li> My coughs, sneezes, nose-blows are down to only a couple a day!  </li>
            <li> Cap wasn&#x27;t put on properly and half of the stuff was soaked into the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used some of the Tea Tree Oil in liquefied African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I am going to reapply tonight and try it on some other minor aging skin issues and see what happens.</li>
            <li> It has dried out the skin surrounding the piercing but other than that I have had no other reactions.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have had a few pimples &amp; they seem to dry up &amp; are almost gone the next day!!  </li>
            <li> This oil has MANY uses and for less than $20 you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s because i have a bad habit of touching my face.</li>
            <li> It is a natural solution to an all too common problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> oil comes in a dark blue glass bottle, the dark coloring helping to protect the oil inside for longer.</li>
            <li> This came well packaged and as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not unusual.</li>
            <li> Also, I used it with a few drops in my shampoo for extra shine and nourishment of my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> In only a few drops you will feel the relief.</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil is was dried up the oily scalp and mixed with the shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a believer in &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; but I had a couple skin tags I wanted to remove.</li>
            <li> Very aggravated,  with the poor packaging.</li>
            <li> It dried out the pimple instantly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working wonders for my skin already only after a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious about its use as a &amp;#34;skin tag remover;&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll have to think about that one.</li>
            <li> I have only used this one a few times</li>
            <li> I recommend this especially if you have nail fungus don&#x27;t waste your time and money going to a doctor get this instead</li>
            <li> was just as expected.</li>
            <li> Came as expected.</li>
            <li> I usually do not leave reviews for products, but seriously, after using this product on my acne for a week, it has all but cleared up.</li>
            <li> After placing a few drops of tea tree oil into a new bottle of shampoo, my children bathed as usual.</li>
            <li> , totally not pure.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with a few other herbs and water, shake and spray.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for tired and achy feet.</li>
            <li> Apply very little with a q tip if used in facial treatments undiluted, it can chemically burn.</li>
            <li> I mixed a small amount of Tea Tree oil with Coconut Oil to create a conditioner serum.</li>
            <li> other words</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to prevent ingrowns and spot treating every other night or so on my face.</li>
            <li> I use the Tea Tree with other products in my hair to fight psoriasis on my hair line.</li>
            <li> Beware, other companies are doing this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The other uses I have read are for fleas, tickets, lice, insect bites and warts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel like I hae more skin tags on my neck :(</li>
            <li> but it might for the other stuff they claim it works on its got a guarantee i say go ahead and try it</li>
            <li> I see on line that people mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li> That would be upsetting, because I put it in lip balms and other skin care</li>
            <li> On the other hand..I did like the smell, so I may keep it and use it in my oil diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I no longer use bleach to kill odors coming from it and other products just haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> I used it in my hair due to an irritation on my scalp and it worked almost immediately</li>
            <li> it kills mildew and other plant diseases.</li>
            <li> Also it is clearing up some other skin problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and none of them stink.</li>
            <li> In addition, a small group of skin tags located in the same area are no longer bothering me.  </li>
            <li> it helps prevent drips that commonly happen with pouring essential oils.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing these high quality products from Radha Beauty!</li>
            <li> the past, tea tree oils have burned and scarred my face if I kept it on for too long.</li>
            <li> I have used at least 5 different brands of Tea Tree oil</li>
            <li> So far I have notice my acne redness has decreased.</li>
            <li> So I tired mixing a few drops with my hair product and massaging into in my scalp, and &amp;#34;Wah Lah&amp;#34; itchy/burning scalp no more, the smell got me at first</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s in the bottle, but it smells different, it&#x27;s completely clear, and ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS for every single purpose you might possibly use tea tree oil for.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that this really did work!!!</li>
            <li> Seems like this is watered down some.</li>
            <li> Also use post brow/lip threading and after waxing &#x27;down under&amp;#34; to prevent infection/ingrowns.</li>
            <li> I store the dropper separately so it doesn&#x27;t break down.</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil maily for acne or other skin issues, and this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the side note ono other uses!</li>
            <li> Was getting tired of buying small bottles and decided I needed a larger one to last longer.  </li>
            <li> Is ther something you can add to this to make it less offensive?  </li>
            <li> Only giving it 3 stars because 2 would be unfair for the short amount of time I been using this,,,well</li>
            <li> I previously bought tea tree oil at Walgreens and it was not close in quality to this one</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been experiencing less breakouts and keeping the slight outbreaks at bay</li>
            <li> And they became way less visible.</li>
            <li> All areas became way less oily and blackheads are look way smaller/less visible.</li>
            <li> One really dried up and half fell off.  </li>
            <li> I have a chronic cough due to allergies, sneeze all the time, and am usually battling a runny nose.</li>
            <li> When I have breakouts, I add a little to my night skin routine and</li>
            <li> sometimes, i get a little bump around it.</li>
            <li> I put a little on a skin tag and it almost gagged me.</li>
            <li> I add a little to my mop water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little soon</li>
            <li> but I seem to be seeing a little softening of the skin and elimination of scales .</li>
            <li> learned about Tea Tree Oil when my daughter was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> I just apply a little with a q-tip on the affected area(my nose, chin, forehead).</li>
            <li> so I have been putt a little bit of this tea tree oil on my acne.</li>
            <li> My family feels that the smell of this bottle is stronger in smell than other brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> So I have been using this oil everyday for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> , a friend told me she uses a few drops under the arms instead of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I mixed up approximately 2 cups water with a couple teaspoons of the tea tree oil in the spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops in the morning to rinse my mouth with and/or add a few drops to my toothpaste while brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> and it seems to actually make my acme worse instead of clearing it up.</li>
            <li> so I put a few drops in a spray  bottle with water and</li>
            <li> I add it to shampoo to fight dandruff and a far lower cost than the expensive shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s been heavily diluted.</li>
            <li> Put a few drops of this oil in your pets crates or on their beds</li>
            <li> You can also add a few drops to a carrier oil like almond oil and apply after your shower or bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few drops when I wash my hair and my itchy scalp goes away.</li>
            <li> Used for a few days on toenails and the fungus is almost gone.</li>
            <li> So far the others have shrunk in size (sorry for the detail).  </li>
            <li> so I put a few drops on it and went to bed.</li>
            <li> I might try a few drops in a steamer for my sinus troubles.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tea Tree oil for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few drops of the tree oil</li>
            <li> It came before the ink dried on the order form.</li>
            <li> worked within a few days on foot rash.</li>
            <li> Poured a few drops in all our shampoos.</li>
            <li> My poison ivy dried out in two uses.</li>
            <li> so you use just a few drops&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it for everything from putting a few drops in my bath tub to helping to sooth some scars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are no easy to find directions on how to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually put this stuff in my lotion and in a little spray bottle to spray on clothes and stuff.</li>
            <li> I got this in particular because I had a new nose piercing that was reacting horribly to my tropical vacation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Tea Tree Oil in the past to remove a wart off my son&#x27;s foot, a pimple on my face, and removing a skin tag on my face.</li>
            <li> You can add a few drops to your bath or use a diffuser and this oil will help with colds and allergies!</li>
            <li> ive seen small results after using it for 5 days...recommended.</li>
            <li> i will say that there was a small amount of oil that had leaked out of the bottle when i recieved my package.</li>
            <li> I rub a small amount on the hurting area and it starts to relieve the pain.</li>
            <li> almost bought a small 15 oz?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order this brand again, unless someone can tell me something I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> We have also bought Lavender in the past.</li>
            <li> I rub just a small dab into my scalp every day and hopefully it will continue to help.  </li>
            <li> No more smelly garbage disposal.</li>
            <li> ; I ended up putting it on a shelf and never touching it since.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(for hard to reach places).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend you purchasing this Tea Tree Oil; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When i dont have tea tree oil, i moisten the area and put salt over it until it sucks the pus/liquid out of the bump...</li>
            <li> We also deal with at least one head-lice outbreak a year.</li>
            <li> I tried it and everyone in the house complained- even those who were upstairs.</li>
            <li> If I rub it well into my scalp, wrap it up in a scarf, sleep on it and then shampoo it when I wake in the morning at least once a week it helps with my dandruff and scalp itch.</li>
            <li> and they said it seems like the fungus is slowly going away.</li>
            <li> and im talking very small skin tags-----P.S.</li>
            <li> you have kids do this… seriously.</li>
            <li> As that’s a little vague</li>
            <li> and I use it multipurpose but needed it on my eyelids for lash mites and it burned my eyelids so bad, and I was advised via research to put tiny drop on eyelids and under eyes before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I happen to be one of those unfortunate adults with skin trouble.</li>
            <li> The glass dropper is very delicate, and broke when my wife took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> got tired of being itchy.</li>
            <li> Shipping was poor, though.</li>
            <li> Had a skin tag that was irritating.  </li>
            <li> Arriived with a broken dropper.  </li>
            <li> I like this product a lot but the glass dropper arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> But my husband&#x27;s skin tags are disappearing with continued use and the worse ones are gone.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I had to post this review.</li>
            <li> I also put a drop on blemishes at night and in the morning, they aren&#x27;t so big and nasty.</li>
            <li> Working on my toenail fungus, when everything else failed.  </li>
            <li> However, I did open the bottle and was overwhelmed by the awful smell.  </li>
            <li> It was weird, because I don&#x27;t remember ever being without tea tree oil in my home.</li>
            <li> What I got erroneously labeled as tea tree oil is as chemically inert as water.</li>
            <li> I have started using it on my psoriasis and seems to be helping in just two applications where everything else has failed.</li>
            <li> For cartilage piercings, it will help prevent weird scarring and bumps.</li>
            <li> Came back from the Caribbean with some nasty bites.  </li>
            <li> also got it to remove skin tag, as some saying that it works, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> were a bit scary.</li>
            <li> Helps to soften dry cuticles and helps heal nasty paper cuts.</li>
            <li> I just held a cold washcloth over my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still too chicken to go to work without any deodorant, but if it&#x27;s a weekend, I&#x27;m using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a few days after I got a terrible sunburn.</li>
            <li> The stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> If it leaves an oil stain, it&#x27;s probably artificial fragrance oil or has been diluted with carrier oil.</li>
            <li> smells REALLY  bad.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad though.</li>
            <li> MY GOAL IS, WANT TO GET RID OF THOSE UGLY AND BROWN COLORED&lt;</li>
            <li> It will make you sick.</li>
            <li> and I have never ever been disappointed with the results that I have gotten.</li>
            <li> I have never once been disappointed with Radha...</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on the number of 5 out of 5 reviews it had but am really disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> I am tempted to try their Lavender oil but the price went up by $3 :( .</li>
            <li> So disappointed...</li>
            <li> It irritates cystic breakouts :(</li>
            <li> I hate.  </li>
            <li> - say goodbye to painful cysts!</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair when I go to school as a lice repellent.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a pattern here, all the nasty bugs hate it</li>
            <li> Horrible oil, smells like some gasoline product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I have never used tea tree oil before and had no idea it smelled so horrible!  </li>
            <li> My garbage disposal has been smelling horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell and burns like alcohol.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this bottle in return for my unbiased opinion. I have had dandruff problems for awhile, and just realized that one of the shampoos I use doesn&#x27;t help at all, so I cut that out. But the one thing that really helped show an improvement was Radha tea tree oil. I mixed a small amount of Tea Tree oil with Coconut Oil to create a conditioner serum. I rubbed the mixture all over my scalp and roots and let it sit overnight. The next day, after I showered, I could really feel a difference in my hair. It was soft and my scalp actually felt moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this mixture about once a week to keep embarrassing dandruff away. This essential oil is strong, so remember that a little bit does go a long way. This bottle contains a generous amount and can be utilized for so many different things. I enjoy finding holistic approaches that apply to my life, instead of always seeking a chemical solution.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price for this product. I love tea tree oil and am so glad to find a high quality oil for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil regularly, and right from the start this had an off aroma.  I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure that this was unadulterated tea tree oil and then I put it on my face, normally tea tree oil tingles a bit, but this oil burned.  I returned it immediately.  Maybe I&#x27;m sensitive, but I would go with another trusted brand if I were you.</li>
            <li> So excited to receive my tea tree oil!  The option of a lid or the provided dropper is so handy. The oil it&#x27;s self smell amazing!  Product provided free in return for unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> So many uses for Tea Tree oil - excellent for acne and overall healing, as well as aches.</li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s so many uses for this! I&#x27;ve used Tea Tree Oil in the past to remove a wart off my son&#x27;s foot, a pimple on my face, and removing a skin tag on my face. Right now I don&#x27;t have any skin issues what so ever, so I used this to make my own cleaner. It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes 3 1/2 Cups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1/2 Cup White, or Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;br /&gt;  3 Cups Water&lt;br /&gt;  1/4 Teaspoon Tea Tree Oil - About 10 Drops&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a big spray bottle to put the ingredients in. You can add drops of essential oils to give your cleaner a certain smell if you&#x27;d like. Shake the bottle us before you start to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I&#x27;m a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it...great size for the price too</li>
            <li> beautifully packaged. wonderful quality of product.  Smells terrific. Works quiet well&lt;br /&gt;on yeast infections of skin of a diabetic patient.  Put some drops and added water to an atomizer&lt;br /&gt;(for hard to reach places).  Also added to warm water in wash basin, and after cleansing and&lt;br /&gt;rinsing areas, and applied with warm wash cloth &amp; let dry.  Scent lasts a long time and kills any&lt;br /&gt;bacteria, infections quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tea Tree Oil for a myriad of ways for years now. It has been most effective on skin issues that I&#x27;ve had to deal with, like dermatitis, cellulitis, acne breakouts, to name a few. I use it directly on my skin, mixed with some skin products that I regularly use and/or mixed with my bath water. I love its antibacterial and antiseptic properties and I don&#x27;t think this product will ever go missing from my medicine cabinet/beauty arsenal. I also personally love this brand, as I have used several products from Radha Beauty and I have never ever been disappointed with the results that I have gotten. Two thumbs up for this brand and this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying the seller was very prompt in living up to their satisfaction guarantee, so there is not much risk in trying this product to see if you like it. It may have all the benefits of other tea tree oils -- for all I know, it may be superior in that respect.  I have used tea tree products for many years, however, from many sellers, and I enjoy the unusual but to me pleasant aroma of tea tree oil. This product was quite different. The oil was more liquid than other tea tree oils, and the aroma was quite different -- to me, quite unpleasant. It smelled more piney, like the janitorial smell in a newly disinfected lavatory. Sorry I had to post this review.</li>
            <li> Amazing product--really nice scent which is a bit more subtle than most tea tree oils that I have tried! Am going to use it to clear up some mold &amp; mildew in our sleeping cabin from too warm of a winter. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results!!</li>
            <li> So I have been using this oil everyday for a few weeks now. The smell is a bit strong but that is due to its purity and once on, you hardly smell it. I put it in my hair when I go to school as a lice repellent. Lice is a big problem in elementary school and this oil does the job! I also put a drop on blemishes at night and in the morning, they aren&#x27;t so big and nasty. Also, the blue bottle is awesome!!one more thing! I put a few drops on the rug in my classroom and the entire room immediately smells good!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. You can use it on just about everything. I love it.</li>
            <li> First time user and loving all of the benefits that this oil can do.</li>
            <li> This is authentic Tea Tree Oil, VERY strong and I use it multipurpose but needed it on my eyelids for lash mites and it burned my eyelids so bad, and I was advised via research to put tiny drop on eyelids and under eyes before bedtime. You can&#x27;t just &amp;#34;rinse off&amp;#34; TToil either so it burned for hours. I just held a cold washcloth over my eyes. I would advise NOT PUTTING THIS on your face unless you consult a doctor that knows about it or what to diluted it with, &amp;#34;water diluting&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t work. You might even want to dilute to use in general.  Nice glass jar and glass dropper which comes out of the dropper lid/squeezer but just stick it 3/4 back in.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil, I&#x27;ll be using it for a lot of things. Came in on time and well packed, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Really good quality product at an unbeattable price! Radha also has an excellent customer service. Highly recommend you purchasing this Tea Tree Oil; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> excellent product. Gives a clean aroma.</li>
            <li> This is a good size bottle for a great price. I like how they included a dropper. I usually put this stuff in my lotion and in a little spray bottle to spray on clothes and stuff. Normally, I&#x27;d have to pour it out and would wind up with it spilling down the side of the bottle and getting on my hands. You do not want pure tea tree oil on you, it&#x27;s very pungent, so the dropper is very useful.  Overall, great price and good product.</li>
            <li> So many uses, Tea Tree Oil is awesome.  I love Radha products!  Reasonably priced for top of the line products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful tea tree oil.  Great price for quantity and quality.  Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This came well packaged and as expected. Thanks to the Army, I live in Georgia. Georgia is hot, humid, and has huge bug issues. Biting bugs, stinging bugs, bugs that form SWAT teams and you are the enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of being itchy. I ordered this to make bug spray. It worked! It&#x27;s awesome in homemade bug sprays! It doesn&#x27;t end there. If you get bit or strung, rub or spray this stuff on it. The itch and bite are gone. Does this awesome products abilities end there? No!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, it&#x27;s hot and humid. So guys who sweat a lot are breeding grounds for all sorts of skin funk. I had a friend who had a rash under his arms. I told him to apply this two times a day for a week. Blammo! Skin funk gone. (I think it was a fungus but don&#x27;t tell him, he&#x27;d be all freaked out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, we got a letter that a girl at my kid&#x27;s gymnastics had the dreaded bug. Yep, lice. I mixed this with a few other herbs and water, shake and spray. No bugs. The kid? She&#x27;s a big fan. She says it smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, a friend told me she uses a few drops under the arms instead of deodorant. I was floored. She is never stinky. So I&#x27;ve been trying this. I&#x27;m still too chicken to go to work without any deodorant, but if it&#x27;s a weekend, I&#x27;m using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Ive been using some in my homemade cleaner. Man, this is awesome. It smells clean, gets things clean, and helps to disinfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, I cannot recommend this product any higher! 5 stars isn&#x27;t enough. This stuff deserves 10.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My wife had been buying tea tree oil from her hairdresser; the Paul Mitchell brand was super expensive and really no different from the product we purchased from Radha.  This is the exact same quality of the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; names at a far more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Smells fantastic and a great value.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I read that Tea Tree Oil can be used to combat mold &amp; dust mite allergies. I have a chronic cough due to allergies, sneeze all the time, and am usually battling a runny nose. I also purchased Sally Organic&#x27;s Glass Organic Spray Bottle to put my allergy-fighting concoction in.  I mixed up approximately 2 cups water with a couple teaspoons of the tea tree oil in the spray bottle.  I cleaned with it, as well as sprayed bedding, carpeting, fans, corners, the air, EVERYTHING!  I can breathe again!  My coughs, sneezes, nose-blows are down to only a couple a day!  I am convinced that the tea tree oil is working!  Anytime that I start feeling &amp;#34;allergic&amp;#34; again, I just get out my bottle, and spray around my area.  I also have used the oil in my wax warmer.  When one of my waxes has lost its scent, I have added a couple drops of the oil to it.  The scent diffuses into the air, aiding in my breathing.&lt;br /&gt;Other Points - The product smells like Lysol Concentrate - basically like a cleaner, but it works, so I don&#x27;t mind it!  The dropper is a nice bonus!</li>
            <li> Authentic tea tree! Very pleased with this brand!!</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice. Very strong smell!!! Would have been nice to have directions on how to best use this product for the things it says it will do.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with tea tree oil and I am very happy with this purchase.  I bought it with the hopes that it will remove some tiny skin tags on my neck in addition to its antiseptic/medicinal properties.  I just started using it,  but the skin tags do seem to be drying up and it has only been a week.  I also put a drop in my toothpaste and love how my mouth feels afterward. My purchase arrived on time with no issues.  I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I receive this product to test and I love it. I have used many different brand names of Tea Tree Oil and by far Radha has the best.</li>
            <li> I usually do not leave reviews for products, but seriously, after using this product on my acne for a week, it has all but cleared up. Definitely a holy grail for my routine.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Radha Tea Tree Oil and so far am pleased.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle!  Good quality.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> High-quality, satisfaction-guaranteed oil zapped my pimples -- both already formed and those forming under the skin. I&#x27;m excited to try for other uses, too, but it worked well on skin, especially during my breakout.</li>
            <li> Seems like this is watered down some. Would like to know what the % to water is.</li>
            <li> Good product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time.  Large bottle included dropper.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love the Tea Tree Oil&#x27;s many uses.  Great size and dropper helps reduce waste.</li>
            <li> wonderful pure tea tree oil - recommended by my mayo clinic doctor as aa all around soothing remedy.</li>
            <li> Another amazing oil from radha! I have a very sensitive skin so I use it to heal my skin of any impurities and any infections. I use to have acne before and I used to use tea tree oil to heal that as well but this one is great too for its medicinal values.</li>
            <li> This is what I like to call a do all potion! Radha really perfected this product making the consistency perfect as well its heeling properties doing it&#x27;s very best. I used a few drops on my dry scalp and it resulted in itch free head very quickly!</li>
            <li> Always gets rid of my acne. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> The best tea tree oil out there. I add a few drops in the morning to rinse my mouth with and/or add a few drops to my toothpaste while brushing my teeth. Either way my mouth feels refreshed and very clean!</li>
            <li> Very high quality, low price, and a good amount.</li>
            <li> We are so happy with the tea tree oil. My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple days and love it. Takes the itch right out of a  mosquito bite.</li>
            <li> I did get a coupon to try this product but review is my own ... Smells nice , normally not a fan of tea tree but this variety smells much lighter ... I used it for a bug killer :) it worked well</li>
            <li> Excellent Tea Tree oil! My daughter &amp; I use it for acne and dandruff which has been working magically! The smell is wonderful, not like other brands I&#x27;ve tried that smell more chemicalized. Comes with a glass dropper which makes application easy. The colbalt blue bottle the oil comes in is very nice too. I have never once been disappointed with Radha...great product!</li>
            <li> Working on my toenail fungus, when everything else failed.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very effective in removing acne! The smell is a little bit strong but fades away quickly, and the stinginess is bearable. Good value</li>
            <li> This is another great product in my ever growing collection of superior quality essential oils for Radha! I&#x27;ve been able to incorporate the oil into my beauty routine as well as daily dental hydene, the uses are truly endless! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to prevent ingrowns and spot treating every other night or so on my face. Also use post brow/lip threading and after waxing &#x27;down under&amp;#34; to prevent infection/ingrowns. I also put a little in a spray bottle of water to calm itchy scalp. It works.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a must have! It is an anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, an anti-bacterial and so much more. This oil has had proven results in fighting MRSA. Also an excellent product for cleaning. And our biggest use for this is to fight and prevent acne. I&#x27;m an essential oil girl. I love this oil and this company is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Only had it a week but seems like good quality tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  Still learning all the things this oil will do!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this tea tree oil over the others I have tried. I add it to my homemade hair rinse to get rid of dandruff and keep my scalp from getting itchy. I will be trying it out for skin tags soon! I was given this product to try out and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is the real thing. It is a large bottle and is of good quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Love that it comes with a dropper! Quick shipping also.</li>
            <li> What a great deal. I looked at many sellers for Tea Tree and Peppermint Essential Oils and this company was the best. I use the Tea Tree with other products in my hair to fight psoriasis on my hair line. It seems to already be less itchy and not so many flakes. Wish me luck.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! I can see the positive effects in only 3 days.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on the number of 5 out of 5 reviews it had but am really disappointed with it.  First off, this tea tree oil does not smell like any other tea tree oil that I have ever bought.  Tea tree oil has its own distinctive scent and this tea tree oil does not have that scent --  to me it smells more like rosemary or lavender.  Also, this tea tree oil does not seem to be strong enough at all and it seems to actually make my acme worse instead of clearing it up.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil can be used for general cleaning, aromatherapy, disinfection, etc. It has a nice light scent and comes in different bottle sizes. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering what the oil was shipped in. It has a distinctly noticeable smell with a hint of tea tree oil. I&#x27;m not too keen to put it on my skin...the jury&#x27;s still out. Either way I&#x27;m not bothering to return it.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I love that they include the dropper. First rate product and service.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works like it is suppose to will definently purchase in the future when I need more tee tree oil. I was given a coupon code to try this product and I am so glad I did. Its nice to have around the house for things :)</li>
            <li> Best I have had!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> nice product.  I would definitely buy it again!  prompt delivery also</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and great price!</li>
            <li> Your tea tree oil is exactly what I was looking for, I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Just started using the tea oil, seems to be working on nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Great stuff ! few drops here in bath or shampoo ,great for skin ,kills fungus on feet and cures scabies ,relieves itch ,read other reviews and be amazed.</li>
            <li> This product is doing just as I expected which is good.  It does have a strong odor but that&#x27;s not unusual. I use it to help with my gums since I have dental issues and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Bottle was much bigger than I thought. What a great value. The dropper lid that comes with it helps prevent drips that commonly happen with pouring essential oils. The tips that accompany the oil are very informative. Thanks. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product and fantastic smell. Love this product and their good customer service!</li>
            <li> I have only just received the product so I can not speak to its effectiveness.  However, I did open the bottle and was overwhelmed by the awful smell.  Is ther something you can add to this to make it less offensive?  I saw the Laveder but I don&#x27;t think this would be for a man.  Peppermint I hate.  Got anything else?</li>
            <li> Loved this product.Will use in several ways.Thanks again for your great service.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m discovering new ways to use it all the time, credit due to your informational download .&lt;br /&gt; Thank you, Radha Beauty Products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering some of your other oils in the near future.</li>
            <li> I really love it!  I use it in my creams,  shampoo, for  massage. Just love tea tree oil. And bottle is very big and cute :)</li>
            <li> You can tell this stuff is the real deal. I have used tea tree oil from several other brands before and in comparison this smells much richer and purer, hands down the best tea tree oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells so fresh and invigorating.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! This stuff works great! Never thought I&#x27;d use &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; stuff, but I love it. Shipping was poor, though. Cap wasn&#x27;t put on properly and half of the stuff was soaked into the box.&lt;br /&gt;* I recieved a discount on this product</li>
            <li> Very fast n very good. Quality</li>
            <li> I was given a deal to try this product but that does not negate my review.  I love this company and their products, why you ask. I discovered them when I ordered and paid for another product of theirs and discovered what great customer service they had.  I like that they always give you complete information on what you can do with each product.  So I was happy to try their Tea Tree oil.  This is a must have in everyone&#x27;s arsenal.  I use this in my laundry, in my shampoo, in my soap (I make myself) and numerous mixtures for my skin, and have even used in spray for dust mites.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is amazing. I ordered it to try to get rid of skin tags, which it did. I was also having an ant problem so I put a few drops in a spray  bottle with water and almost all the ants are gone. I can&#x27;t believe how many uses there are for this oil. Love it !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been mixing this with coconut oil to topically treat psoriasis. Topical steroids have lost their effectiveness after over a decade of use so I&#x27;ve been looking for another solution for quite some time. I&#x27;ve used this mixture for 6 days, and the improvement in my skin condition has been amazing! I expect a half-dollar sized patch on my elbow will be completely gone in another week. I&#x27;ve also taken 3 tablespoons of coconut oil per day orally.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product. I have tried many other oils in the past, but this one has a great quality. I especially love the glass dropper, so I can just leave it in there, making it more convenient for using on a daily basis. I use tea tree oil maily for acne or other skin issues, and this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> I ran out of tea tree oil last week. It was weird, because I don&#x27;t remember ever being without tea tree oil in my home. Having 4 young boys around makes it get used fast though. I use it for so much, but mostly for pest repellant (I live in the country...fleas, ticks, mice, etc), wellness (I make bath bombs, bath salts, skin cream, add it to a humidifier for congestion, etc), and sometimes I&#x27;ll quickly mix a few drops with a few drops EVOO and rub directly onto a rash, sting, bite, burn, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived super fast, well packaged, in a pretty blue glass bottle and a separate dropper top. The price is fantastic, especially for such a large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Why didn&#x27;t I give 5 stars? Well, the trademark smell isn&#x27;t quite as strong as I&#x27;m used to. I wish it was! I&#x27;m just not sold that this is as pure as the claim is. I&#x27;m still using it, and it seems to work as expected, so that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not giving up on this company. They have amazing prices, and the smell isn&#x27;t so far &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; to discourage me from buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for toenail fungus that I&#x27;ve had for over 20 years. I will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> The attachment is very useful. Good thought from the seller.</li>
            <li> Good product, but I do not like the constant emails from seller to leave a review. Pushy telemarketing. I probably will not buy again because of this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after learning that it was great for bumps on piercings and I must say 3 weeks later my bump is almost non existent.  I recently have two new additional piercings and it has helped tremendously with the healing time. As other reviewers has pointed out the oil is very strong and therefore you will not need a lot. It has dried out the skin surrounding the piercing but other than that I have had no other reactions. The size for the price is beyond a bargain and the smell is very soft and lovely.  I will be incorporating this in my daily uses from now on.</li>
            <li> Probably the best and most concentrated tea tree oil I have ever used. I add it to shampoo to fight dandruff and a far lower cost than the expensive shampoos out there. Please note that this WILL dry your hair and face after you rinse. Just work a good moisturizer through your hair after or use hair oil. You will not need to use too much as this stuff is very strong.</li>
            <li> Live it, added a few drops to my shampoo and wwow what s differences it makes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...the shipment was superfast and the tea tree oil is wonderful.  I can&#x27;t say enough about contact with the seller in sharing information on the many wonderful uses for the essential oils she carries.  I&#x27;ll be checking here first, before purchasing essential oils elsewhere...You can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing these high quality products from Radha Beauty!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is as strong as other tea tree oils I have had which depending on your use can be a good thing or a bad thing</li>
            <li> Horrible oil, smells like some gasoline product., totally not pure.</li>
            <li> This is great. I bought it for an itchy scalp and I felt the results after just one shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great tea tree oil!  I use it in blending essential oils for different purposes.  Quality product that was provided to me for evaluation.</li>
            <li> I have a confession to make. I initially gave this tea tree oil 5 stars with a great review before actually trying it.  The company asks that you email them directly if your review is less than 5 stars. And, since they&#x27;re giving you the product for free, you kind of feel obligated to do so. Well, my moral compass will no longer allow me to do this, especially since I heavily rely on reviews before purchasing a product. I realize now that this practice is unethical.  Beware, other companies are doing this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually tried this tea tree oil and found that it is not 100% tea tree oil. It&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s been heavily diluted. I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for the last 6 years for my eczema, so I know genuine tea tree oil. I compared it to the tea tree oil I already had from 2 different companies, and this oil smelled completely different from both of them.</li>
            <li> using it in a mixture with oregano and eucalyptus to treat all kinds of maladies great price and size and happy wiyh the quality</li>
            <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new “in” fad for health and wellness has been oil with all the forefront on natural and therapeutic methods to relieving our issues without medication. I have been really getting into the different oils and this is one I had never heard of. I immediately opened it and began reviewing it. This oil upon trying and researching was found to be used mostly for beauty and home remedies. The oil is 100% pure and natural and from steamed leaves. The 4 oz. bottle is quite large and should last you for quite awhile if used in diffusers and for simple other therapies. One of the uses I used it for was for sunburns. This oil when placed on the burn soothed the skin immediately and reduced the timing of the burn. Also, I used it with a few drops in my shampoo for extra shine and nourishment of my color treated hair. The other uses I have read are for fleas, tickets, lice, insect bites and warts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for tired and achy feet. Just apply to the bottom or to some water and soak your feet. In only a few drops you will feel the relief. This is a great oil for sore muscles and massage also. This oil has MANY uses and for less than $20 you cannot go wrong! Satisfaction Guaranteed. The smell is a bit like pine and with the dropper is easy to apply topically or to place in water, etc. This is one of the more versatile oils in its class. I love it!</li>
            <li> First things first this has absolutely nothing to do with this oil really but I just love the deep blue bottle it’s packaged in…moving on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love talking about oils, there are so many uses for them and so much good they bring to our daily lives! Tea Tree oil in particular is one of my favorites! I was first introduced to it in a diaper rash cream for my youngest son a little over 5 years ago and began to research it and all it’s many great uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A good rule of thumb is if you’ve got skin issues, it can probably fix that. As that’s a little vague I’ll go into it a bit more haha. It is best known to aid in acne, fungal infections on nails, athletes foot, scabies, and lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have kids do this… seriously. My kids have NEVER had lice once in their lives. Put a few drops of this awesome tea tree oil into their shampoo and the lice will think your kiddos just arent a great place to land on. Move along lice you won’t be landing on my kiddos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have pets? Put a few drops of this oil in your pets crates or on their beds and it keeps fleas away! This is even helpful for removing ticks. There seems to be a pattern here, all the nasty bugs hate it so I’m loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your going camping or on a family outing bring this bottle with you. It should actually be right along with your cosmetics and or first aid kit! This stuff helps with bug bites, worts, ringworm, and sunburns. You can also use this as an ingredient in actual effective hand sanitizer because yea it helps with that too. Minor cuts and scrapes benefit from tea tree oils antimicrobial effects, like I said I’m not sure if it should be in your make up bag or your first aid kit, might want to get a few bottles to carry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for acne use a q-tip and add a few drops to it, put it directly on pimples and bam they will soon go away! You can add a few drops to your bath or use a diffuser and this oil will help with colds and allergies! You can also add a few drops to a carrier oil like almond oil and apply after your shower or bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is amazing, I love what they stand for, love their products, love the packaging!&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**drops to a carrier oil like almond oil and apply after your shower or bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is amazing, I love what they stand for, love their products, love the packaging!&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review.

            <li> Had a skin tag that was irritating.  Used the tea tree oil and it was gone in two days.</li>
            <li> Radha Tea Tree Oil is of high quality and as good as any other good tea tree oil. Main difference is that the nice 4oz. size is a great value. I would definitely recommend and buy again. The dropper is terrific!!!</li>
            <li> Really helps acne, I apply a little to my skin before my moisturizer. Biggest bottle I&#x27;ve seen in the market to far that&#x27;s under $50</li>
            <li> smells REALLY  bad.  Did not remove skin tags.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is miraculous.  I have used it for many problems with excellent results.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  It already comes with a dropper.  I&#x27;ve been using it to soak my feet.  I haven&#x27;t had the tingle I&#x27;d like but my feet feel refreshed and it&#x27;s controlling any fungus I may&#x27;ve had.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Looks and smells awesomely official!</li>
            <li> great size Fast delivery great product</li>
            <li> Product arrived as said and is of good quality.  Will be buying my essential oils from them from now on.</li>
            <li> I was instantly obsessed with this particular tea tree oil, which I now describe as a miracle product because it single handed has become the most effective remedy for any/all skin/scalp issues, and it&#x27;s by far the fastest most effective treatment for seriously sore muscles. After many years experimenting with countless skincare products and scalp treatments- it&#x27;s incredibly relieving to finally know what works. The fact that this one product takes care of both is terrific- and the price is pretty unbelievable for being a super cure for stubborn skin and sore muscle issues. Honestly I&#x27;d pay 10x that with no complaint because it would be worth it, but the super affordable cost just makes me love it that much more.</li>
            <li> Some of the best tea tree oil that I have purchased.  The seller was super in letting me know it was on the way and asked if I had any problems.  Love this attention.  Will buy from this merchant again.</li>
            <li> Just started using. Will update with future results.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to for tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s not quite as strong as the last brand I bought. I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for over a year now and I do like this one the best. Large bottle, decent smell. I&#x27;m going to use it for a couple of other things the company mentioned it was good for. My daughter has something like eczema so I will be letting her try the oil on her skin. Will let you know. It does heal toe nail fungus for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! Unlike many other tea tree oils I have tried this is a very good oil for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;In the past, tea tree oils have burned and scarred my face if I kept it on for too long. This oil tingles, but does not hurt my skin at all! I am using it in combination with Radha&#x27;s Lavender oil to apply on acne and it has been working very well. For people who are trying tea tree oil for the first time I recommend mixing it with a carrier oil first. For example, mixing it with rosehip or argan oil with make the oil more easier to wear for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  I use it in combo with unrefined shea butter and pure coconut oil as a moisturizer, and it works really well.  The smell can be a little overwhelming, but it doesn&#x27;t stink - it&#x27;s just really strong.  I suggest mixing it with a little bit of an unscented carrier oil if you have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> Excellent item. I am finding many uses for this product.</li>
            <li> This Tea Tree oil has so many uses and benefits for health minded people. I use this is a spray with a little coconut oil/vinegar and spray it on my dogs to keep things away in the yard we live in a woody area and they are always outside rolling in the grass and I want none of that in the house, so this is one of uses. Then I spray the same solution in the bathtub after using to make sure nothing is spreads, next it is the kitchen I wipe down the sink several times a week with Tea Tree and olive oil that keep the sink with a glow and the germs down to a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there many other uses for Tea Tree Oil and when you go on line you get a lot of suggestions as well. This Tea Tree Oil by Radha Beauty was given to me for free for my fair and honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a day but I bought this for the purpose of putting on my toenails for fungus. I hope it works. So far I love the bottle and the dropper is great. I previously bought a 2oz bottle that definitely didn&#x27;t last as long as i wanted it to, and I think that might have been because there was no way to gauge how much was coming out. The price is better or comparable to other tea tree oils on here and ones I&#x27;ve seen in store.</li>
            <li> I love the oils that I get from Radha.  I love tea tree oil.  I use it for so many things.  I make up a mixture of oils with coconut (carrier) oil - tea tree, peppermint, eucalyptus, rosehip and my whole family uses it to relieve muscle pain.  It works so much better than anything that I have purchased at the store.</li>
            <li> Great tea tree at a great price! It&#x27;s been working very well.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. I use tea tree oil for a variety of skin issues, currently among them - shingles. This is a very nicely packaged product with an excellent glass dropper included. I recommend Radha as a source for tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Great product. I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I received great benefits from this tree oil.It also helps stop nail fungus and it&#x27;s easy to use and gets the job done. this is a must buy for many things and will always stay number one on my buying list.</li>
            <li> Awesome oil! Very large size and great price</li>
            <li> First time trying this. Chose Radha over many others for low cost + good customer service reports. Surely good oil. Added dropper is helpful. I am using it in laundry, hand soap &amp; cleaning agents. Smells real good. I am tempted to try their Lavender oil but the price went up by $3 :( . Strongly recommend buying from these folks.</li>
            <li> Packaging was terrific; bottle is gorgeous and even came with a glass dropper.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I have never used tea tree oil before and had no idea it smelled so horrible!  I had planned to use it on my sons eczema but I will have to find something that smells better to mix with it.  It smells like something I would clean my kitchen floor with.</li>
            <li> Smells good, as described. There was a bit of a leakage in my shipment but was probably due to the hot weather, left a nice scent in the cardboard and eventually my room haha. Apply very little with a q tip if used in facial treatments undiluted, it can chemically burn.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil is so versatile it&#x27;s astounding. From cleaning wounds to killing mold &amp; mildew naturally it&#x27;s a must have in your green arsenal.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping, great value. Love tea tree oil</li>
            <li> HOPE TO GET RID OF THE SKIN TAG&lt;br /&gt;CONS : TO BE HONEST AROMA IS PRETTY STRONG&lt;br /&gt;  MAKES ME FROWN WHENEVER I OPEN THE BOTTLE&lt;br /&gt;  MY GOAL IS, WANT TO GET RID OF THOSE UGLY AND BROWN COLORED&lt;br /&gt;  SKIN TAGS, STILL APPLYING TWICE DAILY BEFORE BED TIME&lt;br /&gt;  WANT TO PROOF MYSELF WILL POST LATER FOR THE RESULT&lt;br /&gt;  I HAVE A STRONG HOPE&lt;br /&gt;  IF SKIN TAGS CAN BE REMOVED&lt;br /&gt;  BY APPLYING THIS TEA TREE OIL DAILY&lt;br /&gt;PROS : I ALSO USE IT TO CLEAN BATHROOM AND IT WORKS WELL WITH THIS PORPOSE&lt;br /&gt;  I MIX ONLY ONE DROP OF TEA TREE OIL WITH 2 OZ WATER BOTTLE&lt;br /&gt;  AND SPRAY OVER MY PILLOW,&lt;br /&gt;  ( WHEN MIXED WITH WATER NO MORE STRONG SCENT )&lt;br /&gt;  I FALL A SLEEP EASILY WITH THIS TEA TREE OIL&lt;br /&gt;I WILL COME BACK FOR SKIN TAG RESULT.&lt;br /&gt;  MAKES ME SLEEP WELL</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil!! Seriously the best! I would definitely recommend. Received my order extremely fast, I will never order from any where else again!</li>
            <li> Came in great condition</li>
            <li> I love using oils for almost anything. I got this in particular because I had a new nose piercing that was reacting horribly to my tropical vacation. I guess the sunblocks and humidity wasn&#x27;t cool according to my nose. But I used this to help clear up the bump that had appeared and within a few days it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My rash is getting lighter each day!</li>
            <li> I bought a lot of tea tree oil before this is the first one I&#x27;ve had that has a different smell.  I hope it was not processed under high heat. we will see how it works. Maybe I can update this review later.</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery!  Great packaging for the glass bottle and the dropper.  You can tell this is high quality Tea Tree Oil and it is at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I am a 41 year old female who has moderate hormonal acne.  I have been on several different antibiotics &amp; creams through my derm &amp; have not found that they do a great job so why use something that has side effects &amp; doesn&#x27;t work well?  I decided to try tea tree oil as an alternative.  So far I have put it on every night before bed &amp; I have had a few pimples &amp; they seem to dry up &amp; are almost gone the next day!!  I hope that this continues to work for me b/c it&#x27;s topical, smells good (to me) &amp; is so much better than putting a pill in my body!  The bottle is big &amp; the price is great.  So far I am very pleased with this product!!</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and so far it&#x27;s going well as I use it for my eyes![[ASIN:B00VKHKH8C Tea Tree Essential Oil - Big 4 oz - 100% Pure &amp; Natural Melaleuca Therapeutic Grade - PREMIUM QUALITY from Australia for acne and skin tag removal]]</li>
            <li> We are learning more as a family how to help heal ourselves without always reaching for over the counter medicines.  There are different oils out there that can heal or prevent problems that can happen to us.  The Radha Tea Tree Oil is a therapeutic grade oil that can help with multitudes of different ailments.  Tea Tree oil has proven to help keep head lice away along with fleas from your animals beds.  I have learned that you can put Tea Tree oil on a cotton ball and put it in your ear when you or one of your family members has an earache and it will help lessen the pain and clear it up.  I put Tea Tree oil on my children&#x27;s bug bites to help stop the itching.  The more that I learn about this oil, the more I turn to it to help instead of the medicines and harmful chemicals that I use to use.&lt;br /&gt;I received product for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent tea tree oil and I love that there is so much of it.  I can use it freely and it&#x27;s such a  nice quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for years. It is definitely a must have essential oil! I was so excited to add Radha&#x27;s tea tree oil to my collection. I was thrilled with the quality; definitely one of the best and at a great price. A great investment and an incredible value for a fabulous product! Radha Beauty has done it again! Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Very aromatic.  I mix with baby oil and use as a shaving lotion.  Saves a lot of money over the ones you buy at the store.  Makes my face feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Really helped my scalp issue</li>
            <li> Very nice and seems like quite a generous  amount.</li>
            <li> I really like the teared oil I&#x27;m using it for toe nail fungus and seems to be working real well. I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I like the oil.  I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s working yet as got it for toe nail fungus and that takes awhile to get cured.  Hoping it will work sooner than later.</li>
            <li> I have had some issues with an oily scalp. I was told that Tea Tree Oil mixed with the shampoo called Free and Clear would do the trick. Well, it did. The Tea Tree Oil is was dried up the oily scalp and mixed with the shampoo has not dried my scalp out either. This was great!</li>
            <li> If you have never used tea tree oil before you may be caught off guard by the strong odor.  I know I was the first time; however, you become accustomed to it fairly quickly, especially if you use less than called for at first.  So far I have used it for general purpose cleaning and odor removal. It does a great job at both.  Having done my comparison shopping, Radha seems to offer their product at a very fair price.  Now if they would add a sheet of suggestions for use and/or come clean my house with it, it would be truly perfect:)</li>
            <li> Geat product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> too soon for any changes</li>
            <li> Good product, good value. The glass dropper is very delicate, and broke when my wife took it out of the package. Other than that, seems ok.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff,so many ways to make your life better, get YOURS today and improve your lifestyle, health, and&lt;br /&gt;Reduce your aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;Dexter Don</li>
            <li> It works like magic.  Second day I noticed a great improvement.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil and customer service.</li>
            <li> Wow! I purchased this for my daughters acne! It&#x27;s gone! I will be using more! Great seller!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quick. Is very comparable to other tea tree oil products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found so many different uses for this oil. My personal favorite use is adding it to my shampoo as a solution to an itchy scalp from dandruff. A few drops when I wash my hair and my itchy scalp goes away. It also adds softness to my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is also a great solution for acne. When I have breakouts, I add a little to my night skin routine and even the most irritated zits are calmed by morning, if not completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have school age children, like I do, you can also add some of the oil to their shampoo if you have any issues with head lice. It is a natural solution to an all too common problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family has used tea tree oil for all sorts of things for as long as I can remember. I really feel that this is something that everyone should have in their medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for review purposes. All thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and communication, quick shipping, totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a believer in &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; but I had a couple skin tags I wanted to remove. I ordered this and it was delivered on time. Much to my surprise, it worked on the tags. I&#x27;m pleased with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> First time trying tea tree oil. I heard great reviews so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll help with my acne. Product came very fast and I&#x27;m glad it came with a separate dropper.</li>
            <li> Super concentrated will last a long time only takes a dab.</li>
            <li> BEST OIL EVER. VERY POTENT! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Even comes with a dropper</li>
            <li> I bought this product for numerous reasons. I use it in my girls shampoo and mine to help repel lice. I also have been using it my daughter humidifier. The sink is light and very relaxing actually. It has helped more with her allergies than using vicks vapor pads in the humidifier.I have also used on my face for acne and it does not over dry and really has helped my skin clear up. I am extremely pleased and will be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> A lot of people use tea tree oil for acne. I actually use it for another reason. I have a nose piercing. sometimes, i get a little bump around it. i think it&#x27;s because i have a bad habit of touching my face. When i do get the bump, i just apply tea tree oil and it makes it go away. When i dont have tea tree oil, i moisten the area and put salt over it until it sucks the pus/liquid out of the bump... gross, i know. but it gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;i bought this because it was discounted but also because i really like the Radha brand. At this point, i&#x27;m making my own little oil collection</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and product arrived as described.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have taken before and after photos of my daughter&#x27;s acne on her shoulders and her back. She started using this tea tree oil on the areas and within days it was clearing up. It was a hit at the cabin as well for after care on mosquito bites. Takes the itch right out!</li>
            <li> great product, excellent price</li>
            <li> Used for a few days on toenails and the fungus is almost gone.</li>
            <li> Great price for an excellent product. .goes on smooth and light absorbed fast:)</li>
            <li> I bought this tea tree oil to add to a homemade foot balm.  The bottle was packed well and the dropper was easy to snap together.  I&#x27;m not an EO expert, but the scent was pleasant and about what I&#x27;ve experienced with other tea tree oils.  The oil has been effective in helping treat a persistent case of athlete&#x27;s foot and has also worked well in a homemade batch of deodorant.  It&#x27;s a reasonable price for a large 4oz bottle which allows me to experiment without worrying about the cost.</li>
            <li> Only giving it 3 stars because 2 would be unfair for the short amount of time I been using this,,,well i&#x27;ve been using on my skin tags on my neck for almost a week and see no results,,,tho I lo the smell of pine it bother b to have it on my neck especially when I go out i smell like my mop. I&#x27;, not giving up..I will follow up in another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;been a while,,sorry forgot to get back to the review, basically because I wasn&#x27;t impressed at bit,,used the entire bottle and I feel like I hae more skin tags on my neck :(</li>
            <li> I like that it came with the dropper included.&lt;br /&gt;Product was sealed for freshness and shipped on time with no issues.</li>
            <li> Great product-tried it on oncoming acne, it&#x27;s dried my skin right away and prevented the acne from surfacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast and good quality shipping considering the bottle is glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Did pretty well on skin tags---you have to apply frequently.  But it really does help.  One really dried up and half fell off.  So far the others have shrunk in size (sorry for the detail).  And the price is unbeatable.  Quality oil, thank you!</li>
            <li> Beautiful mild scent as opposed to some you can buy that are just too strong. I will certainly buy this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> In less than a week it has reduced skin tags size tremendously and I expect within 2 weeks they will be gone!</li>
            <li> It a very good product..ive seen small results after using it for 5 days...recommended. .its the real deal..i would only buy this brand.</li>
            <li> Arriived with a broken dropper.  Very aggravated,  with the poor packaging.</li>
            <li> This is working on my 2great toenail fungus. Need to rub on daily</li>
            <li> Looks like tea tree oil,  smells like tea tree oil,  tastes like tea tree oil,  must  be tea tree oil.  Goes down nice and smooth,  pleasant aftertaste.  Leaves nothing but crisp clean fresh breath.</li>
            <li> My order arrived promptly.  I use a lot of tea tree oil for different homemade products around my house.  I think this bigger size bottle is going to work out great!</li>
            <li> came very well boxed and with both a regular cap as well as a dropper style lid.  The quality of oil appears to be excellent and getting the larger amount was a bonus!  So far it seems to be just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes to remove some skin tags. It&#x27;s been a month and none have come off yet.</li>
            <li> The delivery was impressively fast and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product &amp; service!</li>
            <li> tea tree oil has become one of my favorite multi-purpose oils. this is good quality, and 4oz should last me a while. i love the blue glass bottle and the included dropper. i will say that there was a small amount of oil that had leaked out of the bottle when i recieved my package. other than that very happy with this TTO</li>
            <li> Been using awhile now and is pretty great on sores however skin tags are still there.</li>
            <li> The dispenser came completely shattered and unusable so upset!</li>
            <li> I use Tea Tree Oil for many things. Buying a larger amount is more cost effective. This EO is great. And the dropper makes using the right amount in recipes perfect</li>
            <li> does not remove skin tags!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Tea Tree Essential Oil and the customer service.</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin... I found it was a little strong &amp; burned the skin on my face slightly when trying to use it to soothe some irritated skin &amp; acne. The glass dropper arrived broken but the seller sent me a replacement quite quickly. I was happily surprised by that! Giving 4 stars for the customer service and the actual concentration of the oil.  Will give it another go on the skin tags &amp; insect bites.....</li>
            <li> Smells a bit different than all of the other tea tree oils I have had, more like pine sol, but it works well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell and it works great! I had a pimple on my forehead so I put a few drops on it and went to bed. When i woke up in the morning it was 90% gone!</li>
            <li> 100% pure tea tree oil as advertised. Great big bottle, for a really good price. My husband and I both use it to treat different skin issues, and it treates each very well. I also make my own vinegar based household cleaning products, and a splash of tea tree oil always makes it smell clean and refreshing (and helps hide the vinegar).</li>
            <li> Great scent.  I use it for when I have a migraine.  I rub a small amount on the hurting area and it starts to relieve the pain.</li>
            <li> a few drops with my night cream and my face is clear and refreshed in the morning!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present</li>
            <li> Love ❤ it... Will buy again from this seller..</li>
            <li> It seems to be very nice tea oil, according to the family member that uses it. Also,  I was impressed with how well the bottle was wrapped to prevent breakage or spillage.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses tea tree oil.  We love it.  My daughter swims and she uses it in her shampoo.  It can also be used to treat blemishes.  Which is what I used it for.  It dried out the pimple instantly.  Would definitely buy this formula again.</li>
            <li> I am liking this product. Too early to tell if it is effective for skin tags. I will post an update soon.</li>
            <li> Great product, price and quantity! So many uses!</li>
            <li> Best tea tree oil I have tried, and I like it being in blue glass as well. Very pleased price wise.</li>
            <li> I like this tea tree oil I have used it on some of my sons show lambs to get rid of ringworm and it does the job! I was given this tea tree for my fair and honest opinion</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several days and so far it seems to be shrinking my skin tags already.</li>
            <li> The location of our front door is such that mold growth occurs.  I ran across a recipe for TEA TREE OIL MOLD &amp; MILDEW KILLER which sounded  like it could address our problem.  The recipe calls for mixing 1 teaspoon of tea tree oil with 1 cup of water in a spray bottle.  I have used it once so far, although the jury is still out, it initially seems to work.</li>
            <li> Very effective tea tree oil and one of the best I tried</li>
            <li> I love Radha tea tree oil. I originally bought it for dry scalp and it works great for that. It has so many other uses! It just so happened to arrive a few days after I got a terrible sunburn. Radha tea tree oil has helped heal the burn and minimize peeling.</li>
            <li> Everything else in the box that the oil came with was fine, but the oil in the Radha Tea Tree Oil bottle has leaked and spilled about half a bottle. (The seal hasn&#x27;t been tampered.) We still want the oil, and wish Amazon or Radha would just replace us with a new bottle instead of having to go through a process of returning it and re-buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Since the bottle is leaking, I might not be able to even ship it back. Any recommendation?!???</li>
            <li> Amazing smells and properties</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and will probably buy again.  Was getting tired of buying small bottles and decided I needed a larger one to last longer.  I&#x27;m sure if you are looking for tea tree oil this will make you happy.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and invigorating when added to shampoo, used to soothe middle-aged complexion woes, or added to a foot soak.  Great price for a large bottle.</li>
            <li> dont buy it for skin tags it dont work at all not even on very tiny skin tags i soaked them 3 times a day for 3 weeks and absolutely nothing at all changed and im talking very small skin tags-----P.S. they contacted me and told me they would refund my money and they did very fast because of this i would say there a very good company the product didnt work for what i bought it for but it might for the other stuff they claim it works on its got a guarantee i say go ahead and try it you cant loose.</li>
            <li> bottel, squeezer, and consistency are good.</li>
            <li> Cannot give zero stars. All the same, the dropper is cool and convenient except one critical problem: THE CONTENTS OF THE BOTTLE ARE COMPLETELY IMPOTENT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought tee tree oil for its medicinal properties. It normally comes in a brown glass bottle and has a slightly yellowish hue to it, a distinct pungent odor, and an unmistakeable sting to it when it disinfects wounds. I don&#x27;t know for sure what&#x27;s in the bottle, but it smells different, it&#x27;s completely clear, and ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS for every single purpose you might possibly use tea tree oil for. The antibacterial and antifungal properties typical of tea tree oil are completely nonexistent here. What I got erroneously labeled as tea tree oil is as chemically inert as water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Tea Tree Oil most of my life, as my dad was a fan, and he&#x27;s always raved about its antiseptic qualities. I was really looking forward to receiving this large supply with an eyedropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it smells all wrong, which bothered me from the start, and the eyedropper doesn&#x27;t fit right on the bottle. It leaked in the box. It does seem to work, but I found the aforementioned issues troubling. I think I&#x27;ll be ordering the Spring Valley brand, which is medical grade, and the brand I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> It must just be me. I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this stuff. I put a little on a skin tag and it almost gagged me. Stunk up the whole house. My wife likes it though. I told her to use it outdoors.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve used it for so many things already. I add a little to my mop water. I&#x27;ve used it for homemade deodorant and bath bombs. I&#x27;ve made a spray for my house. The uses are limitless.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it for my skin, my hair, even as an aroma.  I&#x27;ve noticed much healthier skin with fewer blemishes.</li>
            <li> PERFECT. It&#x27;s working wonders for my skin already only after a few days and I&#x27;m using for my ears for my ear stretching, gauging... helped my skin tag, moley looking thing go away... it does have some smell but not a bad one, it&#x27;s like a tree smell, not pine smell, just good. I love that kind of scent though. I&#x27;ve been using it with a mixture of vit. E oil, coconut oil and moisturizing lotion for my chest, hips &amp; thighs that have some tiny stretch marks from 4 pregnancies and it&#x27;s just helping wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;I almost bought a small 15 oz? Bottle for like $6 bc it was on PRIME, but this stuff has so many uses I am glad I paid the extra few bucks &amp; got 4oz !!!! This brand is great! Will be coming back for more!!!</li>
            <li> The stuff stinks. Strong odor. I see on line that people mix it with other oils. There are no easy to find directions on how to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought some coconut oil up today I guess I&#x27;ll try some combination to see what works. I think I do it out side.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality tree tree oil. I got it for all the many uses, but have been dropping a little into the bath water with some lavender and it makes the whole bathroom smell nice.  The smell isn&#x27;t over powering like some, but of course if you don&#x27;t like tea tree oil you won&#x27;t car for this. I also had a red mark, thought it was a bug bite or rash, been on my leg for a week. I put the oil directly on it after my bath and to my surprise tonight after only 8 hours, the mark was almost gone. The swelling was completely gone.  I am going to reapply tonight and try it on some other minor aging skin issues and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It works and smells great.</li>
            <li> Large size and packaged perfectly!</li>
            <li> Very fresh and a great value!  Seems to do what I wanted it to do (I use it for cleaning and medicinal purposes).</li>
            <li> I use this oil for a lot of things. Also on my head if I have a dry ichy spot. Thank you! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with the Radha Peppermint oil. Same size bottle. The prices are amazing, because I&#x27;ve been paying 2-3 times more than this from any other company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil, though, smells quite different from any other brand I&#x27;ve purchased. Sure, it smells... tea tree...ish .... But it smells like tea tree oil PLUS something. Or highly diluted? I can&#x27;t put my finger on it. The other tea tree oils I&#x27;ve had have all smelled pretty much the same, with slightly varying degrees of potency and purity. Maybe this is a bad batch, or maybe it&#x27;s a different kind of extraction. I have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is just diluted or a cheaper extraction method, that&#x27;s better than a chemical additive or something. That would be upsetting, because I put it in lip balms and other skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a large city where &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; and health food products are abundant and are extremely high quality, so I feel like I can tell the difference. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order this brand again, unless someone can tell me something I don&#x27;t know. I see so many 5-star reviews, so I&#x27;m open to learning because I really want to like this product - the prices are outstanding!!! But maybe for a reason?</li>
            <li> My daughter swears by tea tree oil for her skin and it definitely works. The Radha brand is high quality and pure and a very good value.</li>
            <li> Arrived safely as promised. I have used some of the Tea Tree Oil in liquefied African Black Soap. Wonderful product. You have a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Great product and service.</li>
            <li> So disappointed... I used this for months, putting twice a day every day and no effect. I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. Very potent. Seems to be helping nicely with my psoriasis. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Freshest smelling oil I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> excellent product at an excellent price...</li>
            <li> Not as strong as the Young Living Essential oils, but okay.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I noticed results the first day. Really attacks breakouts. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, and the item was packaged very well, and arrived safely. The bottle that I received does not have much of a scent.  I do not know why this Tea Tree oil is not as potent as others I have used.  I wish that the scent was stronger.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND AT THE RIGHT PRICE</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  So many uses and excellent quality.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works for many different things!</li>
            <li> Seems like a good quality</li>
            <li> We love the tee tree oil. We have also bought Lavender in the past. I would highly recommend this product to our friends and others. Great for homemade things like soap shampoo etc.</li>
            <li> Love the oils, the bottle and the dropper included</li>
            <li> Love my Tea Tree Essential Oil. Have been using it everywhere for various things around my home and personal use. Awesome product, very happy. Will be purchasing more essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great product with multiple benefits. Works exactly as its supposed to.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended it for fungus on my toenails.  I don&#x27;t know ye if it&#x27;s working, but I just love the fragrance!!</li>
            <li> This is great Tea Tree oil.  Very nice pure quality, highly recommend. Have used other brands and this is superior!</li>
            <li> What is it about this Tea Tree Essential Oil, that makes it so pleasant to smell? That alone convinces one to feel like it is really working.</li>
            <li> Great for aromatherapy. Good value</li>
            <li> Love it! Must have in your medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil has a very strong fragrance but it works well for a variety of things. The manufacturer of this particular product NEEDS to remove &amp;#34;can be used for FLAVORING&amp;#34; on the back of the bottle. You cannot ingest tea tree oil. It will make you sick.</li>
            <li> glad I found a place that I can get this product fast</li>
            <li> On of the best purchases of the year.  I have started using it on my psoriasis and seems to be helping in just two applications where everything else has failed.</li>
            <li> Having heard great reports from friends, I am embarking upon a Radha Tea Tree Oil treatment regimen for skin tags.  The dropper/applicator makes it easy to apply, especially on the back of my neck. Hope to have a positive report to add to this; I&#x27;m optimistic!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews and it broke me out because it was too strong. Made my skin a wreck! Do not recommend</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Cleared up athletes foot in 2 days after we used the over the counter stuff for weeks without results.Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Came really fast. Great service. Love the product. Using it on skin tags and on roseacea. Works better than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Shipped fast with status updates, product exactly as described, satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil. It&#x27;s nature&#x27;s anti-infective. I love the rich texture and fresh scent of Radha TTO. It&#x27;s quality oil at a great price. I also love the dropper that&#x27;s included.,</li>
            <li> This product is legit. Comes in a glass bottle with a glass dropper. Wonderful oil too! A must buy if you do the &amp;#34;oil thing&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> goood!  so big botle :) that&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> Great product! I love that this bottle is so big and I love that I can use it for cleaning my kitchen. I&#x27;ve been using it for summer bug prevention and it works great and smells great! I cleaned out the inside of my cabinets, my floors, my windowsills, and my shower with this product and I love it! The smell doesn&#x27;t bother my husbands allergies and it&#x27;s super effective! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I love it it so wonderful!! I try to find thing like dat for alll my life it lot of help my face so much better from rash and pimple</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil at a good price with a good-quality dropper – a better deal than the other tea tree oils I could find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i liked the larger size and dropper but this does not smell like any tea tree oil i have ever used; that makes me concerned about using it.</li>
            <li> Very high quality tea tree oil.  And great price.  Another reviewer mentioned that she started adding it to her shower gel, and no longer has to wear deodorant.  I decided to test that as I&#x27;ve ruined many a silk shirt with deodorant.  I am shocked that this really did work!!! I cannot smell any hint of body odor and have not worn deodorant for three days, and it&#x27;s 100 degrees here.  Very psyched to have found this use for the oil.</li>
            <li> Received the Tree Tea oil about a week ago. I am using it on my hands legs and feet. It&#x27;s a little soon but I seem to be seeing a little softening of the skin and elimination of scales . I actually like the aroma and it does not last a really long time.</li>
            <li> The instant I opened this bottle, I thought, wow this smells nice and that was when I started to think it wasn&#x27;t true Tea Tree Oil.  I have used at least 5 different brands of Tea Tree oil and they all smelled about the same..this one reminds me of a combination of different oils (eucalyptus one of them).  I had been using Tea Tree oil on a skin condition and the second I changed to this one, it flared up.  So, if it is Tea Tree oil or a combination of oils, it&#x27;s definitely not the one for me.  On the other hand..I did like the smell, so I may keep it and use it in my oil diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Added an additional star for a couple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. After my initial review the company reached out to me and offered to refund my money upon return of the product...very nice of them&lt;br /&gt;2. I have decided to keep it and use it as an additive to my cleaning regime...it adds a nice fresh smell to my house&lt;br /&gt;3. It is nice diffused as well</li>
            <li> works as promised for age spots and bumps!</li>
            <li> Very good product and very pure and effective.</li>
            <li> In my home, we have two big issues. One issue stems from having a child with eczema. The itchy dry skin plagues her. We also deal with at least one head-lice outbreak a year. That dreaded letter from the kids&#x27; school arrives telling me that one of the kids in their class has head-lice. The days ahead bring constant head checks. Having a product that treats my child&#x27;s eczema and prevents head-lice is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After placing my order, this tea tree oil arrived promptly two days later surrounded by bubble wrap within a white box. I loved that it is 100% pure and natural. After placing a few drops of tea tree oil into a new bottle of shampoo, my children bathed as usual. Recently, I received that dreaded letter letting me know a child in her class had head-lice. After doing daily head checks, I realized my child had missed this outbreak. The tea tree oil had worked! I was completely over joyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree oil has also worked wonders for my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I combine 1/2 a cup of extra virgin olive oil and 20 drops of tea tree oil into a paste. Then, I apply it to my daughters skin. It is hands down the best that I have found for treating her skin. You can also use 10 drops of tea tree oil and extra virgin olive oil and put it into a bath. The soothing bath is great for giving her instant relief and coating her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this tea tree oil. The pure and natural aspect to it means that it has been much more effective on my daughters skin and very effective in preventing head-lice. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I am definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li> I use this for my acne and I can&#x27;t tell you how much it has helped. The dropper also makes for such easy application. The smell is amazing. I would recommend this if your having any issues with acne. I also use this for sties and eye infections. Just make sure you dilute it to 50%. I use coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Best tea tree oil around!!</li>
            <li> i received mine about a week ago and I bought it purposely to treat my dandruff and extra skin tag on my face. The dandruff is almost gone but haven&#x27;t seen any improvement with the skin tag on my face. I guess it&#x27;s too early to tell. Overall, product seems to be working.</li>
            <li> great product, great price</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! Definitely going to reorder:)</li>
            <li> For two years I have had a very itchy scalp which four different dermatologists have prescribed medications, but no relief.  I have used your Tea Tree Oil for a week and can feel a great deal of relief.  I rub just a small dab into my scalp every day and hopefully it will continue to help.  I am very encouraged with my progress and plan to start branching out and using the oil for other things.  It definitely be part of my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product, thank you!</li>
            <li> excellent stuff keeps the fleas out of my dogs house and pads!</li>
            <li> im so happy about this product..will buy again..thank you&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> love it and would order again</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for cystic acne. It irritates cystic breakouts :(</li>
            <li> Thick, rich, high quality, well priced, with a good-grade glass dropper.  This is used not only for body and face, but did you know a quality tea tree oil  will kill mold? (1 tsp per cup of water) I also use it as a natural odor eliminator in my bathrooms, basement, and footwear.  I&#x27;m absolutely delighted with the quality of Radha Tea Tree oil, and believe me, I do a lot of research before I bite.</li>
            <li> Very happe with the tea tree oil</li>
            <li> Grest for acne. Strong odor so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff....Just dont really care for the smell..</li>
            <li> This product smells great! The dropper is also a lovely addition -- I read reviews for some products that did not include a dropper. So far I have used the tea tree oil for dandruff on my scalp, for bug bits, for my boyfriend&#x27;s eczema, and for blemishes left by acne. It reduces itching for my scalp, his eczema, and my bug bites; and helped reduce redness and inflammation for the acne blemishes. I can&#x27;t wait to find more uses for this stuff! I put it directly on my scalp and put 20 drops each into my shampoo and conditioner. I am VERY happy with this product and will buy again once this huge 4oz bottle is finished. What a deal!!</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair because its dry and I have major dermatitis on my scalp. My hair came out soft and silky and my scalp is improving after one use. My scalp was itchy before I used this and now it isn&#x27;t. The whole house smelled great after I washed my hair with this oil. I plan to use this as my main hair rinse because I believe the chemicals in shampoo are causing my scalp to be so dry. I would definitely recommend this if you suffer from dry, itchy scalp or if you just want silky, shiny, great smelling hair.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product, nice bottle, timely delivery, low price!  Will order from Radha again! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Great quality and so easy to use. Currently my main use is to mix it with non-alcohol mouthwash. I also put a couple drops on my tooth brush. I brush all over inside my mouth and know I&#x27;m getting a quality clean, free from bacteria, etc. etc.! I&#x27;m curious about its use as a &amp;#34;skin tag remover;&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll have to think about that one. BTW, years ago - I made it into a spray for the fungal rash on my back. Worked great every time! I might try a few drops in a steamer for my sinus troubles. Wonderful company, excellent choice in bottling and including the dropper! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have been using Tea Tree oil for a few years now.  This is the first time I have purchased Radha Brand.  It is really light and easily added to products.  I wish the smell was a little lighter but it is expected to have a great concentration of tea tree oil.  I will purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this!</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I needed... lice beware!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Very pure, nice smell, not as strong as others in the market.</li>
            <li> Great product, large bottle. Delivered fast. And good communication along the way. Thank you</li>
            <li> I rarely give reviews but this product is a must-have for anyone with acne-prone skin like me. Use if daily in the morning and evening and ever since i&#x27;ve noticed some very clear improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Received it on time and great product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. I&#x27;m new to tea tree oil so I wasn&#x27;t expecting the strong scent.  It is not unpleasant, just strong and distinctive.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and it actually helped remove skin tags! Love this product.</li>
            <li> This has a really strong smell, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell. So far, I&#x27;ve used it as a spot treatment for blemishes. a few drops on my cat&#x27;s beds to help keep fleas away and as an overall general room scent. I plan on trying this out with a carrier oil for massage and hair treatment sometime soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product of very high quality. It has proved to be very effective with my scalp problem, properly mixed with the carrier oil jojoba.</li>
            <li> I use this as an additive to my homemade Condioner and it&#x27;s absolutely great. It open the pores and leaves the scalp feeling rejuvenated. Well definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Great product! True to listing</li>
            <li> I previously bought tea tree oil at Walgreens and it was not close in quality to this one</li>
            <li> Great quality, good price, fast deluvery</li>
            <li> Great product. Large bottle well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Oil! I use the tea tree oil for treating dandruff. I mix it with the Radha Peppermint and put that in my Shampoo! Tea tree is also good for mosquito bites!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This oil is perfect for treating my freshly-pierced ears. Smells great and is a natural healing aid. For cartilage piercings, it will help prevent weird scarring and bumps.</li>
            <li> Radha delivered plenty terms of rapid response, a stellar product and remarkable value.  As soon as I gathered my dropped jaw at the price, cynicism and doubt filled my mind. I was certain the 4 ounce bottle was filled with a substandard product. But I tried it anyway, probably motivated by wishful thinking I didn&#x27;t, at the time, realize existed.  I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  Radha&#x27;s Tea Tree is top notch-- definitely worth the 5 stars rating given by nearly everyone.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Tea Tree, so much so I decided to buy a larger bottle! I use vinegar as a rinse for my wash and add Tea Tree and Lavender to the vinegar and I add essential oils to a block of wood to freshen the air in my home. I am not disappointed with this purchase and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the oil to add to hand and dish soap. My garbage disposal has been smelling horrible. Since I am trying to be more environmentally aware I no longer use bleach to kill odors coming from it and other products just haven&#x27;t worked. I tried a few drops of the tree oil and wow did it do the job. No more smelly garbage disposal. Plus safe for the environment.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! been using this liquid gold for my cystic acne and I&#x27;ve been experiencing less breakouts and keeping the slight outbreaks at bay - say goodbye to painful cysts! I also use it for my daughter&#x27;s cloth wipes - super awesome! I store the dropper separately so it doesn&#x27;t break down.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell and burns like alcohol.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. Product arrived in great shape. Love the dropper. Very happy</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT.  SO FAR WORKS GREAT ON HAIR WHEN MIXED WITH SHAMPOO.  ALSO GOOD ROOM AIR FRESHNER WHEN DROPPED ON POUPOUREE (SP?)</li>
            <li> Pretty intense smell, kind of like Vicks vapor rub. Not too bad though. I used it in my hair due to an irritation on my scalp and it worked almost immediately and my scalp cleared up in two days!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered promptly and it is working.  Would like more info of the various uses of the oil and also more details on if and when to add water and how much.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, beings that it is 100% it is very strong but just a drop from a qtip does just fine - sometimes I will use it over moisturizer if I apply to a delicate area.</li>
            <li> the Radha brand tea tree oil seems to be pretty high quality. I bought 3 of the 4oz bottles because I use tea tree oil for so many things. I was using another brand before I found Radha and the first thing I noticed was the smell was slightly different. then I looked at the ingredients and found that my old tea tree oil had other things in it. 2 oils besides the tea tree oil. the Radha ingredients says 100% pure tea tree oil. so I won&#x27;t be going back to the other brand. it makes sense now why there was a slightly different smell. the price was great for the 4 oz bottles and each bottle comes with a dropper which is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an allergy to dustmites and found out that tea tree oil kills dustmites. you can add it to any non scented cleaner. I use it in a spray for around the house to kill the dustmites everywhere. 1 tea spoon of tea tree oil per 1 cup of water. shake before each use. I could tell a difference the first time I used it. I also make my own mouthwash from it. tea tree oil is antibacterial, antimicrobial and antifungal. use 1 to 2 drops of tea tree oil per 1/4 cup of water. I also throw in other oils into the mouthwash mix such as clove oil, peppermint oil, sage oil and eucalyptus oil. it&#x27;s great to keep your mouth clean and helps reverse receding gum lines. another great use for tea tree oil is in the garden. it kills mildew and other plant diseases.</li>
            <li> Love this for a several reasons. It keep my skin clear, and it does NOT burn while doing so. I am so glad I purchased this I will definitely  repurchase and the size for the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> Lice prevention here we come!</li>
            <li> A great buy for me. Thank you very much. Hope to do business with you again.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied!!  Highly recommendable product.</li>
            <li> fast shipment, good amount for money.</li>
            <li> Too soon to evaluate effectiveness, but nobody mentioned how MUCH this stuff smells !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Over the top - drives you out of the room.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to improve my crepey skin on my arms and neck</li>
            <li> A great product for a great price. Delivered within days of order.</li>
            <li> Works as promised for age spots and bumps! Great product!</li>
            <li> Has an amazing smell and I love all the uses for Tea Tree Oil! Great for bug bites to scrapes!</li>
            <li> I happen to be one of those unfortunate adults with skin trouble. I have used tea tree oil on and off over the years and as a fan Radha oils I jumped at a chance to be part of their tester group. This oil arrived quickly and the glass bottle was packed well with both bubble wrap and a separate interior box besides their outer padded mailer. I like the fact they include the dropper, which makes application a lot easer then with some oils. The oil itself is light and clear and smells faintly of a pleasant citrus. I have only used this one a few times but I am happy with both the quality of the product and the results. While the Radha oils are on the pricy side of essential and mixed oils I have been impressed so far with each if their products that I have tried and would be willing to pay the extra the next time I run out.</li>
            <li> Really like the Tea Tree Oil!!  I&#x27;ve used it in my bath and it is so aromatic and soothing! Love the smell, it&#x27;s so relaxing and makes my skin feel so smooth!  I&#x27;ll be taking it up to my camper where I don&#x27;t have a tub, but I plan on using it in my footbath that I have up there!  It&#x27;s so nice to have natural, 100% pure oils to use, as I am a person with very sensitive skin.  Another winning product from Radha Beauty!!  I received the oil in return for my positive review of the product.  Which I&#x27;m very happy to provide!</li>
            <li> I love this tree oil and will be ordering more very soon! I cannot believe the huge container! Incredible deal! Thank you!!! Also, thank you for the booklet about tea oil and all the different things it helps with! very informative!</li>
            <li> Came back from the Caribbean with some nasty bites.  Nothing stopped the itching.  I ordered this tea tree oil and it did the trick!</li>
            <li> High quality tea tree oil. I use it for acne, minor cuts, and cleaning. It is amazing for keeping my 3 lb dog from marking his territory!</li>
            <li> My tea tree oil shipped quickly and was packaged well. I use essential oils regularly and this one is high quality and the price is great! I will definitely purchase this product again and try other Radha beauty products. I love the blue bottle the tea tree oil came in. And it comes with a dropper as well.</li>
            <li> This Radha Tea Tree Oil is wonderful.  I received it to review and it has so many uses.  I especially like it as a use on skin tags.  I prefer homeopathic remedies and having the tea tree oil is a plus as a part of my medicine cabinet.  It is great for toe fungus, dry scalps, cold sores and so much more.  The best thing about it is that it is 100% pure.  Most commercial tea tree oils are not.  The bottle is a nice generous size.  This essential oil is great to mix with fractionated coconut oil to make remedies.  Great for lice or as a natural flea repellent.  There are so many more uses as well.</li>
            <li> Great quality of oil! ! I will definitely buy again.  Fast and efficient shipping all together what a joy! !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to build a collection of  Essential Oils for my family.  They have endless uses and are much preferred to buying chemical-based health products (which may or may not be beneficial).&lt;br /&gt;I learned about Tea Tree Oil when my daughter was a little girl.  When her elementary school had an outbreak of head lice, I put two or three drops in her hair.  She was, thankfully, never infected with them.&lt;br /&gt;One of my favourite uses is to put three drops into a tub of very warm water, sit back, and relax. The aroma of the tea tree oil is calming... soothing... and relaxing.  Happy Husband likes it as well.  I believe you will find many uses for it, too.&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Tea Tree Oil to facilitate this review.  I received no monetary compensation. The opinions expressed herein are my own and based on my own use of and experience with the item.</li>
            <li> The product is great. I am very pleased with it and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far I like the results of this oil for treating mild toenail fungus and sporadic facial outbreaks.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Great for skin aliments, rashes, wound care, infections, rashes and any situation that requires relief from problems with the skin. Great smell and the eye dropper applicator is so easy to use. I highly recommend this product to keep in your medicine cabinet at all times</li>
            <li> Miracle Oil – cannot say enough about the Radha brand tea tree oil, for one is not &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; with anything nor does it contain any fillers. I use this on my skin as a antiseptic, on my hair, mix it up with shea butter for a effervescent moisturizer, even fill up spray bottles with water and a droplet of this for a refresher on my furniture and linens between laundry. So many different uses, good value for the size. Get yours today!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product. I use this on my scalp when I get an ingrown hair from a short military cut. I was able to test this product out for my review. A little goes a long way. I also put it in my oil diffuser to scent my room. Excellent product. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot but the glass dropper arrived broken.  I guess that&#x27;s the risk you take to ship glass.  It&#x27;s still usable without with the dropper.</li>
            <li> Great product, Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it! I add tea tree to cleaning solutions, to the bath, to disinfect my menstrual cups, for everything. I find that this is a good quality EO for the price. The smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the large quantity. It also had a pleasing, not overpowering, scent. It relieved the itch of a rash I&#x27;ve been battling on my shin for years. I&#x27;ve seen multiple Dermatologists and have used many prescription creams without relief. This is an EXCELLENT product for multiple uses!! I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to treat persistent athlete&#x27;s foot. So far I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 days and the redness and itching has gone down quite a bit. I hope it continues to progress this way. This bottle comes with a regular screw top as well as a screw-on eye dropper, which is very convenient for&lt;br /&gt;putting a couple drops on the affected area. I&#x27;m very happy with it so far. It shipped in 2 days thanks to amazon prime, too.</li>
            <li> I use it for blackheads. And they became way less visible. Best results I ever got! I just apply a little with a q-tip on the affected area(my nose, chin, forehead). All areas became way less oily and blackheads are look way smaller/less visible. I use it about 3-4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I also got it to remove skin tag, as some saying that it works, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. But I still give it 5 starts as it works magic on my blackheads</li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is very weak and doesn&#x27;t have tea tree oil&#x27;s sweet woody scent in addition to an antiseptic scent.  It&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> I use this for my nail fungus which I had for a LONG TIME since high school junior year. I apply the oil twice a day and I can already see some improvements. Mind you I have use tea tree oil for about a month and I&#x27;m glad of the results so far. Will continue to use until this fungus is completely gone. LOVE the fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s in a big bottle. I recommend this especially if you have nail fungus don&#x27;t waste your time and money going to a doctor get this instead</li>
            <li> Working very well is relieve the summer insect bites and itches.  Will tell my camping friends they need to get some as it works much better that most itch relief creams.</li>
            <li> This might be a very good product, but it smells HORRIBLE, maybe all tea tree oil does, but I won&#x27;t use it as I can&#x27;t take the smell</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and is just what I needed. Thank you for the side note ono other uses!</li>
            <li> It came before the ink dried on the order form.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a dropper so I do not waste the product. It smells better than other brands I have used</li>
            <li> worked within a few days on foot rash. I am very happy!</li>
            <li> Skin tags removal takes a dedicated regiment of constant attention and applying this oil. As in other oils that I have tried, it takes a month or so for a total removal. After an initial application I did see a reduction in the skin tag. If you enjoy smelling like pine sol then you are in luck. As far a healing athletes foot I saw no improvement. It did not improve my social status either.</li>
            <li> I got this radha tea tree oil for my dandruff, acne, and a family members toe fungus.  You get a lot of tea tree oil in the bottle because most bottle have 1 oz and this one has 4 oz. To get rid of my dandruff I put some in my hair and leave it in for about 8 minutes so it can be a hair mask. I wash out the tea tree oil with my shampoo and it seems it wash out easy. Also I have acne on my back so I have been putt a little bit of this tea tree oil on my acne. So far I have notice my acne redness has decreased. One of my family members has toe fungus so I had them put it on their toe and leave it on and they said it seems like the fungus is slowly going away. It does have a strong smell but all tea tree oils have a strong smell. I am very happy with the results I have been seeing so far. I received this tea tree oil for free to review and give my honest feedback about it.</li>
            <li> Love Radha Tea tree Oil. Helps to soften dry cuticles and helps heal nasty paper cuts. Great stuff - will never stray from this product!</li>
            <li> Awesome quality and great value! I use it in my DIY beard oils and in many other useful ways. Tea tree oil is good stuff and this is the best brand and value I have found!</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 because it works!  It might have a strong smell, but it is not offensive and fades after about an hour. But my husband&#x27;s skin tags are disappearing with continued use and the worse ones are gone.  Also it is clearing up some other skin problems.  My doctor told me to use it for an inner ear problem I have.  But I would not recommend using it on your ears without prior doctor approval. I am reordering it so we each have a bottle to use and can keep it with our stuff. It Works! period.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but honestly pure Tea oil from local drugstore smells better. Do like the bottle and eye dropper&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service from supplier/ Amazon</li>
            <li> Really love this oil.. and great price too.</li>
            <li> This is my second radha oil purchase. The potency is great and I love the jars and dropplers. Very good quality overall.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil.  Great value too!</li>
            <li> New at this.  But I like, first I&#x27;m trying.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree oil has became a staple in our household for its antiseptic/antibacterial properties.  The Radha Tee Tree Oil comes very well packaged and I like the addition of the dropper.  Quality is comparable to what I would pay triple for at the local health food store.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and the product was just as expected.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brand of tea tree oil.  I have used tea tree oil for decades and this brand has a lovely scent and is very effective for bug bites, acne, and anything that needs a disinfectant.  I will purchase more in the future.  This tea tree oil, was delivered very quickly and in perfect condition.  I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, high quality as described.  Love the product, highly recommended</li>
            <li> Bought to use with the wool dryer balls.  I&#x27;m using but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Came as expected. Poured a few drops in all our shampoos.</li>
            <li> Very good oil. Keeps my feet fresh all day long. Also good for my skin</li>
            <li> It is great for dabbing on a q-tip and applying directly to acne, or places healing on your skin. It removes redness fairly quikly smells as armatic as tea tree oil always does.</li>
            <li> Wow best oil I ever used ......amazing I have no words. Thank you</li>
            <li> We are keeping lice away!</li>
            <li> Have used this twice a day now for well over a week and has done nothing to remove my skin tags they still look the same,I do like that it has a dropper.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and product was in good condition. It smells so strongly and so horrible that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use it. I tried it and everyone in the house complained- even those who were upstairs. ( I used it downstairs.) I&#x27;ve tried other brands and none of them stink. I won&#x27;t be using this at all. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought oils from this brand before, so for my first aid kit I wanted to have some tea tree oil and I went with this one, I love the fact that it comes with an droper, great for applying just a drop where you want it, the smell is very strong, but that&#x27;s tea tree oil for you, I haven&#x27;t use it long enough to see a change in my skin tags but I&#x27;m hopeful, this oil can be use in many ways, one of them is as an anti fungal, so my next use will be my husband&#x27;s gym shoes, I got it discounted in exchange of my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I like this oil. It is pure and useful</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My poison ivy dried out in two uses. Cleared my daughters ear piercing infection. Now using successfully on athletes foot. The amount for th money is fantastic. Having the dropper is great for ease of use. And I love the color of the bottle. Seriously this stuff is a magic potion.</li>
            <li> great stuff  concentrated so you use just a few drops&lt;br /&gt;results were very positive and almost immediate.</li>
            <li> Good value, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I received this bottle of tea tree oil for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. My family feels that the smell of this bottle is stronger in smell than other brands I have used in the past. I don’t see this as an issue as I like the smell, but my husband doesn’t so he does find it a problem. Most uses you would dilute it with a carrier so the smell would not be as much of an issue. I like to use it straight, on my scalp and hair for dandruff and scalp itch. It’s not a cure, and it only works as often as I use it for my particular condition. Different people will get different results. If I rub it well into my scalp, wrap it up in a scarf, sleep on it and then shampoo it when I wake in the morning at least once a week it helps with my dandruff and scalp itch. If I stop using tea tree oil this way it comes right back so it’s more of a preventative treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil comes in a dark blue glass bottle, the dark coloring helping to protect the oil inside for longer. All types of essential oils should come in darker glass bottles for it to stay fresher longer. It also has a glass dropper to help you use just the right amount of oil. There are lots of other uses for tea tree oil, but I haven’t really tried any of them because my main purpose of purchasing and using any brand now or in the past has been for my scalp. This is a nice 4oz bottle and works well for my purposes so I would purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> As someone that loves the many different uses of tea tree oil I was super excited to receive this Radha Tea Tree Oil in the mail!! After testing this tea tree oil out for myself I have to say it&#x27;s really a great product with many different uses and benefits!! This premium tea tree oil is 100% pure &amp; natural essential oil therapeutic grade so it&#x27;s definitely a high quality tea tree oil. This tea tree only is made by steam distillation of fresh leaves, which is really awesome!! It has many amazing uses from beauty uses to home uses. Some of the many beauty uses include: using tea tree oil to help heal and soothe sunburns, smell helps with opening sinuses and bronchial tubes for easier breathing, can be used as a natural antiseptic, use it to heal skin infections, use it to prevent lice, use it to prevent fleas, use it as a treatment for warts and insect bites, use it to treat acne, use it to treat dandruff, etc. This tea tree oil for many beauty benefits can be mixed with carrier oils such as fractionated coconut oil &amp; more.  Some of the many home uses for tea tree oil include: using it in soaps, fight mildew, laundry booster, use as an all purpose cleaner, freshen carpet, etc. While I have tried many of these uses and loves the results of using tea tree oil for all personally my favorite way to use tea tree oil is when I make homemade soaps and bath products. It really is a great product and I definitely recommend the use of tea tree oil to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Good value and full strength oils</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Tea Tree oil. I actually just bought tea tree oil from a local store and the warnings that came with it were a bit scary. I have a nail fungus so the doc&#x27;s told me to try this remedy before placing me on antibiotics and such. So I went to the store and there were so many warnings: &amp;#34;Very potent, don&#x27;t get it directly on your skin without a buffer&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Use this essential oil with caution.&amp;#34; I ended up putting it on a shelf and never touching it since. I had received this product from Radha and I LOVE it. I especially love the dropper. I use this in my facial cleanser, my body wash and on my nail with no problems. I have also used it for bug bites and soaking my feet- I LOVE this stuff!! This review is 100% my own, honest opinion as I did receive this product for free.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it really works</li>
            <li> I was genuinely surprised at the size of the model and the large quantity I received. The  scent of the oil was very pleasant when I opened the bottle. I placed a drop on my wrist and initially the fragrance was quite strong with an undertone reminiscent of cleaning product. As time passed the lavender only smell lingered. I can see myself using this product for meditation purposes. I love the smell of lavender, and this oil is definitely on target with that.</li>
            <li> Radha,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank you, thank you.  This product is remarkable. It cleared up the heat rash I had been bothered with in just two days.  In addition, a small group of skin tags located in the same area are no longer bothering me.  I am so appreciative to have a natural product that works so effectively.  I hope you will continue to carry this product because I do not plan to be without it.</li>
            <li> awesome product as always</li>
            <li> This seems to be genuine tea tree oil; it smells like it and gives that &amp;#34;tea tree tingle&amp;#34; if you touch it to your lip. And I LOVE the beautiful cobalt blue glass bottle it comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reservation:  It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong to me as the tea tree oil I&#x27;m used to buying at Trader Joes, and smells slightly different too, so I did a paper blot test on it. Basically you put a drop of oil on an index card. Most essential oils are highly volatile and will evaporate completely, leaving no oil stain on the paper. If it leaves an oil stain, it&#x27;s probably artificial fragrance oil or has been diluted with carrier oil. This oil evaporated at the same rate of the Trader Joe&#x27;s oil. It&#x27;s quite possible this is simply a different source from what I&#x27;m used to smelling, because I don&#x27;t see any indications that it&#x27;s a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> I love it! feels great and smells great! smell reminds me of line sol but I love that smell!! this oil is great!</li>
            <li> didnt come with any directions for use. havent had any results yet.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have tried several store brands through the years and this quality and amount can&#x27;t be best:)</li>
            <li> Great service, Great product... Very happy with this...</li>
            <li> Love it.  Big bottle, smells great.  I use mine for bug bites and shampoo enhancer</li>
            <li> Received the product on time and it works quite well</li>
            <li> Good product @ reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this brand of Tea Tree Oil, and it is probably the one I will stick with</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have had all sorts of tea tree oil, this is by far my fave. For the price you get a huge bottle i wanna say may 2x or 3x bigger than atvthe drug store. The dropper is rediculously convinient. Also it comes well packages and wrapped up, nothing happened to this baby. This is now my HG tea tree oil!</li>
            <li> I recently got a new job, a &#x27;fancy&#x27; desk job for that matter, so I now have to do something with myself in the mornings. Most days I straighten my hair, but this dries out my scalp, and I have some oil for my hair, but it only seems to help the bottom ends. I bought this a few weeks ago on a whim, just to try it, since it is good for multiple healing abilities. So I tired mixing a few drops with my hair product and massaging into in my scalp, and &amp;#34;Wah Lah&amp;#34; itchy/burning scalp no more, the smell got me at first but I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy it. And the best part was that it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy film/look in my hair like using too much hair product can do. I&#x27;m giving it five stars for use, good packaging - it comes with a lid and a dropper you can also use as a lid. - and for making my life a litter easier.</li>
            <li> This company is BRILLIANT.  I ordered the Tea Tree oil and the Lavender oil.  Both are quite wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Superb quality.  I use it for everything from putting a few drops in my bath tub to helping to sooth some scars.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to purchase from this company again.  Thank you so much.  Nancy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and would recommend to anyone who is looking for tea tree oil!  It is of superior quality and has eased my dry skin in just a few days where as others have taken weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product. Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This product is great! It is a great price for the oz, and quality. I&#x27;ve used this for soaking my feet, facial steams, and on my face to treat acne. The best thing about this product is the smell, Tea Tree tends to be very pungent and strong, but the smell for the Radha is definitely bearable, even pleasant.</li>
            <li> Pure, love the bottle and the option for the dropper!</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it&#x27;s working but seems legit</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Love how this includes the dropper!</li>
