            <li>I&#x27;m light olive and these colors work great for me.</li>
            <li>Great color pay off, you a light hand.</li>

            <li>Sleek is one of the best product I have use so far.  </li>
            <li>I had debated between getting this in Light or Fair.</li>
            <li>Also, it arrived about a month early, which was wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have a light olive complexion and I totally love the Sleek MadeUp Face (fair) Kit.  </li>
            <li>the contouring/bronzer is a nice complimentary shade for fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I love light better than fair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not chalky and go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I was even more pleased by how well the contour shade blends out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it :)</li>
            <li>The quality is great and the shipping is ultra fast.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but like most picture the color was off.</li>
            <li>IMO, better than NARS.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I absolutely love having all these colors together in one convenient compact.</li>
            <li>Love the highlight.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this palette.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation on all 3 sections is top notch.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the highlight color.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The highlighter is okay</li>
            <li>I use all three colors and they blend so beautifully and look natural but way better.  </li>
            <li>Each color is wonderfully pigmented, so you get excellent color payoff using only a small amount of product.</li>
            <li>The darker contour color works well and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>You have most everything you need for quick touch ups or enhancements.</li>
            <li>I love love this kit so so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s buildable, which is nice for me because I&#x27;m new to contouring.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also used them on my girlfriend who is a fair and blonde</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>The blush is also BEAUTIFUL and isn&#x27;t too dark for me.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how quickly I received this kit.</li>
            <li>It came so quickly</li>
            <li>The mirror inside is a fabulous, large size.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually quite nice.</li>
            <li>Also, this kit includes a full sized mirror which is so oft lacking in even higher end makeup products these days.</li>
            <li>Not necessarily  a bad thing, just imagine them much brighter!</li>
            <li>Definitely will repurchase. :)</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly what you see in the picture - no darker, no lighter.</li>
            <li>In &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; the blush is a golden pink and reminds me a lot of the famous Nars Orgasm.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how amazing this compact is for such a low price.</li>
            <li>The compact itself is very well made.  </li>
            <li>All of the colors are very complementary.  </li>
            <li>On all the trio the colors shown look very muted compared to real life.</li>
            <li>Very shimmery.</li>
            <li>I even got my sister to buy one after she kept using mine so much.</li>
            <li>I wear this as much as I do my NARS and YSL blush and contour/highlight products.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of sparkly/glittery stuff in the highlight color that I don&#x27;t really care for...</li>
            <li>This palette blends better than any other products i have ever bought and when i got it in the mail, the makeup was intact and not in shattered pieces.</li>
            <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed it for dark skin tones as well as it being a Becca Highlighter dupe!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amankkhaira.com/2015/07/sleek-makeup-face-form-kit-review.html</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sleek, high quality look &amp; feel.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny for such a generous quantity &amp; quality product.</li>
            <li>and I love it, it has become an everyday staple in my make up routine.</li>
            <li>The highlighter has a nice subtle shimmer and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid and quite thin, so it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li>The highlight is a light pink and the blush is a coral pink with gold shimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super pigmented, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing with blushes, you want it to go on subtle.  </li>
            <li>highlighter is very pretty with a bit of shimmer and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is black and &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34;, and you get a very generous amount of product, which considering the pigmentation, will last you forever.</li>

            <li> Very shiny, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> think I have a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; complection with dark brown hair and blue eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant about buying a contour kit because I&#x27;m not big on make up and didn&#x27;t want it to be too dark</li>

            <li> weren&#x27;t what I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I have nc20 skin and find it hard to find a matte contour powder with yellow undertones that doesn&#x27;t make me look muddy, and I found my HG contour powder here!!</li>
            <li> Also the compact is very hard to open.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> I am very pale with freckles &amp; these shades</li>
            <li> , I find it the least used pot in this palette.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find products for HAC that flatter my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this item.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the quality</li>

            <li> Finally! The right colors for my fair neutral face!! I was even more pleased by how well the contour shade blends out. Definitely will repurchase. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered the Faceform kit in Fair.  This set came in a very nice box.  The compact itself is very well made.  There is a good amount of product and the colors are pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; complection with dark brown hair and blue eyes.  The blush looked very good on me.  The darker contour color works well and is easy to apply.  It&#x27;s buildable, which is nice for me because I&#x27;m new to contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlighter is very pretty with a bit of shimmer and a little goes a long way.  All of the colors are very complementary.  This set takes all the guesswork out of highlighting and contouring.</li>
            <li> The middle color is a dead ringer for Nars Orgasm.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a good price this is. I was skeptical about the quality but it&#x27;s actually quite nice. Great product! I&#x27;m so glad I bought it :)</li>

            <li> Great colors for any skin tone! I use this every day. I&#x27;m light olive and these colors work great for me. I also used them on my girlfriend who is a fair and blonde and they looked great on her, too! The quality is great and the shipping is ultra fast. Very impressed with SLEEK!</li>
            <li> Very shiny, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but like most picture the color was off. On all the trio the colors shown look very muted compared to real life. Not necessarily  a bad thing, just imagine them much brighter! Great color pay off, you a light hand.</li>
            <li> Fabulous colors with perfect pigmentation, its colors show up perfectly on skin with minimal powder on the brush. The blush (pink) and the highlight (pearl) have some shimmer to them, but the contouring shade (brown) is completely matte. This palette blends better than any other products i have ever bought and when i got it in the mail, the makeup was intact and not in shattered pieces. I am very pleased with this SLEEK product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Sleek is one of the best product I have use so far.  I love light better than fair.</li>
            <li> IMO, better than NARS.</li>
            <li> Absolutely incredible makeup! I cannot believe how quickly I received this kit. International shipping only took about a week! The product was packaged really well, so I received it in perfect condition. The name Sleek is very fitting for the compact. I love it&#x27;s sleek, high quality look &amp; feel. The mirror inside is a fabulous, large size. It is very hard to find products for HAC that flatter my skin tone. I am very pale with freckles &amp; these shades work perfectly. I love that the bronzer is matte &amp; the blush gives me a perfect glow. Each color is wonderfully pigmented, so you get excellent color payoff using only a small amount of product. The colors blend beautifully. I absolutely love having all these colors together in one convenient compact. I cannot believe how amazing this compact is for such a low price. Worth every penny for such a generous quantity &amp; quality product.</li>
            <li> the best trio ever!!! great pigmentation, highlights without looking greasy, excellent price and fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I love love this kit so so much. I use it everyday before I leave the house. Perfect for contour and highlight. Love the highlight. Very shimmery.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this palette. The blush is a nice glowy pink/coral, which is perfect for my skin tone. The pigmentation on all 3 sections is top notch. I think the depth of color on the matte bronzer is perfect for my shade (I&#x27;m very light and I can use this for contouring without a problem). I had debated between getting this in Light or Fair. I&#x27;m happy I got the Fair!</li>
            <li> I have a light olive complexion and I totally love the Sleek MadeUp Face (fair) Kit.  I use all three colors and they blend so beautifully and look natural but way better.  Once spring is here (or before) I will be ordering this in the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; color.  Oh the anticipation!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. I was hesitant about buying a contour kit because I&#x27;m not big on make up and didn&#x27;t want it to be too dark but these colors are so nice! It came so quickly and I love it, it has become an everyday staple in my make up routine. I even got my sister to buy one after she kept using mine so much.</li>
            <li> This its the best trio ever because all that you need its in this pallet bronzer,blush and iluminator all in one. You can use the illuminator like a eyeshadow and the brocer in the crease and you are done. Loved!!!!</li>
            <li> beauty .....good packging</li>
            <li> Perfect travel palette.  In &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; the blush is a golden pink and reminds me a lot of the famous Nars Orgasm.  The highlighter has a nice subtle shimmer and the contouring/bronzer is a nice complimentary shade for fair skin.  It&#x27;s not super pigmented, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing with blushes, you want it to go on subtle.  The packaging has a nice matte almost rubberized feel.  It&#x27;s solid and quite thin, so it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li> The colors are exactly what you see in the picture - no darker, no lighter. They&#x27;re not chalky and go on very smoothly. The highlighter and blush are shimmery. The highlight is a light pink and the blush is a coral pink with gold shimmer. Absolutely beautiful. The contour color is a totally matte chocolate color. The compact does include a mirror. I absolutely LOVE the highlight color. It makes a big difference on my face. Also, it arrived about a month early, which was wonderful. The compact is about the same size as a elf concealer palette, the ones with four concealers.</li>
            <li> Sleek makes great make-up! Pigmented and beautiful. You get Dept store/professional quality makeup at a drugstore price. I swaer I wear this as much as I do my NARS and YSL blush and contour/highlight products. The packaging is black and &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34;, and you get a very generous amount of product, which considering the pigmentation, will last you forever. I  chose to purchase this before the contour kit because it is a great for carryall for your bag :) You have most everything you need for quick touch ups or enhancements. Also, this kit includes a full sized mirror which is so oft lacking in even higher end makeup products these days.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of sparkly/glittery stuff in the highlight color that I don&#x27;t really care for...you can&#x27;t be too heavy-handed with it or you start to look like one of the Twilight vampires.</li>
            <li> I am inlove to this awesome kit!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this item.  I believe I have gotten some skin problems from using this and the colors and coverage weren&#x27;t what I had expected.  Also the compact is very hard to open.</li>
            <li> LOVED this! I have nc20 skin and find it hard to find a matte contour powder with yellow undertones that doesn&#x27;t make me look muddy, and I found my HG contour powder here!! The blush is also BEAUTIFUL and isn&#x27;t too dark for me. The highlighter is okay, I find it the least used pot in this palette. Been recommending this to all my fair friends!</li>
