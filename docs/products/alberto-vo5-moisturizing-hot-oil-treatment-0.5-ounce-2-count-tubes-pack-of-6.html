            <li>The best products are not always the most expensive--the ones you can&#x27;t find at drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>it is particularly useful to be able to get a quantity of 6 packages, its nice not to have to worry about running out of product...</li>
            <li>wow is my hair happy.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive ,easy,  hair treatment.</li>
            <li>It is easy, fast, effective and affordable.</li>
            <li>It only needs to be used once a week to be very effective.</li>
            <li>I thought my hair was already healthy, but after applying this on my hair for the first time, I Could immediately feel a difference once it air-dried.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I ordered this 6-pack.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, I got the natural volume that I wanted!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a cheap, effective solution for my moisture-craving hair.  </li>
            <li>Just exactly what I expected, and I hope to continue to order these, they arrive promptly and the convenience is great...</li>
            <li>It will get scalding hot quickly.</li>
            <li>The oil gets warm and regular hot water temps, so you will not burn your scalp.</li>
            <li>The oil seemed to be watered down, trying to get more out of the product, cheap, won&#x27;t order again!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to follow the directions  Wet hair first, and don&#x27;t leave it on for more than  a minute.  </li>
            <li>my hair&#x27;s pretty dried/frizzed (from dye jobs, highlights, and straightening)</li>
            <li>so i thought i&#x27;d try the hot oil treatments</li>
            <li>and you will be thanking me for telling you about it! ;)</li>
            <li>In two treatments (during one week) I was feeling better and now a month later (two treatments a week), I am not itchy at all!</li>
            <li>the tube sit in the hot water while I wash my face in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Ring</li>
            <li>hair will absorb all of the hot oil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use conditioner on the hot oil day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A couple of times of VO5 hot oil treatment, and</li>
            <li>What drew us to this site was the great savings as compared to what we usually pay even at Wally World!</li>
            <li>It is much better than using a regular conditioner and in combination with a weightless shampoo will really leave your hair</li>
            <li>I like this product because it makes my dry hair healthy and shining.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and only adds about 5 minutes to my morning on the day I use it.</li>
            <li>my hair just didn&#x27;t lose much of its frizz</li>
            <li>so I think my expectations were reasonable.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight with a bit of wave.</li>
            <li>For my hair, this really works -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Or, as I recently found out, you can just go get the Frizz-Ease Smooth Start Shampoo and the Defrizzing Conditioner</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the whole tube.</li>
            <li>Not saying it won&#x27;t work, just didn&#x27;t help mine much.</li>
            <li>Hairdressers probably do not like it because it is so reasonably pricedâ€¦</li>
            <li>there are other cheaper ones that work much better.</li>
            <li>maybe my hair&#x27;s TOO beat up for this to have made any sorta effect on it, but it WAS pretty soft post wash...</li>
            <li>The hot oil treatment makes my hair so soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li>nice tight package, no wasted packing materials.  </li>
            <li>I have long, wavy, highlighted, fine hair (not thick).</li>
            <li>when i blow dry my hair it is smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>that one is a little easier/more convenient to use, but you pay for that convenience b/c it costs more.</li>
            <li>If I used it twice a week it may work better, but it&#x27;s a little pricey for me to use a box</li>
            <li>I think it is a great product to use instead of  expensive morrocan oil.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to buy it from her because the product was marked up so much, so</li>
            <li>I still have oil left in the first tube.</li>
            <li>My hair is back to the condition it was in when I was a kid (before hair dye, hot tools, and hairspray)</li>
            <li>consistent wear n tear from my heating tools (hair dryer and flat iron</li>
            <li>I have natural tightly coiled African hair and have tried other hot oils included pure olive oil but wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>so I tried in on my fine straight hair thinking maybe her hair was just too thick to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>The lengthy time is not even remotely necessary,the minute does just fine, i just like the extra time for the treatment to penetrate my hair.</li>
            <li>I heard about using VO5 from natural hair forums and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>One of those old products that should never disappear from the market.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>it feels soft and shiny again.  </li>
            <li>When I am in the mood, I mix one hot oil treatment tube with an equal amount of olive oil and some Aussie three minute miracle deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product used to be part of my hair care regimen a few years ago but it became more and more difficult for me to find it in stores until I didn&#x27;t find it at all.</li>
            <li>leave hair feeling or looking greasy----works on fine or thick hair.</li>
            <li>but with those you run the risk of weighted down hair, something that hasnt really happened while using these products!</li>
            <li>I have normal hair, but its dry.</li>
            <li>My hair has a shine that wasn&#x27;t there before, my hair seems stronger with the weekly use of the VO5 hot oil treatment and I&#x27;m having less issues with our humidity creating flyaways.</li>
            <li>If you want to flush 5 dollars right down the toilet.</li>

            <li> I usually do this only when im about to blow dry my hair to keep moisture.</li>
            <li> like other womens&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it alongside a couple of other hair treatments and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> My very very tight coils were actually loosened quite a bit and hung down to my shoulder....</li>
            <li> my hair down into the mug&lt;</li>
            <li> Less than $22 for 6/12 treatments at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> 5 seconds if half a tube.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li> It helps with the little flyaways that I get, but it&#x27;s temporary.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This works the product up the shaft of hair but leaves the focus on the bottom few inches.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thick hair, but the ends are brittle and break too easily due to</li>
            <li> But very slight.</li>
            <li> We all know having medical problems can get expensive and this is one of the cheapest things I have ever done to target the hair issue that works well for me.  </li>
            <li> My cousin uses this as a stand alone and it tamed her thick wavy locks in record time...</li>
            <li> This shipment had obviously gone bad for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is thin and the product does not add unwanted weight.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been using it every week without fail.</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I swear by this product! I tell all my friends to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was getting really dry, and since using this it&#x27;s like silk and not oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a month.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have been using this product for a couple years now and like it. It only needs to be used once a week to be very effective. What drew us to this site was the great savings as compared to what we usually pay even at Wally World!</li>
            <li> my hair&#x27;s pretty dried/frizzed (from dye jobs, highlights, and straightening) so i thought i&#x27;d try the hot oil treatments bc i&#x27;d heard a lot of good things baout it etc etc. it was ehhh. maybe my hair&#x27;s TOO beat up for this to have made any sorta effect on it, but it WAS pretty soft post wash...my hair just didn&#x27;t lose much of its frizz if any....</li>
            <li> I tried this product on both my daughter and myself and it didn&#x27;t work at all. My daughter has very long thick and wavy hair and we thought it would moisturize the ends. Nothing! so I tried in on my fine straight hair thinking maybe her hair was just too thick to notice a difference. still nothing. don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. there are other cheaper ones that work much better.</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference after just a couple of applications. Great product!! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and also nice for the hair. The price is also affordable for 6boxes with 2tubes per box.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive ,easy,  hair treatment. Provides lots of moisture quickly to dry, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product has been around for years and my daughter and I both have used it through out the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling or looking greasy----works on fine or thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have normal hair, but its dry. I knew buying it that I shouldn&#x27;t expect it to be a salon treatment- so I think my expectations were reasonable. It was great and it works like a charm on relatively normal hair.My coworkers noticed it as well. Big difference from before, lot of shine. I wash my hair everyday out of habit and i blow dry, flat iron. My hair is straight with a bit of wave. I recommend this to just about anyone. I think it is a great product to use instead of  expensive morrocan oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I also like the Shower Works ready-to-use kind - that one is a little easier/more convenient to use, but you pay for that convenience b/c it costs more. But both products work in terms of keeping my hair looking healthy. I would recommend using these about twice a week. For my hair, this really works - I have long, wavy, highlighted, fine hair (not thick).</li>
            <li> I have natural tightly coiled African hair and have tried other hot oils included pure olive oil but wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the result. I heard about using VO5 from natural hair forums and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. While using it in the shower I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed, but once my hair dried, I must say I was happy with the result. My very very tight coils were actually loosened quite a bit and hung down to my shoulder....with a lot of bounce. I will defiantly be using this product again.</li>
            <li> I am dismayed that I cannot find this in local drugstores anymore.  It&#x27;s such a cheap, effective solution for my moisture-craving hair.  I had changes in hair texture and thickness after a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and this product is part of my arsenal to tame my hair into making it look halfway normal / like other womens&#x27; hair.  We all know having medical problems can get expensive and this is one of the cheapest things I have ever done to target the hair issue that works well for me.  I hope they never quit making this.</li>
            <li> If you want to flush 5 dollars right down the toilet. By all means buy this product.</li>
            <li> When I am in the mood, I mix one hot oil treatment tube with an equal amount of olive oil and some Aussie three minute miracle deep conditioner. Then, I heat it just a tad in the microwave for an intensive \\&quot;conditioning pack\\&quot; treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have this all on your hair, you cover it up and then you can use a blowdryer to heat up your hair to let it all absorb nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, as I recently found out, you can just go get the Frizz-Ease Smooth Start Shampoo and the Defrizzing Conditioner and you will be thanking me for telling you about it! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realistically, you need both. You need the deep conditioning treatments and the daily shampoo/conditioner miracle of Frizz-Ease. Bless them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thick hair, but the ends are brittle and break too easily due to consistent wear n tear from my heating tools (hair dryer and flat iron used daily.) My stylist told me about this product but I didn&#x27;t want to buy it from her because the product was marked up so much, so I went in search of it a year or two later. I found it at a local store more expensive than online, so I purchased it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow o wow is my hair happy. My hair has a shine that wasn&#x27;t there before, my hair seems stronger with the weekly use of the VO5 hot oil treatment and I&#x27;m having less issues with our humidity creating flyaways. My hair is noticeably softer to the touch, and easier to manage when I straighten. I&#x27;m no longer having to use the flat iron as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love this product. Buy it once, and I promise you&#x27;ll want to keep buying.</li>
            <li> The hot oil treatment makes my hair so soft and shiney.  The oil gets warm and regular hot water temps, so you will not burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s winter or not but for the last few months by scalp was so itchy, I couldn&#x27;t stop scratching.  I decided to try this to rub into my scalp. I would leave it on and then workout so my head warmed up.  In two treatments (during one week) I was feeling better and now a month later (two treatments a week), I am not itchy at all! I don&#x27;t use the whole tube. I just put the oil on my finger tips and rubbed it into my scalp.  I still have oil left in the first tube.</li>
            <li> I tried it and did nothing to improve my dry hair. Not saying it won&#x27;t work, just didn&#x27;t help mine much.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry hair. I used it extactly follwoing the instruction coming with kit. It did not make my hair any difference.</li>
            <li> Have used this over the years.  A miracle product mainstay that I will buy when I see at a good price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff, just itchy scalp and Alberto VO5 has helped reduce the itching dramatically. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The oil seemed to be watered down, trying to get more out of the product, cheap, won&#x27;t order again!  Bad.</li>
            <li> This product used to be part of my hair care regimen a few years ago but it became more and more difficult for me to find it in stores until I didn&#x27;t find it at all. Recently I tried Amazon and it was there!!! Even though the instructions say to use it once weekly, I used it twice weekly for a month or so until my hair became lustrous and strong, then I use it as suggested to maintain my hair looking healthy.  Not only I notice the difference, but almost everybody around me. It is easy, fast, effective and affordable. Also, my hair is thin and the product does not add unwanted weight. One of those old products that should never disappear from the market.</li>
            <li> I love this, my hair feels wonderful.  I use Wen to wash and vo5 to condition before I wash with the Wen.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it makes my dry hair healthy and shining. I use it once a week. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once a week for 3 months. It&#x27;s easy to use and only adds about 5 minutes to my morning on the day I use it. I don&#x27;t follow the directions 100%. I have very long hair and have found that this works best for me:&lt;br /&gt;Heat up a mug of water&lt;br /&gt;let the tube sit in the hot water while I wash my face in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Ring my hair out (literally)&lt;br /&gt;dump the water out of the mug and squeeze in the contents of the VO5 tube&lt;br /&gt;Push my hair down into the mug&lt;br /&gt;My hair will absorb all of the hot oil. Then I run my fingers through for about a minute, maybe two. This works the product up the shaft of hair but leaves the focus on the bottom few inches.&lt;br /&gt;Then I rinse and wash my hair. I don&#x27;t use conditioner on the hot oil day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a bit greasy that day. But very slight. I must wash it the next day. It helps with the little flyaways that I get, but it&#x27;s temporary. If I used it twice a week it may work better, but it&#x27;s a little pricey for me to use a box a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed no difference in breakage or split ends.</li>
            <li> before I take a shower, it helps my hair to be manageable.  I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> The best products are not always the most expensive--the ones you can&#x27;t find at drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a product junkie and having the tendency of buying more expensive products, I was a bit hesitant about purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, once every week. Wow. I don&#x27;t have damaged hair by any means, but I take care of it anyway. I thought my hair was already healthy, but after applying this on my hair for the first time, I Could immediately feel a difference once it air-dried. I love it so much, I ordered this 6-pack. Definitely a must.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is wonderful.  This shipment had obviously gone bad for whatever reason. I have sent it all back and expect a refund.</li>
            <li> it is particularly useful to be able to get a quantity of 6 packages, its nice not to have to worry about running out of product...many retail stores don&#x27;t even carry VO5 Hot Oil so to be able to order this amount is perfect for me...nice tight package, no wasted packing materials.  Just exactly what I expected, and I hope to continue to order these, they arrive promptly and the convenience is great...</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions, and you will get the best results.  My hair looked and felt like straw.  A couple of times of VO5 hot oil treatment, and it feels soft and shiny again.  Use it once or twice a week.  And most importantly, I got the natural volume that I wanted!  Hairdressers probably do not like it because it is so reasonably pricedâ€¦Less than $22 for 6/12 treatments at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Bought this at walmart for I think around five bucks. I use it alongside a couple of other hair treatments and have no complaints. My hair is back to the condition it was in when I was a kid (before hair dye, hot tools, and hairspray) My cousin uses this as a stand alone and it tamed her thick wavy locks in record time...</li>
            <li> I have sworn by this oil treatment for decades.  It is much better than using a regular conditioner and in combination with a weightless shampoo will really leave your hair nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to follow the directions  Wet hair first, and don&#x27;t leave it on for more than  a minute.  You can use it several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I warm it by microwaving for 10 seconds..BE Careful  - NO LONGER.  It will get scalding hot quickly. 5 seconds if half a tube.</li>
            <li> I have used this for decades and it is my go to product when my hair needs moisture.  Lately, I have been using it every week without fail.</li>
            <li> I have course,medium-thick hair. I usually do this only when im about to blow dry my hair to keep moisture. I wet my hair,pour this is in, put a Plastic bag over my hair and leave for 30 minutes. The lengthy time is not even remotely necessary,the minute does just fine, i just like the extra time for the treatment to penetrate my hair. I make sure i wash everything out (to avoid heaviness or any weight in my hair) and voila when i blow dry my hair it is smooth and hydrated. Great results for about the $4.00 i pay. Of course you can do your at home EVOO or COCO oil treatments but with those you run the risk of weighted down hair, something that hasnt really happened while using these products!</li>
            <li> VO5 does wonders and it has for years. I recommend this product every time. It helps repair damaged hair and split ends.</li>
