    <ol>
            <li>This is great!  </li>
            <li>I feel like i have a beautiful head of  hair.  </li>
            <li>I used the Fat Hair foam and it always worked great, yet sticky.</li>
            <li>This is not as great and still makes hair sticky.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great but does not thicken my AT ALL.</li>
            <li>It smells good too, so that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
            <li>Anchor with some good hairspray, and your hair is set.</li>
            <li>Works great for my fine hair!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with Samy Fat Hair \\&quot;0\\&quot; calorie Thickening /first time purchase .  </li>
            <li>It is a good addition, softening my (thinning) hair and giving it a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>Love the price too!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like putting a light hair spray on that smell great...</li>
            <li>I thought it had been discontinued so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Loved the original formula in the gray bottle, will not buy this product again!</li>
            <li>It sprays in a very fine mist</li>
            <li>I love this stuff,  I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>The creme did not give nearly as much fullness or volume; might be good for someone with coarser or curly hair, but the spray is better for my hair and lighter!</li>
            <li>One of the best thickening products out there, a definitely must buy.</li>
            <li>The creme is even better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>When I use this product I&#x27;m able to style my hair.</li>
            <li>Love love love this.</li>
            <li>I might even grow to love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like it too because it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff--it really makes my fine hair fat!  </li>
            <li>And the price for this product is such a great deal considering how it makes my hair look and how it makes me feel about my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an outstanding life-changing product, but it lives up to its claims  pretty well.</li>
            <li>I also love spraying it on my hot rollers while they&#x27;re on my head.</li>
            <li>This stuff is wicked addicting, so prepare to never be able to live without it!</li>
            <li>Item came as described and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for several years, very happy with results, even in the Deep South humidity.</li>
            <li>Great product for those of us who have thin, fine hair..</li>
            <li>By the way, this has a very slight, pleasant fragrance that once applied, you really don&#x27;t smell at all.  </li>
            <li>It looks soft and full.</li>
            <li>It feels like air and it makes such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this product for awhile now i really like it</li>
            <li>I can style my hair like I want, it&#x27;s got body and volume and looks much thicker and</li>
            <li>This really seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not getting too much product in an one place.</li>
            <li>All I really wanted in hair thickening product was one that would make my hair appear thicker or fuller.....</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I compared it with the Fat Hair Thickening Creme, but the Spray is so much better for my fine, thin hair!  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does make fine, limp hair thicker.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this considering</li>
            <li>I thought I would try something new because I run out of my usual stuff so quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it every day on wet hair and when I want sexy going-out hair I spray it on after I&#x27;ve dried it as well.</li>
            <li>I apply it to freshly washed, conditioned and towel dried but still damp hair.  </li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied, changed the original formula from thickening hair to to volumizing (big difference for my thin hair).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product to be honest, but I have a ton of long thin hair and was looking for something that might add a little strength to it without adding any weight.</li>

            <li> Due to illness and medications that I take my hair has been thinning considerably.  </li>
            <li> Blow dry on low, finger combing and scrunching as you go.</li>
            <li> Products and suplements to regrow hair have produced limited results.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the various Fat Hair products for a few years and thought I&#x27;d try this mist.</li>
            <li> Not really what is says it is.</li>
            <li> or I might add some anti-frizz/gloss product or small amount of soft styling product afterwards and blow dry a little.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin blonde hair which I usually keep on the short side(a cross between Sharon stone&#x27;s short do and a chicken).</li>
            <li> Then I will either let my hair air dry down, in a very loose bun (which helps to add some waves to my hair)</li>
            <li> I had been using this other product until this brand name hair product company changed the formulation of their  thickening spray to be a sticky styling product.  </li>
            <li> less expensive here than at salon, where I purchased my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I used it on my mother&#x27;s hair and there is daylight and dark difference in the texture of her hair now.  </li>
            <li> even the next day, I look like I have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Spray it on directly(sparingly) or put some on your hands and work thru damp hair for less control.</li>
            <li> I hate flat hair and this is the one product that really gives my hair some body.</li>
            <li> And NOT include a sticky hairspray and NOT leave my hair crunchy or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I had ran out of my usual product (Beyond the Zone-hair thickener).</li>
            <li> Its so trippy how thick your hair feels and looks IMMEDIATELY after spraying this in.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that I can&#x27;t do anything with.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i think they are no longer making it??</li>

            <li> Very pleased with Samy Fat Hair \\&quot;0\\&quot; calorie Thickening /first time purchase .  I bought Samy Fat Hair \\&quot;0\\&quot; calorie thickening spray  as a leap of faith.  I had been using this other product until this brand name hair product company changed the formulation of their  thickening spray to be a sticky styling product.  Due to illness and medications that I take my hair has been thinning considerably.  Products and suplements to regrow hair have produced limited results.  All I really wanted in hair thickening product was one that would make my hair appear thicker or fuller.....And NOT include a sticky hairspray and NOT leave my hair crunchy or stiff.  Well, to my surprise, this product delivered.  This makes my hair look, appear and feel fuller.  I apply it to freshly washed, conditioned and towel dried but still damp hair.  Then I will either let my hair air dry down, in a very loose bun (which helps to add some waves to my hair) or I might add some anti-frizz/gloss product or small amount of soft styling product afterwards and blow dry a little.  Ta-Dah!  I&#x27;m done and I feel like i have a beautiful head of  hair.  I really like this product.  I might even grow to love this product.  By the way, this has a very slight, pleasant fragrance that once applied, you really don&#x27;t smell at all.  And the price for this product is such a great deal considering how it makes my hair look and how it makes me feel about my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff--it really makes my fine hair fat!  I thought it had been discontinued so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product! It feels like air and it makes such a huge difference. It&#x27;s vavavoom volume to the max! It smells nice. I use it every day on wet hair and when I want sexy going-out hair I spray it on after I&#x27;ve dried it as well. I also love spraying it on my hot rollers while they&#x27;re on my head. This stuff is wicked addicting, so prepare to never be able to live without it! I always have a backup bottle. If I could only have ONE hair product, this would be it.</li>
            <li> Though listed as a thickening spray, I actually consider it a styling product. I have fine, thin blonde hair which I usually keep on the short side(a cross between Sharon stone&#x27;s short do and a chicken). I hate flat hair and this is the one product that really gives my hair some body. Spray it on directly(sparingly) or put some on your hands and work thru damp hair for less control. Blow dry on low, finger combing and scrunching as you go. Anchor with some good hairspray, and your hair is set. This spray does not hold my hair without some hairspray though, it&#x27;s not actually meant for that. It can build up along with the hairspray, so give your head a rest once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Much less expensive here than at salon, where I purchased my first bottle. Have been using this for several years, very happy with results, even in the Deep South humidity.</li>
            <li> I have been using the various Fat Hair products for a few years and thought I&#x27;d try this mist. It is a good addition, softening my (thinning) hair and giving it a nice sheen. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,  I have very fine hair and it works great. Makes my hair look poofy and thicker.</li>
            <li> Great product for those of us who have thin, fine hair..this stuff works.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell it doesn&#x27;t thicken at all. Not really what is says it is. Not recommended by me.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this considering I had ran out of my usual product (Beyond the Zone-hair thickener). I thought I would try something new because I run out of my usual stuff so quickly. I am going to go back to my product. This stuff smells great but does not thicken my AT ALL. It&#x27;s just like putting a light hair spray on that smell great...that is all. I do not recommend!</li>
