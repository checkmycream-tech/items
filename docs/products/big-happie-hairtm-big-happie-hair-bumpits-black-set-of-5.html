            <li>a dvd witch is very cool.</li>
            <li>Maybe your hair isnt too smooth will be okay, but shes having problems putting them on and make them stay.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good product</li>
            <li>seems like its fine from my perspective anyway</li>
            <li>, IT REALLY MAKES YOUR HAIR LOOK NICE</li>
            <li>Received on time and in the original box.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of these, but so far I love them!</li>
            <li>THE LARGE ONE IS WHAT I USE THE MOST</li>
            <li>give me the volume on top with out so much teasing</li>
            <li>Product is overall ok, but with the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>easy to use, comes with instructional CD, it also comes with a booklet to show the many different styles you can do.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like them but won&#x27;t have to return them cuz they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>it is beyond worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Bought just for fun.</li>
            <li>If ya don&#x27;t know how to use it, it will hurt when you pull on it after teasing and readjusting to the right place.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like them very much</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look very good with women with thin hair.</li>
            <li>, they also work really well for the curly headed!</li>
            <li>Great if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>they are very nice hard plastic.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair so obviously they didn&#x27;t stick to my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and for these having thick hair would work much better.</li>
            <li>THESE WORK VERY WELL</li>
            <li>so they ended up very hurtful and they weren&#x27;t covered under my hair.</li>
            <li>This don&#x27;t stick very well in your hair at all.</li>
            <li>I even got more then i expected.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>and I think there must be other better bumpits than these.</li>
            <li>Quality is fine, but the design is really not that smart.</li>
            <li>I have to say that my shipment is what i expected for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>They are fun to use for a different look now and then!</li>
            <li>but postage made up difference, but really could of used different sizes</li>
            <li>They work, I have very fine limp hair, but if I back comb a little where they are going to sit they nestle in and do exactly what they are suppose too!</li>
            <li>they stay on your head very comfortably, i have red hair and use the black ones and its totally concealed.  </li>
            <li>they do not fit my head right.</li>
            <li>so i cant really figure out how to use them so they get stuck in my hair and are kind of painful to get out because it gets tangled.</li>

            <li> good product, not the ones that look cheap and feel cheap. but its hard to use. Maybe your hair isnt too smooth will be okay, but shes having problems putting them on and make them stay.</li>
            <li> THESE WORK VERY WELL, THEY DONT PULL YOUR HAIR OUT WHEN REMOVING THEM. THE LARGE ONE IS WHAT I USE THE MOST, IT REALLY MAKES YOUR HAIR LOOK NICE, I PUT A BUMPIT IN AND THEN PUT MY HAIR INTO A BUN AND IT LOOKS SO CUTE.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE....&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Bought this product thinking it was gonna make it easier &amp; faster to do my hair but its actually kinda hard &amp; it takes up alot of time tryina make it look good &amp; get it on right. I do like this product because when its on it stays on all day &amp;it looks really nice.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again.  No problems and does what it says it will do.  Try it, you will fall in love</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and for these having thick hair would work much better. also i am not a hair genius so i cant really figure out how to use them so they get stuck in my hair and are kind of painful to get out because it gets tangled. They arent poor quality tho. they are very nice hard plastic. i would recommend if you&#x27;re good with hair.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter . She love it, we had some when the came out and we wore them out.</li>
            <li> i have to poof my hair up every night for my job.  i have thick and heavy hair so the amount of teasing was going to make me bald.  these stupid bump its have saved my head and saved 10-15 mins every time i have to poof up.  i can now do my hair in 5 when it used to take me 20.  they stay on your head very comfortably, i have red hair and use the black ones and its totally concealed.  i watched a youtube vid for tips on how to put it in but they came with an instruction manual.  i dance 5 nights a week in a show in las vegas and not once have i lost a bumpit even if i&#x27;ve hit my head!  it is beyond worth the money.  i got the rest of my cast hooked on them too! im not sure how they work with thin or stringy hair but i know the girls in the show with that type use them and haven&#x27;t complained yet.  seems like its fine from my perspective anyway, they also work really well for the curly headed!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look very good with women with thin hair. The bumps are thick and big and if you have thin hair, you can see the bumpits.</li>
            <li> I love the bumpits! They were a great addition to my wedding. Shipping was fast and product was great. Came with a how to video as well!</li>
            <li> Really hard to use. I just threw them away after several attempts. Save yourself some time and money, don&#x27;t buy this product. Quality is fine, but the design is really not that smart.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them very much and I think there must be other better bumpits than these. I have fine hair so obviously they didn&#x27;t stick to my hair and I needed to fix them with pins so they ended up very hurtful and they weren&#x27;t covered under my hair. You still need to tease your hair before you insert them and you have to use a hair spray which I never do cuz it harms my hair badly. Didn&#x27;t really like them but won&#x27;t have to return them cuz they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> Bought just for fun. My niece might use it on her Quincenera lol</li>
            <li> This don&#x27;t stick very well in your hair at all. My hair is also VERY thick .</li>
            <li> They work, I have very fine limp hair, but if I back comb a little where they are going to sit they nestle in and do exactly what they are suppose too! give me the volume on top with out so much teasing I risk damaging my hair. They are fun to use for a different look now and then!</li>
            <li> I ordered the TV Bumpits for my daughter. She thought she would like them. She states that they, &amp;#34;cause a bit of irritation to her scalp; they were itchy and uncomfortable.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I buy my wife, As Seen on TV &amp;#34;BumpitsÂ®&amp;#34; Big Hollywood Bonus 5 Piece Set (BLACK)  and sometimes uses Normal</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work.  They show through. They snarl in your hair.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Great if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I guess they were ok for the price I paid.. 1cent..but postage made up difference, but really could of used different sizes</li>
            <li> Received on time and in the original box.  My daughter and I are going to play with them this weekend.  We can not wait.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good product</li>
            <li> If ya don&#x27;t know how to use it, it will hurt when you pull on it after teasing and readjusting to the right place. It sometimes works, sometimes doesn&#x27;t. Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it but seemed easier when you watch the video. Product is overall ok, but with the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I have to say that my shipment is what i expected for a cheap price. I even got more then i expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of these, but so far I love them! I no longer have flat, dull, boring hair when I have one of these in!</li>
            <li> easy to use, comes with instructional CD, it also comes with a booklet to show the many different styles you can do.Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Hard to get just right in your hair.  Needs lots of practice.</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service!!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Came with CD and everything mentioned.</li>
            <li> I chose 4 stars because I like them but do not love the. they do not fit my head right. but it comes with a dvd witch is very cool.</li>
            <li> Everything I asked for</li>
