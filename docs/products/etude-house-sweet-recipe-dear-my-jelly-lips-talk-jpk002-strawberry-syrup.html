            <li>The texture is exactly like its name, like jelly and the color is so pretty</li>
            <li>i ordered another color and they&#x27;re both pretty.</li>
            <li>Also, I advice placing the lipstick in the fridge a.s.a.p if you live in a very hot place.</li>
            <li>I love the color because it&#x27;s vibrant but also a bit sheer.. .</li>
            <li>BUT the lip stick is REALLY moist just like it says and its SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>however amazon does what it can to give fast and speedy service.</li>
            <li>it makes your lips look very shiny and moist ~</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tan since its summertime, so this lipstick doesn&#x27;t suit me as much as i want it to, but once its winter</li>
            <li>Also shipping may take awhile because it is shipping from South Korea,  but it did arrive much sooner than Amazon&#x27;s  estimated arrival date.  </li>
            <li>Purchased thur Rescue Warrior Inc. --- Fast shipping and always have provided me with a sample/s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>This arrived pretty fast, especially since on 4th of July, most of the postal offices and stuff are closed.</li>
            <li>The color is much redder than I thought, but it is beautiful and leaves some pink on my lips after a few hours, not gone completely</li>

            <li>However I live in a really hot and humid area and when it arrived it was a little melted</li>
            <li>My daughter has a thing for Korean products in general, and she raves over this lipstick.</li>
            <li>(I easily fixed it by taking out the lipstick, melting it and then putting it back on the container).</li>

            <li> I like the item, but the lipstick is so soft, it has broke in half and lays on the side of the lipstick tube, so when I apply, some is constantly rubbing off.</li>
            <li> You will have to reapply because it doesn&#x27;t last long, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Its packaging is super cute, and i was a little disappointed because it was supposed to be strawberry scented, but to me it smelled like cherries instead.</li>

            <li> pigmented and a little sheer...</li>
            <li> Not very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Shipping came way faster than expected, this product is lighter than it seems online</li>
            <li> Not worth the long wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it varies per customer</li>
            <li> Small and is see through</li>

            <li> I just got this recently and was pleased to discover that it had a good color in real life and that it had a nice sweet scent. I wish that it was easier to buy however amazon does what it can to give fast and speedy service.</li>
            <li> Such cute packaging! The lipstick is in new condition and came with fast and great delivery ( It came 2 weeks early). The color JPK 002 is beautiful, very flattering and cute. The texture of the lipstick is more like a lip balm with sheer pink color. It looks great for daily wear and smells like cherries + it makes your lips look very shiny and moist ~</li>
            <li> Love this! Moisturizing and sheer but nice color pay off and texture. It wears out nicely as well.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this lipstick she have bought more then one.</li>
            <li> It has a lip balm kind of feel so it gives it a lot of moisture! I love the color because it&#x27;s vibrant but also a bit sheer.. .</li>
            <li> Very pretty colour and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing, so if you have dry lips i highly recommend it for you. It&#x27;s not sticky at all and it feels like a lip balm. The color payoff is really good too.</li>
            <li> Cutely packaged. Colo looms super bright when you first look at it but it&#x27;s very sheer. Looks like a gloss. Not very hydrating. It leaves a hint of color after it has come off.</li>
            <li> Great color, great sheer coverage.  The package is adorable, too.  My daughter has a thing for Korean products in general, and she raves over this lipstick.</li>
            <li> It came in 11 days, and it was really well protected! It had a long line of bubble wrap and was in a box too. In the box i found a really cute surprise! There was a sample in it!! I&#x27;m not sure whether it varies per customer but i got a Face Conditioning Cream sample! It says its for Whitening, Anti-Wrinkle, and Balancing. I&#x27;m really excited to check it out!&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, onto the product. Its packaging is super cute, and i was a little disappointed because it was supposed to be strawberry scented, but to me it smelled like cherries instead. I&#x27;m not a big fan of cherry smells so this made me sad. BUT the lip stick is REALLY moist just like it says and its SUPER soft. I really love it. I&#x27;m tan since its summertime, so this lipstick doesn&#x27;t suit me as much as i want it to, but once its winter I&#x27;ll be more pale and I&#x27;m definitely gonna wear this then.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t as I expected, but it&#x27;s nice for layering with another color. It&#x27;s nice and smooth and easy to apply, too.</li>
            <li> This product is so beautiful! The texture is exactly like its name, like jelly and the color is so pretty it looks like you&#x27;ve just eaten a popsicle plus it leaves a tint after the sheen is gone. Love it!</li>
            <li> love this formula.  pigmented and a little sheer... i carry it in my purse to apply after lunch.  very pretty.  i ordered another color and they&#x27;re both pretty.</li>
            <li> Small and is see through</li>
            <li> I am in love with Etude House&#x27;s jelly lipsticks!  They go on smooth, with a nice wash or tint of color, and they smell sweet and a little fruity, kind of like a jelly bean. You will have to reapply because it doesn&#x27;t last long, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. Also shipping may take awhile because it is shipping from South Korea,  but it did arrive much sooner than Amazon&#x27;s  estimated arrival date.  It came with some samples too, which is always nice!</li>
            <li> I love love love it!!! I can&#x27;t get enough of it. The smell reminds me of strawberry fanta. The lipstick turns kinda lipglossy and when it drys out, your lips stay red</li>
            <li> The lipstick itself it&#x27;s amazing, the color and the finish are beautiful and its really moisturizing. However I live in a really hot and humid area and when it arrived it was a little melted so it broke.  (I easily fixed it by taking out the lipstick, melting it and then putting it back on the container).</li>
            <li> This arrived pretty fast, especially since on 4th of July, most of the postal offices and stuff are closed. It came within 12 days. Which isn&#x27;t too shabby, considering that this came all the way from Korea. But this product, oh my god AMAZING!!! It is defintely a buildable color, but at the same time it is sheer. Also, I advice placing the lipstick in the fridge a.s.a.p if you live in a very hot place.</li>
            <li> Shipping came way faster than expected, this product is lighter than it seems online but it is buildable and it&#x27;s veryy moisturing, smells like jelly beans, I love it! :]</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it on but the lipstick was so melted I couldn&#x27;t even get it out of the lipstick container. I want a replacement. I paid for it but got a damaged/unusable lipstick.</li>
            <li> I like the item, but the lipstick is so soft, it has broke in half and lays on the side of the lipstick tube, so when I apply, some is constantly rubbing off. :I</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise! Being darker skinned, I thought a Korean product wouldn&#x27;t work for me. This exceeded my expectations. This &amp;#34;lip jelly&amp;#34; gives an awesome hue that I think would work on ANY skin color. Bravo Etude House!</li>
            <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips at all (and I have really dry ones). The color is much redder than I thought, but it is beautiful and leaves some pink on my lips after a few hours, not gone completely and I love that.</li>
            <li> Not worth the long wait.</li>
            <li> This feels great, looks great,and has the cutest packaging</li>
            <li> Nice product with super duper cute packaging!!!!! The lipstick is very pigmented and has a bit strawberry scent, looks really nice on young girls :D</li>
            <li> Purchased thur Rescue Warrior Inc. --- Fast shipping and always have provided me with a sample/s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great color, cute packaging and worth a try.</li>
            <li> the color is very pretty, very accurate to the images shown, but the scent is somewhat off putting.</li>
