            <li>Best to try another product</li>
            <li>Great product, works as intended, awesome price!!!</li>
            <li>Not so great though.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work well diminising lines around the eye area and seems to have an nice tingling on skin.</li>
            <li>and it becomes lumpie when I apply my foundation over the top.  </li>
            <li>Works good for the puffiness but was hoping it would do more for the dark circles-not so great there.</li>
            <li>Said to work in 14 day with a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to apply for few more weeks for better results.</li>
            <li>After you open the cream it is only good for 30 days.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t see that much change in the eye area.</li>
            <li>so I dont really know...</li>
            <li>I have very puffy eyes</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Not completely Puff free so not giving 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This product was highly recommended...</li>
            <li>Not than Im very particular with the spelling but most fake merchandises have cheap packagings and misspelled words</li>
            <li>but Im not sure if the jar I had is authentic...</li>

            <li> now i guess i need to upgrade to a more expensive eyecream, not sure yet.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my eye lids or under eye skin, it doesn&#x27;t burn or anything, but like any other eye cream I have tried, it doesn&#x27;t show any difference.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> With me in the other place to buy is not the same！</li>

            <li> Was a little harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks, morning and night, but it works.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.. using it for 2 weeks twice a day</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an eye cream that does it all!</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out terribly and it did nothing at all for my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning under my makeup as a base.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that it does not work on puffiness under my eyes.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had a tough time finding an eye cream that reduces dark circles and puffiness.  It takes a few weeks, morning and night, but it works.  I purchased a jar for my sister for Christmas.  She has not had the same results.  When I inquired, she said she was not using it at night and not every morning.  Use it twice and day and you&#x27;ll see results.  I use it in the morning under my makeup as a base.  A little goes a long ways.  Too much and it becomes lumpie when I apply my foundation over the top.  This jar will lasts about 3 months.</li>
            <li> Said to work in 14 day with a significant improvement.  I doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> After you open the cream it is only good for 30 days.</li>
            <li> Dark circles seemed to subside little. Not so great though. Will continue to apply for few more weeks for better results.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t see that much change in the eye area. Have almost  used 2/3 of the jar. is this product recommended to be used as  a supplement to another revitol product?</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well diminising lines around the eye area and seems to have an nice tingling on skin.</li>
            <li> seems to be working but Im not sure if the jar I had is authentic...Theres one word on the jar that is misspelled...Not than Im very particular with the spelling but most fake merchandises have cheap packagings and misspelled words so I dont really know...</li>
            <li> I ONLY USED IT FOR A MONTH.  COULDN&#x27;T TELL ANY DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.. using it for 2 weeks twice a day no changes in dark circles or puffiness. Best to try another product</li>
            <li> I have very puffy eyes and this seems to truly help.  Have been using for about 3 months.  Not completely Puff free so not giving 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me. Will go back to Neocutis brand</li>
            <li> I have been using for like 2 months now, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. it doesn&#x27;t dry my eye lids or under eye skin, it doesn&#x27;t burn or anything, but like any other eye cream I have tried, it doesn&#x27;t show any difference. I have tried revive loreal, gel k for eyes, clinique eyewear. now i guess i need to upgrade to a more expensive eyecream, not sure yet.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended...I am very disappointed that it does not work on puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product, works as intended, awesome price!!!</li>
            <li> Works good for the puffiness but was hoping it would do more for the dark circles-not so great there. It&#x27;s hard to find an eye cream that does it all! Haven&#x27;t found it yet.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this cream at all! It dried my skin out terribly and it did nothing at all for my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Was a little harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> no difference been using for over 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> With me in the other place to buy is not the same！</li>
            <li> I have used other expensive eye creams, but this is the winner. I have no eye irritation that i had using other creams.dark circles also seemed to subside a little.I will recommend this.</li>
            <li> It does not work as described. Will never buy it again.</li>
