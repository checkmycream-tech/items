            <li>It&#x27;s not to overwhelming, I use this with the body mist and the body butter.</li>
            <li>It covered for sure all the expectatives.</li>
            <li>when i tell them, their like...i gotta get that, omg!!:)</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>On the same note, since the smell is so strong I believe it&#x27;s best to not wear perfume with it as it already does that job too.</li>
            <li>My wife liked it very much!</li>
            <li>It came early, and is in great condition.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for my wife and she REALLY likes it and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it smells too strong either.</li>
            <li>The one thing I could see being bothersome to some people is how strong the smell is and could make headaches to some.</li>
            <li>If your looking for something that smells sexy and flirty &amp; sweet</li>
            <li>Product was shipped securely.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth</li>
            <li>10-12 years ago, this was a really unique fragrance...</li>
            <li>Clean fresh scent!</li>
            <li>It makes me feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li>It was nice, but just not the same</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my young neices and liked the scent so much that I bought some for myself.</li>
            <li>and she was right</li>
            <li>Such a nice scent, that really is a &amp;#34;Love Spell&amp;#34; on the men around you.</li>
            <li>Feels a little greasy when first applied, but then is absorbed, leaving a nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what they stated it is.</li>
            <li>It is first quality</li>
            <li>The smell was different from what I experienced from another Victoria&#x27;s Secret Love Spell product.</li>
            <li>small so good like it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to make 20 words here because I really don&#x27;t want to do a long review. :)</li>
            <li>Not for me, is a gift for someone, but I can say that at least the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel very oily after applying.</li>
            <li>My mom absolutely loves this lotion</li>
            <li>I first smelled an imitation scent of this very lotion/perfume brand and did lots of research to find out who made the original</li>
            <li>I enjoy many Victoria Secret body lotions.</li>
            <li>Only thing, this scent is becoming more common.</li>
            <li>A nice delicate smell.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and in brand new condition.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll try something new</li>
            <li>When I bought this new, it was shipped to me on time</li>
            <li>New</li>
            <li>Therefore, the lotion leaves my skin feeling hydrated and very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion since early in high school</li>
            <li>ordered the lotion with the body spray, lotion was received first, spray took several days</li>
            <li>As soon as I get out of the shower I put it on and it absorbs into your skin well and instantly makes it super soft all day long.</li>
            <li>I love any Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fragrance.</li>
            <li>Victorias Secret Love Spell Hydrating Body Lotion es una</li>
            <li>Not only is the bottle sticky on the outside and only mostly full, but as you can see in the pictures I&#x27;ve posted, there was dried lotion all over the cap</li>
            <li>We live in a very dry climate so my wife uses quite a bit on her back and arms etc.</li>

            <li> My wife liked it very much! The fragance was she was looking for. It covered for sure all the expectatives.</li>

            <li> smells great!  Leaves skin smooth</li>
            <li> what can i say? this is the best smelling scent right now! this stays in my purse for traveling and everyday when im out. everywhere i go someone asks me what im wearing and when i tell them, their like...i gotta get that, omg!!:)</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what they stated it is. It is first quality and I like to buy this for my wife. I&#x27;m trying to make 20 words here because I really don&#x27;t want to do a long review. :)</li>
            <li> My mom absolutely loves this lotion so I got it for her for Christmas and she was right it smells wonderful and was at a good price.</li>
            <li> Not for me, is a gift for someone, but I can say that at least the smell is pleasant. ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion since early in high school and I&#x27;m now in my senior year of college. Sometimes I&#x27;ll try something new but it just never compares to this lotion and I go back. I get a lot of complements on the smell. I used to have really dry skin and even had eczema at one point before I ever used this. I haven&#x27;t had dry skin problems since I started using this lotion. As soon as I get out of the shower I put it on and it absorbs into your skin well and instantly makes it super soft all day long. The one thing I could see being bothersome to some people is how strong the smell is and could make headaches to some. On the same note, since the smell is so strong I believe it&#x27;s best to not wear perfume with it as it already does that job too.</li>
            <li> When I bought this new, it was shipped to me on time but when it arrived, it had been USED. Not only is the bottle sticky on the outside and only mostly full, but as you can see in the pictures I&#x27;ve posted, there was dried lotion all over the cap and somebody&#x27;s nasty thumb prints all over. There&#x27;s a sticker on it that says New but that&#x27;s a lie. Disgusting.</li>
            <li> I love this product and smell really good</li>
            <li> entrega rapida, originales, condiciones perfectas, buen olor, el vendedor es bastante responsable y no dio dolor de cabeza. recomiendo comprar a el</li>
            <li> I have the love spell body spray which is amazing, so I bought this lotion. The smell is a little strange on my skin, doesn&#x27;t smell quite like the body spray or perfume and it has a bit of a sticky feel to it.</li>
