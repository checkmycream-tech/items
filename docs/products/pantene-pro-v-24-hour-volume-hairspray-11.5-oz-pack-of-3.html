            <li>I use it every day just to keep my fine hair from blowing all over.</li>
            <li>Great value for this hard to find hairspray and it came with 3 cans of the spray and the price was good.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s accurate.</li>
            <li>I tried to spray my hair lightly, and it saturated my hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is cheap and overpowering, too.  </li>
            <li>I got free shipping on my order.</li>

            <li>Please bring back the unscented Classic Hairspray and make a lot of people happy again.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray and only wish that it was more available, It dries fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also sensitive to smells and this one is ok.</li>
            <li>Our female soldiers have trouble getting hold of many of the hair products that they need, I liked this because I trust Pantene and the price was good particularly with the subscribe and save program.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay to me, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or good, which kind of surprised me for Pantene, as they used to be known (back in the day) for great smells.</li>
            <li>It spells pretty good compared to other Hairsprays.</li>
            <li>works just as great as some of the more expensive brands</li>
            <li>just as described Thanks!</li>
            <li>great hairspray for windy day&#x27;s and night or just every day use, long or short hair even tinted hair, no un-kind smell in fact</li>
            <li>This hairspray is pretty good for a maximum hold aerosol sort in that it does hold fairly well without flaking or making the hair overly \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot; Since I&#x27;m growing the front of my hair out, it&#x27;s at a very awkward stage right now</li>
            <li>The first day I purchased this item, I sprayed so much because every time I&#x27;ve purchased a &amp;#34;Maximum Hold&amp;#34; they never work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true Amazon junkie, almost always happier to order rather than drive somewhere to get something, and frequently it is cheaper here as well, sometimes a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>And keeps your Hair in place for the whole Day.</li>
            <li>I holds very well on a windy day.  </li>
            <li>and it really does the trick</li>
            <li>can lets you know how much hold you&#x27;ll get</li>
            <li>I have so many problems with my hair; it is so thin and fine; does not want to hold my set .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m needing something that holds it in place a little better than this.</li>
            <li>It provides a great hold for thin hair!</li>
            <li>This hairspray keeps a good hold all day long without being stiff.</li>
            <li>which seems to work better for my \\&quot;in between\\&quot; hair style, but may be overly stiff for some folks.</li>
            <li>I live in Washington State</li>
            <li>I tried 3 or 4 different Pantene products before finally finding this one that works just like the original.  </li>
            <li>Soft hold, not like a helmet!</li>
            <li>Could work for thicker hair, but too stiff for my fine</li>
            <li>It goes on heavy and sticky, even when you try to lightly spray.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Not only does it hold my hair in place, but it is still soft to the touch!!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and have a hard time getting a spray to hold all day.</li>
            <li>My hair was super stiff and flaky (mind you that I added like 1/4th of the bottle, not knowing it&#x27;s power</li>
            <li>I hope the don&#x27;t change the formula much like they often due.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, definitely hard hold (a bit too stiff for my liking)</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 94-year-old mother who has thin, fine hair to help hold her hairstyle longer.</li>

            <li> It never really dried, and stayed extremely gunky and sticky all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time and could no longer find it locally so ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I completely agree with the previous reviewer:  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is too strong and I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be a little bit different than I was used to, could be a slight change to the formula?  </li>
            <li> Does not flake and isn&#x27;t sticky like some of the other formulas are.  </li>
            <li> I know how to use it, it literally only takes me like 5 small sprays and BAM..</li>
            <li> It seemed a bit sticky but that could have been caused by a slight increase in humidity.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky and doesn&#x27;t flake off.  </li>
            <li> Little did I know, this product means business!</li>
            <li> which was difficult, before I could go back to sleep.</li>
            <li> an aside, these were so poorly packaged that all 3 lids were broken.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it ends up gluey for some people (no offense) unless they spray it and immediately brush it or something.</li>
            <li> I heard these were expensive and my girlfriend loves them.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the expensive salon hairsprays and paid up to 5 times for them as I paid for this one-never again.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty the day after I wash it</li>
            <li> I hated when they changed the formulations in this product and changed the packaging.  </li>

            <li> This is another item I bought for a female soldier in the Afganistan war. Our female soldiers have trouble getting hold of many of the hair products that they need, I liked this because I trust Pantene and the price was good particularly with the subscribe and save program.</li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating when I say this: When you use this hairspray it is like spraying invisible glue on your hair. It goes on heavy and sticky, even when you try to lightly spray. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Wow. My hair is controlled in Houston humidity. (We breathe water here.)  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I completely agree with the previous reviewer:  This stuff is like glue!  I tried to spray my hair lightly, and it saturated my hair.  It never really dried, and stayed extremely gunky and sticky all day.  I tried to comb out my hair at the end of the day and ended up having to get in the shower and wash this stuff out.  The smell is cheap and overpowering, too.  What gives, Pantene??  Please bring back the unscented Classic Hairspray and make a lot of people happy again. Change is not always good!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray. Holds well and smells great!!!</li>
            <li> I hated when they changed the formulations in this product and changed the packaging.  I tried 3 or 4 different Pantene products before finally finding this one that works just like the original.  Does not flake and isn&#x27;t sticky like some of the other formulas are.  This matters when you use the product every day!</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray and only wish that it was more available, It dries fast and you can work with it. Not only does it hold my hair in place, but it is still soft to the touch!!</li>
            <li> nice and light hair spray.</li>
            <li> Only use this hairspray if you want &amp;#34;helmet hair&amp;#34; because you cannot get a comb through after using. I bought this for my 94-year-old mother who has thin, fine hair to help hold her hairstyle longer. Unfortunately, it is too strong and I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, definitely hard hold (a bit too stiff for my liking)</li>
            <li> I love the hold that you get with this spray but I found that it was making my head stick to my pillow at night. It woke me up to turn over. I has to go brush it out - which was difficult, before I could go back to sleep.</li>
            <li> The first day I purchased this item, I sprayed so much because every time I&#x27;ve purchased a &amp;#34;Maximum Hold&amp;#34; they never work. Little did I know, this product means business! My hair was super stiff and flaky (mind you that I added like 1/4th of the bottle, not knowing it&#x27;s power lol.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know how to use it, it literally only takes me like 5 small sprays and BAM.. ALL DAY HOLD and no humidity, stiffness, or flakes!</li>
            <li> Me and my husband love this hairspray. It provides a great hold for thin hair!</li>
            <li> I had never used this kind of hairspray before and decided to try it because of the reduced  price and I am so happy I did! Besides the great saving price (got 3 per package) I got free shipping on my order. (Over $35 order) And thats not a problem with me, I love shopping with Amazon! This hairspray holds your hair very well, it is not too heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Three hair sprays for a great price. Holds hair well.  I am a hairspray junkie and pantene works just as great as some of the more expensive brands</li>
            <li> I heard these were expensive and my girlfriend loves them. I bought them for her and says it&#x27;s the one she always buys. Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> just as described Thanks!</li>
            <li> A great control hair spray.  I have fine hair and have a hard time getting a spray to hold all day.</li>
            <li> Soft hold, not like a helmet!</li>
            <li> Could work for thicker hair, but too stiff for my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, these were so poorly packaged that all 3 lids were broken.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It holds your hair well, but without the look of having hairspray. I hope the don&#x27;t change the formula much like they often due.</li>
            <li> This hairspray keeps a good hold all day long without being stiff.</li>
            <li> This is the one Hairspray that Dries quickly. And keeps your Hair in place for the whole Day. And best of all. It spells pretty good compared to other Hairsprays.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is pretty good for a maximum hold aerosol sort in that it does hold fairly well without flaking or making the hair overly \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot; Since I&#x27;m growing the front of my hair out, it&#x27;s at a very awkward stage right now and I&#x27;m needing something that holds it in place a little better than this. However, if you have a hairstyle that is already established, that is, not in the middle stages of \\&quot;growing out\\&quot; like mine is, this should be plenty of holding power for you. The scent is okay to me, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or good, which kind of surprised me for Pantene, as they used to be known (back in the day) for great smells. When I run out of this can, I&#x27;m going back to my regular stuff, [[ASIN:B001E5E26I Aussie Instant Freeze Aerosol Hairspray 7 Oz (Pack of 12)]] which seems to work better for my \\&quot;in between\\&quot; hair style, but may be overly stiff for some folks.</li>
            <li> Great value for this hard to find hairspray and it came with 3 cans of the spray and the price was good.</li>
            <li> great hairspray for windy day&#x27;s and night or just every day use, long or short hair even tinted hair, no un-kind smell in fact there&#x27;s no smell, great priece fore a 3 pk, I&#x27;ed recomend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true Amazon junkie, almost always happier to order rather than drive somewhere to get something, and frequently it is cheaper here as well, sometimes a lot cheaper. I love this hairspray. I don&#x27;t know how it ends up gluey for some people (no offense) unless they spray it and immediately brush it or something. I use it every day just to keep my fine hair from blowing all over. It lasts all day. Been using it for years. I&#x27;m also sensitive to smells and this one is ok. Could never use the Aussie products, scent is way too strong.</li>
            <li> I have so many problems with my hair; it is so thin and fine; does not want to hold my set . I have found this Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Style Lasting Volume Maximum Hold Aerosol to be the best for my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time and could no longer find it locally so ordered from Amazon.  It seemed to be a little bit different than I was used to, could be a slight change to the formula?  It seemed a bit sticky but that could have been caused by a slight increase in humidity.  I holds very well on a windy day.  Still reliable and I would buy it again.  Delivery was as promised.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the expensive salon hairsprays and paid up to 5 times for them as I paid for this one-never again.  I love the Pantene products and this one is by far my favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky and doesn&#x27;t flake off.  It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty the day after I wash it so I can go two or sometimes even three days between shampoos.  I live in Washington State so I use the one for humidity and it really does the trick but there are several formulas and the coding with numbers on the front of the can lets you know how much hold you&#x27;ll get and it&#x27;s accurate.</li>
