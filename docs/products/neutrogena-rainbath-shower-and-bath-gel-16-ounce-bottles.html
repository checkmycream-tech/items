            <li>I really enjoyed the Pomegranate - which is a bright and fruity fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It gives your skin an amazing feel.</li>
            <li>anyhow, it is amazing..</li>

            <li>Nice variety pack.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice variety in our guest bathroom shower.  </li>
            <li>It is also fairly gender neutral and fruity and very unique.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re an OK body soap, but kind of on the watery side.</li>
            <li>Really Good thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED the Neutrogena Rainbath Original</li>
            <li>So happy I found a great place to get a bigger variety.</li>
            <li>Scent is great, product is consistent.....</li>
            <li>Better than liquid soap.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Oh Neutrogena how I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the Neutrogena Rainbath.</li>
            <li>My favorite is pomegranate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t you just love Neutrogena?</li>
            <li>Better price than I can find anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I love all three scents.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for over 10 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>The pomegranate was not around when I was younger but this scent is also great!</li>
            <li>The apple really does smell like apples and all 3 make my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>so you really can&#x27;t break them apart and give as gifts seperately but for the price, you will make someone happy sending all 3.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love these bath jells.</li>
            <li>love neutrogena body washes.</li>
            <li>Love fragrances and the neutrogena brand name</li>
            <li>I wish they would reach out to me to try more of their products I love them.</li>
            <li>Love the Neutrogena Rainbath line.</li>
            <li>A plus is the pump dispenser - planning on saving those and using them for hand soap. :)</li>
            <li>Our guests love the product.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE ONE OF THE BOTTLES LEAKED A PRETTY GOOD AMOUNT.</li>
            <li>Good variety, nice soap, and best value for the money (getting these 3 small ones is cheaper than getting one large one).</li>
            <li>I love this product, such a great way to cleanse/nourish your skin, leaves your skin smoothe as a baby&#x27;s &amp;*%$ :-)</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived as expected and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin smooth and shine, looks healthy.</li>
            <li>But....the original smells so good on him ;)</li>
            <li>Love the 3 fresh scents!  </li>
            <li>We both love the Rainbath original and the Pomegranate scents.  </li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m turning other people on to this trio of wonderful scents.</li>
            <li>I buy it over and over again because it is trusted and true!  </li>
            <li>Until I saw this pack, I didn&#x27;t know they made more than the amber colored and blue colored Rainbaths, so this was a welcome surprise.</li>
            <li>The recipient of this gift set likes the product already and loved getting this particular assortment of scents.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked.. and doesn&#x27;t have the overly strong , nauseating , cloying perfumey smell of bath and body..</li>
            <li>Super refreshing.</li>
            <li>Super Price!  </li>
            <li>but this was available.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin moistorized and feeling smooth for hours.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the reviews said, I bought several more.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!!  </li>
            <li>lathers nice, smells divine and really makes me feel clean and tingly afterwards..</li>
            <li>the new scents are nice to have as well.</li>
            <li>All three clean well and don&#x27;t leave me with an oily after feel.  </li>
            <li>I love the light scent of the Pear - it is definitely a classic scent that is gender neutral (as is the original scent.)  </li>
            <li>Worth the money and free shipping.!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool</li>
            <li>Such a good deal for these body washes.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena Rainbath will have your body smelling fresh and feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>These are good, but not as big as the ones you can get at Costco.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter who is pregnant and she loves it.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena Rainbath and especiall love the smaller bottle&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Have used the Neutrogena products, particularly the rainbath and I love then.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is adequate, but not what you&#x27;d think it would be.</li>
            <li>It smells great, lathers well enough and is gentle on your skin like all Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>Have been using Rainbath in my shower for years and now love the new scents.</li>
            <li>Now as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>its worth every penny</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>I would like to be able to purchase the 3 pack in larger sizes.</li>
            <li>rainbath leaves my skin so silky and soft and lightly scented</li>
            <li>Three bottles instead of one giant bottle is more convenient than the package sold at Costco.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>and I would most definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li>More manageable sized bottles with 3 different fragrances -</li>
            <li>Received this as a xmas gift.. not this exact set..</li>
            <li>First time smelling the pomegranate</li>
            <li>My husband started using them and now we go threw them fast!</li>
            <li>My skin feels squeaky clean and it ever irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also like the smaller bottle as it goes into shower caddy easily.</li>
            <li>I remember the gold original from my stays in 5 star hotels and this appears to be exactly like what I was used to back then.</li>
            <li>Received fast.</li>
            <li>liked the variety of the 3 scents but it was overpriced...went to Walmart and found the same scents and size sold individually for $9.99 each</li>
            <li>I have also tried the blue (hard to find) moisturizing formula which is great for winter dryness, although I don&#x27;t like the scent as much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, I will purchase again</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how large the bottles were in this set.</li>
            <li>were new fragrances for me.  </li>
            <li>I was able to pick this set up at my local big box store last week.  </li>
            <li>my favorite scent is the pear and green tea, u cant beat this price for all three!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I like the body wash scents and I have Sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Freshen up my body and feel soft.</li>
            <li>mine was 2 bottles (original and the green tea) and a shower scrubby puff...</li>
            <li>I am using the original now and then will switch to the green tea when that is gone</li>
            <li>I just hope they never mess with the formula it is working</li>
            <li>I have long used the original scent but the Pomegranate and the Pear and Green Tea</li>
            <li>Okay, that might be overdoing it a little, but just a little.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These are good, but not as big as the ones you can get at Costco.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter who is pregnant and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena Rainbath and especiall love the smaller bottle&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Have used the Neutrogena products, particularly the rainbath and I love then.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is adequate, but not what you&#x27;d think it would be.</li>
            <li> It smells great, lathers well enough and is gentle on your skin like all Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> Have been using Rainbath in my shower for years and now love the new scents.</li>
            <li> Now as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> its worth every penny</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I would like to be able to purchase the 3 pack in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> rainbath leaves my skin so silky and soft and lightly scented</li>
            <li> Three bottles instead of one giant bottle is more convenient than the package sold at Costco.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I would most definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> More manageable sized bottles with 3 different fragrances -</li>
            <li> Received this as a xmas gift.. not this exact set..</li>
            <li> First time smelling the pomegranate</li>
            <li> My husband started using them and now we go threw them fast!</li>
            <li> My skin feels squeaky clean and it ever irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also like the smaller bottle as it goes into shower caddy easily.</li>
            <li> I remember the gold original from my stays in 5 star hotels and this appears to be exactly like what I was used to back then.</li>
            <li> Received fast.</li>
            <li> liked the variety of the 3 scents but it was overpriced...went to Walmart and found the same scents and size sold individually for $9.99 each</li>
            <li> I have also tried the blue (hard to find) moisturizing formula which is great for winter dryness, although I don&#x27;t like the scent as much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, I will purchase again</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how large the bottles were in this set.</li>
            <li> were new fragrances for me.  </li>
            <li> I was able to pick this set up at my local big box store last week.  </li>
            <li> my favorite scent is the pear and green tea, u cant beat this price for all three!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I like the body wash scents and I have Sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Freshen up my body and feel soft.</li>
            <li> mine was 2 bottles (original and the green tea) and a shower scrubby puff...</li>
            <li> I am using the original now and then will switch to the green tea when that is gone</li>
            <li> I just hope they never mess with the formula it is working</li>
            <li> I have long used the original scent but the Pomegranate and the Pear and Green Tea</li>
            <li> Okay, that might be overdoing it a little, but just a little.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the same as Costco size but was surprised to see these were larger bottles than expected.  </li>
            <li> Has helped with dry skin without leaving oily residue.</li>
            <li> Hard to find where I live.  </li>
            <li> I become bored of those huge size sold in Costco by the time I used half way.</li>
            <li> Not much foam.</li>
            <li> like the pear, haven&#x27;t used the pink one yet.</li>
            <li> packaging was damaged and the bottles leaked a little...but other than that...good buy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave build up like some other brands of body washes.</li>
            <li> the price per ounce is way less.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves the Green Tea and Pear scent!</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone loves these.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding Rainbath in my area for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have a hard time choosing.</li>
            <li> i will keep all 3 for myself sorry</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Neutrogena Rainbath.  </li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED the Neutrogena Rainbath Original so when I saw this 3-pack I had to buy it! All scents are very fresh and just perfect in strength (not at all overbearing). My skin feels squeaky clean and it ever irritates my sensitive skin. A 16oz bottle lasts me about six weeks.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter who is pregnant and she loves it. Package was in good shape upon arrival and came on time.</li>
            <li> Love the 3 fresh scents!  I would like to be able to purchase the 3 pack in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Better than liquid soap.</li>
            <li> The recipient of this gift set likes the product already and loved getting this particular assortment of scents.  She loved the gift.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I especially likePomegranate and Pear but in all fairness I haven&#x27;t tried the OG yet.</li>
            <li> I was able to pick this set up at my local big box store last week.  I have long used the original scent but the Pomegranate and the Pear and Green Tea were new fragrances for me.  I love the light scent of the Pear - it is definitely a classic scent that is gender neutral (as is the original scent.)  I really enjoyed the Pomegranate - which is a bright and fruity fragrance.  All three clean well and don&#x27;t leave me with an oily after feel.  I was surprised at how large the bottles were in this set.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!!  Hard to find where I live.  Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> Now as good as I expected. Not much foam. Yet to try all flavours.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena Rainbath and especiall love the smaller bottle&#x27;s. This is asctually my favorite to use as a bubble bath!</li>
            <li> Lots of comments from our guests on these.... very nice ... of course,, they are Neutrogena!  You wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> The wife and her grandkids are still using it.  I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this product, such a great way to cleanse/nourish your skin, leaves your skin smoothe as a baby&#x27;s &amp;*%$ :-)</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and silky. Has helped with dry skin without leaving oily residue. Highly recommended, I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Oh Neutrogena how I love it.  I can&#x27;t get enough of this product at all.  Any of their products are great.  I would recommend to anyone, anytime.  All scents smell great too.</li>
            <li> Have used the Neutrogena products, particularly the rainbath and I love then.  The shipment arrived as expected and in excellent condition.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the same as Costco size but was surprised to see these were larger bottles than expected.  Worth the money and free shipping.!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool</li>
            <li> my favorite scent is the pear and green tea, u cant beat this price for all three! rainbath leaves my skin so silky and soft and lightly scented its worth every penny i will keep all 3 for myself sorry no sharing this product go get your own!</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin. Neutrogena Rainbath is the only shower gel that&#x27;s never caused a skin reaction. I love this stuff! So happy I found a great place to get a bigger variety.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get them again. They&#x27;re an OK body soap, but kind of on the watery side. The fragrance is adequate, but not what you&#x27;d think it would be.</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift to a guy I work with who likes this kind of stuff and he says he loves it. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the Neutrogena Rainbath. It gives your skin an amazing feel.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the reviews said, I bought several more. Excellent, I will purchase again. wonderful service.  I am so please with this purchased.</li>
            <li> Have been using Rainbath in my shower for years and now love the new scents. My favorite is pomegranate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lila</li>
            <li> Great variety of Neutrogena.  Three bottles instead of one giant bottle is more convenient than the package sold at Costco.</li>
            <li> Nice variety pack.  We buy the 40-oz bottles for refilling the 16-oz bottles.  My wife loves the Green Tea and Pear scent! We both love the Rainbath original and the Pomegranate scents.  Great Value over purchase at the Pharmacy</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Neutrogena Rainbath.  Feels good, smells good.</li>
            <li> Loved the value of the triple purchase.  You can always trust Neutrogena</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you just love Neutrogena? These soaps are wonderful, great scents and great quality!</li>
            <li> Such a good deal for these body washes.  This stuff is incredible, my Mom used to use it for us when we were kids and I&#x27;ve always loved the smell.  Better price than I can find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know Neutrogena Rainbath has different scents!  Same feel but now I can have a different smell. &#x27;-0</li>
            <li> I love all three scents.  I would never have tried this if I hadn&#x27;t gotten it as a gift.  Now, I&#x27;m turning other people on to this trio of wonderful scents.</li>
            <li> I like the body wash scents and I have Sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it or make me itch .</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 10 years and love it.  the new scents are nice to have as well.</li>
            <li> Greatest product ever! Love the variety of this package!</li>
            <li> This package comes with all 3 scents and they are excellent! I remember the gold original from my stays in 5 star hotels and this appears to be exactly like what I was used to back then. I am a guy but the scent is fairly gender neutral in my opinion but it does stay with you all day. I have used it as a wash and a shampoo and it works great in both. The pomegranate was not around when I was younger but this scent is also great! It is also fairly gender neutral and fruity and very unique. The apple really does smell like apples and all 3 make my skin feel great. I have also tried the blue (hard to find) moisturizing formula which is great for winter dryness, although I don&#x27;t like the scent as much. This boxed set has all 3 boxes glued together so you really can&#x27;t break them apart and give as gifts seperately but for the price, you will make someone happy sending all 3.</li>
            <li> Amazon ALWAYS has the best price on Neutrogena bath gel!! ONLY GAVE IT 4-1/2  STARS BECAUSE ONE OF THE BOTTLES LEAKED A PRETTY GOOD AMOUNT. It came to me to me quickly, very pleased!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent value.  I have a hard time finding Rainbath in my area for some reason.  These bottles are twice the size of the ones that I can buy locally and the price per ounce is way less.  I never saw the pomegranate scent before..... Love it.  I hope amazon always stocks this.</li>
            <li> Love these bath jells. Freshen up my body and feel soft.</li>
            <li> usual;y get the larger size but this was available. like the pear, haven&#x27;t used the pink one yet. love neutrogena body washes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful I love it.  I bought for a gift but kept one for myself!</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller!!</li>
            <li> Nice,I like this shower gel;)favourite one)</li>
            <li> Loved i Have reordered it.</li>
            <li> Like all the scents and love the good lather! Just wish the scents were a bit stronger and would linger on my skin.</li>
            <li> Super refreshing. Great product.</li>
            <li> Nice sized bottles and good variety.</li>
            <li> Love fragrances and the neutrogena brand name</li>
            <li> Gift excellent love it!</li>
            <li> Great price and 16 oz  is perfect size. Scents esp Pear scent is great.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as advertised. A great value for the price. It was also delivered on time!</li>
            <li> Excellent Deal!!!, the smells of these products are great! I will definetly buy it again! Do no doubt on buy this you will never regret</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of the Neutrogena bath, make-up and facial products and shampoos for years. This is some of the best smelling stuff in the world! Okay, that might be overdoing it a little, but just a little. It smells great, lathers well enough and is gentle on your skin like all Neutrogena products. Until I saw this pack, I didn&#x27;t know they made more than the amber colored and blue colored Rainbaths, so this was a welcome surprise. It arrived in plenty of time and I would most definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> More manageable sized bottles with 3 different fragrances - I become bored of those huge size sold in Costco by the time I used half way. These do not bore me at all. Also like the smaller bottle as it goes into shower caddy easily.</li>
            <li> packaging was damaged and the bottles leaked a little...but other than that...good buy.</li>
            <li> Every Neutrogena Bath Gel scent is a delight to the senses.  This set let me try some of the newer scents that I hadn&#x27;t before.  I love them all! I have all of them lined up in my bathroom window so that one can choose which scent they want to experience.  Sometimes I have a hard time choosing.</li>
            <li> perfect variety for this price.  not the largest of size, so you you can try it out an decide which one to go with for a larger size later.  quality product.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Rainbath will have your body smelling fresh and feeling smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t leave build up like some other brands of body washes. The price was incredible for a 3 pack</li>
            <li> Leaking when received</li>
            <li> Received this as a xmas gift.. not this exact set.. mine was 2 bottles (original and the green tea) and a shower scrubby puff...I think mine came from Sears or target.. anyhow, it is amazing.. lathers nice, smells divine and really makes me feel clean and tingly afterwards.. I am using the original now and then will switch to the green tea when that is gone.. I&#x27;m hooked.. and doesn&#x27;t have the overly strong , nauseating , cloying perfumey smell of bath and body..</li>
            <li> These are good, but not as big as the ones you can get at Costco.  So I would wait for the sale there and get 3-4 at a time.  These are smaller and need to be dumped into the bigger bottle several times over the weeks.  I will stick with the larger Costco bottles.</li>
            <li> I am a neutrogena girl!!! I wish they would reach out to me to try more of their products I love them. I just hope they never mess with the formula it is working leave it be, please! These bath cleansers smell so good, and as always cleans me and my family great! I keep my home stocked with their bath cleansers.</li>
            <li> Good variety, nice soap, and best value for the money (getting these 3 small ones is cheaper than getting one large one).</li>
            <li> Really Good thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone loves these.  The dispenser is nice.</li>
            <li> Good product at good price.</li>
            <li> Received fast. Smells great. First time smelling the pomegranate and it&#x27;s refreshing like the others! My husband started using them and now we go threw them fast! But....the original smells so good on him ;)</li>
            <li> Love the Neutrogena Rainbath line. This is a great purchase that is in line with the best price at SAMs and the combo pack is nice. A plus is the pump dispenser - planning on saving those and using them for hand soap. :)</li>
            <li> Super Price!  I buy it over and over again because it is trusted and true!  Scent is great, product is consistent..... no doubts, buy</li>
            <li> Great smelling body wash. Keeps my skin moistorized and feeling smooth for hours. I will not use anything else ever.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was leaking when it arrived. I wanted to try all three varieties of this soap and this pack is a great way to do this.</li>
            <li> liked the variety of the 3 scents but it was overpriced...went to Walmart and found the same scents and size sold individually for $9.99 each..,.right after I bought it..so I would have paid about about $33...</li>
            <li> Love all three smells, great value for the trio. Makes skin smooth and shine, looks healthy. Use every day in the shower!</li>
            <li> Nice variety in our guest bathroom shower.  Our guests love the product.</li>
            <li> Great scents, and the pump style bottles are perfect for the shower!</li>
