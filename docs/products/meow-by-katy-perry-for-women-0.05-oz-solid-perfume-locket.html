            <li>For the price, I think it would make a very good gift, especially for someone who loves kitties!</li>

            <li>smells great, and is super cute for a young lady.</li>
            <li>This necklace/perfume locket is very cute and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>The perfume is soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Cheap, flimsy.</li>
            <li>AND THEY ARE BOTH DELIGHTFULLY LIGHT AND BREEZY,  YET MULTIFACETED SCENTS.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>loved it in every way but the chain broke, and she only wore it for 3 days</li>
            <li>What a sweet gift this was for my granddaughter..</li>
            <li>and I love it so much</li>
            <li>The perfume inside is true to scent and all in all, its a nice little gift for anyone even if you&#x27;re not a fan of her, try the perfume :)</li>
            <li>-I LOVE YOUR TASTE IN YOUNG YET SENSUAL SCENTS!</li>
            <li>I found the fragrance also pleasant, but more for a young person teen young adult.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the wife wants!  </li>
            <li>and I love that its long it doesn&#x27;t have a clasp</li>
            <li>The necklace is kind of long and heavy but pretty cute.</li>
            <li>Larger than I expected, which is nice!  </li>
            <li>It smells lovely, and the long necklace was okay, although not very substantial.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just partial to more of the earthy scents, so I&#x27;m not going to attempt to comment too much.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed .</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really a neutral and would go with any color clothing.</li>
            <li>its weight is substantial enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>I will definately be bying off of Amazon in the future and just hope and pray my two year old doesn&#x27;t anymore!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not expecting heirloom quality, but it would be nice if the case lasted long enough to use up the perfume.</li>
            <li>It must sound strange, but this is what you are buying!</li>
            <li>He box did not looked like brand new.</li>
            <li>It had a hazardous waste warning next to the place where it should have had a box asking for the reason.</li>
            <li>Did not return it because it was busy time before Christmas and was not worted my time to print return label and wasting time in the post office.</li>
            <li>the chain is cheap to say the least...don&#x27;t waste your money  </li>
            <li>Its been since October that ive had this product and I must say im surprised it hasn&#x27;t tarnished.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 12 year old niece.</li>
            <li>Looks classy but not the chain.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter, who loved it, but the swivel post broke after two days rendering it useless.  </li>
            <li>From what I can tell so far, however, gorgeous concept &amp; design, flawed execution.</li>
            <li>not strong enough to hold cover on without top pin</li>
            <li>Bought this as a present for my 14 year old niece.  </li>
            <li>My friends and teachers give me compliments on it and its also a long necklace and modern since I see some people going for the long chain pendant type of jewelry.</li>

            <li> The gift box it came in was a little squished but the necklace was securely wrapped in lots of pink tissue and a black velveteen bag</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long enough to put over your head</li>
            <li> I am not surprised it was a hit with her.</li>
            <li> The chain is quite long so you can just slip it over your head.  </li>
            <li> smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Long chain.</li>
            <li> Necklace/locket  was broken and beat up plus purfume falls right out.</li>
            <li> Well, even though I bought 2 other perfume type necklaces, this appears to be the only 1 that&#x27;s going to be a handful to get replaced/</li>
            <li> The perfume was dry and look like someone used it.</li>
            <li> Love them both, very heavy pendant but at least it wont flip over to the plain side while wearing it.</li>
            <li> The only flaw it has is that the chain is not strong enough for the locket.</li>
            <li> You can smell the fragrance even when the locket is closed.</li>
            <li> well spent</li>
            <li> I HAVE THE LOCKET IN THIS PINK COLOR, THE FRAGRANCE MEOW,</li>
            <li> I can really only smell medal :/</li>
            <li> if u do buy it be very careful</li>
            <li> What little girl doesn&#x27;t like to be in the spotlight a little?</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my little sister.  </li>
            <li> I slid the 2 sides apart and the &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;, which I&#x27;ll call perfume gloss, promptly slipped out of the little crevice</li>
            <li> Took a few days longer to arrive than I had hoped, but still made it in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Always hard to find what to get pre-teens and teens as they reach that in between age.</li>
            <li> I ordered it late</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, hated watching it fall apart almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, then necklace chain snapped on Christmas day, after being worn for less than an hour. :(</li>
            <li> Sadly, the locket I bought broke within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Depressing.</li>

            <li> This is so neat looking, and it has a nice long chain, and it&#x27;s really cute, and smells great with her perfume of &amp;#34;Meow&amp;#34; in it.  It&#x27;s very pretty, sparkly, and feminine!!!!  Every Girl would love this, and also the &amp;#34;Purr&amp;#34; Locket!!!  Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who loves katy perry. It&#x27;s cute and smells nice. She will love it.</li>
            <li> Took a few days longer to arrive than I had hoped, but still made it in time for Christmas. Unfortunately, then necklace chain snapped on Christmas day, after being worn for less than an hour. :(</li>
            <li> loved it in every way but the chain broke, and she only wore it for 3 days</li>
            <li> Great service, It came on time and it is in great condition. Bigger than what I thought but its still very cute and smells GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> I got her Purr pendant and now i have the Meow pendant.  Love them both, very heavy pendant but at least it wont flip over to the plain side while wearing it.</li>
            <li> A very good item and I like it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good/strong as the perfume. I can really only smell medal :/ The necklace is kind of long and heavy but pretty cute. My friend said she liked it</li>
            <li> Sadly, the locket I bought broke within 24 hours. In two places. The chain, and the bolt that connects the two halves of the locket both fell apart. Cheap, flimsy. Depressing. I bought this as a gift for my daughter, hated watching it fall apart almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, who loved it, but the swivel post broke after two days rendering it useless.  I&#x27;m not expecting heirloom quality, but it would be nice if the case lasted long enough to use up the perfume.</li>

            <li> Gave to my daughter for the holidays - perfect gift and smells great - She loves cats and fits in her purse.</li>
            <li> What a sweet gift this was for my granddaughter..although she is 10 this give is appropriate for any age as its made so wel and with the yummy perfume inside it is absolutely adorable! Love it! Wish I had gotten one for myself :)</li>
            <li> item cover when received, broke after only 1 day&lt;br /&gt;magnet not strong enough to hold cover on without top pin</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece and she loves it! She loves the way it smells and looks. She receives alot of attention and compliments when she wears it. What little girl doesn&#x27;t like to be in the spotlight a little? I remembered when I grew up, how much my sisters and I loved perfume jewerly.  I am not surprised it was a hit with her. She is 12.</li>
            <li> This necklace/perfume locket is very cute and reasonably priced.  The chain is quite long so you can just slip it over your head.  The pink color is soft and muted so it&#x27;s really a neutral and would go with any color clothing. I love the bright and sparkly rhinestones in the kitty&#x27;s ears! I had never smelled the fragrance &amp;#34;Meow&amp;#34; before but it is sweet and quite pleasant.  You can smell the fragrance even when the locket is closed. The gift box it came in was a little squished but the necklace was securely wrapped in lots of pink tissue and a black velveteen bag so it was thoroughly protected.  For the price, I think it would make a very good gift, especially for someone who loves kitties!</li>
            <li> I used to have a solid perfume necklace as a kid and it was one of my favorite gifts.  So we gave this to our 6-year-old and 8-year-old granddaughters for their birthdays and they love it!  (My daughter said the perfume is perfect - not too strong).</li>
            <li> Whatever the wife wants!  I liked the fragrance,,and will order it again.  I believe it was a Christmas stocking stuffer..Brownie points.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Bought this as a present for my 14 year old niece.  It smells lovely, and the long necklace was okay, although not very substantial.  A very cute idea.</li>
            <li> Just a cute necklace with perfume inside the head of the kitty. It must sound strange, but this is what you are buying!</li>
            <li> i personally love this necklace but i dropped it once and it broke within 3 days if u do buy it be very careful ith it it is very fragile</li>
            <li> Product is fabulous!  I received it towards the end of stated timeline! Larger than I expected, which is nice!  Just Beautiful!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my little sister.  I ordered it late so i knew I wouldn&#x27;t get it in time for her birthday and actually it came the day of her birthday!  She absolutely loved it and I love the ease and quickness of ordering and receiving!  I will definately be bying off of Amazon in the future and just hope and pray my two year old doesn&#x27;t anymore!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought two....one for each granddaughter...both broke...the chain is cheap to say the least...don&#x27;t waste your money  its garbage...cute but come on lasted 2 days...and now I have 2 sad grand kids and I&#x27;m out of 25 bucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Necklace is beautiful, packaging is beautiful, I loved the concept for my daughter! Upon receiving the product I opened it and checked to see how it worked. I slid the 2 sides apart and the &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;, which I&#x27;ll call perfume gloss, promptly slipped out of the little crevice it was supposed to be stuck in. I wanted something for under the tree, so I wrapped it &amp; figured I&#x27;d return it after Christmas. Well, even though I bought 2 other perfume type necklaces, this appears to be the only 1 that&#x27;s going to be a handful to get replaced/my $$ returned. It had a hazardous waste warning next to the place where it should have had a box asking for the reason. I&#x27;m *hoping* that the company who sent this through Amazon will work with me to get me a product that&#x27;s not malfunctioning, and if they DO, I will edit my review based on my newest experience. From what I can tell so far, however, gorgeous concept &amp; design, flawed execution.</li>
            <li> The locket was very nice and brand new. The only flaw it has is that the chain is not strong enough for the locket. But that is an easy fix. :-)</li>
            <li> I love the length of this necklace.  I wear it to work and get many compliments.  The frangrance is nice too.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it when I gave it to her as a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift.  She loves the smell and of course, Katy Perry.</li>
            <li> Its been since October that ive had this product and I must say im surprised it hasn&#x27;t tarnished. My friends and teachers give me compliments on it and its also a long necklace and modern since I see some people going for the long chain pendant type of jewelry. The perfume inside is true to scent and all in all, its a nice little gift for anyone even if you&#x27;re not a fan of her, try the perfume :)</li>
            <li> I love this It&#x27;s so pretty and smells so good and I love that its long it doesn&#x27;t have a clasp it&#x27;s long enough to put over your head and I love it so much I ordered the purple one purr so if your thinking about buying it I would recommend it</li>
            <li> smells great, and is super cute for a young lady. its weight is substantial enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice item.  Long chain.</li>
            <li> This locket is bigger than the picture!! Its so adorable, smells great and is really pretty looking! Love it!</li>
            <li> my fiance likes this. she got it just because she wanted to see what it was. in the end, she decided that it was money well spent</li>
            <li> A gift for my granddaughter for the second Christmas,  She loves the scent and I think that she smells wonderful when she wears it!</li>
            <li> I HAVE THE LOCKET IN THIS PINK COLOR, THE FRAGRANCE MEOW, AS WELL AS THE PURPLE LOCKET OF HER PURR FRAGRANCE AND THEY ARE BOTH DELIGHTFULLY LIGHT AND BREEZY,  YET MULTIFACETED SCENTS.  NOW I WEAR THEM AND GET COMPLIMENTS ON THEM AS A FASHION STATEMENT, BUT IT&#x27;S NEAT THAT I CAN JUST OPEN THE LOCKETS TO REFRESH MY FRAGRANCE THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND NOBODY KNOWS THEY CONTAIN SOLID PERFUME UNLESS I TELL THEM. BEAUTIFUL, AFFORDABLE , AND BRILLIANT IDEA-FEW COMPANIES DO SOLID PERFUMES ANYMORE AND I LOVE THEM. BRING US MORE &amp;#34;KITTY&amp;#34;SCENTS AND MORE LOCKETS TO MATCH, KATY PERRY-I LOVE YOUR TASTE IN YOUNG YET SENSUAL SCENTS!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 12 year old niece. She loved the fragrance and the necklace! I found the fragrance also pleasant, but more for a young person teen young adult.  I&#x27;m just partial to more of the earthy scents, so I&#x27;m not going to attempt to comment too much. It served as a great gift!! Always hard to find what to get pre-teens and teens as they reach that in between age. This was purr-fect!</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim as I have Purr in both locket and liquid form, and the scent is wonderful.  Even without putting the solid perfume on, the scent travels with you all day.  Nice!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves cats so i got her this and she loves it. The perfume is soft and pleasant. Looks classy but not the chain. So you can exchange that if you want to wear it or you can just put it on the purse. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Smells so nice. Perfect for a gift. Go this for my daughter who is a KatyCat.</li>
            <li> I had already bought Katy Perry before and could not find any in the stores in my area, so I went to Amazon. At the time I didn&#x27;t even know this locket existed and loved it so I purchased it along with the spray perfume.</li>
            <li> love the smell perfect gift to the Kat</li>
            <li> The perfume locket was purchased for my niece as a Christmas gift.  The locket broke within 24 hours.  Cheaply made.</li>
