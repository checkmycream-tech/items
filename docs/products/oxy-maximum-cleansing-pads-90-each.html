            <li>in all, great value and very effective.</li>
            <li>and for a very nice price.  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant not over-powering smell.</li>
            <li>Recommend a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>this is good for your skin and as a cleanser --- however the pads stick together</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>This product is not as good as clearasil, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I use this to keep my skin clean to prevent blackheads which is what this is best for.  </li>
            <li>Great idea bundling more than one in a package.  </li>
            <li>Very strong and a good deal to buy bulk on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>, so glad I can buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Kids come in sweaty from sports and it is a great and easy way to keep them from breaking out.</li>
            <li>The price is good, the pads work fine, but who knew that instead of the good ole benzoyl peroxide that used to be in OXY pads</li>
            <li>But it works amazingly for me.  </li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t cure your acne, that will happen from good diet and exercise, but it sure does help.</li>
            <li>For that kind of acne, I&#x27;ve found these pads to be reasonably effective.</li>
            <li>They are effective at cleaning the skin.</li>
            <li>However, like all acne products, they aren&#x27;t a miracle cure, and you shouldn&#x27;t expect spectacular results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a mom with teens of my own.</li>
            <li>I have not used this yet, but I have heard many good things about it.  </li>
            <li>BUT this stuff works wonderfully and my skin and getting so much clearer.</li>
            <li>has really made me feel beautiful!</li>
            <li>It has always worked great, and keeps my mug clean.</li>
            <li>I think these pads are also great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time and just want to get a quick treatment.</li>
            <li>Oxy Maximum is very strong and Oxy suggests that you wash your hands after use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooo happy with this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Good if you have mild acne problems.</li>
            <li>I am away from home more than 12hrs a day, so I take my Oxy with me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced a fair decrease in acne with regular use, but at the cost of drier skin.</li>
            <li>These are really great, and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>made me breakout even more.</li>
            <li>Salicylic Acid does better for me than the Benzoyl Peroxide in Pro-Activ.</li>
            <li>I love how I got 3 of these for this price</li>
            <li>so when I re order I have to make sure I will be home when it comes.</li>
            <li>I have even seen scars from breakouts turn lighter and my complexion to become more even-tone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these to maintain my skin / treat problem areas for years now, and I&#x27;m really pleased with them.</li>
            <li>I am not going to say this is a magic cure because in my quest to defeat acne I have found that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>I really love Oxy products now.</li>
            <li>Probably a strategic choice on the company&#x27;s part - it will sell more containers.</li>
            <li>Gives your face a refreshing and tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>They work great and you really can&#x27;t complain about the cost.</li>
            <li>I am not too sure what I can say about this product to give it a rating.</li>
            <li>My skin has become 100times better since I started using these pads.</li>
            <li>I have used the Oxy Pads on-and-off for many years and I never felt like they worked.</li>
            <li>Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips , 14 Nose Strips]].  </li>
            <li>Works better than Proactive and way cheaper.</li>
            <li>First off, if this is the acne product you need, this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>-Mart brand) is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>This does a really good job with keeping my sons face nice a clear.</li>
            <li>That said, the old packaging had a great seal.</li>
            <li>Use these after workouts and they greatly reduce my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>Used to be a great deal at $11, now the cost is much more than a local grocery store.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>These simplify the act of cleaning your face and make it easy to keep acne at bay.</li>
            <li>These pads are really easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda strong thou</li>
            <li>My skin has steadily getting better and better!</li>
            <li>They are simply awesome, wet it then put it on your nose and wait about 15 mins, then rip it off and all of your pores will be clean.</li>
            <li>then these will do fine for you.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal for a 3-pack (if you have Prime Shipping) better than I can find in any store near me unless there&#x27;s a pretty fantastic sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is a great for cleaning you skin every day, how ever if you want something that is more powerful to get rid of you zits(instead of just keep them from coming back like this product) I would suggest something with benzoyl peroxide in it.</li>
            <li>Problem went away after I started using Latex Free Disposable-Vinyl Gloves.    </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying them any more, they&#x27;re no longer useful to me.</li>
            <li>these are primarily rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>The pads work great at helping clean your face and back.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried these yet, they are quick, easy and cheaper on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a quick and easy way to get rid of blackheads</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not sure if these are the best for me.</li>
            <li>you, we will forward to appropriate department.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>, they get your face clean.  </li>
            <li>Even though his acne has cleared up, he continues to use these to keep his face/pores clean.  </li>
            <li>I like oxy pads to clean my pores</li>
            <li>Amazing product that keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>Honestly nothing stops acne completely.  </li>
            <li>But these offer deep cleaning and do a good job without breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have many complexion problems, but I do break out on occasion.  </li>
            <li>it definitely beats drug store prices by a good</li>
            <li>(work from home, don&#x27;t shave for days, get off me), and it maintains its moisture even over a full beard.  </li>
            <li>If you do not mind a reasonably powerful cheap musk floating about your face, burning your eyes, ruining the flavor of your food and dismaying friends  </li>
            <li>Ya right - like I was the first in how many years to point out that their repackaging dries out the solution.</li>
            <li>It helps clean up the stubborn makeup and leaves my face with a fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>things are SUPER moist out of the can.  </li>
            <li>I have mild acne, but i still would like it gone.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to wear a tank top FINALLY!</li>
            <li>Very very convenient!</li>
            <li>Clearasil, has a much better scent, and leaves my skin feeling clean, not dried out.</li>
            <li>While these are good, and I won&#x27;t repeat everyone else&#x27;s opinions of its capabilities, be aware that this is just a repackaging of this that you can find at your local CVS:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really well, cleans makeup off easily.</li>
            <li>Thanks OXY!!</li>
            <li>but thankfully my skin has ajust very well!!</li>
            <li>These work amazing on face, back, chest and neck to clear up any break outs without drying out the skin or causing more breakouts while healing.</li>
            <li>keeping your face clean helps the pores to stay more open.</li>
            <li>I break out these pads, and use one right on the pimple itself, once in the morning, and again at night.</li>
            <li>Been using these for years, my face never feels cleaner than it does right after using one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap and not super effective.</li>
            <li>It seems there are several types of OXY, I am using the OXY Maximum (the only type I have ever used) - and it is working for me greatly.     </li>
            <li>These treatments really are not interchangeable, as they are effective on different types of acne.</li>
            <li>They are very intense however.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately you just have to mostly outgrow it but</li>
            <li>and I am able to use them several times a day.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t get over how much these pads pick up even after a thorough wash!</li>
            <li>you have to remove first to use the pads, but once opened it)</li>
            <li>I can really see my skin improving!</li>
            <li>Consistent use once per day showed a difference in about a week.</li>
            <li>And, it is much cheaper than ProActiv while being more effective (at least for me).</li>
            <li>Using the face wash, cleansing pads, and spot treatment has helped to keep my face clean and clear.</li>
            <li>As she gets older, and if she starts to get more acne, she may have to use these daily along with a face wash, but for now, they are used randomly, and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Tho&#x27; the battle wages on, these have really helped reduce how many and my pores appear to be smaller.</li>
            <li>However, at this point I&#x27;m willing to try absolutely ANYTHING to help with my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Pretty much any 2% pad will do the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a long lasting supply at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>The sensitive skin type clean my pores and my makeup off without so much pain.</li>
            <li>When I come home and an dripping with sweat, I wash my face, wait for it to dry then use it to get all the stuff I missed with water, then I rinse my face once more to get the chemical feel off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to be sure to use it often or else the cleansing pads will dry out and be of no use.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has a problem with these being too strong, but I guess \\&quot;extra strength\\&quot; is no lie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is too strong for daily use.  </li>
            <li>you really have to use it with something.  </li>
            <li>For how much you pay, it comes with TONS of pads.</li>
            <li>Careful to avoid using after a shower and/or more than 2 times / day on a sunny day.  </li>
            <li>And this one really helped me to get rid of the acne that was making marks on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But what&#x27;s really import is: does it work.</li>
            <li>Ever, Highly Recommend!  </li>
            <li>Buying through Amazon Prime and subscribe and save is much cheaper than buying them in the store.</li>
            <li>and when I can keep this up things really do improve.</li>
            <li>It would keep the pads in a pool of liquid, well absorbing cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>Very well.</li>
            <li>It really should have been mentioned.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get rid of the ones you have</li>
            <li>/&gt;Salicylic acid is recommended for blackheads and other more surface-level acne.</li>
            <li>These are so filled with alcohol that they burn and burn and dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>Comes out two pads at one time, be sure to separate them.&lt;br /&gt;Product leaves a slightly sticky residue, that remains on your face for a couple days, or until you wash it off</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a decent price</li>
            <li>They do the job for my tween son who is experiencing mild acne around his hairline, but you could probably get some cotton swabs and a bottle of rubbing alcohol and get the same effect, which is what we plan to try when these run out.  </li>
            <li>I suspect that the sting comes from the high alcohol content-</li>
            <li>For the price its great, listen to your body, you may not need something as extreme everyday.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for those big red ones that can even be a little painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use proactive and it got rid of most of the acne I had but a few spots it just doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>I was able to buy this for a few cents cheaper than what I can get it in the store.</li>
            <li>; What that means is I don&#x27;t use them daily or anything, just when something isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>The new packaging is not that way.</li>
            <li>and I will sunburn easily even though I have a slightly darker complexion.</li>
            <li>Your skin will get super dry.  </li>
            <li>There are much better choices in similar products from other brands.</li>
            <li>Yep, it is exactly as described and cheaper than buying it at your local Walgreens or Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend them if you have dry skin because then it&#x27;ll just dry your skin out even more.</li>
            <li>Much easier than doing a full and messy face wash in the sink.</li>
            <li>helps keep my face clear from oils that can develop throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and they still don&#x27;t do anything to clear up acne.</li>
            <li>and Oxy seems to do nothing to clear it up.</li>
            <li>Do to oily skin I suffer from Adult Acme.  </li>
            <li>As always, I like to mention that these products should NOT be used by those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the pads are gentle and have the same texture on both sides.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of muscle to close them completely.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 14 year old son.</li>
            <li>These were 8$ a piece at the pharmacy near me.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I recommend buying the sensitive skin type instead.</li>
            <li>These are the only items that they will use since they are so convenient and easy to use.... and the pads seem to be working pretty well at combating the few pimples they are currently getting.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne prone skin forever, and have incorporated these into my routine for the past year and had a large deal of success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too strong, I will probably switch back to clearasil pads after using this product.</li>
            <li>It is too bad because they are fine otherwise and the price is certainly OK.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re getting a new or different formula or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also dry my skin way too much.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t dry me out too much and doesn&#x27;t leave any agitated redness.</li>
            <li>However, gentle enough to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>My entire life I have had a blackhead problem, I&#x27;ve been using OXY for years and its the only one that really does the job.  </li>
            <li>It was actually pretty harsh, but can last maybe too much.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t have really oily skin, then it would dry your skin out!  </li>
            <li>It is also not nearly as drying as the benzoyl blends, even though it has a high concentration of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use these cleansing pads on my 10 year old daughter, who is just now starting to get acne.</li>
            <li>I tried to go without using them for a while to give my skin a break from the harsh chemicals, but I&#x27;m coming right back to them because my skin is flaring up and</li>
            <li>The first few times i used it, my face cleared up.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for teen/tweens with typical skin issues.</li>
            <li>only problem is the sensitivity to sunlight on a summer day is pretty heavy</li>
            <li>Only the small container may last enough to be useful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The price is good, the pads work fine, but who knew that instead of the good ole benzoyl peroxide that used to be in OXY pads</li>
            <li> But it works amazingly for me.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m now a mom with teens of my own.</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet, but I have heard many good things about it.  </li>
            <li> BUT this stuff works wonderfully and my skin and getting so much clearer.</li>
            <li> has really made me feel beautiful!</li>
            <li> It has always worked great, and keeps my mug clean.</li>
            <li> I think these pads are also great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time and just want to get a quick treatment.</li>
            <li> Oxy Maximum is very strong and Oxy suggests that you wash your hands after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo happy with this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Good if you have mild acne problems.</li>
            <li> I am away from home more than 12hrs a day, so I take my Oxy with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced a fair decrease in acne with regular use, but at the cost of drier skin.</li>
            <li> These are really great, and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> made me breakout even more.</li>
            <li> Salicylic Acid does better for me than the Benzoyl Peroxide in Pro-Activ.</li>
            <li> I love how I got 3 of these for this price</li>
            <li> so when I re order I have to make sure I will be home when it comes.</li>
            <li> I have even seen scars from breakouts turn lighter and my complexion to become more even-tone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these to maintain my skin / treat problem areas for years now, and I&#x27;m really pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I am not going to say this is a magic cure because in my quest to defeat acne I have found that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I really love Oxy products now.</li>
            <li> Probably a strategic choice on the company&#x27;s part - it will sell more containers.</li>
            <li> Gives your face a refreshing and tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> They work great and you really can&#x27;t complain about the cost.</li>
            <li> I am not too sure what I can say about this product to give it a rating.</li>
            <li> My skin has become 100times better since I started using these pads.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oxy Pads on-and-off for many years and I never felt like they worked.</li>

            <li> Works better than Proactive and way cheaper.</li>
            <li> First off, if this is the acne product you need, this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> -Mart brand) is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> This does a really good job with keeping my sons face nice a clear.</li>
            <li> That said, the old packaging had a great seal.</li>
            <li> Use these after workouts and they greatly reduce my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> Used to be a great deal at $11, now the cost is much more than a local grocery store.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> These simplify the act of cleaning your face and make it easy to keep acne at bay.</li>
            <li> These pads are really easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda strong thou</li>
            <li> My skin has steadily getting better and better!</li>
            <li> They are simply awesome, wet it then put it on your nose and wait about 15 mins, then rip it off and all of your pores will be clean.</li>
            <li> then these will do fine for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for a 3-pack (if you have Prime Shipping) better than I can find in any store near me unless there&#x27;s a pretty fantastic sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is a great for cleaning you skin every day, how ever if you want something that is more powerful to get rid of you zits(instead of just keep them from coming back like this product) I would suggest something with benzoyl peroxide in it.</li>
            <li> Problem went away after I started using Latex Free Disposable-Vinyl Gloves.    </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying them any more, they&#x27;re no longer useful to me.</li>
            <li> these are primarily rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> The pads work great at helping clean your face and back.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried these yet, they are quick, easy and cheaper on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a quick and easy way to get rid of blackheads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure if these are the best for me.</li>
            <li> you, we will forward to appropriate department.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> , they get your face clean.  </li>
            <li> Even though his acne has cleared up, he continues to use these to keep his face/pores clean.  </li>
            <li> I like oxy pads to clean my pores</li>
            <li> Amazing product that keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> Honestly nothing stops acne completely.  </li>
            <li> But these offer deep cleaning and do a good job without breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have many complexion problems, but I do break out on occasion.  </li>
            <li> it definitely beats drug store prices by a good</li>
            <li> (work from home, don&#x27;t shave for days, get off me), and it maintains its moisture even over a full beard.  </li>
            <li> If you do not mind a reasonably powerful cheap musk floating about your face, burning your eyes, ruining the flavor of your food and dismaying friends  </li>
            <li> Ya right - like I was the first in how many years to point out that their repackaging dries out the solution.</li>
            <li> It helps clean up the stubborn makeup and leaves my face with a fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> things are SUPER moist out of the can.  </li>
            <li> I have mild acne, but i still would like it gone.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to wear a tank top FINALLY!</li>
            <li> Very very convenient!</li>
            <li> Clearasil, has a much better scent, and leaves my skin feeling clean, not dried out.</li>
            <li> While these are good, and I won&#x27;t repeat everyone else&#x27;s opinions of its capabilities, be aware that this is just a repackaging of this that you can find at your local CVS:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works really well, cleans makeup off easily.</li>
            <li> Thanks OXY!!</li>
            <li> but thankfully my skin has ajust very well!!</li>
            <li> These work amazing on face, back, chest and neck to clear up any break outs without drying out the skin or causing more breakouts while healing.</li>
            <li> keeping your face clean helps the pores to stay more open.</li>
            <li> I break out these pads, and use one right on the pimple itself, once in the morning, and again at night.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years, my face never feels cleaner than it does right after using one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap and not super effective.</li>
            <li> It seems there are several types of OXY, I am using the OXY Maximum (the only type I have ever used) - and it is working for me greatly.     </li>
            <li> These treatments really are not interchangeable, as they are effective on different types of acne.</li>
            <li> They are very intense however.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately you just have to mostly outgrow it but</li>
            <li> and I am able to use them several times a day.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get over how much these pads pick up even after a thorough wash!</li>
            <li> you have to remove first to use the pads, but once opened it)</li>
            <li> I can really see my skin improving!</li>
            <li> Consistent use once per day showed a difference in about a week.</li>
            <li> And, it is much cheaper than ProActiv while being more effective (at least for me).</li>
            <li> Using the face wash, cleansing pads, and spot treatment has helped to keep my face clean and clear.</li>
            <li> As she gets older, and if she starts to get more acne, she may have to use these daily along with a face wash, but for now, they are used randomly, and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Tho&#x27; the battle wages on, these have really helped reduce how many and my pores appear to be smaller.</li>
            <li> However, at this point I&#x27;m willing to try absolutely ANYTHING to help with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty much any 2% pad will do the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long lasting supply at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> The sensitive skin type clean my pores and my makeup off without so much pain.</li>
            <li> When I come home and an dripping with sweat, I wash my face, wait for it to dry then use it to get all the stuff I missed with water, then I rinse my face once more to get the chemical feel off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to be sure to use it often or else the cleansing pads will dry out and be of no use.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has a problem with these being too strong, but I guess \\&quot;extra strength\\&quot; is no lie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is too strong for daily use.  </li>
            <li> you really have to use it with something.  </li>
            <li> For how much you pay, it comes with TONS of pads.</li>
            <li> Careful to avoid using after a shower and/or more than 2 times / day on a sunny day.  </li>
            <li> And this one really helped me to get rid of the acne that was making marks on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But what&#x27;s really import is: does it work.</li>
            <li> Ever, Highly Recommend!  </li>
            <li> Buying through Amazon Prime and subscribe and save is much cheaper than buying them in the store.</li>
            <li> and when I can keep this up things really do improve.</li>
            <li> It would keep the pads in a pool of liquid, well absorbing cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Very well.</li>
            <li> It really should have been mentioned.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get rid of the ones you have</li>
            <li> /&gt;Salicylic acid is recommended for blackheads and other more surface-level acne.</li>
            <li> These are so filled with alcohol that they burn and burn and dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Comes out two pads at one time, be sure to separate them.&lt;br /&gt;Product leaves a slightly sticky residue, that remains on your face for a couple days, or until you wash it off</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a decent price</li>
            <li> They do the job for my tween son who is experiencing mild acne around his hairline, but you could probably get some cotton swabs and a bottle of rubbing alcohol and get the same effect, which is what we plan to try when these run out.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that the sting comes from the high alcohol content-</li>
            <li> For the price its great, listen to your body, you may not need something as extreme everyday.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for those big red ones that can even be a little painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use proactive and it got rid of most of the acne I had but a few spots it just doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> I was able to buy this for a few cents cheaper than what I can get it in the store.</li>
            <li> ; What that means is I don&#x27;t use them daily or anything, just when something isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li> The new packaging is not that way.</li>
            <li> and I will sunburn easily even though I have a slightly darker complexion.</li>
            <li> Your skin will get super dry.  </li>
            <li> There are much better choices in similar products from other brands.</li>
            <li> Yep, it is exactly as described and cheaper than buying it at your local Walgreens or Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend them if you have dry skin because then it&#x27;ll just dry your skin out even more.</li>
            <li> Much easier than doing a full and messy face wash in the sink.</li>
            <li> helps keep my face clear from oils that can develop throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and they still don&#x27;t do anything to clear up acne.</li>
            <li> and Oxy seems to do nothing to clear it up.</li>
            <li> Do to oily skin I suffer from Adult Acme.  </li>
            <li> As always, I like to mention that these products should NOT be used by those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the pads are gentle and have the same texture on both sides.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of muscle to close them completely.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 14 year old son.</li>
            <li> These were 8$ a piece at the pharmacy near me.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I recommend buying the sensitive skin type instead.</li>
            <li> These are the only items that they will use since they are so convenient and easy to use.... and the pads seem to be working pretty well at combating the few pimples they are currently getting.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne prone skin forever, and have incorporated these into my routine for the past year and had a large deal of success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too strong, I will probably switch back to clearasil pads after using this product.</li>
            <li> It is too bad because they are fine otherwise and the price is certainly OK.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re getting a new or different formula or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also dry my skin way too much.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry me out too much and doesn&#x27;t leave any agitated redness.</li>
            <li> However, gentle enough to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> My entire life I have had a blackhead problem, I&#x27;ve been using OXY for years and its the only one that really does the job.  </li>
            <li> It was actually pretty harsh, but can last maybe too much.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t have really oily skin, then it would dry your skin out!  </li>
            <li> It is also not nearly as drying as the benzoyl blends, even though it has a high concentration of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use these cleansing pads on my 10 year old daughter, who is just now starting to get acne.</li>
            <li> I tried to go without using them for a while to give my skin a break from the harsh chemicals, but I&#x27;m coming right back to them because my skin is flaring up and</li>
            <li> The first few times i used it, my face cleared up.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for teen/tweens with typical skin issues.</li>
            <li> only problem is the sensitivity to sunlight on a summer day is pretty heavy</li>
            <li> Only the small container may last enough to be useful.</li>
            <li> To work right, you have to use it at least twice a day</li>
            <li> I use it every 3 days or so and rely mainly on exfoliation and an everyday facial wash.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products, like Trader Joe&#x27;s acne cleansing pads and benzoyl peroxide, that keep my face mostly clear.</li>
            <li> Get the smallest possible container of these (unless you use them every day - and probably dry your skin out).</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are fabulous, saving my Daughter the embarrassment of having an angry looking pimple on her face while she&#x27;s at school.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time, and like it.</li>
            <li> Some of these in stores can come dry but all of the ones that I got from online were just what I needed</li>
            <li> ALL PADS will dry out.</li>
            <li> Unless you use these every day, the pads will dry.</li>
            <li> OK but it has an unpleasant perfume added which is not mentioned on the label.</li>
            <li> but you can catch it on-sale at the big box stores for less.</li>
            <li> I look for pads that leave as little sticky residue as possible.</li>
            <li> As expected and on time.</li>
            <li> But that is to be expected with any product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve checked the ingredients, and the salicylic content is not strong enough to be causing this stinging sensation.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this because of how strong they are.</li>
            <li> However, for me washing my hands was not enough to prevent my fingers&#x27; skin to excessive exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> One is benzoyl peroxide, and the other is used in these pads, salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4/5 star is due to the case.</li>
            <li> Using some of the other products the pimple will go away in a day or two; sometimes overnight.</li>
            <li> A tiny complaint is that the container doesn&#x27;t seal that well.</li>
            <li> I like other OXY products, but these were thrown in the trash after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It is harsh, but I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> If you do not mind a harsh scrub and/or a slight burning sensation, this is for your problem skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these on her everyday though as I am concerned about them drying her skin....</li>
            <li> I cannot use them everyday or else</li>
            <li> This does not provide a seal at all, so the solution will evaporate out of the container leaving you with ineffective dried out pads.</li>
            <li> Do not spend your money on expensive products prior to trying this product.</li>
            <li> also, i left the container on it&#x27;s side so that the medicine could soak through all the pads and it began leaking --- i.e., flawed...</li>
            <li> The issue is that the top does leaks terribly.</li>
            <li> It does burn a little, but not to the point where it should seriously bother you.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I was desperately looking for a solution for my Acne problem, so I went to my local drug store</li>
            <li> There are two common acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching desperately for a product that claims to treat/reduce acne and actually works.</li>
            <li> Seriously, Oxy is the winner.</li>
            <li> This is for persons with serious oily faces and for persons prone to serious acne.  </li>
            <li> only bad part about it</li>
            <li> I had really bad back acne for three years and washing it in the shower never helped.</li>
            <li> As soon as a breakout appears, (and it&#x27;s always just one ugly, red, pimple that pops out on her forehead area,)</li>
            <li> These are average and would rate 4 stars if not for the unwanted and unpleasant perfume.</li>
            <li> I use them myself sometimes at night when I&#x27;m too tired for my 3 step face wash program .great</li>
            <li> The scent of these is HORRIBLE, and to make it worse, the scent remains noticeable for a long time after application.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to take just one.  </li>
            <li> I had acne bad</li>
            <li> There is nothing bad I can say about OXY.  </li>
            <li> that that&#x27;s a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> but I also will use my St Ives Anti aging moisturizer and the dryness is not as bad.</li>
            <li> In fact, it can be startling how much grim they pick up.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> you really have to use it with something.  Do not use it alone.</li>
            <li> Very very convenient! I use this before sleeping every night. Has a pleasant not over-powering smell. For how much you pay, it comes with TONS of pads. Will definitely buy again once i&#x27;m done with my current pads.</li>
            <li> Honestly nothing stops acne completely.  But these offer deep cleaning and do a good job without breaking the bank.  I had acne bad and my oldest already has it so these are a must as part of the treatment.  Ultimately you just have to mostly outgrow it but keeping your face clean helps the pores to stay more open.</li>
            <li> Cheap and not super effective. However, gentle enough to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This product is made with peroxide, an excellent healing agent as well as cleaning agent.  When I purchased 3 bottles at once, I didn&#x27;t know I would get to share them.  Great idea bundling more than one in a package.  This is my choice when I need this type of cleaner.  I actually bought it to use on my fingernails that were turning yellow.  Worked great.</li>
            <li> I use these cleansing pads on my 10 year old daughter, who is just now starting to get acne. As soon as a breakout appears, (and it&#x27;s always just one ugly, red, pimple that pops out on her forehead area,) I break out these pads, and use one right on the pimple itself, once in the morning, and again at night. Withing 24 hours-the redness is gone, and the pimple is greatly reduced, to almost nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fabulous, saving my Daughter the embarrassment of having an angry looking pimple on her face while she&#x27;s at school. I don&#x27;t use these on her everyday though as I am concerned about them drying her skin....we just use when a breakout occurs. As she gets older, and if she starts to get more acne, she may have to use these daily along with a face wash, but for now, they are used randomly, and work perfectly. Thanks OXY!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have many complexion problems, but I do break out on occasion.  I decided to try these on a whim.  They work well, they get your face clean.  They are very intense however.  I cannot use them everyday or else it overdries my face, I also recommend a facial moisturizer to apply afterwards or else your face is going to overproduce oil to overcompensate.  I use it every 3 days or so and rely mainly on exfoliation and an everyday facial wash.      For the price its great, listen to your body, you may not need something as extreme everyday.</li>
            <li> These changed my life.  A friend (who owns a beauty salon) recommended Salicylic acid pads to me, and boy did these ever work.  Careful to avoid using after a shower and/or more than 2 times / day on a sunny day.  Your skin will get super dry.  Recommend a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> helps keep my face clear from oils that can develop throughout the day. a trusted brand.</li>
            <li> As expected and on time. No complaints.</li>
            <li> My face looks great.  Do not spend your money on expensive products prior to trying this product.</li>
            <li> this is a great for cleaning you skin every day, how ever if you want something that is more powerful to get rid of you zits(instead of just keep them from coming back like this product) I would suggest something with benzoyl peroxide in it.</li>
            <li> this is good for your skin and as a cleanser --- however the pads stick together and it is difficult to take just one.  also, i left the container on it&#x27;s side so that the medicine could soak through all the pads and it began leaking --- i.e., flawed...</li>
            <li> These face cleaners get the oil of my face, at the expense of making my face have some sort of chemical smell. But I don&#x27;t care, cause I just use them before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I was desperately looking for a solution for my Acne problem, so I went to my local drug store and I decided to try 3 deferent brands of anti-acne cleansing pads. Seriously, Oxy is the winner. I am away from home more than 12hrs a day, so I take my Oxy with me. I used the pads 2-to-3 times a day.  It seems there are several types of OXY, I am using the OXY Maximum (the only type I have ever used) - and it is working for me greatly.     Oxy Maximum is very strong and Oxy suggests that you wash your hands after use. However, for me washing my hands was not enough to prevent my fingers&#x27; skin to excessive exfoliation.  Problem went away after I started using Latex Free Disposable-Vinyl Gloves.    I would recommend you to give a try this product and hopefully you will find it helpful.</li>
            <li> There are much better choices in similar products from other brands. I like other OXY products, but these were thrown in the trash after a few uses. The scent of these is HORRIBLE, and to make it worse, the scent remains noticeable for a long time after application. They also dry my skin way too much. Clearasil, has a much better scent, and leaves my skin feeling clean, not dried out.</li>
            <li> My son has been using the Oxy Pads since he started having acne. Even though his acne has cleared up, he continues to use these to keep his face/pores clean.  I like the fact I can order 3 in a package to save time and money.</li>
            <li> Some of these in stores can come dry but all of the ones that I got from online were just what I needed and they work great!</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t cure your acne, that will happen from good diet and exercise, but it sure does help. A tiny complaint is that the container doesn&#x27;t seal that well. When I take this on the go, in a duffel bag or whatnot, it tends to leak and leaves the pads dryer than they should be.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for a 3-pack (if you have Prime Shipping) better than I can find in any store near me unless there&#x27;s a pretty fantastic sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this works on my face. I have an oily face so it doesn&#x27;t dry me out too much and doesn&#x27;t leave any agitated redness. My girlfriend has a problem with these being too strong, but I guess \\&quot;extra strength\\&quot; is no lie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the sensitivity to sunlight on a summer day is pretty heavy and I will sunburn easily even though I have a slightly darker complexion. But that is to be expected with any product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great value and very effective.</li>
            <li> There is nothing bad I can say about OXY.  This is for persons with serious oily faces and for persons prone to serious acne.  To work right, you have to use it at least twice a day but if you don&#x27;t have really oily skin, then it would dry your skin out!  But it works amazingly for me.  It helps clean up the stubborn makeup and leaves my face with a fresh feeling.  It never dries out my skin because it&#x27;s made for may skin type.  There are different types and different strength levels, so you can find a level for you but for me A+!</li>
            <li> Do to oily skin I suffer from Adult Acme.  I use this 3 times a day for a basic cleanse before applying the prescription ointment I use twice a day.  Much easier than doing a full and messy face wash in the sink.</li>
            <li> I bought it and I have never used products for acne. And this one really helped me to get rid of the acne that was making marks on my skin. I use it 2 or 3 times a day. And now I only use it once a day, and I have no acne anymore at all.</li>
            <li> First off, if this is the acne product you need, this is a good deal. It&#x27;s a long lasting supply at a pretty good price. it definitely beats drug store prices by a good margin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what&#x27;s really import is: does it work. Well, it depends. There are two common acne treatments. One is benzoyl peroxide, and the other is used in these pads, salicylic acid. These treatments really are not interchangeable, as they are effective on different types of acne. Benzoyl peroxide is used to treat deep, under-the-skin pimples. it&#x27;s great for those big red ones that can even be a little painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid is recommended for blackheads and other more surface-level acne. For that kind of acne, I&#x27;ve found these pads to be reasonably effective. They are effective at cleaning the skin. In fact, it can be startling how much grim they pick up. However, like all acne products, they aren&#x27;t a miracle cure, and you shouldn&#x27;t expect spectacular results. I&#x27;ve experienced a fair decrease in acne with regular use, but at the cost of drier skin. I&#x27;m really not sure if these are the best for me. I&#x27;d recommend trying a one-pack before committing to the three-pack supply.</li>
            <li> Best Stuff Ever, Highly Recommend!  Use Morning and Night!</li>
            <li> Continuing to buy this product great value</li>
            <li> Great deal! Same product as I&#x27;ve purchased in store.</li>
            <li> Used to be a great deal at $11, now the cost is much more than a local grocery store.</li>
            <li> I started using these when I was a teen. I&#x27;m now a mom with teens of my own. Buying through Amazon Prime and subscribe and save is much cheaper than buying them in the store. The pads work great at helping clean your face and back. They are a must have for anyone with acne prone skin. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use a pad after I come home from each run. When I come home and an dripping with sweat, I wash my face, wait for it to dry then use it to get all the stuff I missed with water, then I rinse my face once more to get the chemical feel off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price too.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne prone skin forever, and have incorporated these into my routine for the past year and had a large deal of success. These are really great, and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> made me breakout even more.</li>
            <li> Although marketed for teenage boys, I am a woman over 40 who loves using the Oxy products. Using the face wash, cleansing pads, and spot treatment has helped to keep my face clean and clear. And, my face knows when I have messed up the system! I also use the scrub to help keep my skin exfoliated. As always, I like to mention that these products should NOT be used by those with sensitive skin. But, if you have stubborn acne, Oxy could be just what you need. And, it is much cheaper than ProActiv while being more effective (at least for me). The packs offered at Amazon are a great bargain and good way to ensure that you don&#x27;t run out of product!</li>
            <li> This is an essential weapon in my acne arsenal. Pro-Activ doesn&#x27;t work for me. Salicylic Acid does better for me than the Benzoyl Peroxide in Pro-Activ. After washing your face, use these pads to remove additional grime, unclog pores and leave acne fighting protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent price but you can catch it on-sale at the big box stores for less. Me and my teenager BOTH use it so we need to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time, and like it. It has always worked great, and keeps my mug clean.</li>
            <li> This does a really good job with keeping my sons face nice a clear. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> My teenage sons are getting to that time.  These are the only items that they will use since they are so convenient and easy to use.... and the pads seem to be working pretty well at combating the few pimples they are currently getting.</li>
            <li> Been using it for yours, my skin is used to it, but it does stain collars, hand towels, sheets....anything that comes in contact with your face soon after using the pads!!</li>
            <li> While these are good, and I won&#x27;t repeat everyone else&#x27;s opinions of its capabilities, be aware that this is just a repackaging of this that you can find at your local CVS:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Oxy-Maximum-Daily-Cleansing-Pads/dp/B000GZWQ06/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1362031353&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;oxy&lt;br /&gt; Like, literally.  It says so on the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing.  But don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re getting a new or different formula or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are SUPER moist out of the can.  I have a hairy face (work from home, don&#x27;t shave for days, get off me), and it maintains its moisture even over a full beard.  It is also not nearly as drying as the benzoyl blends, even though it has a high concentration of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet, but I have heard many good things about it.  I have mild acne, but i still would like it gone.  I use proactive and it got rid of most of the acne I had but a few spots it just doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid of.  I love how I got 3 of these for this price, the only thing I DID NOT LIKE was that I had to sign for the package so when I re order I have to make sure I will be home when it comes.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for 3 years now. The first few times i used it, my face cleared up. I have even seen scars from breakouts turn lighter and my complexion to become more even-tone.  the pads are gentle and have the same texture on both sides. i used the NOXZEMA this time just to switch it up but i am going back to this!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Good price too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these to maintain my skin / treat problem areas for years now, and I&#x27;m really pleased with them. I tried to go without using them for a while to give my skin a break from the harsh chemicals, but I&#x27;m coming right back to them because my skin is flaring up and nothing else seems to help!</li>
            <li> Yep, it is exactly as described and cheaper than buying it at your local Walgreens or Wal-Mart.  If you want to save money, buy this pack of three.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for year and haven&#x27;t had an acne problem since I started. These simplify the act of cleaning your face and make it easy to keep acne at bay. If you haven&#x27;t tried these yet, they are quick, easy and cheaper on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use prime be warned: these will not ship 2 day as they have &amp;#34;hazardous materials&amp;#34; in them.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years, my face never feels cleaner than it does right after using one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only precaution is not to use them before working out / breaking a sweat as it will get in your eyes and burn.</li>
            <li> I think this is too strong for daily use.  I&#x27;ve checked the ingredients, and the salicylic content is not strong enough to be causing this stinging sensation.  I suspect that the sting comes from the high alcohol content- 46% is like plastering rubbing alcohol over your face.</li>
            <li> I was able to buy this for a few cents cheaper than what I can get it in the store.</li>
            <li> The best acne pads ever made and nobody comes close. Believe it or not, Equate(Wal-Mart brand) is pretty good as well. If you do not mind a harsh scrub and/or a slight burning sensation, this is for your problem skin.</li>
            <li> All acne products depend on your skin, so it is necessary to experiment.  Oxy was the turning point in my experimenting.  It is harsh, but I have extremely oily skin and I am able to use them several times a day.  I take these in my suitcase all the time, and I have never had one leak. It takes a bit of muscle to close them completely.  I use these now in combination with oxy&#x27;s exfoliating face wash.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that keeps my skin clear.  Hard to find in stores, so glad I can buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Middle age zits, who knew!</li>
            <li> I started trying the Oxy Daily Defense cleansing pads with the Oxy Maximum Strength Cleanser and wow. My skin has steadily getting better and better! I am not going to say this is a magic cure because in my quest to defeat acne I have found that isn&#x27;t the case. BUT this stuff works wonderfully and my skin and getting so much clearer. I have noticed a bit of dryness from this combo but I also will use my St Ives Anti aging moisturizer and the dryness is not as bad. I think these pads are also great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time and just want to get a quick treatment. I really love Oxy products now. I am 23 with combination skin and this stuff has really made me feel beautiful!</li>
            <li> I got thru my teen years virtually unscathed--but now approaching 60 seems to be out of control. These pads are really easy to use and I can&#x27;t get over how much these pads pick up even after a thorough wash! Tho&#x27; the battle wages on, these have really helped reduce how many and my pores appear to be smaller. I try to use 3X a day when I&#x27;m home and when I can keep this up things really do improve.</li>
            <li> After spending 100s of $$$.. I go into CVS and they had them on sale for $1:49 and I was like hey try it out, it might work!! And umm IT DID!! My  skin has cleared out and I go weeks without breakouts.. And even when I do by the next aye it&#x27;s gone!!  It&#x27;s kinda strong thou but thankfully my skin has ajust very well!! I&#x27;m soooo happy with this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I do like the Oxy Pads, they work well for &amp;#34;incident response.&amp;#34; What that means is I don&#x27;t use them daily or anything, just when something isn&#x27;t right and I need to get some extra cleaning to prevent a problem.  That said, the old packaging had a great seal. It would keep the pads in a pool of liquid, well absorbing cleaning solution. All the pads remained functional until I completed the entire package.  The new packaging is not that way. ALL PADS will dry out. Unless you use these every day, the pads will dry. The only &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; in place (once you open it - it does ship with a sealed covering you have to remove first to use the pads, but once opened it) is a piece of paperboard in the lid. This does not provide a seal at all, so the solution will evaporate out of the container leaving you with ineffective dried out pads. Probably a strategic choice on the company&#x27;s part - it will sell more containers. However, it should decrease loyalty. I for one, don&#x27;t want a product whose basic principle is a pad soaked in solution but packaging makes the solution evaporate. What use is that?  Get the smallest possible container of these (unless you use them every day - and probably dry your skin out). Only the small container may last enough to be useful. I won&#x27;t be buying them any more, they&#x27;re no longer useful to me. (By the way, I wrote to the company about this, and their response was &amp;#34;Thank you, we will forward to appropriate department.&amp;#34;) Ya right - like I was the first in how many years to point out that their repackaging dries out the solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching desperately for a product that claims to treat/reduce acne and actually works. OXY does it! They come i convenient pads which you can apply after you wash your face. Gives your face a refreshing and tingly feeling. I can really see my skin improving!</li>
            <li> Pros: You see what is coming off your face after you wipe with it.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It burns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t work instantly. It was actually pretty harsh, but can last maybe too much. You have to be sure to use it often or else the cleansing pads will dry out and be of no use.</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as clearasil, but it gets the job done.  It&#x27;s a little too strong, I will probably switch back to clearasil pads after using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 14 year old son. They work great on blackheads!! He uses them on his face and his shoulders and back area. They work great and you really can&#x27;t complain about the cost. I use them myself sometimes at night when I&#x27;m too tired for my 3 step face wash program .great product overall.</li>
            <li> and for a very nice price.  Even at my age, 57, I still find I need this product.  It works as it&#x27;s always worked since I was a teen. Very well.</li>
            <li> The price is good, the pads work fine, but who knew that instead of the good ole benzoyl peroxide that used to be in OXY pads these are primarily rubbing alcohol.  They do the job for my tween son who is experiencing mild acne around his hairline, but you could probably get some cotton swabs and a bottle of rubbing alcohol and get the same effect, which is what we plan to try when these run out.  I gave them 4 stars because they came packaged well and they work for my son.</li>
            <li> I am not too sure what I can say about this product to give it a rating. It is what it says it is &amp; that&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is as described....2% salicylic acid pads. The reason for the 4/5 star is due to the case. I travel a lot and like to bring these pads with me.  The issue is that the top does leaks terribly. If these are just going to sit on your bathroom counter, than consider it a 5/5 product.  If you are like me and travel with your toiletries than you may wish to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Use these after workouts and they greatly reduce my adult acne.  Very strong and a good deal to buy bulk on Amazon.  These were 8$ a piece at the pharmacy near me.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this because of how strong they are. However, at this point I&#x27;m willing to try absolutely ANYTHING to help with my oily skin. My skin has become 100times better since I started using these pads. I don&#x27;t recommend them if you have dry skin because then it&#x27;ll just dry your skin out even more. but if you have oily skin like i DID then this will be great for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution!! Don&#x27;t travel with them because the container leaks. only bad part about it</li>
            <li> I have used the Oxy Pads on-and-off for many years and I never felt like they worked. I figured I&#x27;d try them again and they still don&#x27;t do anything to clear up acne. I&#x27;ve used other products, like Trader Joe&#x27;s acne cleansing pads and benzoyl peroxide, that keep my face mostly clear. I can have the same pimple for days and Oxy seems to do nothing to clear it up. Using some of the other products the pimple will go away in a day or two; sometimes overnight. I won&#x27;t be buying Oxy Pads again.</li>
            <li> OK but it has an unpleasant perfume added which is not mentioned on the label. It really should have been mentioned. It hit me when I put it on. I am sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I use salicylic acid pads to avoid and reduce blackheads and oily skin. Pretty much any 2% pad will do the job. I look for pads that leave as little sticky residue as possible. These are average and would rate 4 stars if not for the unwanted and unpleasant perfume. I cannot use them. It is too bad because they are fine otherwise and the price is certainly OK.  If you do not mind a reasonably powerful cheap musk floating about your face, burning your eyes, ruining the flavor of your food and dismaying friends  then these will do fine for you.</li>
            <li> I like oxy pads to clean my pores but I recommend buying the sensitive skin type instead. These are so filled with alcohol that they burn and burn and dry my skin out. The sensitive skin type clean my pores and my makeup off without so much pain.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for teen/tweens with typical skin issues. Consistent use once per day showed a difference in about a week.</li>
            <li> Great to have around when you have teens.  Kids come in sweaty from sports and it is a great and easy way to keep them from breaking out.</li>
            <li> These work amazing on face, back, chest and neck to clear up any break outs without drying out the skin or causing more breakouts while healing.</li>
            <li> Comes out two pads at one time, be sure to separate them.&lt;br /&gt;Product leaves a slightly sticky residue, that remains on your face for a couple days, or until you wash it off</li>
            <li> My entire life I have had a blackhead problem, I&#x27;ve been using OXY for years and its the only one that really does the job.  I use this to keep my skin clean to prevent blackheads which is what this is best for.  Doesn&#x27;t really get rid of the ones you have but after you get rid of those then OXY will keep them away.  If you are looking for a quick and easy way to get rid of blackheads then I have to recommend you buy [[ASIN:B0009EILKS Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips , 14 Nose Strips]].  They are simply awesome, wet it then put it on your nose and wait about 15 mins, then rip it off and all of your pores will be clean.</li>
            <li> Good if you have mild acne problems.</li>
            <li> I had really bad back acne for three years and washing it in the shower never helped. I started using these on my face and back a week ago and I was able to wear a tank top FINALLY! Works really well, cleans makeup off easily. It does burn a little, but not to the point where it should seriously bother you. Works better than Proactive and way cheaper.</li>
