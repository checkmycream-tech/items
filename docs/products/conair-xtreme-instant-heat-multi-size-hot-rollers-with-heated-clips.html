            <li>I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>A very good investment!</li>
            <li>The metal clips of 20 years ago I used caused breakage and slipends - these clips are awesome.  </li>

            <li>These rollers are awesome.  </li>
            <li>Definitely my best hair appliance purchase ever!</li>
            <li>but I now agree with all those that weren&#x27;t impressed with them.  </li>
            <li>so I ended up using bobby pins, which works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself and my sister and best friend kept borrowing it</li>

            <li>curlers are perfect for my mew shorter summer hair cut.  </li>
            <li>BABHS40 Ceramic and Ionic 30-Roller Hair Set]] just had the best reviews.</li>
            <li>This hair roller system is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The clips are the best part because I can&#x27;t use those wire clips.</li>
            <li>the product came in excellent conditions.</li>
            <li>Best impulse buy I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find that it curled my hair perfectly the way I wanted, and they stayed for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>Also, the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are superficial at best</li>
            <li>that being said, these curlers are awesome.  </li>
            <li>still, the curlers themselves are great!</li>
            <li>being said, the clips DO NOT work on the jumbo size rollers (especially on top of the head).  </li>
            <li>but the clips still don&#x27;t work the best.</li>
            <li>When i found these they were perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the curlers!!</li>
            <li>but it needs a lot of changes to be perfect!</li>
            <li>It heats well and the quality is really great!  </li>
            <li>Made my wife very happy, she says they work perfectly</li>
            <li>I thought the clips were especially good in the beginning</li>
            <li>Awesome set.</li>
            <li>This item is simply AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>Work amazingly!!</li>
            <li>The idea is actually very good-</li>
            <li>very good, thank you, thank you</li>
            <li>My hair came out incredibly shiny after I used these too which I have never had with any curling iron i owned.</li>
            <li>She said the price is great, and that it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work Conair!</li>
            <li>I like everything about it, and know that it would do a good job IF the rollers would stay in!  </li>
            <li>I loved that set!  </li>
            <li>When I was at work everyone kept asking me where I got my hair done because it look beautiful and</li>
            <li>It sets your hair beautifully every time.  </li>
            <li>The rollers curled my hair beautifully and created volume.</li>
            <li>They heat up very quickly and they hold all night!!!</li>
            <li>They work great on my hair.  </li>
            <li>otherwise great set giving me lots and lots of curls that lasted two days.</li>
            <li>Change the clips and you&#x27;ll have a great product.</li>
            <li>But the best thing is that it gives amazing shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>great results.  </li>
            <li>hair looks great and</li>
            <li>This took no time at all, and I look great...</li>
            <li>I am happy with the rollers.</li>
            <li>The clips are great.</li>
            <li>I even used Redken spray starch will is great for holding curls, but still no luck.</li>
            <li>This product works great.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was an automatic shut off safety feature, but otherwise, great.</li>
            <li>They work great and help get rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li>this product is great.</li>
            <li>recommend these curlers, I think they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>They give a great curl</li>
            <li>, how great is that?</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a great curler set.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>I am giving these curlers their starts because they do a great job in terms of speed.</li>
            <li>the felt is great as when I had tested out the ones which were rubbery with bumps it got caught and tangled in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked great for my hair.</li>
            <li>They are great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not happy with this item at all</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I got it.</li>
            <li>All in all a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li>I think these hair rollers are great.</li>
            <li>I got this product in a timely manner, the product worked great..</li>
            <li>my makeup is great.  </li>
            <li>I returned a set of curlers that where cost over $80.00 because I didn&#x27;t like them, these are great for the price.</li>
            <li>Also, the rollers are great</li>
            <li>These work great.  </li>
            <li>Well I am happy I got these.</li>
            <li>i am happy with it will use it a lot</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is great and my hair looks great after using the rollers.</li>
            <li>Like the concept, rollers work great, clamps are a miss for me.</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>its great, had it for a week</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my rollers!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied!!.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love!!</li>
            <li>very nice set of curlers</li>
            <li>The curlers are great, but buy your own clips!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon is amazing but these rollers are just so so!</li>
            <li>I can not get this look even with a nice ceramic curling iron!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to end up loving the way your hair looks!</li>
            <li>In fact, I fall in love with it, as it was my best friend since then.</li>
            <li>you CONAIR, you&#x27;ve always been my best friend wherever I go..  : )</li>
            <li>I have  broke the top shell traveling and dropping it but still works perfect.</li>
            <li>but I saw that they had a fairly good rating and were a great price</li>
            <li>These were well made, great clips, and good reviews.</li>
            <li>Heat up very quickly, and the one size fits all clips work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, plenty of rollers, compact in size but perfect for a head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the rollers, I do not like the clips that came with the set, however I have my own clips and used them they work perfect.</li>
            <li>so these are not that good size wise.  </li>
            <li>and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>it looks good for about 10 mins</li>
            <li>The curler size selection is good -</li>
            <li>I turned it on for a good 45 mins before I used the rollers</li>
            <li>I was and purchased this yesterday with good results.  </li>
            <li>If curling irons have always made you look like abstract art, and not in a good way, and you&#x27;ve resigned yourself to having the hairstyle of an 11-year-old for the rest of your life, don&#x27;t be dis\\&quot;tress\\&quot;ed</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend a good hour or so of quality time with my curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The product seem to be of good quality for the price we paid.  </li>
            <li>They all good.      </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get good curls).</li>
            <li>Still a good set for the cost.</li>
            <li>Good quality for this Price.</li>
            <li>And if nothing else they look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>BUT IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIANCE,</li>
            <li>Always had good experience with Conair products and recommend them.  </li>
            <li>Good curls is a matter of getting a feel for what your hair needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And now the good...</li>
            <li>Also the clip heating feature on this set is a good idea in theory but</li>
            <li>Good and speedy delivery</li>
            <li>They heat up good</li>
            <li>They seem to be just as good as the jumbo ones which we gave 5 stars to.  </li>
            <li>I found a good way to save time was by putting in my rollers and taking them out when I get to my destination.  </li>
            <li>good purchase</li>
            <li>I put these in let them cool, take them out, bam perfect hair.</li>
            <li>I advise buyers to leave the rollers in until they cool for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a very good product, easy to use</li>
            <li>in all, I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>But I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>She seems to be very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Both grand daughters are having a great time with this curler set</li>
            <li>all Im very pleased with this product&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this set of curlers and would recommend.</li>
            <li>and we find that it does an excellent job of providing just the right amount of curl for those occasions when you need it.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and gave me beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>These hot curlers are wonderful.</li>
            <li>If you love your hair curled with all day hold, shine, and bounce these are for you!</li>
            <li>Try it--I think you&#x27;ll love it!  </li>
            <li>i bought them on here, because places like CVS wanted $20 more dollars for them, so the price was a steal!     </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>I would rate this item 400 stars if I could I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not that impressed with the hot rollers either.</li>
            <li>but now I love doing my hair with these!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>These are excellent hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research into hot rollers and which ones would be best for me.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The clips are so cheap!!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I love how her hair looks!</li>
            <li>Love using these!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>The product arrived as the seller stated and was more than what I expeted!</li>
            <li>This is the best hot roller set</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>excellent product, very good, highly recommend, good quality and good price, thanks for the confidence,</li>
            <li>I use it on my synthetic hair and it does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>warm* 3 of these.  </li>
            <li>The clips also stay in nicely.  </li>
            <li>I used to get nice bouncy curls, but now the rollers don&#x27;t hold heat and when I unroll my hair it comes out frizzy, fuzzy and kinky.</li>
            <li>The curls do look nice though.</li>
            <li>I do get nice curls.    </li>
            <li>The rollers did not burn; they were warm but tolerable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
            <li>it does have some curl of its own, but of course not the kind I want.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using my roommate&#x27;s curlers, but wanted to try my own.  </li>
            <li>if I leave them in around 10-15 minutes, I get nice body and some curl.</li>
            <li>Unfortuantely, they were the wire kind (even narrower than these plastic ones), so didn&#x27;t solve my problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many styling tools from Conair that I loved-</li>
            <li>loved the fact that I was able to use these rollers.</li>
            <li>so it says and they&#x27;re flocked so they&#x27;re warm to the touch but not scalding when held.</li>
            <li>I do wish there was some kind of clip storage, but I just kept the box it came in and keep them in there for</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Produces a nice curl</li>
            <li>They stay in my hair quite nicely</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair texture you&#x27;d need to have so that these would work.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I do get a nice curl in the end.  </li>
            <li>My daughter owns a set of these, and I like the way they work -- with the deluxe clips.  </li>
            <li>Nice selection of sizes and helpful guidebook.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this item the one thing that I liked was the fact that Conair said these rollers would not crinkle your hair.</li>
            <li>And the heated areas that are supposed to warm the clips?</li>
            <li>/&gt;*lid doesn&#x27;t clasp shut, it just kind of rests on the unit.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice curler set for the price...</li>
            <li>I find them very easy to use, and my curls stay in, the clips are great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are super easy to use and hold the curl all day!!!</li>
            <li>She said it was the best hot roller she has ever had, including ones costing much more.</li>
            <li>It worked very fast and the results were incredible.</li>
            <li>I am sure this product will be great if you can easily manipulate the clips.</li>
            <li>These hot rollers are the bomb they don&#x27;t get tangled in your fair cool to touch no burns and very nice curl, This was a great purchase</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the review with the new clips: tried them with the meal clips - and they are awesome</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly, and as promised give great shine to the hair.  </li>
            <li>This easy to do my hair &amp; look good</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and do a great job.</li>
            <li>it was very easy to use, heated up quickly, and gave great results.  </li>
            <li>and yes, I will be lookin&#x27; sexy! :)</li>
            <li>This is a great set of hot rollers!</li>
            <li>The best thing about these hot rollers is that they do put super curls in your hair!  </li>
            <li>After the 1st try using the unit on my own, I instantly love it.  </li>
            <li>I am a mom of 2 and this is perfect when I have a busy day.</li>
            <li>This has happened before, but this time  I am not so thrilled with my purchase that I want to pay more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My old set, the Clairol Deluxe hairsetter, lasted 20 years!!!  </li>
            <li>Having heard great things about these I tried them, and while they won&#x27;t curl all my hair, if I knot my hair and then just curl the bottom half, these are great!  </li>
            <li>They are easy to put it (no burning fingers here!).  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is below my shoulders</li>
            <li>With that being said I quickly found out they are AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>and I can easily get the curls I want using these!</li>
            <li>Also, have very fine hair and the plastic clips</li>
            <li>I have VERY fine hair and the clips</li>
            <li>Unless you already own some good clips and you don&#x27;t need the rollers very hot...</li>
            <li>I love these curlers, Got them as a gift as I read they are good for fine hair.</li>
            <li>The counter weight placed against the scalp while using the old style pins keep your curlers in place MUCH BETTER!!!  </li>
            <li>i tried to save money and buy cheap - ended up spending way more money trying to find a good prouct that works.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that this hairsetter creates long shiney waves that help to beautifully frame the face.  </li>
            <li>I thought this heat setter was one of Conair&#x27;s best that came out on the market... much better than the old plastic \\&quot;prickly teeth\\&quot; rollers.</li>
            <li>works great but fingers still get hot at touch</li>
            <li>If you want great curls and don&#x27;t have much time to put into your hair this is the product for you!</li>
            <li>First - these would be great rollers if you&#x27;re looking for tighter curls (not waves), and if you&#x27;ve got shorter hair.</li>
            <li>and it turned out great even with my first</li>
            <li>They work great if I put alot of gell in my hair first.</li>
            <li>So again for my first set, I am happy with them.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly hot and do a great job of putting in a curl that holds.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers are great.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers are great but the clips will not hold my hair</li>
            <li>It is a great machine and heats up quickly and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Besides that I like the product just fine, and I like the curl it gives me hair!</li>
            <li>clips to hold rollers are very cheap, but they work.</li>
            <li>The new clips are just ideal.</li>
            <li>I will try to by separate clips from the store and maybe that will help but have seen better hot roller machines and this one is not that great.</li>
            <li>These rollers smooths all the runaway curls and makes beautiful curls on my bone straight hair on top.</li>
            <li>The flocked surface makes rolling easy and is kind to your hair.</li>
            <li>The holders are easy to put in and effective to hold up the roller.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers work great, really almost too great.  </li>
            <li>Buy it for yourself first, if you find it effective, don&#x27;t forget that YOUR BELOVED ONES DESERVE ONE  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It did work better than the set of conair jumbo rollers, but the curl still fell out.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because I love that it comes with clips and not the metal pins.</li>
            <li>&quot; that will hopefully work better.  </li>
            <li>so glad i got it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the product and plan to use it sometime</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>I WAS GLAD I DID.</li>
            <li>love my curlers except they gave out after year was up 18 mos -</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really love this product and am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>This is an ok set, but I sure wouldn&#x27;t rave about it.</li>
            <li>This product worked better to distribute the heat and lessen the frizz .. because of the heatable metal clamps...</li>
            <li>However, the flocking had worn off, so I was always burning my fingers, plus I had lost most of the pins.  </li>
            <li>I really really enjoy these rollers a lot!</li>
            <li>NO ONE belived I did it myself :)</li>
            <li>They held ok on the sides if you were still.</li>
            <li>I love using them to give me wome height on top, then let the end stay out of the curler</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought them</li>
            <li>Wish it had more mediums.      </li>
            <li>This set is one of the many that I have owned</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this hair setter.  </li>
            <li>The curler holders are so much better than the ol&#x27; days.  </li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>i love this product..</li>
            <li>i am sure you will too...</li>
            <li>I guess they are better than not.</li>
            <li>Conair didn&#x27;t even see fit to give us a zip-lok plastic bag to keep them in, you&#x27;re on your own there.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow I get so many complements when I roll my hair with these rollers.</li>
            <li>I have some cheaper ones that do a better job.  </li>
            <li>I sure wish that the manufacturer had put a disclaimer on the box.</li>
            <li>I have used electric rollers (including Conair) for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>I use a lot of hair spray, but the curl relaxes after 2-3 hours at the most.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used hot rollers and I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>We both love it.    </li>
            <li>and I can see it would work on many hair types.</li>
            <li>I have used many, and never had to throw one away before.</li>
            <li>My favorite curling iron is Conair&#x27;s infiniti curling wand.</li>
            <li>it sure doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>, i just purchased this item at amazon and was glad on delivery too  </li>
            <li>I tried these thinking they might work better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that finally I find these rollers, I tried another brand, and all had  flows, not these.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to return this set and get a Remington one instead with longer, fitted, snap-on clips to hold my hair onto the rollers better.</li>
            <li>The clips that come with this don&#x27;t hold my hair up, in fact for most of the size rollers</li>
            <li>These curlers were definitely not the perfect match.</li>
            <li>The curl does not stay in my hair for more than about 45 mins (if that)</li>
            <li>She is very happy with it, she said she would buy the same model again if needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for many years.</li>
            <li>I AM SURE THEY HAVE HAD TO HAVE SOME LAWSUITS OVER THIS.</li>
            <li>I love this hair curler set.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that all their hairdressers will give me as rewarding results until I tried this year three of their products, which are CONAIR CHV26IX, CS19JCS and CD 160DRCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds curl better than any brand or size curling iron</li>
            <li>I love it for that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The curls hold for most of the day which is more that I can say for the curling iron</li>
            <li>This is more than sufficient to give me curls.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift and recipient was quite pleased, except there is no storage space for the cord or the clips.</li>
            <li>Lovely set of rollers that won&#x27;t stay in my hair with the provided clips.  </li>
            <li>, their material helps to stay in my hair better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the problem some have had with burned fingers because I don&#x27;t let it heat for more than a couple of minutes--</li>
            <li>I love the curlers.  </li>
            <li>Scunci No slip Grip Chunky Clips]]  until i can find some better clips.  </li>
            <li>I have now longer hair and the results looks now better as the curls look</li>
            <li>more natural.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how these would for me...</li>
            <li>and so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Im better off using an iron or wand.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Heated clips seem to give a better set to the curl</li>
            <li>Probably best for short hair.</li>
            <li>better clip system is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I READ MOST OF THE REVIEWS ON HERE</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE</li>
            <li>AND I ACTUALLY ENJOYED PETTING THEM IN</li>
            <li>SURE..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Instant flawless curls!</li>
            <li>I should have done a bit more homework before purchasing these</li>
            <li>however I would have just said to order a better set separately;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that more practice will solve this problem.</li>
            <li>The top is flimsy, and although the cord can be wrapped around the bottom, there is no clip to hold it.  </li>
            <li>I was really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I also like being able to set the heat factor.  </li>
            <li>i will be giving them a neg review for sure.  </li>
            <li>This curler set is awesome becuase it heats up so fast, the curls are great and last all day....</li>
            <li>I have had these for over a year and just love them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Maybe with more practice, I can do better.</li>
            <li>Like lightening fast, which is great if you are in a rush though you can also leave them to heat for longer.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>In fact my hair was MUCH more frizzy after using this than before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned this from my beautician mother and from the many beauticians I&#x27;ve known through my dad&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li>I was wiloing to give this another try with better clips if they would have sent them to me</li>
            <li>Many rollers fall out during use and don&#x27;t keep the roller at your scalp.</li>
            <li>As you use them you can replace them with more clips so they can heat up as well.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>I rather like most about the setter, but my problem is that I can&#x27;t seem to get the roller clamps to hold the rollers in place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to know the answer to my dilemna.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I returned that and ordered this instead.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better if you have some type of body in your hair.</li>
            <li>It stays all day without any hairspray, and I get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>They do not heat in 60 seconds, more like minutes.</li>
            <li>Maybe longer hair would allow them to work better.</li>
            <li>Glad I have them.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>They are OK, but just OK.</li>
            <li>I love, love, LOVE this set.</li>
            <li>When my house burned I had to buy more.</li>
            <li>like to get volume on the top</li>
            <li>i do feel like they could have more grip</li>
            <li>yet.&lt;br /&gt;*hair looks a lot more shiny after using these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it sells for even more on the official conair site than it does here or in store.</li>
            <li>But my grand daughter can use them.</li>
            <li>Just a design suggestion from a user :-)</li>
            <li>I bought these over a year ago and still love them.  </li>
            <li>nice smooth a shiny</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hot rollers!!!</li>
            <li>and they are very gentle on my fine hair which is also great.  </li>
            <li>It is very effective on my straight hair.</li>
            <li>Also there is a nice variety of roller sizes with an good number of each particular size.</li>
            <li>I love the foam cushioning which is very comfortable and my hair is easy to curl around the rollers.  </li>
            <li>It grasps nicely (even to fine hair) and is easy to roll.</li>
            <li>honestly if i had had this set when i got married, i would have used it to style my own hair for the wedding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, made my hair look awesome, big improvement over curling iron.</li>
            <li>The rollers did heat up quickly and it was nice being able to heat up the clips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned these hot rollers for about 10 years and have loved using them.</li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH CONAIR MAKES A GOOD HOT ROLLER</li>
            <li>This is really a good hot roller device.</li>
            <li>Best hot rollers by far!!</li>
            <li>Either way, this is a great product, and I will probably order it again when I need new curlers.</li>
            <li>But they give a nice quick curl.</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed the easy clips</li>
            <li>This new set delivers great curls, and makes my hair look very full with lots of body.  </li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t seem to get very hot, which may be part of the reason they don&#x27;t curl effectively.</li>
            <li>my fine hair (that&#x27;s meant as an adjective, not a self-congratulation) is as healthy as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>The curlers are perfect for my fine hair, the curls stay even with only a light mist of hair spray.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and are very hot to get a good curl  3)</li>
            <li>The concept is great, but the clips are completely inadequate.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Not only the price and the wave came out good, the most amazing thing is.....</li>
            <li>This product offers a great solution for me.</li>
            <li>As far as the clips that come with this set, I guess I am in the minority as I thought having heated clips was a great feature.</li>
            <li>but they seem to be becoming scarce.</li>
            <li>because the curl looks good, lasts a couple of days and they heat up fast.  </li>
            <li>This set is reasonably priced and gives good results.</li>
            <li>loved this hair setter so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get all gussied up very often, but when I do, these new rollers do a great job!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and it curls very nicely and quickly.</li>
            <li>The rollers are perfect because they are not hot to the touch</li>
            <li>but I have no doubts it will exceed my expectations since I&#x27;ve seen the product being used on other people with exquisite results!</li>
            <li>After I have tried other roller and curling irons and nothing compares to this great product!  </li>
            <li>After getting them to cool, i unroll them one by one and voila!</li>
            <li>but, because of the clamps (that I was really excited about) it leaves a crease in your hair at the top of your curl.  </li>
            <li>My wife on the other hand is very happy with them.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to style them into the hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>The curl is nice and shiny and my hair is nice and soft.    </li>
            <li>These are easy to use, except that the clips don&#x27;t always stay on in place, sometimes they want to slip alittle and do not try to bend over as they will unroll with you.  </li>
            <li>For me - with rather average, easy to curl hair - they are great and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>And I have easily curlable hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found these really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>dressing has never been as easy.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using hot rollers and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use and give my hair body.</li>
            <li>My hair breaks and frizzes so easily.</li>
            <li>So easy and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the hair setter is really easy; just plug it in and wait for it to heat up.</li>
            <li>They come in a separate pouch, which means it would be too easy to pack the hair setter and forget the pins.  </li>
            <li>so it curls easily).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>these are sold at a lot of stores so picking up a pack is easy</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Well made and easy to use rollers.  </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest you keep looking.  </li>
            <li>I was able to curl my hair fast, but still have nice curls.</li>
            <li>My hair looks flippy and cute right now because i curled it the night before!  </li>
            <li>These may work well for someone with fine, easy to curl hair-but not for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and dose not hold a curl easily.</li>
            <li>This hot roller set curls hair nicely, but the plastic, heated clips that it comes with leaves crinkles in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was able to take them out with full curls.</li>
            <li>My hair is VERY easy to curl and will HOLD curl all day when the right product is used.  </li>
            <li>For other hair types, or maybe someone more experienced with hair than myself, it works well, heats quickly, sets quickly and is a good brand.</li>
            <li>This is my very own first set, and I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the way my hair comes out with this.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that I have to have permed every 2 months</li>
            <li>This Conair Heat Hair Setter works fine.  </li>
            <li>and they leave a crease in my hair (shoulder length and fine -</li>
            <li>Chose this one because of the number of rollers, the felt covering, and the plastic clips, which I thought would work fine.  </li>
            <li>and I know it will be just fine.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended hot rollers to me, saying they are the best way to get a curl that lasts all day, but the curls I get from this barely last an hour.</li>
            <li>The seller was fine though so no complaints there.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is so fine, the clips wanted to fall out.</li>
            <li>The metal holders work fine</li>
            <li>I have fine baby-like hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is a pain in the butt to curl.</li>
            <li>These rollers do not work well for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Clips leave dents in my fine hair</li>
            <li>Perhaps they work on thicker hair, but I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>They are fairly hot on the edges, but I have yet to find any curlers that won&#x27;t be challenging to handle for more than a minute.  </li>
            <li>My hair (fine) took a lot of rollers</li>
            <li>I found the lid to be just fine.</li>
            <li>I am So glad she&#x27;s enjoying them - I&#x27;ve had hot rollers myself for 25 years and they are a MUST when it comes to style and manageability.</li>
            <li>With my fine hair, the clips never stay in place</li>
            <li>fine hair, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The rollers themselves work fine....</li>
            <li>I loved the convenience of setting my hair while preparing for work &amp; having a full head of curls by the time I am ready to leave for work.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; clips really aren&#x27;t warm after sitting on the warming rack, the spring on the clip wasn&#x27;t that strong</li>
            <li>I love these hot rollers!</li>
            <li>I love it so much !!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these hot rollers!</li>
            <li>My cousin has shoulder length, fine hair and looks amazing after using than the whole set in about 1/2 hour.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And the rollers are HUGE.</li>
            <li>Hot clips used on top of head will leave lines/clip marks after you comb out, so I always use cool clips on top curlers.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was great because now I don&#x27;t have to buy those clips everyone raves about.. BIG MISTAKE !!!      </li>
            <li>It really depends on the weather though which is kind of a no brainer.  </li>
            <li>It stayed secure until I removed them.</li>
            <li>They were light and flexible and held the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li>and they are light when on your head.</li>
            <li>Clips hold securely.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make a nice, defined curl.  </li>
            <li>This is CHEAP JUNK.</li>
            <li>My rollers came with cheap plastic clips that were designed to hold the rollers in place...</li>
            <li>heats up fast and creates nice curls</li>
            <li>With that in mind, I&#x27;d say these rollers would have been fantastic except that I could not keep them in my hair with the provided clips.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Conair, and they were fantastic about it.</li>
            <li>They offered to send me some alternative clips for free.</li>
            <li>On the plus side all of the clips fit all of the curlers</li>
            <li>Silky smooth.</li>
            <li>So I ended up buying just a set of metallic cheap clampy pins to hold them in place.</li>
            <li>I do like that they warm up and fast too, though.</li>
            <li>Light and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>My hair always comes out smooth and bouncy not frizzy.</li>
            <li>That model does a fabulous job and the wire clips keep the curler in place</li>
            <li>if having an ionic setter is important to you, than look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>IT WAS SO CHEAP</li>
            <li>DCONT SEE HOW IT COULD HAVE CURLED ANY BETTER.THE CLIPS THAT SECURE YOUR HAIRNARE</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite its short comings, this hair setter makes great looking curls with practice and patience.</li>
            <li>It does not have an on/off switch, it has a light that comes on when it is on.  </li>
            <li>I had to call CONAIR and struggle with them just to send me 10 clips for free..</li>
            <li>/&gt;The clips do not hold the hair securely.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>Like a light pink/purple pearl.</li>
            <li>mine came with the plastic clips that fit any size of roller.  </li>
            <li>All in all a GREAT product especially for beginners like me!</li>
            <li>I liked the old style better.</li>
            <li>The curl holds nicely even after just ten minutes, and the heated clips are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>They heat up nice and fast but the clips are kind of flimsy and don&#x27;t hold the rollers in place very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that this one is a keeper, though I have also come to the conclusion that so far there is no such thing as a perfect hot roller set for under $50, but this one is pretty close.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even sure I was doing it right.  </li>
            <li>While I have very fine, easy to curl hair, it also worked well on my neice who has very thick-corse hair.</li>
            <li>so I am very dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t recieve what I ordered!!!</li>
            <li>First of all the price of this setter went from $22.77 to over $36.00 in one week&#x27;s time!!</li>
            <li>Overall very nice</li>
            <li>I found this Conair Instant hair set of rollers very nice</li>
            <li>but hold onto some hot \\&quot;u\\&quot; shaped clips I got from ebay to make sure the rollers stay secure...  </li>
            <li>These rollers are easy to use and heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I wanted some quick and easy curls</li>
            <li>While my hair was more voluminous than usual, the staying power (with a setting spray) wasn&#x27;t incredible.</li>
            <li>The good thing about these hot rollers is that they heat up fast and curl one&#x27;s hair well.  </li>
            <li>I bought these rollers because I needed a quick and easy way to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;*these are super easy to use.</li>
            <li>It kind of sags a good inch or so down from the roots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It breaks my heart to read many of the reviews here about this set from women who just love their new \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; set because the ions make it so that the setter does not damage the hair.</li>
            <li>These heat up quickly and are great to use, but with my short hair, I just prefer to use the jumbo rollers.  </li>
            <li>(I would recommend buying a couple sets of Conair Super Clips which are fabulous and hold any size roller securely to your head)</li>
            <li>My wife didn&#x27;t like the product she is used to the clairol hot rollers that she had for many years</li>
            <li>I love the clips get hot too.  </li>
            <li>of curl, smile!</li>
            <li>THe Conair system works fine and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>cool ends are important and the curlers are made well, as well as the clips.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaints about these hot rollers, I love them.</li>
            <li>It is user friendly and harmless to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought the Conair Tourmaline but didn&#x27;t like the clips.</li>
            <li>But the clips leave significant crimp marks, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way around it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many conair hot roller sets I&#x27;ve bought over my life - 10, 15?  </li>
            <li>I love these hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Different clips would be nice!</li>
            <li>I love the rollers as they give me exactly that,  volume and curl that lasts hours</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and I was excited to try these</li>
            <li>It works for now, but the curlers themselves are definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I have used hair rollers since arrival and am pretty well pleased.      </li>
            <li>I bought this product for Wal-Mart for $10 cheaper than Amazon was selling it for, but I still wanted to leave a review because it is a great product it just has one minor hiccup.</li>
            <li>As a matter fact, I rather like the curly at the ends look; it isn&#x27;t as overwhelming as the full-on bounce of when the curls are first set</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth it!</li>
            <li>I have been using hot rollers for many years.</li>
            <li>As far as when you do get one to hold right, the curl comes out nice and if you give yourself some spray, it will turn out ok.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is determined to be straight.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Conair instant heat rollers to replace my old Conair rollers which I was very happy with.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to properly style my own hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that ever worked and that I enjoyed using, up until now, is the Instyler I own.</li>
            <li>This actually works better for me, as I already own a set of all jumbo (1.5 inch) rollers.   </li>
            <li>I only gave it two stars because it DID heat up evenly, and the rollers themselves would be nice in a better \\&quot;house.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly, and rolled smoothly into my hair.</li>
            <li>and they were super easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li>the price is right, the curls come out VERY nice, the rollers and clips don&#x27;t burn your fingers, and it&#x27;s a fast, easy process for cute curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>They get nice and hot, are easy to use and the style stays in for a good long time, even in the hot, humid Texas weather.</li>
            <li>Not like the old hairsetters for sure!  </li>
            <li>Loved these new hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I love that they hold their heat well and heat up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it and wanted the exact same thing but thought it would be nice to have the large and medium sized curlers as well, though I primarily use the jumbo.</li>
            <li>I had the hardest time finding Jumbo curlers, and am glad Conair thought to make a hair setter with mostly large rollers.  </li>
            <li>but it would be gread if it came with a special glove to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;Top</li>
            <li>I had to resort to curling the top layer of my hair with a large barrel</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the clips but have the Conair large clips - they are better.</li>
            <li>The large and medium rollers are okay.  </li>
            <li>Returned them right away, and I would not recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li>But after using it a few times, I&#x27;m impressed at how hot they get.</li>
            <li>I will say that the clips are really not that great</li>
            <li>These are great hot rollers overall.</li>
            <li>I must use sytling spray before rolling and clipping but not inconvenient and the results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I received a similar Conair model that is almost as good.  </li>
            <li>The only thing it lacks are good clips.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall out while you are waiting for them to cool.  </li>
            <li>For someone like me who is clueless about how to style hair, these are a dream come true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always wanted salon finish curls but always dread the time it takes to curl my full head.  </li>
            <li>And their warranty is only good for 30 days.  </li>
            <li>, I wait for them to cool in my head</li>
            <li>I finally got wise, got on line, found another set of Caruso Molecular Rollers and ordered them.  </li>
            <li>I like nice soft \\&quot;even\\&quot; curls.  </li>
            <li>I find the curls last longer and it leaves my hair shiny and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a learning process for me, but overall I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I leave them out for 15 seconds to cool before I put in my hair</li>
            <li>, MOSTLY COOL TO THE TOUCH</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews stating that the good clips don&#x27;t come with the sets offered here, I&#x27;ve decided to actually go to the store and purchase them.   </li>
            <li>I needed curls for my solo, but i need to be able to curl my hair fast.</li>
            <li>fast love that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never even used hot rollers before and wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be the right purchase for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Cons: the lid is kind of fragile which break easily</li>
            <li>you can salvage the outer layers of your hair, the curls created by these hot rollers will last all day and look very nice.</li>
            <li>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t, but my hair came out with just the right amount of curl, smooth and shiny.......</li>
            <li>The rollers were really easy to use and the clips held my hair in place pretty well.</li>
            <li>This hot roller set has a variety of sized rollers and has easy clips.  </li>
            <li>while its amazing that you can heat them also, they barely hold!!</li>
            <li>and they make the most beautiful curls that last all day and into the next even when slept on.  </li>
            <li>Their CS department is second to none, their prices are much better than Folica&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve always been happy with Amazon in general.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and very straight so this did not help much.</li>
            <li>The Hot rollers works fine.</li>
            <li>The old school wire ones works much better and don&#x27;t leave huge dents in my hair.</li>
            <li>The curlers work well and heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>They look nice, love the pink.  </li>
            <li>Though they do heat up quickly, I don&#x27;t care for the clips.</li>
            <li>It is quick.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a quick hair fix.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been curling my hair for over ten years and have tried several curling irons and curler sets inorder to find the perfect match.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, and well.</li>
            <li>I think the curler set contains just the right number of each size of roller -- even better though would be to have two ore large</li>
            <li>This is my first set of hot rollers and I love them.</li>
            <li>This baby heats up really quick, and does the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The rollers don&#x27;t heat as quickly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I also bought the super clips that come in a box of 10</li>
            <li>Quick heat up</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, but the clips do not hold the rollers in place.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly.</li>
            <li>Smaller and hotter curlers left in for a longer time is usually best for my hair.</li>
            <li>They heat up just as quickly as they say.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, I have the kind of hair that wants desperately to be straight, and my curl stays all day with these curlers.  </li>
            <li>After using it, I realize that I would be better off with more rollers that were the same size.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and curl well.  </li>
            <li>I bet the the Revlons pins would help tremendously.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Ok first of all, I have never used any hot rollers before</li>
            <li>These heat up quick and once I was done putting them all in I started to take them out.</li>
            <li>That said, the curlers heat up quickly and release the hair without tangling.  </li>
            <li>I use little to no hairspray at all, and my hair stays beautiful</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them and the clips keep these rollers in much much better than those metal pins.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a great deal for paying less than $25.00 for a true ionic setter.</li>
            <li>However, I dont need to have used hot rollers before to tell you that the plastic ends on the rollers feel super cheap.</li>
            <li>Ordered the Conair Ion Shine instant heir setter which my wife had owned before &amp; was very satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>I have advanced from pin curls, to rollers, and then to hot rollers over the ages.</li>
            <li>Very Hot Curlers.</li>
            <li>I own a couple of different sized curling irons and though i love how they curl my hair, it just takes forever to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>I was unsure about using different sized rollers, but I did some research on how to use them and found that using the largest rollers on top, medium ones in the middle, and smallest on the bottom of my head as advised works great.</li>
            <li>I asked if the company would be willing to send me a set for free since the ones that come with the rollers are inferior and she said, \\&quot;no, they are for sale\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>These are the best, they heat up quick, make nice curls in short amount of time and no static!  </li>
            <li>They are insanely easy to use and heat up super fast.</li>
            <li>I can easily make breakfast, pack lunches, and get kids ready for school and the rollers stay in place.  </li>
            <li>I love these hot rollers so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old and can style my own hair for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>Problem is, 3rd time I used these hot rollers the plastic part of the rollers melted, shorted out the product for good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really procrastinating about buying another set of hot curlers because there may not be any that perform better than these.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re willing to put the effort in, or go buy different clips, it&#x27;s a good set.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and gave almost too much curl.</li>
            <li>A good set of hot rollers, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Its fast and easy and dont burn my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased the product because of my fine hair and looked forward to the SMART Clips keeping the hair on the rollers.</li>
            <li>If they sit more than 10 mins they get pretty hot and burn my fingers, even the clips can get that hot.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be the only one who needs more rollers, they should be easier to get!</li>
            <li>She had never used hot rollers ever and now is HOOKED on them!</li>
            <li>The rollers are great but the clips don&#x27;t hold as tightly as I would like.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t stay in my straight, fine hair, even with the claw clips.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and these rollers</li>
            <li>The rollers get nice and hot very quickly and you don&#x27;t have to keep them in long to get the desired look.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I kept my old clips and they work fine with this set.     </li>
            <li>easy to use,heats super fast very convienient!</li>
            <li>Also it would have been nice if they would have put a little lip on the top lid.</li>
            <li>I would consider myself an special occasion user of hot rollers (maybe 10 times a year).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very frugal of Conair to sell this hair setter with cheap clips.  </li>
            <li>Even when I brush through it a few times it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li>but rather then return the whole set - would they please supply you with the metal version of the clips that fit this model.  </li>
            <li>It claims to heat in an \\&quot;xtreme\\&quot; 3 minutes, and according to the instructions the light will change to notify the user when they&#x27;re ready for use.</li>
            <li>As advertised by many hair curler fans, this product delivered soft voluminous curls.</li>
            <li>so it stays warm longer.. and makes the curl last longer too !!  </li>
            <li>Amazon is good for buying books and not much else.</li>
            <li>I also love how fast they heat up, and how you can roll your head and in 10-15 mins have a whole head of bouncy curls.      </li>
            <li>I like these curlers better than the old style.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I kept the ones from my old set.     </li>
            <li>when I do try and use the clips they leave a big kink in the curl and does not look good especially for the curls on top of the crown.</li>
            <li>This was definately worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>So if your initial turn out isn&#x27;t so good, my advice is to try as much as you can to follow the directions to the T.</li>
            <li>The clips simply don&#x27;t hold --- the pin type are much more secure  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe these are worth the money.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice curl that seems to last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the clips.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if the product delivered actually came with the accessories in the pictures.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>I just bought another set with the old fashioned skinny wire hooks, as most seem to use the clips nowadays</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t think it was worth keeping.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d like to say the reason was because this setter is worth every penny, but I&#x27;d be lying.</li>
            <li>By the time you get back to the 1st clip, it&#x27;s heated quite nicely.</li>
            <li>After this problem was fixed, I don&#x27;t have any more complaints.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this item is they do heat up fast.</li>
            <li>I guess the old metal hooks are better.</li>
            <li>I struggled getting the rollers in place the first few times but the curls turned out beautiful and lasted majority of the day.</li>
            <li>The clips also cause dents near the top of your curls.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law who has long thin hair - this has transformed her hair into a full head of beautiful dazzling curls and she LOVES them.</li>
            <li>but they kind of left a dent on my hair and didn&#x27;t want to stay in place.</li>
            <li>I have used Conair Hot Rollers for 30+ years and didn&#x27;t give a second thought to purchasing this product, as I&#x27;ve always been very satisfied with my Conair products.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice because i use the smaller ones on the sides.</li>
            <li>Every time I do my hair with these I get tons of compliments (without fail) and the best thing is that they are so easy and fast!</li>
            <li>Granted, they burned my fingers by then, but I had certainly gotten my parents&#x27; money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>They heat up super fast, they can get super hot, they have an on-off switch, and they&#x27;ve got \\&quot;cool touch\\&quot; ends (</li>
            <li>It&#x27; the first thing I actually thought made my hair look cute curled!</li>
            <li>Sometimes they curl great, other times not so much.</li>
            <li>These rollers heat up quickly and don&#x27;t get too hot to handle</li>
            <li>Cons - curlers can get super hot, clips can get super hot, clips leave unsightly creases, and don&#x27;t hold hair on the curler</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up super fast!</li>
            <li>I curl my hair everyday, and I love these!!</li>
            <li>I have super stubborn, super straight hair that will not hold a curl.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of hot rollers, and overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Right now hair is shorter</li>
            <li>They just slip right out.</li>
            <li>it seemed to me that I needed 3 hands to do it right.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;velvet&#x27; finish contributes to the curlers sliding right out.</li>
            <li>It does take some experimentation to get the right tempature setting and the length of time needed to get the desired result.</li>
            <li>I put the rollers in my hair and attach the clip and within seconds, the clip is falling off and the roller is rolling right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>this slip right out of my hair.</li>
            <li>The timing was just right.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that the clips fit all the roller sizes because of their design so you don&#x27;t have to search for the right size clip like the older sets.</li>
            <li>but because the clips aren&#x27;t very strong it doesn&#x27;t stay tight and does get hot if touching your face.</li>
            <li>It has been more warm than usual and I am prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that this particular product is no longer available.</li>
            <li>The new clips are much easier to use and rollers felt more secure as opposed to older style of clips.  </li>
            <li>I am asian and have really thinning fine hair and did not want anything that would damage my hair even more or make it fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pros - quick heat, if you leave them on long enough they get good and hot, easy to use, and an on/off switch  </li>
            <li>rught after which it and so much more volume  cause of the nice curls especially when you have a choice of different size rollers in one</li>
            <li>This hot roller set is definitely worth the $25 I paid.  </li>
            <li>They get nice and hot but not so hot that you&#x27;ll end up with third degree</li>
            <li>They barely fit around the rollers, and I find I have to restrict my activities (normal house chores) when wearing them for fear they&#x27;ll fall out.  </li>
            <li>Although i do think that it&#x27;s a minor concern, the product still delivers even with this kind of clamp.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m growing out my hair.. and decided to get the jumbo set (which comes with less rollers and also because the hot clips clamps didn&#x27;t hold the rollers as secure as I&#x27;d have liked.   </li>
            <li>Having used electric hot rollers for many years, I needed to find a set that had bigger rollers, did not catch and break my hair, and heated quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, I am one of those people who never put the time in to type up a review (and a long one at that!), but I&#x27;m in such of a good mood cause of my hair, I just had to!</li>
            <li>The picture looked as if they were large and medium.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer!</li>
            <li>I purchased these earlier this week, b/c I have very straight, very fine, hair and wanted to give it some volume.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that these curlers are wrapped in a soft velvety material that doesn&#x27;t burn your hands to touch like metal, and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair so much as metal seems to burn.</li>
            <li>back to review and purchase another set for a birthday present, that&#x27;s how happy it has made me.</li>
            <li>The rollers are multi-sized so with my current hair style, the different sizes work great.  </li>
            <li>Heats up super fast.  </li>
            <li>The cool touch tips are nice and do help to cut down on the amount of times that you&#x27;ll accidentally touch the roller.</li>
            <li>and she really enjoys them and says they get hot quickly.</li>
            <li>The case is a newer, sleek version of cases past and nice looking and a size that is easy to travel with as well.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product on the magazine, ordered it because the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*it&#x27;s all very fast.</li>
            <li>with all roller sets, if you have very very straight hair, I advise you to use styling products to maintain the curl and body of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the hair setter with the old style of clip which does not work well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair but have used other brands; all with better success.  </li>
            <li>Reading her review nearly put me off buying these, but I find the lid is just fine.</li>
            <li>If I had fine hair, I think I&#x27;d pass on these and go with the old fashioned wire clips.     </li>
            <li>With a little hairspray, you&#x27;re good to go for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Like very much, it does exactly like it says on the website.</li>
            <li>The curls made with the setter are pretty good, but it seems to me that this little appliance was designed by someone who had never used one and had never consulted anyone who did.</li>
            <li>I like the hot rollers, the sizes and the ease of use.</li>
            <li>It makes me easier in the process of curing my hair using the hot roller.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Bravo Conair and thanks for the speedy delivery Amazon !</li>
            <li>w/ the way it works, except the ends are hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>THEY DONT GET HOT</li>
            <li>WHEN I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>I bought it almost a month ago, and it still works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not just these hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I will not be buying another set, I think I&#x27;m going with the BabyLiss hot rollers this time.     </li>
            <li>What I love about the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers is their \\&quot;new\\&quot; way of holding the roller in place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if my hair were longer, I would need the extra heat from the clip.</li>
            <li>and they come with the hot clips (\\&quot;u\\&quot; shaped bent metal clip)..     </li>
            <li>First off...  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because there is no heat setting on the machine</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I have had a set of Conair hot rollers that lasted me for 10+ years.  </li>
            <li>When the Hot Rollers arrived, there is no ON/OFF switch.  </li>
            <li>are hot...</li>
            <li>Especially if you try to roll on the top of your head.  </li>
            <li>This is my first hot roller..</li>
            <li>, they are my first ones I have ever gotten</li>
            <li>I mostly use the larger rollers, since my hair is longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>When I first pull them out</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost Delta Burke in the first season of Designing Women</li>
            <li>I find this product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>If anyone has any ideas on a quality set of hot curlers please share?</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!  </li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t get that hot even in that amount of time.  </li>
            <li>So I thought I&#x27;d try hot rollers.    </li>
            <li>I bought this set because I was looking for hot rollers that had multi sized rollers and the tourmaline ceramic rollers caught my eye.  </li>
            <li>The thing I like about hot rollers is they are easier than just a curling iron and then having to roll the curl backup and bobby pin until time to comb out hair.  </li>
            <li>It will make it a real pain when I travel and have to figure out a place to store the clips so I don&#x27;t lose them!</li>
            <li>Edges of rollers pretty hot to handle, too.</li>
            <li>I used them for 3 weeks and not once did the curl last for more than an hour.  </li>
            <li>BE AWARE that the roller diameters they give you on the box seem to be for the plastic ENDS of the rollers, which are wider than the barrels you roll your hair on, so</li>
            <li>The rollers get plenty hot, but the clips are a pain to use and don&#x27;t hold.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had purchased the jumbo rollers with the regular metal clips that hold better.  </li>
            <li>The rollers don&#x27;t get too hot to touch</li>
            <li>Also the edges of the curlers are too hot for my scalp.</li>
            <li>This is the first set of hot curlers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>and I are still doing a lot of bonding and the hot curlers</li>
            <li>Since the rollers don&#x27;t feel hot to the touch</li>
            <li>The wife used the item several times after the purchase and was pleased with the results every time and even started curling the children&#x27;s (girls) hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before</li>
            <li>My only con is that I have A LOT of hair, and I could have used one or two more rollers.  </li>
            <li>I have never use hot rollers before.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>In fact, I can&#x27;t keep MOST rollers in my baby-fine hair, so this was not a big shock.  </li>
            <li>The rollers get plenty hot (hotter than the alternative set I got) and there&#x27;s an included pouch to store the clips in.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair had so much more volume when I pulled the rollers out--a big advantage.</li>
            <li>I am ready to reveal my curls to everyone else!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s too curly when I first take it out.</li>
            <li>First of all, my rollers came with the fishy shaped looking clips.  </li>
            <li>You can control how hot they get with a heat setting (1-12).</li>
            <li>I often set my hair in these hot rollers, and then do my makeup and dressing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as though I&#x27;m a first time hot curler user.</li>
            <li>My first try took 15 minutes to get three rollers in</li>
            <li>, I bought the first hairdresser from CONAIR - hair setter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I anticipated and is working well.</li>
            <li>I used a trick my sister showed me - to push them towards the scalp first and then rotate them upwards to hold them in place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can set your hair really fast!</li>
            <li>this is like many mini curling irons in your hair at the same time.</li>
            <li>The lovely curls are definitely marred by the marks.</li>
            <li>I love these rollers, especially the variable heat setting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen an alternative hot roller set until Caruso, so I&#x27;m gonna give those a try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers for probably 25 years, but now that I&#x27;m going to look for a job again and want some variety in my look (and for going out too), so I bought these.</li>
            <li>Included in the box, is an order form for ordering more rollers in various sizes!</li>
            <li>It works fast &amp; efficient!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay overall.</li>
            <li>I got the hot rollers as a Christmas gift (2013).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Been using hot rollers for 30 years.  </li>
            <li>the tips make sure you are not constantly burning yourself.  </li>
            <li>my hair stylist suggested using velvet hot rollers for styling.</li>
            <li>These are the first set of rollers I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>End of rollers are a bit hot when rolling your hair onto the roller&lt;</li>
            <li>the felt every time ue pu it on the hot rollrs</li>
            <li>I like the material on the roller to help protect my hair from getting too hot.</li>
            <li>They actually work much better than the clips that come with the Hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I love the low price as well as the look of these.</li>
            <li>I have to use my old wire clips to to secure rollers.</li>
            <li>I paid much more for it than I would have had I purchased the same set here.</li>
            <li>I love how the rollers and clips are both heated to add extra setting power for the hair.</li>
            <li>and  holds a curl pretty well.   </li>
            <li>The curlers get TOO hot.</li>
            <li>I had to order some larger clips just to make sure the curlers stayed in place.</li>
            <li>I have two sets of these hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I wish someone would make a hot roller set with all 1-1/4</li>
            <li>I purchased this Conair Hot Roller Set because you stated it had a on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>unfortunately it&#x27;s not JUST the clips....</li>
            <li>yourselves a favor and spend the extra $10 on another set of better rollers.</li>
            <li>first of all, do NOT buy this from amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have never used hot rollers before</li>
            <li>These rollers melted - so bizarre - clearly defective.</li>
            <li>It would be consistent, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first I&#x27;ve tried hot rollers.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is not ionic and it does not control frizz.</li>
            <li>I like the design of the smooth rollers, unlike the old school hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>like velvet rollers that get HOT but protect my fingers and ears and</li>
            <li>/&gt;These plastic butterfly style clips don&#x27;t hold the curler in place so all I get is some wimpy end curl and not the volume at the root that drive me to set my hair in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I tried them and first of all, the rollers got so hot they burnt my head.</li>
            <li>I used a setting spray for hot rollers and tried spraying my hair to keep the curl in but to no avail.</li>
            <li>I got these at a local drug store, and I love them.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, This was the first hot rollers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>,the clips get hot too, I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Need higher heat</li>
            <li>The set comes with enough clips as well (more than 3).</li>
            <li>The rollers literally fell out my first time using them.</li>
            <li>They get so hot</li>
            <li>So much faster for me than using a curling iron!</li>
            <li>it seems like way too many sets out there have massive curlers</li>
            <li>sooo pretty.</li>
            <li>i love that i dont have to sleep on a wet head full of curlers or a sock bun to get the look that i want.</li>
            <li>Package arrived on time and was g exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anyone who has the different lengths of hair for which this mish-mash of sizes would be appropriate.  </li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying Hot Rollers off line.  </li>
            <li>I love \\&quot;big hair\\</li>
            <li>I love all the various sizes</li>
            <li>Hot rollers have been around forever, I really don&#x27;t understand why manufacturers cannot get it right.</li>
            <li>These hot rollers are amazing :) I have long thick stubbern hair and this is the only thing that gives me gorgeous curls.</li>
            <li>If you are lucky enough to get the clips to work, be prepared to sit very still until the rollers are cool!</li>
            <li>This problem is easily solved by purchasing clips separately ($1-$3 for a set of 4) at any general merchandise store.</li>
            <li>After that, I just let it sit and cool for about 10 to 15 minutes, all at the comfort of being able to do other things like do my makeup or watch TV.  </li>
            <li>Which I work in a humid hot area where most hair will fall flat within an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Conair extreme gives me big beautiful curls for days.  </li>
            <li>The set is compact and attractive, and there are more than enough rollers included to set my thick, straight, just-past-shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>Because of the smooth texture, I was able to wrap as much or as little hair around the rollers to work with my style.</li>
            <li>Other then that the curls stay for hours and they are nice and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I went back to using hot curlers that are just plastic which get much hotter and works much better in curling my hair</li>
            <li>Based on what other reviews have said, results depend on the kind of hair</li>
            <li>I use them to give body to my straight long hair and none of the sizes were suitable for that.</li>
            <li>Even though they do get hot fast, too hot to touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll preface this review by saying that I have been using hot rollers for over 20 years -- pretty much every day.  </li>
            <li>Related to this, good curls take a lot of time (though this depends on the length of your hair) and definitely a lot of patience.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and there are different size rollers which is perfect for my hair style, the only drawback is sometimes the rollers are a little hot to handle.  </li>
            <li>I guess the temperature gauge would be useful to some, but I just leave it on the &#x27;high&#x27; setting.</li>
            <li>I tried these because reviews seemed generally positive.  </li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d give these guys a try (after reading a multitude of positive reviews).</li>
            <li>First I could not believe it, it is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I can take the first roller out, it works that fast.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast, and are EVENLY hot.  </li>
            <li>I really like my xtreme hot rollers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think that&#x27;s pretty much all i can say about it.</li>
            <li>I use a small amount of mousse and in fifteen to twenty minutes I have a gorgeous style.  </li>
            <li>My curls where so soft and full of body</li>
            <li>Whoever thought of these new clips hasn&#x27;t used hot rollers before!  </li>
            <li>I like to get a nice tight roll with the roller right up next to my scalp and then secure the roller when I set my hair.</li>
            <li>have very fine hair and not much of it.</li>
            <li>My very hair is fine, but very thick &amp; straight-so the curl lasts about 2 hours at best, and that&#x27;s with spray or other holding product.  </li>
            <li>If I roll the curls high enough on top of my head</li>
            <li>plastic that is easy to crack or break off, so be cautious when flipping it back and forth.</li>
            <li>After heating the first time, one of the rollers won&#x27;t even fit back onto the heating element.</li>
            <li>I suggesst thought that you heat it up for a pretty good time at least for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t nearly strong enough to hold your hair in place.</li>
            <li>I think I will really enjoy these once I get used to the dry heat, and they do get hot!</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like about it is that the clips are too large for the curlers, which means the curlers don&#x27;t stay rolled up all the way.</li>
            <li>The box for these rollers says it includes jumbo, large &amp; medium rollers.  </li>
            <li>The large ones are</li>
            <li>&quot; as advertised, the set came with large plastic clips which leave noticeable crimps in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The largest are not jumbo size but large.</li>
            <li>The set comes with \\&quot;8 jumbo, 6 large, 6</li>
            <li>However, I find myself wishing I had purchased the one with all large rollers.</li>
            <li>Three of the smart clips are located in the case and heat up with the curlers.  </li>
            <li>conair needs to design a clip that works on large rollers.</li>
            <li>My light never changed, so for the first few weeks I was rather perplexed as to when to start using the rollers.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had better clips from my older little conair hot roller and these now work like a charm.</li>
            <li>Several just slipped right out as I tried to secure them, even with small amounts of hair and they hung down instead of more secured to the scalp like they should for optimum curls.</li>
            <li>They look like they will be nice, but they don&#x27;t hold the hair quite as tight as I would like, and they leave a dent every.</li>
            <li>I had an older large set of hot rollers to compliment this set.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t generally have a lot of trouble with rollers falling out, these are otherwise very nice.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t heat up as good at all, and I didn&#x27;t like the smaller rollers,or the new style clips, so I sent it back too.</li>
            <li>There is a higher end model which is the Conair Ion Shine, and that particular model IS an ionic setter.</li>
            <li>These rollers are merely large, not JUMBO, but they don&#x27;t give curl so much as wave.</li>
            <li>, well, it actually gets hot pretty quickly, you just need to heat it for 5 minutes or so and it will be ready.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d be smart and get around this by putting the clip on the space left by a roller when I removed it, but that was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>She said she really liked them but that the top broke off and that makes it difficult to travel with them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While these do give a nice curl towards the bottom, the top looks all wrong.</li>
            <li>but I couldnt get ready for work with them.  </li>
            <li>it worked really well, the way it was supposed to work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I purchased these rollers so save time getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this.</li>
            <li>They are really flimsy and won&#x27;t hold rollers in very well.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>I give it 2 stars because it does heat up fast.  </li>
            <li>Also, the clips do not hold your hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>your hair is ready..</li>
            <li>To me that&#x27;s like selling a vase that doesn&#x27;t hold water very well.  </li>
            <li>They heat up fast and the curl stays all day.</li>
            <li>the velvet rollers don&#x27;t burn my finger tips, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair when I remove them</li>
            <li>That covering is very &amp;quot;chintzy&amp;quot;</li>
            <li>They heat up quite fast and I like the variety of sizes.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m stuck with something I probably won&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>They heat up really fast.  </li>
            <li>and she had much thicker hair than I do.  </li>
            <li>Also, invest in some of the cheap, old fashioned style pens that will hold the rollers in more firmly.</li>
            <li>They really do give my a hair a \\&quot;bounce\\&quot;, that it did not have before.  </li>
            <li>I bought this set  because my hair--thick, absolutely straight and body-less, but very fine--would not hold curling-iron curl.  </li>
            <li>The reason I keep the curlers is because my hair is waist length and pin straight.  </li>
            <li>I really like the clips.</li>
            <li>Now, I can transform myself between straight &amp; wavy any time I want without spending fortune to go to a hair dresser.</li>
            <li>The clips also didn&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li>I used it about ten times in 7 weeks and now the cheap plastic switch doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li>I use to spend almost 45 minutes curling my whole head with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>i rally really like this</li>
            <li>I really like Conair rollers.</li>
            <li>They leave a much tigher curl than I want.</li>
            <li>This product allowed me to put gentle curls in that stayed.</li>
            <li>The clips don&#x27;t work very well if at all, letting the rollers fall out of your hair.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t like these.  </li>
            <li>I will try to find someone who really does not want to have curly hair and give them this set....</li>
            <li>My hair is medium length and straight.</li>
            <li>These are so fast.</li>
            <li>They heat up in about 2 minutes and they&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li>IT IS VERY INFERIOR</li>
            <li>Replacement clip sets would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a 4.5 because my hair does curl very well.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to get up 3 hours before to get ready.</li>
            <li>I really like the Conair Ion Shine hair setter.  </li>
            <li>Thanks anyway    </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Takes much longer than 85 secs to heat up</li>
            <li>I wanted these ones as they are multisided, heated up fast and they have the felt material over the roller.</li>
            <li>Normally I would use the hot electric curlers</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to friends, it really can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay in very well.</li>
            <li>So, with budget out the window, I shelled out the $63.90 with free 2nd day Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Because these did not work very well for me</li>
            <li>My only problem with the product is that the clips don&#x27;t fit around the curlers so it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair in place.</li>
            <li>In 5 minutes I have my hair ready.</li>
            <li>Much easier than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>and really there&#x27;s just a blunt edge to them which leaves a dent/crease in each curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks for the reviews, you have saved me some headaches.</li>
            <li>so you can really customize your style.  </li>
            <li>I do wish there were some jumbo size rollers in this set, and I don&#x27;t really like the clips that come with it.  </li>
            <li>but I could be putting in too much hair.  </li>
            <li>They do not hold the curlers in place very well at all.</li>
            <li>you soooooooooooo much.</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up really fast.</li>
            <li>Better than expected...</li>
            <li>also the butterfly clips work very well.</li>
            <li>I really looked around and studied up before buying this.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much happier</li>
            <li>The color is much softer than pictured.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast, within about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks all for telling me that fact.</li>
            <li>Also, the clips leave dents; I much prefer the wire holders.  </li>
            <li>The heat is too much for the plastic on the bottom of the rollers.  </li>
            <li>This set does heat very well</li>
            <li>Hair is ready to go in five minutes, start to finish.</li>
            <li>but i find that i dont really have a problem with the clips that everyone complains about.</li>
            <li>, it costs too much.</li>
            <li>I really like it and praise the thought that went into the design.</li>
            <li>I was very disapponted.  </li>
            <li>This would make it much easier to go in and out to repeatedly put clamps on the warmer rungs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be taking a perm by end of the year, so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see if the fluff will stay on longer after the perm.</li>
            <li>heats up fast.</li>
            <li>These heat up fast.  </li>
            <li>Finally, and this is just personal preference, but it would be nice if the cord could be wrapped underneath for storage.</li>
            <li>I can use different combinations of roller sizes to come out with a bunch of different looks which is really nice.</li>
            <li>&quot; so this makes it nice &amp; fluffy after i take the rollers out.</li>
            <li>They also didn&#x27;t seem built to hold a decent amount of hair on the curler, it was just kind of a mess.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been very impressed with my hair (which is pretty dry and unhealthy</li>
            <li>The big plasic clips made the rollers super easy to remove and left no marks on my hair.    </li>
            <li>Love how my hair looks &amp; good for a lazy day since little work involved</li>
            <li>I read the negative reviews about the clips not holding very well, and I can tell you I experienced the same issue at first too.</li>
            <li>The different sized barrels are great for long and short hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many from other brands but none worked with me and gave me salon results as CONAIR</li>
            <li>I purchased other U-shaped clips as they work better for me.  </li>
            <li>The end result is beautiful bouncy curls that last all day (I have really thick straight hair so for me</li>
            <li>I really like this product of Conair , its 3 different sets of sizes is suitable for different lengths of hair.</li>
            <li>The other thing I like to do is spray some hairspray while the rollers are in and with these clips is covers most all of the hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine streight hair shoulder length hair and after using the product for a week, I found the cutlers did not get hot enought for my hair to keep the curl, no matter how long I left them in.</li>
            <li>The packaging/instructions say they heat up in a few seconds - this is also not true - I would give them 5 minutes or more to reach a good heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because the edges aren&#x27;t raised, I found that my hair both slipped off the roller, and got caught in the gap where the roller sits onto the heating element - although that might possibly be solved by using the right clips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it works fine, but not so satisfy with it being used when it suppose to be brand new</li>
            <li>My hair is silky and the older pins just didn&#x27;t stay in very well.</li>
            <li>The clips that secure the rollers get quite hot, so be careful where you place them on your head.</li>
            <li>The curlers have been better on my hair than the hot iron I was using everyday.  </li>
            <li>These rollers do a good job of curling my hair, and I like the three sizes, but the unit has some serious design flaws:  1)</li>
            <li>They feel very familiar because of the other set I have...</li>
            <li>i wash my hair at night - come it out and let it dry naturally to elimate in static.  </li>
            <li>I have also used it on my daughter&#x27;s fine long hair too!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get a smooth curl with these, although the curl doesn&#x27;t hold all that long anyway.  </li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;m in this long hair phase I will enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and it usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl long, but these work great on</li>
            <li>My mom owns an old conair hot rollers set which was dual voltage</li>
            <li>The hot rollers give my hair shiny, voluminous, and soft &amp;#34;romantic&amp;#34; curls.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I needed to replace the molecular curler set that finally wore out after about 12 years of tried and true service.  </li>
            <li>I simply open the plastic cover on that side to cool them a bit.</li>
            <li>Even though the indicator dot turns white in about a minute, the rollers are still quite cool.</li>
            <li>(The metal clips I already own are too small and shoot across the bathroom when I try to use them with this</li>
            <li>This is by FAR the poorest quality set of hot rollers I have ever bought.      </li>
            <li>The hot rollers do the job, except I use the clips from my old Remington set.</li>
            <li>I leave them in until they cool and then resist combing for my hair for until the last minute.</li>
            <li>The heat of the rollers is not as hot as my old Clairol Travel set</li>
            <li>so I use my old clips that look like claws instead that came with my hot shot rollers.</li>
            <li>My old one died after four years, and I got a new one right away.  </li>
            <li>The rollers never seem to get really hot, and the clips only fit properly on the large size rollers.  </li>
            <li>The plastic case covering over the rollers as you heat them should stay down to create the appropriate environment for the ion process to work.</li>
            <li>When I first opened up the box to this set of hot rollers, I though it was not going to last me long because it seemed cheap.</li>
            <li>- I usually use the &#x27;jumbo&#x27; and &#x27;medium&#x27; rollers from my other set, and these create good volume and nice loose curls.</li>
            <li>I just have to say that I like this new technology, with the fast heat up, the ionic ceramic rollers and the slit in the clips.</li>
            <li>The 3 sizes that this set comes with works for more of a shoulder length (or slightly longer)</li>
            <li>This all took less than 10 minutes and with practice, I&#x27;m sure would take about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Clips are easy to use,  but not very stable.  </li>
            <li>I am Asian so my hair straightens out really quickly</li>
            <li>The curls last all day and look even better the next day.  </li>
            <li>So, if you need to use a particular size again that isn&#x27;t the one with the dot</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what Conair was thinking trying to replace the clips for the curlers, these clips are no comparsion to the older claw clips and metal clips.  </li>
            <li>If you like big dents and ridges in the top of your hair left by the roller clips, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>In addition to my super fine hair, I have lots of layers, which usually don&#x27;t work with rollers.</li>
            <li>I purchased these hot rollers this past February in anticipation of some formal occasions coming up, and was pleased with the results they gave.    </li>
            <li>The curlers were not as thick as my last set, but they seem to work great.  </li>
            <li>Just a suggestion I think most people would prefer a regular address to send back returns.    </li>
            <li>I still have my older clips, so it worked out for me.</li>
            <li>The traditional electric roller pins are available on Amazon and the soft covering on this product&#x27;s curlers</li>
            <li>I bought my first Conair Hot rollers similar to this one which I used for over 25 years.</li>
            <li>It comes with only 3 clips which isn&#x27;t enough if you want to use more than three rollers at a time.</li>
            <li>They are too small and more importantly don&#x27;t get anywhere near hot enough.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to replace it with the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Hot Rollers, since I was interested in curlers that would heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to use hot rollers in the past.</li>
            <li>I was wary because of the lid comments, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be pleased.</li>
            <li>is more than enough to do my entire head.</li>
            <li>I did it because I had pins from an older set of rollers that I assumed would work.  </li>
            <li>I cannot use the ones included and do have to use older pins.  </li>
            <li>Conair Ion Shine rollers are very easy to use, take very little time (five to 10 minutes to heat, a few minutes to roll, and about 10 minutes running around the house looking like Medusa while they set) and the results are gorgeous, natural-looking and last all</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and flat with a bit of natural wave-I never knew what to do with it</li>
            <li>They fit fine on the bigger rollers, but they are still much too narrow to keep my super-straight hair from unwinding off the roller.</li>
            <li>I do have to use a little hair spray because I have very straight, baby fine shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>However, the sizes of the curlers are quite small and would be good for short hair in a very curly style.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken good care of my set, I never leave it on or forget to turn it off for long periods, and I can&#x27;t imagine it wearing out so quickly, especially because I only use them maybe twice a week.</li>
            <li>The first few uses, I found that they worked OK if I let them heat up a LONG time (20+ minutes or more) and left them in a LONG time (until the rollers were completely cool).  </li>
            <li>the clips do not hold tight to your head and on top of that the container holds 3 in with curlers and the remaining ones have to be put in a zip lock bag which means we would misplace at some point</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want tight curls against my head, I like the look of curls and waves more towards the lower 2/3 of my now shoulder-length</li>
            <li>I would recommend these highly.  </li>
            <li>My ancient Clairol curlers, made in the 70&#x27;s, lasted throughout high school, college, and graduate school.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this  roller set as it was from Conair.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>The clips won&#x27;t secure your hair very well if you roll it the other way.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set at Target yesterday and was excited to give it a try today as my old set from the 70&#x27;s finally stopped working.</li>
            <li>They put a large crimp in my hair near my scalp.  </li>
            <li>maybe something a little better since it has the Conair name on it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely sure that one of those little clippy deals is still stuck in a potted plant or embedded in plaster somewhere.  </li>
            <li>Spend a little bit more and get professtional ionic curlers.</li>
            <li>Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for a healthier alternative, and I ended up purchasing these hot rollers!</li>
            <li>These clips are too small; do not hold the rollers securely, and they are made of hard plastic which is not the most comfortable material.</li>
            <li>I have an older version that I needed to replace and the quality of this new set</li>
            <li>They were SO much easier to use than the ones with metal clips, they go in fast, come out fast, and I definitely had lots of body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick plastic, but I don&#x27;t see any need to be any thicker than it is....</li>
            <li>THE CLIPS SUPPLIED ARE USELESS, THEY FLY OFF THE ROLLER OR DON&#x27;T HOLD AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>This hair setter has a few short comings, but is still an overall great product.</li>
            <li>They hold OKAY but not fabulously.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands for decades - these rollers have a few issues</li>
            <li>I purchased these guys after the heating element on my last set of hot rollers broke; there weren&#x27;t a lot of options at retail, and these looked gentle and like the clips would hold.  </li>
            <li>The roller set is quick to heat and there are enough rollers for my hair (just past shoulder length, pretty fine, lots of layers).</li>
            <li>When I the curlers cool completely before removing them, my hair stays curly - even the next morning!</li>
            <li>Curling irons were just taking too long, so for the first time in years I decided to try hot rollers again.  </li>
            <li>but they are too heavy so not being able to \\&quot;anchor\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I spend few minutes to use them and I leave them for at most 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you are just looking to throw a few rollers in the bottom for wave or on the top for volume, this set might work for you.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever return items because it&#x27;s such a hassle.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I tried, the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds.</li>
            <li>rollers themselves are good, but not great</li>
            <li>This set does a wonderful job on my hair which goes down to the middle of my back with long layers and is naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li>curlers turn out okay, for the most part, if you can put up with the hassle and don&#x27;t mind them feeling all loose and shaky all over  your head.</li>
            <li>Once I started to hook it up and everything it heated up quite quick, but it made this sound like it was working really hard to heat the rollers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and it seems to work fine for other people on here.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no hard spiky bumps on the curlers.  </li>
            <li>I use the Conair super clips which I bought separately instead, would use my old wire clips if only I could find them.</li>
            <li>They actually work pretty well, so I found out that I don&#x27;t need to leave them in as long as I originally thought I did.</li>
            <li>So i have some other plastic clips that have a straight edge rather than rounded like these &amp; they seem to hold on better to the big rollers.</li>
            <li>A big one right on front that you couldn&#x27;t miss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start out by saying I was skeptical when I opened the box and felt the rollers which were very light and cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li>At this point, whether I heat them for five minutes or 25 minutes, I only wind up with a few curls, and most rollers don&#x27;t even heat enough to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hardly a professional, and was hoping hot rollers would be simple enough that I could set, cool, and go.</li>
            <li>I have a much older version of hot rollers that I have to replace after about 10 years and thought this would be the same thing as what I had.</li>
            <li>I wanted something better than foam rollers (which always made my curls too tight and took forever!)</li>
            <li>The clips fit the medium and large rollers, but the rollers still flop around on your head and are not secure at all.  </li>
            <li>The unit should come with the SMART Clips(Plastic Clips) but instead is supplied with cheap wire clips that do not secure your hair.</li>
            <li>I have really thick fine hair that takes forever to blow dry and style, so to be able to just throw it up in curlers while I do</li>
            <li>Big improvement over the old hot rollers!</li>
            <li>They do not pull your hair, I was expecting larger rollers, but they do create a nice look, my hair is a little longer than shoulder lenght.</li>
            <li>I have used the same hot curlers for 30 years because none compared to the high heat.  </li>
            <li>However, one of the reasons I ordered this was because of the new types of clips that was advertised in the product description.</li>
            <li>Also, I live in the Philippines</li>
            <li>though it looks brand new</li>
            <li>and I was in need of a new set, since after a while the cushioning comes off and it burns the hair.</li>
            <li>I would want to return this item and get 100% refund or change to a new item.</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the steam rollers, but couldn&#x27;t find any new ones.</li>
            <li>for this new set...</li>
            <li>and I decided to get a new set.</li>
            <li>I pinned up the top half of my hair (crown and bangs) and curled the back and sides, let them sit for about a minute, took those out, clipped that section to the side and took down the top of my hair... curled those and again, once the rollers were all in</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and  only takes 10 minutes to have a very curly hair.</li>
            <li>There are many videos teaching you how to take advantage of the open center.</li>
            <li>I have loooong thick straight healthy hair, and these rollers do not grip or curl well.</li>
            <li>I liked the claw clip rollers from my jumbo set and the old metal rollers from my previous set ( Loaned to my sister and never got it back).    </li>
            <li>so I am being extra careful not to break the top.</li>
            <li>In the 3rd or 4th months, the clips began slipping, and now the only ones that hold are the jumbos, which are really too big to do me any good.  </li>
            <li>I bought the smaller roller set because I recently cut my hair for the  spring/summer so the larger diameter set doesn&#x27;t really have enough hair to hold in nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have a feeling these curlers work best with average hair that doesn&#x27;t go to far in either the super thick or super thin direction.</li>
            <li>Within the second month, one of the rollers became too hot to handle comfortably; now 3 release so much heat that my fingers burn when I use them, just like the ancient ones that would drip wax after a few years--not months.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight Asian hair - these clips do not hold the roller.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re even easy enough to use in a rush, so long as I plug them in ahead of time.</li>
            <li>The dot on the curlers turned white within the alloted time frame, but the curlers were not all hot and still had to wait 15 minutes.      </li>
            <li>Not to mention, there are too many small size curlers.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t recommend this product if you have a lot of hair because there&#x27;s not enough hot rollers</li>
            <li>Also, does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I used the largest barrels on the top roll of hair and medium on the sides and small barrels for the rest of my head.</li>
            <li>I may take them back to get a more expensive set that will do a better job.</li>
            <li>I have been using hot rollers since I was a teen.  </li>
            <li>The rollers don&#x27;t sit on pegs, they have a slit through the middle and you slide it onto a bar across the case, and that is how the roller heats, which is why it probably doesn&#x27;t get that hot.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>First - no blue clips came with it, as advertised.  </li>
            <li>either so no more burned fingers :-)</li>
            <li>these Conair hot rollers, it only takes me about 7 to 10 min prepping time to put all the rollers in my hair!</li>
            <li>I suspect this is because they do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>Prior to this I owned a Clariol hot roller set for 20 years before it died.  </li>
            <li>Also wanted to order more small rollers but could not find them on your website or on Conair.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get or stay hot enough to cure.</li>
            <li>have impossible-to-curl hair (have done 3 in home perms with my hair looking exactly the same as to when I started them).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple different hot rollers</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended For Hot Rollers Only.</li>
            <li>The rollers do not get hot enough for the curl to stay.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hot enough by then.</li>
            <li>I let them sit about 30 seconds before begining to take them out, starting from the first one I put in.</li>
            <li>The different sized rollers have to be placed exactly the way the set comes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The actual curlers can sometimes be too hot to touch both when they come out of the heater and even after you put it in your hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t feel like they got hot enough to do anything.  </li>
            <li>I tried 2 different hot roller sets (Conair, Revlon) before arriving at this one.</li>
            <li>The plastic clips get REALLY hot and if you manage not to burn your fingers when you pick them up you&#x27;ll definitely feel the heat if they happen to touch your neck or ear.</li>
            <li>Though considering the other 2 sets I&#x27;ve tried this one definitely comes out on top.</li>
            <li>First I purchased a very similar item but that did not have the on and off</li>
            <li>Gets hot enough.</li>
            <li>so if yoy have naturally wavy/curly hair be cautious!</li>
            <li>this unit is pretty massive</li>
            <li>it pretty enough to leave out, it  heats up&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like a solid roller, but I was willing to give these a try.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>And the top doesn&#x27;t flip back like some of the other readers said, mine stays upright (for now)</li>
            <li>Gets pretty hot &amp; helps your curls get fast &amp; firm.  </li>
            <li>Indicator light for hot rollers too dull.</li>
            <li>The roller heats up fairly quickly, but can get a little too hot, so I usually open one side of the cover when I&#x27;m ready to roll.</li>
            <li>I found  that I did not like the new version as well as the old.  </li>
            <li>During my first and subsequent attempts, I was able to maintain my curls and my hair was less frizzy than when I use regular rollers.</li>
            <li>The clips also did not secure the rollers onto my head as every time I moved the clips allowed a lot of movement and some would easily fall out.</li>
            <li>Also, while I really liked the concept of heated clips, they were difficult to handle b/c they were so hot.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the same exact clips that came with my old roller set.</li>
            <li>I finally got a chance to use them for the first time today and all I can say is WOW.....</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter that they only give you enough room to place 3 at a time on the heating elements, because as you take one off to use, just replace it with a cool one.</li>
            <li>I asked about obtaining a set of metal clips that are similar to the old fashioned hot roller clips and she offered to sell them to me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other kind of clip other than what is sold with the set.</li>
            <li>(but i have super thin, fine</li>
            <li>heat on bothsides was a good idea but not for long thick hair.</li>
            <li>There are too many small and not enough large rollers for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It does not heat up as fast and whereas the old had a high and low setting this</li>
            <li>only reason I gave it a 4 is that they are very hot in your hand making it more difficult to apply when you lack hot roller experience.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price; however the clips dont secure the hair tightly around the rollers as i have seen in more expensive sets</li>
            <li>I have fine to average hair that hits just below my shoulders and usually holds a curl easy, with these rollers my hair had lost 100% of the curl after just 60 minutes and</li>
            <li>I ordered the Conair Shine Instant Heat Hair Setter which was the same hair setter I had purchased a few years ago, because I was very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>The adjustment on the heat setting allows for a wide range of heat, with the highest setting getting very hot.  </li>
            <li>Being able to work with multiple curls make it slight faster than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Usually the curls fall out of my hair pretty quickly</li>
            <li>never would have guessed but these made my (usually) inbetween-textured, usually dull hair, look and feel SO GOOD!</li>
            <li>Even running a hair brush over them did not mess them up!</li>
            <li>These grey clips work better for the other size rollers just not the largest.  </li>
            <li>It was the same problem, the clips would not keep curler tight in place close to the head and many times fell out.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hold the curler in as tight as I would like and sometimes leave dents in my hair especially if I curl it under like I like to do with the top layer.  </li>
            <li>The large rollers could have bee bigger but worked</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smart clips they leave kinks in your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering how cheap these rollers are, I don&#x27;t regret buying them, but they do take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I first started using these, because the curl was pretty tight.</li>
            <li>They heat up very fast and I can have my long hair up in rollers in about 10mins.  </li>
            <li>My hair is hard to curl, but it is like magic after I put it on for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Also, it was hard to get the clips to hold my hair on the jumbo curlers, so I may order more of those.</li>
            <li>my only complaint is that I need more large ones than what is included in this set.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the smart clips leave some crimping at the top roots of my hair, not the lower curls.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU COULD OPEN THE LID, BECAUSE IT&#x27;S KIND OF HARD.</li>
            <li>This is a nice option for different styling for my very thick straight hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would inprove is more space to heat up clips at one time but other than that I am a fan forever!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not impressed at all with the cheap plastic clips that are suppose to hold the curlers in place, they flip all over the place and leave creases in what should be a smooth curl.  </li>
            <li>When I received this item it was clear that it had been repackaged.</li>
            <li>had to get out old clips to make it stay.</li>
            <li>I almost forgot, some people mentioned that it comes with wire clips, at least mine came with butterfly clips. :)</li>
            <li>These curlers were a complete disappoinment.  </li>
            <li>is nothing like the old ones.  </li>
            <li>I replaced an old Conair with the wire clips with this.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to save time, not waste it.</li>
            <li>Wow that this works for me...</li>
            <li>it is I really wanted bigger curlers.  </li>
            <li>The teeth are just too short to really dig in and hold well.</li>
            <li>The clips actually hold my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>I feel as though I&#x27;m not burning my hair up when I use these rollers with their soft flocking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too old to bother with that now.  </li>
            <li>Second - doesn&#x27;t curl very well.</li>
            <li>These rollers are much easier to use than I initially thought they would be.  </li>
            <li>If I use anything larger my hair will return to being pin straight in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>but wow whne</li>
            <li>I had to use the clips from my old set.</li>
            <li>I even tried on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>The straight hair is what my hair looked like AFTER I left the curlers in for 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I told my husband not to get rid of the box as I really had a feeling they would be going back.  </li>
            <li>Still, its not enough to bother me too much.  </li>
            <li>The clips do leave marks in my hair but fade fast enough to not bother me.</li>
            <li>I bought this set of curlers because my old set was just that - OLD.  </li>
            <li>However, now I&#x27;m heating up both sets, and FINALLY I can relax and set my hair the way I really WANT to!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not hunting around for the matching clip like in the old days.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this product even got as far as the store shelf.</li>
            <li>AND AS FAR AS THE LID</li>
            <li>BUT AS FAR AS HOW THEY CURL YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li>-- even professional stylists can&#x27;t get my hair to hold a curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really hope someone can get back to me the ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls last.</li>
            <li>idid not like it as mutch as my old one did notr like the claps</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Babyliss Professional Model BABHS40.</li>
            <li>How much would it have cost to add on a tiny plastic clip or two?  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t damage the hair the way the old products did.</li>
            <li>In short I really like the rollers on this set, however the clips suck.</li>
            <li>Combine that with the frizziness that this set produces and you end up with a pretty strange looking</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, but I&#x27;ve always had a problem with frizz and my curls having a uniformed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the largest size rollers for a natural looking curl.  </li>
            <li>Further, the clips feel kinda flimsy and do not hold the roller in place very well.</li>
            <li>Mine is shortish and I have to use the wire clips from old set.</li>
            <li>The old set had metal pins.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have never gotten rid of my old set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly bald, at least far more than I would like so clearly</li>
            <li>They do heat up fast, but there is no storage place for all the extra clips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of roller sets, and I like this one the best, even if the clips are worthless.</li>
            <li>But alas, if it sounds too good to be true, than it usually is.</li>
            <li>It does give good curl, when the clips finally hold....but so frustrating.  </li>
            <li>DOUBLE WOW!!!    </li>
            <li>/&gt;(if you are Australian like me or from other countries that don&#x27;t have the same power adapter as in America be sure to get a universal power adapter from your local shopping center with this purchase :) )</li>
            <li>Only one roller changes the color dot to show when heated and you have to heat the outer clips individually on the three spaces provided at the far right.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and it curled my full head with two rollers still left over.</li>
            <li>It seems almost impossible to find good hot rollers anymore.</li>
            <li>It took me 20 minutes the most transforming from long, thick straight hair to bouncy soft wavy.     </li>
            <li>At least three times while putting hot rollers in my hair- one of the clips will slip and a hot roller with go crashing to the bathroom floor (which causes they to chip!).</li>
            <li>my hair is straight but flat</li>
            <li>The only way to avoid this is to use insanely small amounts of hair, which would take more rollers than this has.</li>
            <li>Second time to buy this product, gave the first one to my daughter so had to buy a second one for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is layered at the end, up about 2 inches, and I mainly use the big rollers to curl/flip up the ends and to add body to the rest.</li>
            <li>They heat up in less than 2 minutes (and get SUPER hot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok (just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;) for about a month, then they don&#x27;t get hot anymore and are useless.  </li>
            <li>IT GETS SO HOT AFTER ONLY A SHORT TIME BEING ON</li>
            <li>With super straight hair, it&#x27;s really hard to find a way to curl my hair without a crease.</li>
            <li>Other than that they do curl well with the right clips to keep them in place.</li>
            <li>But the seller or company sold this product to me, clearly stated that it is a BRAND NEW ITEM, but when I open the box, there was hair in it,</li>
            <li>I have very little curls and a huge dent.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally they get tangled in my hair because of their design, even though I remove them carefully, but that doesn&#x27;t happen super often.  </li>
            <li>This is especially true if you have thick and/or long hair; the slits in the curlers can easily catch stray strands of hair and create frustrating messes of tangles.</li>
            <li>I used them for the first time today and they have lasted all day long!!!</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair for almost 20 years and would like to have some wave to match a dress to be worn on my sister&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
            <li>STILL WORK IF AS LONG AS YOUR NOT JUMPING UP AND DOWN,THE CURLERS HEAT UP REALLY FAST</li>
            <li>The curl is exactly what I was looking for and expected.  </li>
            <li>and I had to spray the dickens out of it with hairspray to calm down the frizzies.</li>
            <li>I would suggest getting the purpler set which comes with large and extra large rollers if you only want loose curls and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and is hot enough to curl the hair either dry or slightly damp.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought the Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers - these came with metal, not</li>
            <li>I wanted to go back to curling my hair the way I remember doing it before all the new types.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this some time ago, but when new, for some reason I never used it.&lt;br /&gt;Pulled it out of the cabinet to try it again, and only ONE curler heated</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had long enough hair for hot rollers for a while.</li>
            <li>but they do need to warm longer than I expected, especially once you have used them all and need to put a few back in to complete the curling.</li>
            <li>SO many of the negative comments left for this product were from misuse.</li>
            <li>provided clips are convenient in that they&#x27;re all the same size; but, they&#x27;re really too big for the smallest-sized rollers.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the Conair Ion Shine Instant Heat Hair Setter, but they obviously never had them in stock in the 1st place</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the rollers once so far but for someone that&#x27;s completely inept and using stuff like this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get a different set of clips for the biggest ones since I really like the set overall.</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 of these conair setters and the Caruso stayed in my thick hair and it was easy.</li>
            <li>so the claim that it controls frizz is false at best.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly there are only 3 warmers for the plactic clips so you can&#x27;t warm all the clips at once.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to use this product because I usually straighten my hair and wanted to switch it up.  </li>
            <li>She uses the jumbo ones almost everyday because these ones are a bit small and she wants more of a wavy look.  </li>
            <li>them at the scalp/root makes the whole curler/clip combo fall loose and kid of hang about 2 inches from where they should be.</li>
            <li>the product itself is small enough to be convenient for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d watched some demonstrations with this particular kit on youtube and was intrigued, but it was double the price at my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I paid nearly $39 for this product and found same exact product at local retailer for nearly $10 less brand new.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I have short hair and could really seriously use some more of the small and medium rollers, but they aren&#x27;t available in stores or online.</li>
            <li>Not sure why such a huge price increase</li>
            <li>I am also upset at Folica in general.</li>
            <li>I have always had issues with curls falling out of my hair, so I shouldn&#x27;t have expected so much from this.</li>
            <li>I tried them out and did not like them near as well as the blue ones.</li>
            <li>I only left them in for 10 minutes so the curls did not last the whole night.</li>
            <li>(so far, I been using only for 3 weeks).</li>
            <li>Also, the rollers themselves are somewhat smaller than my old set.</li>
            <li>so personally I would not waste my money on the Babyliss brand again.</li>
            <li>WHERE THE SOFT METERIAL ISNT COVERING,IVE ONLY USED IT ONCE</li>
            <li>It was finally time for me to update my old Conair set.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;*these give me really soft, romantic curls.</li>
            <li>You can pull the tail of your hair into the open center of the hot roller.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers, Pink from the seller called &amp;#34;Gourmet Kitchen Gallery&amp;#34; on May 11, 2013.</li>
            <li>This Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Roller in pink are meant to curl you hair.</li>
            <li>Tired of foam rollers and waiting for your hair to set in two or more hours?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to get the curler to stay with the clip, and when I could, I was almost guaranteed a nice crease where the clip met up with my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin, getting more so all the time.  </li>
            <li>The old style wire clips held much more securely and were less awkward to use.  </li>
            <li>I hate these new clips, but I tried using my claw clips from my jumbo set and the hot rollers leave a nice curl with them.  </li>
            <li>I went back a second time thinking it would be a matter of getting used to a new product.</li>
            <li>They are also very heavy when you have a head full of them.  </li>
            <li>These are typical hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>they were not hot enough to leave a hot curl executed look at all not those spring bouncy curls when you unroll just a wave with curl at end</li>
            <li>Super small rollers...</li>
            <li>I have trashed perfectly adequate electric rollers in the past when I couldn&#x27;t find their clips.</li>
            <li>Too heavy to stay in tight with these barely gripping clips.</li>
            <li>They burn your fingers as you try to secure them and just do not seem big or round enough to cover the entire roller around your hair.</li>
            <li>I too have used Conair hot rollers in the past and I really liked my compact jumbo roller set, unfortunately it was now in need to be replaced since it was over 10 years old and the lid was cracked.  </li>
            <li>Overall the product works very well, but how long will they last me, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s no way to protect yourself other than to wear silicone mitts), the curlers absolutely would not stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>Also I will be very cautious to make other orders in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is just a hot mess.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;re bending over to find them, and even more of them spring out of your head causing your long (but still straight) hair to cascade down into your eyes, making the search for the pesky little devils that much harder still.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, the clips will shoot across the room like bullets and become almost impossible to find, while the lovely pink rollers clatter to the floor and manage to roll under any available surface</li>
            <li>I basically used this item for less than 10 times then left it in a dry and clean place in my bedroom.</li>
            <li>My hair is on the thick, coarse side, so perhaps that&#x27;s why I don;t have a huge problem with them staying in place.</li>
            <li>I wanted multiple roller sizes, but it seems like the diameter of these rollers are smaller than my old set.  </li>
            <li>It is not worth the money as the rollers don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>So if there were better clips I would give a full rating, but I&#x27;m really disappointed with the design.</li>
            <li>Before you blame the hot rollers for not working, look up tutorials online, practice a little, and try again.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a little unsure how to use hot rollers just look up a tutorial online and then get these.</li>
            <li>I found this set as a replacement, expecting to receive generally the same set.  </li>
            <li>I usually leave them in longer because I love tight curls.</li>
            <li>the only thing that if you have a thin hair like me and want to keep your curls for a long time i would recommend a hair spray , but not too strong , you can spray your hair and use the rollers, than after you are done, you can just spray it to all your hair from a distance and you are done!</li>
            <li>Actually they get a little too hot for me</li>
            <li>The rollers are nice with the stay cool ends and flocking, but the clips are awkward to use and too big for the small rollers.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the previous design.  </li>
            <li>When I went to my hairdresser 3 weeks after I&#x27;d been using them, she was surprised at how dry my hair was...</li>
            <li>I have long wavy-curly coarse hair and after drying my  hair and rolling it up, the hairsetter leaves my hair tamed, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;re correct; my review was of the Conair Ion Shine Instant Heat Hairsetter, which is predominantly cornflower blue in color and, apparently, discontinued.</li>
            <li>While they will hold the smaller rollers on they tend to slip and can barely manage the big rollers.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat hot enough to curl anything, hair falls limp rapidly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;*ends are too hot on bare hands, im not sure how often i&#x27;d be using these without that</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair to begin with, so these rollers really make my hair curly when I use the medium or occasional small sizes.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted the rollers to give me both volume and loose natural looking curls .</li>
            <li>With waist-length straight hair of medium thickness, tight curls are just not an option.  </li>
            <li>Because the clips slip so much, the curl is limited to the ends of my hair, so I look a little like the old Midge doll.  </li>
            <li>One back log about it is , you might want to leave it for a considerable amount of time to make it hot enough , it says 10 mins of the box , but leave it for at least 20 mins</li>
            <li>need to admit that my hair is hard to handle and sometimes it might be complicated to roll it properly on the curlers, besides the fact that you&#x27;ll burn your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful enough, but in overall is a great product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they came in a little pouch, which is made of very flimsy material.  </li>
            <li>but they do leave little dents in my hair if I put too much hair on the rollers.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have had is the edges get a little too hot to touch if left on too long.</li>

            <li> curlers are perfect for my mew shorter summer hair cut.  </li>
            <li> BABHS40 Ceramic and Ionic 30-Roller Hair Set]] just had the best reviews.</li>
            <li> This hair roller system is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The clips are the best part because I can&#x27;t use those wire clips.</li>
            <li> the product came in excellent conditions.</li>
            <li> Best impulse buy I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find that it curled my hair perfectly the way I wanted, and they stayed for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> Also, the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are superficial at best</li>
            <li> that being said, these curlers are awesome.  </li>
            <li> still, the curlers themselves are great!</li>
            <li> being said, the clips DO NOT work on the jumbo size rollers (especially on top of the head).  </li>
            <li> but the clips still don&#x27;t work the best.</li>
            <li> When i found these they were perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the curlers!!</li>
            <li> but it needs a lot of changes to be perfect!</li>
            <li> It heats well and the quality is really great!  </li>
            <li> Made my wife very happy, she says they work perfectly</li>
            <li> I thought the clips were especially good in the beginning</li>

            <li> She said the price is great, and that it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work Conair!</li>

            <li> The rollers curled my hair beautifully and created volume.</li>
            <li> They heat up very quickly and they hold all night!!!</li>
            <li> They work great on my hair.  </li>

            <li> Change the clips and you&#x27;ll have a great product.</li>

            <li> The clips are great.</li>
            <li> I even used Redken spray starch will is great for holding curls, but still no luck.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was an automatic shut off safety feature, but otherwise, great.</li>

            <li> For the price, this is a great curler set.</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> I am giving these curlers their starts because they do a great job in terms of speed.</li>
            <li> the felt is great as when I had tested out the ones which were rubbery with bumps it got caught and tangled in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked great for my hair.</li>
            <li> They are great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not happy with this item at all</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I got it.</li>
            <li> All in all a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I think these hair rollers are great.</li>
            <li> I got this product in a timely manner, the product worked great..</li>
            <li> my makeup is great.  </li>
            <li> I returned a set of curlers that where cost over $80.00 because I didn&#x27;t like them, these are great for the price.</li>
            <li> Also, the rollers are great</li>
            <li> These work great.  </li>
            <li> Well I am happy I got these.</li>
            <li> i am happy with it will use it a lot</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is great and my hair looks great after using the rollers.</li>
            <li> Like the concept, rollers work great, clamps are a miss for me.</li>
            <li> works great.</li>
            <li> its great, had it for a week</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my rollers!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied!!.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love!!</li>
            <li> very nice set of curlers</li>
            <li> The curlers are great, but buy your own clips!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon is amazing but these rollers are just so so!</li>
            <li> I can not get this look even with a nice ceramic curling iron!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to end up loving the way your hair looks!</li>
            <li> In fact, I fall in love with it, as it was my best friend since then.</li>
            <li> you CONAIR, you&#x27;ve always been my best friend wherever I go..  : )</li>
            <li> I have  broke the top shell traveling and dropping it but still works perfect.</li>
            <li> but I saw that they had a fairly good rating and were a great price</li>
            <li> These were well made, great clips, and good reviews.</li>
            <li> Heat up very quickly, and the one size fits all clips work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, plenty of rollers, compact in size but perfect for a head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Love the rollers, I do not like the clips that came with the set, however I have my own clips and used them they work perfect.</li>
            <li> so these are not that good size wise.  </li>
            <li> and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li> it looks good for about 10 mins</li>
            <li> The curler size selection is good -</li>
            <li> I turned it on for a good 45 mins before I used the rollers</li>
            <li> I was and purchased this yesterday with good results.  </li>
            <li> If curling irons have always made you look like abstract art, and not in a good way, and you&#x27;ve resigned yourself to having the hairstyle of an 11-year-old for the rest of your life, don&#x27;t be dis\\&quot;tress\\&quot;ed</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend a good hour or so of quality time with my curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The product seem to be of good quality for the price we paid.  </li>
            <li> They all good.      </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get good curls).</li>
            <li> Still a good set for the cost.</li>
            <li> Good quality for this Price.</li>
            <li> And if nothing else they look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> BUT IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIANCE,</li>
            <li> Always had good experience with Conair products and recommend them.  </li>
            <li> Good curls is a matter of getting a feel for what your hair needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And now the good...</li>
            <li> Also the clip heating feature on this set is a good idea in theory but</li>
            <li> Good and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> They heat up good</li>
            <li> They seem to be just as good as the jumbo ones which we gave 5 stars to.  </li>
            <li> I found a good way to save time was by putting in my rollers and taking them out when I get to my destination.  </li>
            <li> good purchase</li>
            <li> I put these in let them cool, take them out, bam perfect hair.</li>
            <li> I advise buyers to leave the rollers in until they cool for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a very good product, easy to use</li>
            <li> in all, I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> But I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> She seems to be very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Both grand daughters are having a great time with this curler set</li>
            <li> all Im very pleased with this product&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this set of curlers and would recommend.</li>
            <li> and we find that it does an excellent job of providing just the right amount of curl for those occasions when you need it.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and gave me beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li> These hot curlers are wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you love your hair curled with all day hold, shine, and bounce these are for you!</li>
            <li> Try it--I think you&#x27;ll love it!  </li>
            <li> i bought them on here, because places like CVS wanted $20 more dollars for them, so the price was a steal!     </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> I would rate this item 400 stars if I could I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that impressed with the hot rollers either.</li>
            <li> but now I love doing my hair with these!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> These are excellent hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research into hot rollers and which ones would be best for me.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> The clips are so cheap!!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> I love how her hair looks!</li>
            <li> Love using these!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> The product arrived as the seller stated and was more than what I expeted!</li>
            <li> This is the best hot roller set</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> excellent product, very good, highly recommend, good quality and good price, thanks for the confidence,</li>
            <li> I use it on my synthetic hair and it does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> warm* 3 of these.  </li>
            <li> The clips also stay in nicely.  </li>
            <li> I used to get nice bouncy curls, but now the rollers don&#x27;t hold heat and when I unroll my hair it comes out frizzy, fuzzy and kinky.</li>
            <li> The curls do look nice though.</li>
            <li> I do get nice curls.    </li>
            <li> The rollers did not burn; they were warm but tolerable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
            <li> it does have some curl of its own, but of course not the kind I want.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using my roommate&#x27;s curlers, but wanted to try my own.  </li>
            <li> if I leave them in around 10-15 minutes, I get nice body and some curl.</li>
            <li> Unfortuantely, they were the wire kind (even narrower than these plastic ones), so didn&#x27;t solve my problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many styling tools from Conair that I loved-</li>
            <li> loved the fact that I was able to use these rollers.</li>
            <li> so it says and they&#x27;re flocked so they&#x27;re warm to the touch but not scalding when held.</li>
            <li> I do wish there was some kind of clip storage, but I just kept the box it came in and keep them in there for</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Produces a nice curl</li>
            <li> They stay in my hair quite nicely</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair texture you&#x27;d need to have so that these would work.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I do get a nice curl in the end.  </li>
            <li> My daughter owns a set of these, and I like the way they work -- with the deluxe clips.  </li>
            <li> Nice selection of sizes and helpful guidebook.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item the one thing that I liked was the fact that Conair said these rollers would not crinkle your hair.</li>
            <li> And the heated areas that are supposed to warm the clips?</li>
            <li> /&gt;*lid doesn&#x27;t clasp shut, it just kind of rests on the unit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice curler set for the price...</li>
            <li> I find them very easy to use, and my curls stay in, the clips are great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are super easy to use and hold the curl all day!!!</li>
            <li> She said it was the best hot roller she has ever had, including ones costing much more.</li>
            <li> It worked very fast and the results were incredible.</li>
            <li> I am sure this product will be great if you can easily manipulate the clips.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are the bomb they don&#x27;t get tangled in your fair cool to touch no burns and very nice curl, This was a great purchase</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the review with the new clips: tried them with the meal clips - and they are awesome</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly, and as promised give great shine to the hair.  </li>
            <li> This easy to do my hair &amp; look good</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and do a great job.</li>
            <li> it was very easy to use, heated up quickly, and gave great results.  </li>
            <li> and yes, I will be lookin&#x27; sexy! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great set of hot rollers!</li>
            <li> The best thing about these hot rollers is that they do put super curls in your hair!  </li>
            <li> After the 1st try using the unit on my own, I instantly love it.  </li>
            <li> I am a mom of 2 and this is perfect when I have a busy day.</li>
            <li> This has happened before, but this time  I am not so thrilled with my purchase that I want to pay more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My old set, the Clairol Deluxe hairsetter, lasted 20 years!!!  </li>
            <li> Having heard great things about these I tried them, and while they won&#x27;t curl all my hair, if I knot my hair and then just curl the bottom half, these are great!  </li>
            <li> They are easy to put it (no burning fingers here!).  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is below my shoulders</li>
            <li> With that being said I quickly found out they are AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine</li>
            <li> and I can easily get the curls I want using these!</li>
            <li> Also, have very fine hair and the plastic clips</li>
            <li> I have VERY fine hair and the clips</li>
            <li> Unless you already own some good clips and you don&#x27;t need the rollers very hot...</li>
            <li> I love these curlers, Got them as a gift as I read they are good for fine hair.</li>
            <li> The counter weight placed against the scalp while using the old style pins keep your curlers in place MUCH BETTER!!!  </li>
            <li> i tried to save money and buy cheap - ended up spending way more money trying to find a good prouct that works.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that this hairsetter creates long shiney waves that help to beautifully frame the face.  </li>
            <li> I thought this heat setter was one of Conair&#x27;s best that came out on the market... much better than the old plastic \\&quot;prickly teeth\\&quot; rollers.</li>
            <li> works great but fingers still get hot at touch</li>
            <li> If you want great curls and don&#x27;t have much time to put into your hair this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> First - these would be great rollers if you&#x27;re looking for tighter curls (not waves), and if you&#x27;ve got shorter hair.</li>
            <li> and it turned out great even with my first</li>
            <li> They work great if I put alot of gell in my hair first.</li>
            <li> So again for my first set, I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly hot and do a great job of putting in a curl that holds.  </li>
            <li> These hot rollers are great.  </li>
            <li> These hot rollers are great but the clips will not hold my hair</li>
            <li> It is a great machine and heats up quickly and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Besides that I like the product just fine, and I like the curl it gives me hair!</li>
            <li> clips to hold rollers are very cheap, but they work.</li>
            <li> The new clips are just ideal.</li>
            <li> I will try to by separate clips from the store and maybe that will help but have seen better hot roller machines and this one is not that great.</li>
            <li> These rollers smooths all the runaway curls and makes beautiful curls on my bone straight hair on top.</li>
            <li> The flocked surface makes rolling easy and is kind to your hair.</li>
            <li> The holders are easy to put in and effective to hold up the roller.  </li>
            <li> These hot rollers work great, really almost too great.  </li>
            <li> Buy it for yourself first, if you find it effective, don&#x27;t forget that YOUR BELOVED ONES DESERVE ONE  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It did work better than the set of conair jumbo rollers, but the curl still fell out.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I love that it comes with clips and not the metal pins.</li>
            <li> &quot; that will hopefully work better.  </li>
            <li> so glad i got it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the product and plan to use it sometime</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> I WAS GLAD I DID.</li>
            <li> love my curlers except they gave out after year was up 18 mos -</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really love this product and am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This is an ok set, but I sure wouldn&#x27;t rave about it.</li>
            <li> This product worked better to distribute the heat and lessen the frizz .. because of the heatable metal clamps...</li>
            <li> However, the flocking had worn off, so I was always burning my fingers, plus I had lost most of the pins.  </li>
            <li> I really really enjoy these rollers a lot!</li>
            <li> NO ONE belived I did it myself :)</li>
            <li> They held ok on the sides if you were still.</li>
            <li> I love using them to give me wome height on top, then let the end stay out of the curler</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought them</li>
            <li> Wish it had more mediums.      </li>
            <li> This set is one of the many that I have owned</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this hair setter.  </li>
            <li> The curler holders are so much better than the ol&#x27; days.  </li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> i love this product..</li>
            <li> i am sure you will too...</li>
            <li> I guess they are better than not.</li>
            <li> Conair didn&#x27;t even see fit to give us a zip-lok plastic bag to keep them in, you&#x27;re on your own there.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow I get so many complements when I roll my hair with these rollers.</li>
            <li> I have some cheaper ones that do a better job.  </li>
            <li> I sure wish that the manufacturer had put a disclaimer on the box.</li>
            <li> I have used electric rollers (including Conair) for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> I use a lot of hair spray, but the curl relaxes after 2-3 hours at the most.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used hot rollers and I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li> We both love it.    </li>
            <li> and I can see it would work on many hair types.</li>
            <li> I have used many, and never had to throw one away before.</li>
            <li> My favorite curling iron is Conair&#x27;s infiniti curling wand.</li>
            <li> it sure doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> , i just purchased this item at amazon and was glad on delivery too  </li>
            <li> I tried these thinking they might work better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that finally I find these rollers, I tried another brand, and all had  flows, not these.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to return this set and get a Remington one instead with longer, fitted, snap-on clips to hold my hair onto the rollers better.</li>
            <li> The clips that come with this don&#x27;t hold my hair up, in fact for most of the size rollers</li>
            <li> These curlers were definitely not the perfect match.</li>
            <li> The curl does not stay in my hair for more than about 45 mins (if that)</li>
            <li> She is very happy with it, she said she would buy the same model again if needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for many years.</li>
            <li> I AM SURE THEY HAVE HAD TO HAVE SOME LAWSUITS OVER THIS.</li>
            <li> I love this hair curler set.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that all their hairdressers will give me as rewarding results until I tried this year three of their products, which are CONAIR CHV26IX, CS19JCS and CD 160DRCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds curl better than any brand or size curling iron</li>
            <li> I love it for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curls hold for most of the day which is more that I can say for the curling iron</li>
            <li> This is more than sufficient to give me curls.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and recipient was quite pleased, except there is no storage space for the cord or the clips.</li>
            <li> Lovely set of rollers that won&#x27;t stay in my hair with the provided clips.  </li>
            <li> , their material helps to stay in my hair better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the problem some have had with burned fingers because I don&#x27;t let it heat for more than a couple of minutes--</li>
            <li> I love the curlers.  </li>
            <li> Scunci No slip Grip Chunky Clips]]  until i can find some better clips.  </li>
            <li> I have now longer hair and the results looks now better as the curls look</li>
            <li> more natural.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how these would for me...</li>
            <li> and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Im better off using an iron or wand.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Heated clips seem to give a better set to the curl</li>
            <li> Probably best for short hair.</li>
            <li> better clip system is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I READ MOST OF THE REVIEWS ON HERE</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE</li>
            <li> AND I ACTUALLY ENJOYED PETTING THEM IN</li>
            <li> SURE..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Instant flawless curls!</li>
            <li> I should have done a bit more homework before purchasing these</li>
            <li> however I would have just said to order a better set separately;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that more practice will solve this problem.</li>
            <li> The top is flimsy, and although the cord can be wrapped around the bottom, there is no clip to hold it.  </li>
            <li> I was really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I also like being able to set the heat factor.  </li>
            <li> i will be giving them a neg review for sure.  </li>
            <li> This curler set is awesome becuase it heats up so fast, the curls are great and last all day....</li>
            <li> I have had these for over a year and just love them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Maybe with more practice, I can do better.</li>
            <li> Like lightening fast, which is great if you are in a rush though you can also leave them to heat for longer.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> In fact my hair was MUCH more frizzy after using this than before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned this from my beautician mother and from the many beauticians I&#x27;ve known through my dad&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> I was wiloing to give this another try with better clips if they would have sent them to me</li>
            <li> Many rollers fall out during use and don&#x27;t keep the roller at your scalp.</li>
            <li> As you use them you can replace them with more clips so they can heat up as well.</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> I rather like most about the setter, but my problem is that I can&#x27;t seem to get the roller clamps to hold the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to know the answer to my dilemna.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I returned that and ordered this instead.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s better if you have some type of body in your hair.</li>
            <li> It stays all day without any hairspray, and I get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> They do not heat in 60 seconds, more like minutes.</li>
            <li> Maybe longer hair would allow them to work better.</li>
            <li> Glad I have them.</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> They are OK, but just OK.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this set.</li>
            <li> When my house burned I had to buy more.</li>
            <li> like to get volume on the top</li>
            <li> i do feel like they could have more grip</li>
            <li> yet.&lt;br /&gt;*hair looks a lot more shiny after using these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it sells for even more on the official conair site than it does here or in store.</li>
            <li> But my grand daughter can use them.</li>
            <li> Just a design suggestion from a user :-)</li>
            <li> I bought these over a year ago and still love them.  </li>
            <li> nice smooth a shiny</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hot rollers!!!</li>
            <li> and they are very gentle on my fine hair which is also great.  </li>
            <li> It is very effective on my straight hair.</li>
            <li> Also there is a nice variety of roller sizes with an good number of each particular size.</li>
            <li> I love the foam cushioning which is very comfortable and my hair is easy to curl around the rollers.  </li>
            <li> It grasps nicely (even to fine hair) and is easy to roll.</li>
            <li> honestly if i had had this set when i got married, i would have used it to style my own hair for the wedding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, made my hair look awesome, big improvement over curling iron.</li>
            <li> The rollers did heat up quickly and it was nice being able to heat up the clips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned these hot rollers for about 10 years and have loved using them.</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH CONAIR MAKES A GOOD HOT ROLLER</li>
            <li> This is really a good hot roller device.</li>
            <li> Best hot rollers by far!!</li>
            <li> Either way, this is a great product, and I will probably order it again when I need new curlers.</li>
            <li> But they give a nice quick curl.</li>
            <li> and I enjoyed the easy clips</li>
            <li> This new set delivers great curls, and makes my hair look very full with lots of body.  </li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t seem to get very hot, which may be part of the reason they don&#x27;t curl effectively.</li>
            <li> my fine hair (that&#x27;s meant as an adjective, not a self-congratulation) is as healthy as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The curlers are perfect for my fine hair, the curls stay even with only a light mist of hair spray.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and are very hot to get a good curl  3)</li>
            <li> The concept is great, but the clips are completely inadequate.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Not only the price and the wave came out good, the most amazing thing is.....</li>
            <li> This product offers a great solution for me.</li>
            <li> As far as the clips that come with this set, I guess I am in the minority as I thought having heated clips was a great feature.</li>
            <li> but they seem to be becoming scarce.</li>
            <li> because the curl looks good, lasts a couple of days and they heat up fast.  </li>
            <li> This set is reasonably priced and gives good results.</li>
            <li> loved this hair setter so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all gussied up very often, but when I do, these new rollers do a great job!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and it curls very nicely and quickly.</li>
            <li> The rollers are perfect because they are not hot to the touch</li>
            <li> but I have no doubts it will exceed my expectations since I&#x27;ve seen the product being used on other people with exquisite results!</li>
            <li> After I have tried other roller and curling irons and nothing compares to this great product!  </li>
            <li> After getting them to cool, i unroll them one by one and voila!</li>
            <li> but, because of the clamps (that I was really excited about) it leaves a crease in your hair at the top of your curl.  </li>
            <li> My wife on the other hand is very happy with them.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to style them into the hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> The curl is nice and shiny and my hair is nice and soft.    </li>
            <li> These are easy to use, except that the clips don&#x27;t always stay on in place, sometimes they want to slip alittle and do not try to bend over as they will unroll with you.  </li>
            <li> For me - with rather average, easy to curl hair - they are great and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> And I have easily curlable hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found these really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> dressing has never been as easy.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using hot rollers and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use and give my hair body.</li>
            <li> My hair breaks and frizzes so easily.</li>
            <li> So easy and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the hair setter is really easy; just plug it in and wait for it to heat up.</li>
            <li> They come in a separate pouch, which means it would be too easy to pack the hair setter and forget the pins.  </li>
            <li> so it curls easily).  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> these are sold at a lot of stores so picking up a pack is easy</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Well made and easy to use rollers.  </li>
            <li> I strongly suggest you keep looking.  </li>
            <li> I was able to curl my hair fast, but still have nice curls.</li>
            <li> My hair looks flippy and cute right now because i curled it the night before!  </li>
            <li> These may work well for someone with fine, easy to curl hair-but not for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and dose not hold a curl easily.</li>
            <li> This hot roller set curls hair nicely, but the plastic, heated clips that it comes with leaves crinkles in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was able to take them out with full curls.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY easy to curl and will HOLD curl all day when the right product is used.  </li>
            <li> For other hair types, or maybe someone more experienced with hair than myself, it works well, heats quickly, sets quickly and is a good brand.</li>
            <li> This is my very own first set, and I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the way my hair comes out with this.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that I have to have permed every 2 months</li>
            <li> This Conair Heat Hair Setter works fine.  </li>
            <li> and they leave a crease in my hair (shoulder length and fine -</li>
            <li> Chose this one because of the number of rollers, the felt covering, and the plastic clips, which I thought would work fine.  </li>
            <li> and I know it will be just fine.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended hot rollers to me, saying they are the best way to get a curl that lasts all day, but the curls I get from this barely last an hour.</li>
            <li> The seller was fine though so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so fine, the clips wanted to fall out.</li>
            <li> The metal holders work fine</li>
            <li> I have fine baby-like hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is a pain in the butt to curl.</li>
            <li> These rollers do not work well for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Clips leave dents in my fine hair</li>
            <li> Perhaps they work on thicker hair, but I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li> They are fairly hot on the edges, but I have yet to find any curlers that won&#x27;t be challenging to handle for more than a minute.  </li>
            <li> My hair (fine) took a lot of rollers</li>
            <li> I found the lid to be just fine.</li>
            <li> I am So glad she&#x27;s enjoying them - I&#x27;ve had hot rollers myself for 25 years and they are a MUST when it comes to style and manageability.</li>
            <li> With my fine hair, the clips never stay in place</li>
            <li> fine hair, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The rollers themselves work fine....</li>
            <li> I loved the convenience of setting my hair while preparing for work &amp; having a full head of curls by the time I am ready to leave for work.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; clips really aren&#x27;t warm after sitting on the warming rack, the spring on the clip wasn&#x27;t that strong</li>
            <li> I love these hot rollers!</li>
            <li> I love it so much !!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these hot rollers!</li>
            <li> My cousin has shoulder length, fine hair and looks amazing after using than the whole set in about 1/2 hour.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And the rollers are HUGE.</li>
            <li> Hot clips used on top of head will leave lines/clip marks after you comb out, so I always use cool clips on top curlers.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was great because now I don&#x27;t have to buy those clips everyone raves about.. BIG MISTAKE !!!      </li>
            <li> It really depends on the weather though which is kind of a no brainer.  </li>
            <li> It stayed secure until I removed them.</li>
            <li> They were light and flexible and held the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li> and they are light when on your head.</li>
            <li> Clips hold securely.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make a nice, defined curl.  </li>
            <li> This is CHEAP JUNK.</li>
            <li> My rollers came with cheap plastic clips that were designed to hold the rollers in place...</li>
            <li> heats up fast and creates nice curls</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I&#x27;d say these rollers would have been fantastic except that I could not keep them in my hair with the provided clips.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I contacted Conair, and they were fantastic about it.</li>
            <li> They offered to send me some alternative clips for free.</li>
            <li> On the plus side all of the clips fit all of the curlers</li>
            <li> Silky smooth.</li>
            <li> So I ended up buying just a set of metallic cheap clampy pins to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> I do like that they warm up and fast too, though.</li>
            <li> Light and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My hair always comes out smooth and bouncy not frizzy.</li>
            <li> That model does a fabulous job and the wire clips keep the curler in place</li>
            <li> if having an ionic setter is important to you, than look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> IT WAS SO CHEAP</li>
            <li> DCONT SEE HOW IT COULD HAVE CURLED ANY BETTER.THE CLIPS THAT SECURE YOUR HAIRNARE</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite its short comings, this hair setter makes great looking curls with practice and patience.</li>
            <li> It does not have an on/off switch, it has a light that comes on when it is on.  </li>
            <li> I had to call CONAIR and struggle with them just to send me 10 clips for free..</li>
            <li> /&gt;The clips do not hold the hair securely.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> Like a light pink/purple pearl.</li>
            <li> mine came with the plastic clips that fit any size of roller.  </li>
            <li> All in all a GREAT product especially for beginners like me!</li>
            <li> I liked the old style better.</li>
            <li> The curl holds nicely even after just ten minutes, and the heated clips are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> They heat up nice and fast but the clips are kind of flimsy and don&#x27;t hold the rollers in place very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that this one is a keeper, though I have also come to the conclusion that so far there is no such thing as a perfect hot roller set for under $50, but this one is pretty close.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even sure I was doing it right.  </li>
            <li> While I have very fine, easy to curl hair, it also worked well on my neice who has very thick-corse hair.</li>
            <li> so I am very dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t recieve what I ordered!!!</li>
            <li> First of all the price of this setter went from $22.77 to over $36.00 in one week&#x27;s time!!</li>
            <li> Overall very nice</li>
            <li> I found this Conair Instant hair set of rollers very nice</li>
            <li> but hold onto some hot \\&quot;u\\&quot; shaped clips I got from ebay to make sure the rollers stay secure...  </li>
            <li> These rollers are easy to use and heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I wanted some quick and easy curls</li>
            <li> While my hair was more voluminous than usual, the staying power (with a setting spray) wasn&#x27;t incredible.</li>
            <li> The good thing about these hot rollers is that they heat up fast and curl one&#x27;s hair well.  </li>
            <li> I bought these rollers because I needed a quick and easy way to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*these are super easy to use.</li>
            <li> It kind of sags a good inch or so down from the roots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It breaks my heart to read many of the reviews here about this set from women who just love their new \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; set because the ions make it so that the setter does not damage the hair.</li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and are great to use, but with my short hair, I just prefer to use the jumbo rollers.  </li>
            <li> (I would recommend buying a couple sets of Conair Super Clips which are fabulous and hold any size roller securely to your head)</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like the product she is used to the clairol hot rollers that she had for many years</li>
            <li> I love the clips get hot too.  </li>
            <li> of curl, smile!</li>
            <li> THe Conair system works fine and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> cool ends are important and the curlers are made well, as well as the clips.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaints about these hot rollers, I love them.</li>
            <li> It is user friendly and harmless to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought the Conair Tourmaline but didn&#x27;t like the clips.</li>
            <li> But the clips leave significant crimp marks, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way around it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many conair hot roller sets I&#x27;ve bought over my life - 10, 15?  </li>
            <li> I love these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Different clips would be nice!</li>
            <li> I love the rollers as they give me exactly that,  volume and curl that lasts hours</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I was excited to try these</li>
            <li> It works for now, but the curlers themselves are definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I have used hair rollers since arrival and am pretty well pleased.      </li>
            <li> I bought this product for Wal-Mart for $10 cheaper than Amazon was selling it for, but I still wanted to leave a review because it is a great product it just has one minor hiccup.</li>
            <li> As a matter fact, I rather like the curly at the ends look; it isn&#x27;t as overwhelming as the full-on bounce of when the curls are first set</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been using hot rollers for many years.</li>
            <li> As far as when you do get one to hold right, the curl comes out nice and if you give yourself some spray, it will turn out ok.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is determined to be straight.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Conair instant heat rollers to replace my old Conair rollers which I was very happy with.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to properly style my own hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that ever worked and that I enjoyed using, up until now, is the Instyler I own.</li>
            <li> This actually works better for me, as I already own a set of all jumbo (1.5 inch) rollers.   </li>
            <li> I only gave it two stars because it DID heat up evenly, and the rollers themselves would be nice in a better \\&quot;house.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly, and rolled smoothly into my hair.</li>
            <li> and they were super easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> the price is right, the curls come out VERY nice, the rollers and clips don&#x27;t burn your fingers, and it&#x27;s a fast, easy process for cute curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> They get nice and hot, are easy to use and the style stays in for a good long time, even in the hot, humid Texas weather.</li>
            <li> Not like the old hairsetters for sure!  </li>
            <li> Loved these new hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I love that they hold their heat well and heat up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it and wanted the exact same thing but thought it would be nice to have the large and medium sized curlers as well, though I primarily use the jumbo.</li>
            <li> I had the hardest time finding Jumbo curlers, and am glad Conair thought to make a hair setter with mostly large rollers.  </li>
            <li> but it would be gread if it came with a special glove to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;Top</li>
            <li> I had to resort to curling the top layer of my hair with a large barrel</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the clips but have the Conair large clips - they are better.</li>
            <li> The large and medium rollers are okay.  </li>
            <li> Returned them right away, and I would not recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> But after using it a few times, I&#x27;m impressed at how hot they get.</li>
            <li> I will say that the clips are really not that great</li>
            <li> These are great hot rollers overall.</li>
            <li> I must use sytling spray before rolling and clipping but not inconvenient and the results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I received a similar Conair model that is almost as good.  </li>
            <li> The only thing it lacks are good clips.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall out while you are waiting for them to cool.  </li>
            <li> For someone like me who is clueless about how to style hair, these are a dream come true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always wanted salon finish curls but always dread the time it takes to curl my full head.  </li>
            <li> And their warranty is only good for 30 days.  </li>
            <li> , I wait for them to cool in my head</li>
            <li> I finally got wise, got on line, found another set of Caruso Molecular Rollers and ordered them.  </li>
            <li> I like nice soft \\&quot;even\\&quot; curls.  </li>
            <li> I find the curls last longer and it leaves my hair shiny and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a learning process for me, but overall I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I leave them out for 15 seconds to cool before I put in my hair</li>
            <li> , MOSTLY COOL TO THE TOUCH</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews stating that the good clips don&#x27;t come with the sets offered here, I&#x27;ve decided to actually go to the store and purchase them.   </li>
            <li> I needed curls for my solo, but i need to be able to curl my hair fast.</li>
            <li> fast love that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never even used hot rollers before and wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be the right purchase for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Cons: the lid is kind of fragile which break easily</li>
            <li> you can salvage the outer layers of your hair, the curls created by these hot rollers will last all day and look very nice.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t, but my hair came out with just the right amount of curl, smooth and shiny.......</li>
            <li> The rollers were really easy to use and the clips held my hair in place pretty well.</li>
            <li> This hot roller set has a variety of sized rollers and has easy clips.  </li>
            <li> while its amazing that you can heat them also, they barely hold!!</li>
            <li> and they make the most beautiful curls that last all day and into the next even when slept on.  </li>
            <li> Their CS department is second to none, their prices are much better than Folica&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve always been happy with Amazon in general.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and very straight so this did not help much.</li>
            <li> The Hot rollers works fine.</li>
            <li> The old school wire ones works much better and don&#x27;t leave huge dents in my hair.</li>
            <li> The curlers work well and heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> They look nice, love the pink.  </li>
            <li> Though they do heat up quickly, I don&#x27;t care for the clips.</li>
            <li> It is quick.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a quick hair fix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curling my hair for over ten years and have tried several curling irons and curler sets inorder to find the perfect match.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, and well.</li>
            <li> I think the curler set contains just the right number of each size of roller -- even better though would be to have two ore large</li>
            <li> This is my first set of hot rollers and I love them.</li>
            <li> This baby heats up really quick, and does the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The rollers don&#x27;t heat as quickly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I also bought the super clips that come in a box of 10</li>
            <li> Quick heat up</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, but the clips do not hold the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly.</li>
            <li> Smaller and hotter curlers left in for a longer time is usually best for my hair.</li>
            <li> They heat up just as quickly as they say.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, I have the kind of hair that wants desperately to be straight, and my curl stays all day with these curlers.  </li>
            <li> After using it, I realize that I would be better off with more rollers that were the same size.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and curl well.  </li>
            <li> I bet the the Revlons pins would help tremendously.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Ok first of all, I have never used any hot rollers before</li>
            <li> These heat up quick and once I was done putting them all in I started to take them out.</li>
            <li> That said, the curlers heat up quickly and release the hair without tangling.  </li>
            <li> I use little to no hairspray at all, and my hair stays beautiful</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them and the clips keep these rollers in much much better than those metal pins.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a great deal for paying less than $25.00 for a true ionic setter.</li>
            <li> However, I dont need to have used hot rollers before to tell you that the plastic ends on the rollers feel super cheap.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Conair Ion Shine instant heir setter which my wife had owned before &amp; was very satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> I have advanced from pin curls, to rollers, and then to hot rollers over the ages.</li>
            <li> Very Hot Curlers.</li>
            <li> I own a couple of different sized curling irons and though i love how they curl my hair, it just takes forever to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about using different sized rollers, but I did some research on how to use them and found that using the largest rollers on top, medium ones in the middle, and smallest on the bottom of my head as advised works great.</li>
            <li> I asked if the company would be willing to send me a set for free since the ones that come with the rollers are inferior and she said, \\&quot;no, they are for sale\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> These are the best, they heat up quick, make nice curls in short amount of time and no static!  </li>
            <li> They are insanely easy to use and heat up super fast.</li>
            <li> I can easily make breakfast, pack lunches, and get kids ready for school and the rollers stay in place.  </li>
            <li> I love these hot rollers so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old and can style my own hair for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> Problem is, 3rd time I used these hot rollers the plastic part of the rollers melted, shorted out the product for good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really procrastinating about buying another set of hot curlers because there may not be any that perform better than these.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re willing to put the effort in, or go buy different clips, it&#x27;s a good set.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and gave almost too much curl.</li>
            <li> A good set of hot rollers, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Its fast and easy and dont burn my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product because of my fine hair and looked forward to the SMART Clips keeping the hair on the rollers.</li>
            <li> If they sit more than 10 mins they get pretty hot and burn my fingers, even the clips can get that hot.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be the only one who needs more rollers, they should be easier to get!</li>
            <li> She had never used hot rollers ever and now is HOOKED on them!</li>
            <li> The rollers are great but the clips don&#x27;t hold as tightly as I would like.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t stay in my straight, fine hair, even with the claw clips.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and these rollers</li>
            <li> The rollers get nice and hot very quickly and you don&#x27;t have to keep them in long to get the desired look.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I kept my old clips and they work fine with this set.     </li>
            <li> easy to use,heats super fast very convienient!</li>
            <li> Also it would have been nice if they would have put a little lip on the top lid.</li>
            <li> I would consider myself an special occasion user of hot rollers (maybe 10 times a year).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frugal of Conair to sell this hair setter with cheap clips.  </li>
            <li> Even when I brush through it a few times it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li> but rather then return the whole set - would they please supply you with the metal version of the clips that fit this model.  </li>
            <li> It claims to heat in an \\&quot;xtreme\\&quot; 3 minutes, and according to the instructions the light will change to notify the user when they&#x27;re ready for use.</li>
            <li> As advertised by many hair curler fans, this product delivered soft voluminous curls.</li>
            <li> so it stays warm longer.. and makes the curl last longer too !!  </li>
            <li> Amazon is good for buying books and not much else.</li>
            <li> I also love how fast they heat up, and how you can roll your head and in 10-15 mins have a whole head of bouncy curls.      </li>
            <li> I like these curlers better than the old style.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I kept the ones from my old set.     </li>
            <li> when I do try and use the clips they leave a big kink in the curl and does not look good especially for the curls on top of the crown.</li>
            <li> This was definately worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> So if your initial turn out isn&#x27;t so good, my advice is to try as much as you can to follow the directions to the T.</li>
            <li> The clips simply don&#x27;t hold --- the pin type are much more secure  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe these are worth the money.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice curl that seems to last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the clips.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if the product delivered actually came with the accessories in the pictures.  </li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> I just bought another set with the old fashioned skinny wire hooks, as most seem to use the clips nowadays</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t think it was worth keeping.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d like to say the reason was because this setter is worth every penny, but I&#x27;d be lying.</li>
            <li> By the time you get back to the 1st clip, it&#x27;s heated quite nicely.</li>
            <li> After this problem was fixed, I don&#x27;t have any more complaints.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this item is they do heat up fast.</li>
            <li> I guess the old metal hooks are better.</li>
            <li> I struggled getting the rollers in place the first few times but the curls turned out beautiful and lasted majority of the day.</li>
            <li> The clips also cause dents near the top of your curls.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law who has long thin hair - this has transformed her hair into a full head of beautiful dazzling curls and she LOVES them.</li>
            <li> but they kind of left a dent on my hair and didn&#x27;t want to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair Hot Rollers for 30+ years and didn&#x27;t give a second thought to purchasing this product, as I&#x27;ve always been very satisfied with my Conair products.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice because i use the smaller ones on the sides.</li>
            <li> Every time I do my hair with these I get tons of compliments (without fail) and the best thing is that they are so easy and fast!</li>
            <li> Granted, they burned my fingers by then, but I had certainly gotten my parents&#x27; money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> They heat up super fast, they can get super hot, they have an on-off switch, and they&#x27;ve got \\&quot;cool touch\\&quot; ends (</li>
            <li> It&#x27; the first thing I actually thought made my hair look cute curled!</li>
            <li> Sometimes they curl great, other times not so much.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up quickly and don&#x27;t get too hot to handle</li>
            <li> Cons - curlers can get super hot, clips can get super hot, clips leave unsightly creases, and don&#x27;t hold hair on the curler</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up super fast!</li>
            <li> I curl my hair everyday, and I love these!!</li>
            <li> I have super stubborn, super straight hair that will not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of hot rollers, and overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Right now hair is shorter</li>
            <li> They just slip right out.</li>
            <li> it seemed to me that I needed 3 hands to do it right.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;velvet&#x27; finish contributes to the curlers sliding right out.</li>
            <li> It does take some experimentation to get the right tempature setting and the length of time needed to get the desired result.</li>
            <li> I put the rollers in my hair and attach the clip and within seconds, the clip is falling off and the roller is rolling right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> this slip right out of my hair.</li>
            <li> The timing was just right.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that the clips fit all the roller sizes because of their design so you don&#x27;t have to search for the right size clip like the older sets.</li>
            <li> but because the clips aren&#x27;t very strong it doesn&#x27;t stay tight and does get hot if touching your face.</li>
            <li> It has been more warm than usual and I am prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that this particular product is no longer available.</li>
            <li> The new clips are much easier to use and rollers felt more secure as opposed to older style of clips.  </li>
            <li> I am asian and have really thinning fine hair and did not want anything that would damage my hair even more or make it fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pros - quick heat, if you leave them on long enough they get good and hot, easy to use, and an on/off switch  </li>
            <li> rught after which it and so much more volume  cause of the nice curls especially when you have a choice of different size rollers in one</li>
            <li> This hot roller set is definitely worth the $25 I paid.  </li>
            <li> They get nice and hot but not so hot that you&#x27;ll end up with third degree</li>
            <li> They barely fit around the rollers, and I find I have to restrict my activities (normal house chores) when wearing them for fear they&#x27;ll fall out.  </li>
            <li> Although i do think that it&#x27;s a minor concern, the product still delivers even with this kind of clamp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing out my hair.. and decided to get the jumbo set (which comes with less rollers and also because the hot clips clamps didn&#x27;t hold the rollers as secure as I&#x27;d have liked.   </li>
            <li> Having used electric hot rollers for many years, I needed to find a set that had bigger rollers, did not catch and break my hair, and heated quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I am one of those people who never put the time in to type up a review (and a long one at that!), but I&#x27;m in such of a good mood cause of my hair, I just had to!</li>
            <li> The picture looked as if they were large and medium.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer!</li>
            <li> I purchased these earlier this week, b/c I have very straight, very fine, hair and wanted to give it some volume.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that these curlers are wrapped in a soft velvety material that doesn&#x27;t burn your hands to touch like metal, and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair so much as metal seems to burn.</li>
            <li> back to review and purchase another set for a birthday present, that&#x27;s how happy it has made me.</li>
            <li> The rollers are multi-sized so with my current hair style, the different sizes work great.  </li>
            <li> Heats up super fast.  </li>
            <li> The cool touch tips are nice and do help to cut down on the amount of times that you&#x27;ll accidentally touch the roller.</li>
            <li> and she really enjoys them and says they get hot quickly.</li>
            <li> The case is a newer, sleek version of cases past and nice looking and a size that is easy to travel with as well.  </li>
            <li> I saw this product on the magazine, ordered it because the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*it&#x27;s all very fast.</li>
            <li> with all roller sets, if you have very very straight hair, I advise you to use styling products to maintain the curl and body of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the hair setter with the old style of clip which does not work well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair but have used other brands; all with better success.  </li>
            <li> Reading her review nearly put me off buying these, but I find the lid is just fine.</li>
            <li> If I had fine hair, I think I&#x27;d pass on these and go with the old fashioned wire clips.     </li>
            <li> With a little hairspray, you&#x27;re good to go for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Like very much, it does exactly like it says on the website.</li>
            <li> The curls made with the setter are pretty good, but it seems to me that this little appliance was designed by someone who had never used one and had never consulted anyone who did.</li>
            <li> I like the hot rollers, the sizes and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> It makes me easier in the process of curing my hair using the hot roller.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Bravo Conair and thanks for the speedy delivery Amazon !</li>
            <li> w/ the way it works, except the ends are hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> THEY DONT GET HOT</li>
            <li> WHEN I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> I bought it almost a month ago, and it still works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not just these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I will not be buying another set, I think I&#x27;m going with the BabyLiss hot rollers this time.     </li>
            <li> What I love about the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers is their \\&quot;new\\&quot; way of holding the roller in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if my hair were longer, I would need the extra heat from the clip.</li>
            <li> and they come with the hot clips (\\&quot;u\\&quot; shaped bent metal clip)..     </li>
            <li> First off...  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because there is no heat setting on the machine</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I have had a set of Conair hot rollers that lasted me for 10+ years.  </li>
            <li> When the Hot Rollers arrived, there is no ON/OFF switch.  </li>
            <li> are hot...</li>
            <li> Especially if you try to roll on the top of your head.  </li>
            <li> This is my first hot roller..</li>
            <li> , they are my first ones I have ever gotten</li>
            <li> I mostly use the larger rollers, since my hair is longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> When I first pull them out</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost Delta Burke in the first season of Designing Women</li>
            <li> I find this product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> If anyone has any ideas on a quality set of hot curlers please share?</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon!  </li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t get that hot even in that amount of time.  </li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d try hot rollers.    </li>
            <li> I bought this set because I was looking for hot rollers that had multi sized rollers and the tourmaline ceramic rollers caught my eye.  </li>
            <li> The thing I like about hot rollers is they are easier than just a curling iron and then having to roll the curl backup and bobby pin until time to comb out hair.  </li>
            <li> It will make it a real pain when I travel and have to figure out a place to store the clips so I don&#x27;t lose them!</li>
            <li> Edges of rollers pretty hot to handle, too.</li>
            <li> I used them for 3 weeks and not once did the curl last for more than an hour.  </li>
            <li> BE AWARE that the roller diameters they give you on the box seem to be for the plastic ENDS of the rollers, which are wider than the barrels you roll your hair on, so</li>
            <li> The rollers get plenty hot, but the clips are a pain to use and don&#x27;t hold.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased the jumbo rollers with the regular metal clips that hold better.  </li>
            <li> The rollers don&#x27;t get too hot to touch</li>
            <li> Also the edges of the curlers are too hot for my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is the first set of hot curlers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> and I are still doing a lot of bonding and the hot curlers</li>
            <li> Since the rollers don&#x27;t feel hot to the touch</li>
            <li> The wife used the item several times after the purchase and was pleased with the results every time and even started curling the children&#x27;s (girls) hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before</li>
            <li> My only con is that I have A LOT of hair, and I could have used one or two more rollers.  </li>
            <li> I have never use hot rollers before.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> In fact, I can&#x27;t keep MOST rollers in my baby-fine hair, so this was not a big shock.  </li>
            <li> The rollers get plenty hot (hotter than the alternative set I got) and there&#x27;s an included pouch to store the clips in.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair had so much more volume when I pulled the rollers out--a big advantage.</li>
            <li> I am ready to reveal my curls to everyone else!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s too curly when I first take it out.</li>
            <li> First of all, my rollers came with the fishy shaped looking clips.  </li>
            <li> You can control how hot they get with a heat setting (1-12).</li>
            <li> I often set my hair in these hot rollers, and then do my makeup and dressing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as though I&#x27;m a first time hot curler user.</li>
            <li> My first try took 15 minutes to get three rollers in</li>
            <li> , I bought the first hairdresser from CONAIR - hair setter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I anticipated and is working well.</li>
            <li> I used a trick my sister showed me - to push them towards the scalp first and then rotate them upwards to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can set your hair really fast!</li>
            <li> this is like many mini curling irons in your hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> The lovely curls are definitely marred by the marks.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers, especially the variable heat setting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen an alternative hot roller set until Caruso, so I&#x27;m gonna give those a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers for probably 25 years, but now that I&#x27;m going to look for a job again and want some variety in my look (and for going out too), so I bought these.</li>
            <li> Included in the box, is an order form for ordering more rollers in various sizes!</li>
            <li> It works fast &amp; efficient!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay overall.</li>
            <li> I got the hot rollers as a Christmas gift (2013).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Been using hot rollers for 30 years.  </li>
            <li> the tips make sure you are not constantly burning yourself.  </li>
            <li> my hair stylist suggested using velvet hot rollers for styling.</li>
            <li> These are the first set of rollers I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> End of rollers are a bit hot when rolling your hair onto the roller&lt;</li>
            <li> the felt every time ue pu it on the hot rollrs</li>
            <li> I like the material on the roller to help protect my hair from getting too hot.</li>
            <li> They actually work much better than the clips that come with the Hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I love the low price as well as the look of these.</li>
            <li> I have to use my old wire clips to to secure rollers.</li>
            <li> I paid much more for it than I would have had I purchased the same set here.</li>
            <li> I love how the rollers and clips are both heated to add extra setting power for the hair.</li>
            <li> and  holds a curl pretty well.   </li>
            <li> The curlers get TOO hot.</li>
            <li> I had to order some larger clips just to make sure the curlers stayed in place.</li>
            <li> I have two sets of these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I wish someone would make a hot roller set with all 1-1/4</li>
            <li> I purchased this Conair Hot Roller Set because you stated it had a on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately it&#x27;s not JUST the clips....</li>
            <li> yourselves a favor and spend the extra $10 on another set of better rollers.</li>
            <li> first of all, do NOT buy this from amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have never used hot rollers before</li>
            <li> These rollers melted - so bizarre - clearly defective.</li>
            <li> It would be consistent, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first I&#x27;ve tried hot rollers.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is not ionic and it does not control frizz.</li>
            <li> I like the design of the smooth rollers, unlike the old school hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> like velvet rollers that get HOT but protect my fingers and ears and</li>
            <li> /&gt;These plastic butterfly style clips don&#x27;t hold the curler in place so all I get is some wimpy end curl and not the volume at the root that drive me to set my hair in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well I tried them and first of all, the rollers got so hot they burnt my head.</li>
            <li> I used a setting spray for hot rollers and tried spraying my hair to keep the curl in but to no avail.</li>
            <li> I got these at a local drug store, and I love them.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, This was the first hot rollers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> ,the clips get hot too, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Need higher heat</li>
            <li> The set comes with enough clips as well (more than 3).</li>
            <li> The rollers literally fell out my first time using them.</li>
            <li> They get so hot</li>
            <li> So much faster for me than using a curling iron!</li>
            <li> it seems like way too many sets out there have massive curlers</li>
            <li> sooo pretty.</li>
            <li> i love that i dont have to sleep on a wet head full of curlers or a sock bun to get the look that i want.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and was g exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone who has the different lengths of hair for which this mish-mash of sizes would be appropriate.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying Hot Rollers off line.  </li>
            <li> I love \\&quot;big hair\\</li>
            <li> I love all the various sizes</li>
            <li> Hot rollers have been around forever, I really don&#x27;t understand why manufacturers cannot get it right.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are amazing :) I have long thick stubbern hair and this is the only thing that gives me gorgeous curls.</li>
            <li> If you are lucky enough to get the clips to work, be prepared to sit very still until the rollers are cool!</li>
            <li> This problem is easily solved by purchasing clips separately ($1-$3 for a set of 4) at any general merchandise store.</li>
            <li> After that, I just let it sit and cool for about 10 to 15 minutes, all at the comfort of being able to do other things like do my makeup or watch TV.  </li>
            <li> Which I work in a humid hot area where most hair will fall flat within an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Conair extreme gives me big beautiful curls for days.  </li>
            <li> The set is compact and attractive, and there are more than enough rollers included to set my thick, straight, just-past-shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Because of the smooth texture, I was able to wrap as much or as little hair around the rollers to work with my style.</li>
            <li> Other then that the curls stay for hours and they are nice and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I went back to using hot curlers that are just plastic which get much hotter and works much better in curling my hair</li>
            <li> Based on what other reviews have said, results depend on the kind of hair</li>
            <li> I use them to give body to my straight long hair and none of the sizes were suitable for that.</li>
            <li> Even though they do get hot fast, too hot to touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review by saying that I have been using hot rollers for over 20 years -- pretty much every day.  </li>
            <li> Related to this, good curls take a lot of time (though this depends on the length of your hair) and definitely a lot of patience.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and there are different size rollers which is perfect for my hair style, the only drawback is sometimes the rollers are a little hot to handle.  </li>
            <li> I guess the temperature gauge would be useful to some, but I just leave it on the &#x27;high&#x27; setting.</li>
            <li> I tried these because reviews seemed generally positive.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d give these guys a try (after reading a multitude of positive reviews).</li>
            <li> First I could not believe it, it is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I can take the first roller out, it works that fast.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast, and are EVENLY hot.  </li>
            <li> I really like my xtreme hot rollers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i think that&#x27;s pretty much all i can say about it.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of mousse and in fifteen to twenty minutes I have a gorgeous style.  </li>
            <li> My curls where so soft and full of body</li>
            <li> Whoever thought of these new clips hasn&#x27;t used hot rollers before!  </li>
            <li> I like to get a nice tight roll with the roller right up next to my scalp and then secure the roller when I set my hair.</li>
            <li> have very fine hair and not much of it.</li>
            <li> My very hair is fine, but very thick &amp; straight-so the curl lasts about 2 hours at best, and that&#x27;s with spray or other holding product.  </li>
            <li> If I roll the curls high enough on top of my head</li>
            <li> plastic that is easy to crack or break off, so be cautious when flipping it back and forth.</li>
            <li> After heating the first time, one of the rollers won&#x27;t even fit back onto the heating element.</li>
            <li> I suggesst thought that you heat it up for a pretty good time at least for 30 minutes</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t nearly strong enough to hold your hair in place.</li>
            <li> I think I will really enjoy these once I get used to the dry heat, and they do get hot!</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about it is that the clips are too large for the curlers, which means the curlers don&#x27;t stay rolled up all the way.</li>
            <li> The box for these rollers says it includes jumbo, large &amp; medium rollers.  </li>
            <li> The large ones are</li>
            <li> &quot; as advertised, the set came with large plastic clips which leave noticeable crimps in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The largest are not jumbo size but large.</li>
            <li> The set comes with \\&quot;8 jumbo, 6 large, 6</li>
            <li> However, I find myself wishing I had purchased the one with all large rollers.</li>
            <li> Three of the smart clips are located in the case and heat up with the curlers.  </li>
            <li> conair needs to design a clip that works on large rollers.</li>
            <li> My light never changed, so for the first few weeks I was rather perplexed as to when to start using the rollers.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had better clips from my older little conair hot roller and these now work like a charm.</li>
            <li> Several just slipped right out as I tried to secure them, even with small amounts of hair and they hung down instead of more secured to the scalp like they should for optimum curls.</li>
            <li> They look like they will be nice, but they don&#x27;t hold the hair quite as tight as I would like, and they leave a dent every.</li>
            <li> I had an older large set of hot rollers to compliment this set.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t generally have a lot of trouble with rollers falling out, these are otherwise very nice.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t heat up as good at all, and I didn&#x27;t like the smaller rollers,or the new style clips, so I sent it back too.</li>
            <li> There is a higher end model which is the Conair Ion Shine, and that particular model IS an ionic setter.</li>
            <li> These rollers are merely large, not JUMBO, but they don&#x27;t give curl so much as wave.</li>
            <li> , well, it actually gets hot pretty quickly, you just need to heat it for 5 minutes or so and it will be ready.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d be smart and get around this by putting the clip on the space left by a roller when I removed it, but that was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> She said she really liked them but that the top broke off and that makes it difficult to travel with them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While these do give a nice curl towards the bottom, the top looks all wrong.</li>
            <li> but I couldnt get ready for work with them.  </li>
            <li> it worked really well, the way it was supposed to work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers so save time getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this.</li>
            <li> They are really flimsy and won&#x27;t hold rollers in very well.</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars because it does heat up fast.  </li>
            <li> Also, the clips do not hold your hair very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> your hair is ready..</li>
            <li> To me that&#x27;s like selling a vase that doesn&#x27;t hold water very well.  </li>
            <li> They heat up fast and the curl stays all day.</li>
            <li> the velvet rollers don&#x27;t burn my finger tips, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair when I remove them</li>
            <li> That covering is very &amp;quot;chintzy&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> They heat up quite fast and I like the variety of sizes.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with something I probably won&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> They heat up really fast.  </li>
            <li> and she had much thicker hair than I do.  </li>
            <li> Also, invest in some of the cheap, old fashioned style pens that will hold the rollers in more firmly.</li>
            <li> They really do give my a hair a \\&quot;bounce\\&quot;, that it did not have before.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set  because my hair--thick, absolutely straight and body-less, but very fine--would not hold curling-iron curl.  </li>
            <li> The reason I keep the curlers is because my hair is waist length and pin straight.  </li>
            <li> I really like the clips.</li>
            <li> Now, I can transform myself between straight &amp; wavy any time I want without spending fortune to go to a hair dresser.</li>
            <li> The clips also didn&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li> I used it about ten times in 7 weeks and now the cheap plastic switch doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li> I use to spend almost 45 minutes curling my whole head with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> i rally really like this</li>
            <li> I really like Conair rollers.</li>
            <li> They leave a much tigher curl than I want.</li>
            <li> This product allowed me to put gentle curls in that stayed.</li>
            <li> The clips don&#x27;t work very well if at all, letting the rollers fall out of your hair.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t like these.  </li>
            <li> I will try to find someone who really does not want to have curly hair and give them this set....</li>
            <li> My hair is medium length and straight.</li>
            <li> These are so fast.</li>
            <li> They heat up in about 2 minutes and they&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li> IT IS VERY INFERIOR</li>
            <li> Replacement clip sets would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a 4.5 because my hair does curl very well.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to get up 3 hours before to get ready.</li>
            <li> I really like the Conair Ion Shine hair setter.  </li>
            <li> Thanks anyway    </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Takes much longer than 85 secs to heat up</li>
            <li> I wanted these ones as they are multisided, heated up fast and they have the felt material over the roller.</li>
            <li> Normally I would use the hot electric curlers</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to friends, it really can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay in very well.</li>
            <li> So, with budget out the window, I shelled out the $63.90 with free 2nd day Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> Because these did not work very well for me</li>
            <li> My only problem with the product is that the clips don&#x27;t fit around the curlers so it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair in place.</li>
            <li> In 5 minutes I have my hair ready.</li>
            <li> Much easier than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> and really there&#x27;s just a blunt edge to them which leaves a dent/crease in each curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks for the reviews, you have saved me some headaches.</li>
            <li> so you can really customize your style.  </li>
            <li> I do wish there were some jumbo size rollers in this set, and I don&#x27;t really like the clips that come with it.  </li>
            <li> but I could be putting in too much hair.  </li>
            <li> They do not hold the curlers in place very well at all.</li>
            <li> you soooooooooooo much.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up really fast.</li>
            <li> Better than expected...</li>
            <li> also the butterfly clips work very well.</li>
            <li> I really looked around and studied up before buying this.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much happier</li>
            <li> The color is much softer than pictured.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast, within about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks all for telling me that fact.</li>
            <li> Also, the clips leave dents; I much prefer the wire holders.  </li>
            <li> The heat is too much for the plastic on the bottom of the rollers.  </li>
            <li> This set does heat very well</li>
            <li> Hair is ready to go in five minutes, start to finish.</li>
            <li> but i find that i dont really have a problem with the clips that everyone complains about.</li>
            <li> , it costs too much.</li>
            <li> I really like it and praise the thought that went into the design.</li>
            <li> I was very disapponted.  </li>
            <li> This would make it much easier to go in and out to repeatedly put clamps on the warmer rungs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be taking a perm by end of the year, so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see if the fluff will stay on longer after the perm.</li>
            <li> heats up fast.</li>
            <li> These heat up fast.  </li>
            <li> Finally, and this is just personal preference, but it would be nice if the cord could be wrapped underneath for storage.</li>
            <li> I can use different combinations of roller sizes to come out with a bunch of different looks which is really nice.</li>
            <li> &quot; so this makes it nice &amp; fluffy after i take the rollers out.</li>
            <li> They also didn&#x27;t seem built to hold a decent amount of hair on the curler, it was just kind of a mess.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been very impressed with my hair (which is pretty dry and unhealthy</li>
            <li> The big plasic clips made the rollers super easy to remove and left no marks on my hair.    </li>
            <li> Love how my hair looks &amp; good for a lazy day since little work involved</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews about the clips not holding very well, and I can tell you I experienced the same issue at first too.</li>
            <li> The different sized barrels are great for long and short hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many from other brands but none worked with me and gave me salon results as CONAIR</li>
            <li> I purchased other U-shaped clips as they work better for me.  </li>
            <li> The end result is beautiful bouncy curls that last all day (I have really thick straight hair so for me</li>
            <li> I really like this product of Conair , its 3 different sets of sizes is suitable for different lengths of hair.</li>
            <li> The other thing I like to do is spray some hairspray while the rollers are in and with these clips is covers most all of the hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine streight hair shoulder length hair and after using the product for a week, I found the cutlers did not get hot enought for my hair to keep the curl, no matter how long I left them in.</li>
            <li> The packaging/instructions say they heat up in a few seconds - this is also not true - I would give them 5 minutes or more to reach a good heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because the edges aren&#x27;t raised, I found that my hair both slipped off the roller, and got caught in the gap where the roller sits onto the heating element - although that might possibly be solved by using the right clips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall it works fine, but not so satisfy with it being used when it suppose to be brand new</li>
            <li> My hair is silky and the older pins just didn&#x27;t stay in very well.</li>
            <li> The clips that secure the rollers get quite hot, so be careful where you place them on your head.</li>
            <li> The curlers have been better on my hair than the hot iron I was using everyday.  </li>
            <li> These rollers do a good job of curling my hair, and I like the three sizes, but the unit has some serious design flaws:  1)</li>
            <li> They feel very familiar because of the other set I have...</li>
            <li> i wash my hair at night - come it out and let it dry naturally to elimate in static.  </li>
            <li> I have also used it on my daughter&#x27;s fine long hair too!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get a smooth curl with these, although the curl doesn&#x27;t hold all that long anyway.  </li>
            <li> So while I&#x27;m in this long hair phase I will enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and it usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl long, but these work great on</li>
            <li> My mom owns an old conair hot rollers set which was dual voltage</li>
            <li> The hot rollers give my hair shiny, voluminous, and soft &amp;#34;romantic&amp;#34; curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I needed to replace the molecular curler set that finally wore out after about 12 years of tried and true service.  </li>
            <li> I simply open the plastic cover on that side to cool them a bit.</li>
            <li> Even though the indicator dot turns white in about a minute, the rollers are still quite cool.</li>
            <li> (The metal clips I already own are too small and shoot across the bathroom when I try to use them with this</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the poorest quality set of hot rollers I have ever bought.      </li>
            <li> The hot rollers do the job, except I use the clips from my old Remington set.</li>
            <li> I leave them in until they cool and then resist combing for my hair for until the last minute.</li>
            <li> The heat of the rollers is not as hot as my old Clairol Travel set</li>
            <li> so I use my old clips that look like claws instead that came with my hot shot rollers.</li>
            <li> My old one died after four years, and I got a new one right away.  </li>
            <li> The rollers never seem to get really hot, and the clips only fit properly on the large size rollers.  </li>
            <li> The plastic case covering over the rollers as you heat them should stay down to create the appropriate environment for the ion process to work.</li>
            <li> When I first opened up the box to this set of hot rollers, I though it was not going to last me long because it seemed cheap.</li>
            <li> - I usually use the &#x27;jumbo&#x27; and &#x27;medium&#x27; rollers from my other set, and these create good volume and nice loose curls.</li>
            <li> I just have to say that I like this new technology, with the fast heat up, the ionic ceramic rollers and the slit in the clips.</li>
            <li> The 3 sizes that this set comes with works for more of a shoulder length (or slightly longer)</li>
            <li> This all took less than 10 minutes and with practice, I&#x27;m sure would take about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Clips are easy to use,  but not very stable.  </li>
            <li> I am Asian so my hair straightens out really quickly</li>
            <li> The curls last all day and look even better the next day.  </li>
            <li> So, if you need to use a particular size again that isn&#x27;t the one with the dot</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what Conair was thinking trying to replace the clips for the curlers, these clips are no comparsion to the older claw clips and metal clips.  </li>
            <li> If you like big dents and ridges in the top of your hair left by the roller clips, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> In addition to my super fine hair, I have lots of layers, which usually don&#x27;t work with rollers.</li>
            <li> I purchased these hot rollers this past February in anticipation of some formal occasions coming up, and was pleased with the results they gave.    </li>
            <li> The curlers were not as thick as my last set, but they seem to work great.  </li>
            <li> Just a suggestion I think most people would prefer a regular address to send back returns.    </li>
            <li> I still have my older clips, so it worked out for me.</li>
            <li> The traditional electric roller pins are available on Amazon and the soft covering on this product&#x27;s curlers</li>
            <li> I bought my first Conair Hot rollers similar to this one which I used for over 25 years.</li>
            <li> It comes with only 3 clips which isn&#x27;t enough if you want to use more than three rollers at a time.</li>
            <li> They are too small and more importantly don&#x27;t get anywhere near hot enough.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to replace it with the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Hot Rollers, since I was interested in curlers that would heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to use hot rollers in the past.</li>
            <li> I was wary because of the lid comments, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be pleased.</li>
            <li> is more than enough to do my entire head.</li>
            <li> I did it because I had pins from an older set of rollers that I assumed would work.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use the ones included and do have to use older pins.  </li>
            <li> Conair Ion Shine rollers are very easy to use, take very little time (five to 10 minutes to heat, a few minutes to roll, and about 10 minutes running around the house looking like Medusa while they set) and the results are gorgeous, natural-looking and last all</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and flat with a bit of natural wave-I never knew what to do with it</li>
            <li> They fit fine on the bigger rollers, but they are still much too narrow to keep my super-straight hair from unwinding off the roller.</li>
            <li> I do have to use a little hair spray because I have very straight, baby fine shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> However, the sizes of the curlers are quite small and would be good for short hair in a very curly style.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken good care of my set, I never leave it on or forget to turn it off for long periods, and I can&#x27;t imagine it wearing out so quickly, especially because I only use them maybe twice a week.</li>
            <li> The first few uses, I found that they worked OK if I let them heat up a LONG time (20+ minutes or more) and left them in a LONG time (until the rollers were completely cool).  </li>
            <li> the clips do not hold tight to your head and on top of that the container holds 3 in with curlers and the remaining ones have to be put in a zip lock bag which means we would misplace at some point</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want tight curls against my head, I like the look of curls and waves more towards the lower 2/3 of my now shoulder-length</li>
            <li> I would recommend these highly.  </li>
            <li> My ancient Clairol curlers, made in the 70&#x27;s, lasted throughout high school, college, and graduate school.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this  roller set as it was from Conair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> The clips won&#x27;t secure your hair very well if you roll it the other way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set at Target yesterday and was excited to give it a try today as my old set from the 70&#x27;s finally stopped working.</li>
            <li> They put a large crimp in my hair near my scalp.  </li>
            <li> maybe something a little better since it has the Conair name on it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely sure that one of those little clippy deals is still stuck in a potted plant or embedded in plaster somewhere.  </li>
            <li> Spend a little bit more and get professtional ionic curlers.</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for a healthier alternative, and I ended up purchasing these hot rollers!</li>
            <li> These clips are too small; do not hold the rollers securely, and they are made of hard plastic which is not the most comfortable material.</li>
            <li> I have an older version that I needed to replace and the quality of this new set</li>
            <li> They were SO much easier to use than the ones with metal clips, they go in fast, come out fast, and I definitely had lots of body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick plastic, but I don&#x27;t see any need to be any thicker than it is....</li>
            <li> THE CLIPS SUPPLIED ARE USELESS, THEY FLY OFF THE ROLLER OR DON&#x27;T HOLD AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> This hair setter has a few short comings, but is still an overall great product.</li>
            <li> They hold OKAY but not fabulously.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands for decades - these rollers have a few issues</li>
            <li> I purchased these guys after the heating element on my last set of hot rollers broke; there weren&#x27;t a lot of options at retail, and these looked gentle and like the clips would hold.  </li>
            <li> The roller set is quick to heat and there are enough rollers for my hair (just past shoulder length, pretty fine, lots of layers).</li>
            <li> When I the curlers cool completely before removing them, my hair stays curly - even the next morning!</li>
            <li> Curling irons were just taking too long, so for the first time in years I decided to try hot rollers again.  </li>
            <li> but they are too heavy so not being able to \\&quot;anchor\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I spend few minutes to use them and I leave them for at most 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you are just looking to throw a few rollers in the bottom for wave or on the top for volume, this set might work for you.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever return items because it&#x27;s such a hassle.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I tried, the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds.</li>
            <li> rollers themselves are good, but not great</li>
            <li> This set does a wonderful job on my hair which goes down to the middle of my back with long layers and is naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li> curlers turn out okay, for the most part, if you can put up with the hassle and don&#x27;t mind them feeling all loose and shaky all over  your head.</li>
            <li> Once I started to hook it up and everything it heated up quite quick, but it made this sound like it was working really hard to heat the rollers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and it seems to work fine for other people on here.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no hard spiky bumps on the curlers.  </li>
            <li> I use the Conair super clips which I bought separately instead, would use my old wire clips if only I could find them.</li>
            <li> They actually work pretty well, so I found out that I don&#x27;t need to leave them in as long as I originally thought I did.</li>
            <li> So i have some other plastic clips that have a straight edge rather than rounded like these &amp; they seem to hold on better to the big rollers.</li>
            <li> A big one right on front that you couldn&#x27;t miss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying I was skeptical when I opened the box and felt the rollers which were very light and cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li> At this point, whether I heat them for five minutes or 25 minutes, I only wind up with a few curls, and most rollers don&#x27;t even heat enough to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hardly a professional, and was hoping hot rollers would be simple enough that I could set, cool, and go.</li>
            <li> I have a much older version of hot rollers that I have to replace after about 10 years and thought this would be the same thing as what I had.</li>
            <li> I wanted something better than foam rollers (which always made my curls too tight and took forever!)</li>
            <li> The clips fit the medium and large rollers, but the rollers still flop around on your head and are not secure at all.  </li>
            <li> The unit should come with the SMART Clips(Plastic Clips) but instead is supplied with cheap wire clips that do not secure your hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick fine hair that takes forever to blow dry and style, so to be able to just throw it up in curlers while I do</li>
            <li> Big improvement over the old hot rollers!</li>
            <li> They do not pull your hair, I was expecting larger rollers, but they do create a nice look, my hair is a little longer than shoulder lenght.</li>
            <li> I have used the same hot curlers for 30 years because none compared to the high heat.  </li>
            <li> However, one of the reasons I ordered this was because of the new types of clips that was advertised in the product description.</li>
            <li> Also, I live in the Philippines</li>
            <li> though it looks brand new</li>
            <li> and I was in need of a new set, since after a while the cushioning comes off and it burns the hair.</li>
            <li> I would want to return this item and get 100% refund or change to a new item.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the steam rollers, but couldn&#x27;t find any new ones.</li>
            <li> for this new set...</li>
            <li> and I decided to get a new set.</li>
            <li> I pinned up the top half of my hair (crown and bangs) and curled the back and sides, let them sit for about a minute, took those out, clipped that section to the side and took down the top of my hair... curled those and again, once the rollers were all in</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and  only takes 10 minutes to have a very curly hair.</li>
            <li> There are many videos teaching you how to take advantage of the open center.</li>
            <li> I have loooong thick straight healthy hair, and these rollers do not grip or curl well.</li>
            <li> I liked the claw clip rollers from my jumbo set and the old metal rollers from my previous set ( Loaned to my sister and never got it back).    </li>
            <li> so I am being extra careful not to break the top.</li>
            <li> In the 3rd or 4th months, the clips began slipping, and now the only ones that hold are the jumbos, which are really too big to do me any good.  </li>
            <li> I bought the smaller roller set because I recently cut my hair for the  spring/summer so the larger diameter set doesn&#x27;t really have enough hair to hold in nicely.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling these curlers work best with average hair that doesn&#x27;t go to far in either the super thick or super thin direction.</li>
            <li> Within the second month, one of the rollers became too hot to handle comfortably; now 3 release so much heat that my fingers burn when I use them, just like the ancient ones that would drip wax after a few years--not months.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight Asian hair - these clips do not hold the roller.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re even easy enough to use in a rush, so long as I plug them in ahead of time.</li>
            <li> The dot on the curlers turned white within the alloted time frame, but the curlers were not all hot and still had to wait 15 minutes.      </li>
            <li> Not to mention, there are too many small size curlers.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t recommend this product if you have a lot of hair because there&#x27;s not enough hot rollers</li>
            <li> Also, does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I used the largest barrels on the top roll of hair and medium on the sides and small barrels for the rest of my head.</li>
            <li> I may take them back to get a more expensive set that will do a better job.</li>
            <li> I have been using hot rollers since I was a teen.  </li>
            <li> The rollers don&#x27;t sit on pegs, they have a slit through the middle and you slide it onto a bar across the case, and that is how the roller heats, which is why it probably doesn&#x27;t get that hot.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> First - no blue clips came with it, as advertised.  </li>
            <li> either so no more burned fingers :-)</li>
            <li> these Conair hot rollers, it only takes me about 7 to 10 min prepping time to put all the rollers in my hair!</li>
            <li> I suspect this is because they do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Prior to this I owned a Clariol hot roller set for 20 years before it died.  </li>
            <li> Also wanted to order more small rollers but could not find them on your website or on Conair.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get or stay hot enough to cure.</li>
            <li> have impossible-to-curl hair (have done 3 in home perms with my hair looking exactly the same as to when I started them).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple different hot rollers</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended For Hot Rollers Only.</li>
            <li> The rollers do not get hot enough for the curl to stay.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hot enough by then.</li>
            <li> I let them sit about 30 seconds before begining to take them out, starting from the first one I put in.</li>
            <li> The different sized rollers have to be placed exactly the way the set comes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The actual curlers can sometimes be too hot to touch both when they come out of the heater and even after you put it in your hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t feel like they got hot enough to do anything.  </li>
            <li> I tried 2 different hot roller sets (Conair, Revlon) before arriving at this one.</li>
            <li> The plastic clips get REALLY hot and if you manage not to burn your fingers when you pick them up you&#x27;ll definitely feel the heat if they happen to touch your neck or ear.</li>
            <li> Though considering the other 2 sets I&#x27;ve tried this one definitely comes out on top.</li>
            <li> First I purchased a very similar item but that did not have the on and off</li>
            <li> Gets hot enough.</li>
            <li> so if yoy have naturally wavy/curly hair be cautious!</li>
            <li> this unit is pretty massive</li>
            <li> it pretty enough to leave out, it  heats up&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like a solid roller, but I was willing to give these a try.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> And the top doesn&#x27;t flip back like some of the other readers said, mine stays upright (for now)</li>
            <li> Gets pretty hot &amp; helps your curls get fast &amp; firm.  </li>
            <li> Indicator light for hot rollers too dull.</li>
            <li> The roller heats up fairly quickly, but can get a little too hot, so I usually open one side of the cover when I&#x27;m ready to roll.</li>
            <li> I found  that I did not like the new version as well as the old.  </li>
            <li> During my first and subsequent attempts, I was able to maintain my curls and my hair was less frizzy than when I use regular rollers.</li>
            <li> The clips also did not secure the rollers onto my head as every time I moved the clips allowed a lot of movement and some would easily fall out.</li>
            <li> Also, while I really liked the concept of heated clips, they were difficult to handle b/c they were so hot.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the same exact clips that came with my old roller set.</li>
            <li> I finally got a chance to use them for the first time today and all I can say is WOW.....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter that they only give you enough room to place 3 at a time on the heating elements, because as you take one off to use, just replace it with a cool one.</li>
            <li> I asked about obtaining a set of metal clips that are similar to the old fashioned hot roller clips and she offered to sell them to me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other kind of clip other than what is sold with the set.</li>
            <li> (but i have super thin, fine</li>
            <li> heat on bothsides was a good idea but not for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> There are too many small and not enough large rollers for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not heat up as fast and whereas the old had a high and low setting this</li>
            <li> only reason I gave it a 4 is that they are very hot in your hand making it more difficult to apply when you lack hot roller experience.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price; however the clips dont secure the hair tightly around the rollers as i have seen in more expensive sets</li>
            <li> I have fine to average hair that hits just below my shoulders and usually holds a curl easy, with these rollers my hair had lost 100% of the curl after just 60 minutes and</li>
            <li> I ordered the Conair Shine Instant Heat Hair Setter which was the same hair setter I had purchased a few years ago, because I was very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The adjustment on the heat setting allows for a wide range of heat, with the highest setting getting very hot.  </li>
            <li> Being able to work with multiple curls make it slight faster than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Usually the curls fall out of my hair pretty quickly</li>
            <li> never would have guessed but these made my (usually) inbetween-textured, usually dull hair, look and feel SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> Even running a hair brush over them did not mess them up!</li>
            <li> These grey clips work better for the other size rollers just not the largest.  </li>
            <li> It was the same problem, the clips would not keep curler tight in place close to the head and many times fell out.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold the curler in as tight as I would like and sometimes leave dents in my hair especially if I curl it under like I like to do with the top layer.  </li>
            <li> The large rollers could have bee bigger but worked</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smart clips they leave kinks in your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering how cheap these rollers are, I don&#x27;t regret buying them, but they do take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I first started using these, because the curl was pretty tight.</li>
            <li> They heat up very fast and I can have my long hair up in rollers in about 10mins.  </li>
            <li> My hair is hard to curl, but it is like magic after I put it on for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Also, it was hard to get the clips to hold my hair on the jumbo curlers, so I may order more of those.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that I need more large ones than what is included in this set.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the smart clips leave some crimping at the top roots of my hair, not the lower curls.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU COULD OPEN THE LID, BECAUSE IT&#x27;S KIND OF HARD.</li>
            <li> This is a nice option for different styling for my very thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would inprove is more space to heat up clips at one time but other than that I am a fan forever!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all with the cheap plastic clips that are suppose to hold the curlers in place, they flip all over the place and leave creases in what should be a smooth curl.  </li>
            <li> When I received this item it was clear that it had been repackaged.</li>
            <li> had to get out old clips to make it stay.</li>
            <li> I almost forgot, some people mentioned that it comes with wire clips, at least mine came with butterfly clips. :)</li>
            <li> These curlers were a complete disappoinment.  </li>
            <li> is nothing like the old ones.  </li>
            <li> I replaced an old Conair with the wire clips with this.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to save time, not waste it.</li>
            <li> Wow that this works for me...</li>
            <li> it is I really wanted bigger curlers.  </li>
            <li> The teeth are just too short to really dig in and hold well.</li>
            <li> The clips actually hold my hair really well.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though I&#x27;m not burning my hair up when I use these rollers with their soft flocking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old to bother with that now.  </li>
            <li> Second - doesn&#x27;t curl very well.</li>
            <li> These rollers are much easier to use than I initially thought they would be.  </li>
            <li> If I use anything larger my hair will return to being pin straight in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li> but wow whne</li>
            <li> I had to use the clips from my old set.</li>
            <li> I even tried on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> The straight hair is what my hair looked like AFTER I left the curlers in for 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I told my husband not to get rid of the box as I really had a feeling they would be going back.  </li>
            <li> Still, its not enough to bother me too much.  </li>
            <li> The clips do leave marks in my hair but fade fast enough to not bother me.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of curlers because my old set was just that - OLD.  </li>
            <li> However, now I&#x27;m heating up both sets, and FINALLY I can relax and set my hair the way I really WANT to!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not hunting around for the matching clip like in the old days.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product even got as far as the store shelf.</li>
            <li> AND AS FAR AS THE LID</li>
            <li> BUT AS FAR AS HOW THEY CURL YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> -- even professional stylists can&#x27;t get my hair to hold a curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really hope someone can get back to me the ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls last.</li>
            <li> idid not like it as mutch as my old one did notr like the claps</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Babyliss Professional Model BABHS40.</li>
            <li> How much would it have cost to add on a tiny plastic clip or two?  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t damage the hair the way the old products did.</li>
            <li> In short I really like the rollers on this set, however the clips suck.</li>
            <li> Combine that with the frizziness that this set produces and you end up with a pretty strange looking</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but I&#x27;ve always had a problem with frizz and my curls having a uniformed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the largest size rollers for a natural looking curl.  </li>
            <li> Further, the clips feel kinda flimsy and do not hold the roller in place very well.</li>
            <li> Mine is shortish and I have to use the wire clips from old set.</li>
            <li> The old set had metal pins.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have never gotten rid of my old set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly bald, at least far more than I would like so clearly</li>
            <li> They do heat up fast, but there is no storage place for all the extra clips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of roller sets, and I like this one the best, even if the clips are worthless.</li>
            <li> But alas, if it sounds too good to be true, than it usually is.</li>
            <li> It does give good curl, when the clips finally hold....but so frustrating.  </li>
            <li> DOUBLE WOW!!!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;(if you are Australian like me or from other countries that don&#x27;t have the same power adapter as in America be sure to get a universal power adapter from your local shopping center with this purchase :) )</li>
            <li> Only one roller changes the color dot to show when heated and you have to heat the outer clips individually on the three spaces provided at the far right.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and it curled my full head with two rollers still left over.</li>
            <li> It seems almost impossible to find good hot rollers anymore.</li>
            <li> It took me 20 minutes the most transforming from long, thick straight hair to bouncy soft wavy.     </li>
            <li> At least three times while putting hot rollers in my hair- one of the clips will slip and a hot roller with go crashing to the bathroom floor (which causes they to chip!).</li>
            <li> my hair is straight but flat</li>
            <li> The only way to avoid this is to use insanely small amounts of hair, which would take more rollers than this has.</li>
            <li> Second time to buy this product, gave the first one to my daughter so had to buy a second one for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is layered at the end, up about 2 inches, and I mainly use the big rollers to curl/flip up the ends and to add body to the rest.</li>
            <li> They heat up in less than 2 minutes (and get SUPER hot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok (just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;) for about a month, then they don&#x27;t get hot anymore and are useless.  </li>
            <li> IT GETS SO HOT AFTER ONLY A SHORT TIME BEING ON</li>
            <li> With super straight hair, it&#x27;s really hard to find a way to curl my hair without a crease.</li>
            <li> Other than that they do curl well with the right clips to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> But the seller or company sold this product to me, clearly stated that it is a BRAND NEW ITEM, but when I open the box, there was hair in it,</li>
            <li> I have very little curls and a huge dent.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally they get tangled in my hair because of their design, even though I remove them carefully, but that doesn&#x27;t happen super often.  </li>
            <li> This is especially true if you have thick and/or long hair; the slits in the curlers can easily catch stray strands of hair and create frustrating messes of tangles.</li>
            <li> I used them for the first time today and they have lasted all day long!!!</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair for almost 20 years and would like to have some wave to match a dress to be worn on my sister&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
            <li> STILL WORK IF AS LONG AS YOUR NOT JUMPING UP AND DOWN,THE CURLERS HEAT UP REALLY FAST</li>
            <li> The curl is exactly what I was looking for and expected.  </li>
            <li> and I had to spray the dickens out of it with hairspray to calm down the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting the purpler set which comes with large and extra large rollers if you only want loose curls and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and is hot enough to curl the hair either dry or slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought the Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers - these came with metal, not</li>
            <li> I wanted to go back to curling my hair the way I remember doing it before all the new types.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this some time ago, but when new, for some reason I never used it.&lt;br /&gt;Pulled it out of the cabinet to try it again, and only ONE curler heated</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had long enough hair for hot rollers for a while.</li>
            <li> but they do need to warm longer than I expected, especially once you have used them all and need to put a few back in to complete the curling.</li>
            <li> SO many of the negative comments left for this product were from misuse.</li>
            <li> provided clips are convenient in that they&#x27;re all the same size; but, they&#x27;re really too big for the smallest-sized rollers.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the Conair Ion Shine Instant Heat Hair Setter, but they obviously never had them in stock in the 1st place</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the rollers once so far but for someone that&#x27;s completely inept and using stuff like this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get a different set of clips for the biggest ones since I really like the set overall.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 of these conair setters and the Caruso stayed in my thick hair and it was easy.</li>
            <li> so the claim that it controls frizz is false at best.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly there are only 3 warmers for the plactic clips so you can&#x27;t warm all the clips at once.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to use this product because I usually straighten my hair and wanted to switch it up.  </li>
            <li> She uses the jumbo ones almost everyday because these ones are a bit small and she wants more of a wavy look.  </li>
            <li> them at the scalp/root makes the whole curler/clip combo fall loose and kid of hang about 2 inches from where they should be.</li>
            <li> the product itself is small enough to be convenient for easy storage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d watched some demonstrations with this particular kit on youtube and was intrigued, but it was double the price at my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I paid nearly $39 for this product and found same exact product at local retailer for nearly $10 less brand new.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I have short hair and could really seriously use some more of the small and medium rollers, but they aren&#x27;t available in stores or online.</li>
            <li> Not sure why such a huge price increase</li>
            <li> I am also upset at Folica in general.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with curls falling out of my hair, so I shouldn&#x27;t have expected so much from this.</li>
            <li> I tried them out and did not like them near as well as the blue ones.</li>
            <li> I only left them in for 10 minutes so the curls did not last the whole night.</li>
            <li> (so far, I been using only for 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> Also, the rollers themselves are somewhat smaller than my old set.</li>
            <li> so personally I would not waste my money on the Babyliss brand again.</li>
            <li> WHERE THE SOFT METERIAL ISNT COVERING,IVE ONLY USED IT ONCE</li>
            <li> It was finally time for me to update my old Conair set.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*these give me really soft, romantic curls.</li>
            <li> You can pull the tail of your hair into the open center of the hot roller.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers, Pink from the seller called &amp;#34;Gourmet Kitchen Gallery&amp;#34; on May 11, 2013.</li>
            <li> This Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Roller in pink are meant to curl you hair.</li>
            <li> Tired of foam rollers and waiting for your hair to set in two or more hours?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get the curler to stay with the clip, and when I could, I was almost guaranteed a nice crease where the clip met up with my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, getting more so all the time.  </li>
            <li> The old style wire clips held much more securely and were less awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> I hate these new clips, but I tried using my claw clips from my jumbo set and the hot rollers leave a nice curl with them.  </li>
            <li> I went back a second time thinking it would be a matter of getting used to a new product.</li>
            <li> They are also very heavy when you have a head full of them.  </li>
            <li> These are typical hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> they were not hot enough to leave a hot curl executed look at all not those spring bouncy curls when you unroll just a wave with curl at end</li>
            <li> Super small rollers...</li>
            <li> I have trashed perfectly adequate electric rollers in the past when I couldn&#x27;t find their clips.</li>
            <li> Too heavy to stay in tight with these barely gripping clips.</li>
            <li> They burn your fingers as you try to secure them and just do not seem big or round enough to cover the entire roller around your hair.</li>
            <li> I too have used Conair hot rollers in the past and I really liked my compact jumbo roller set, unfortunately it was now in need to be replaced since it was over 10 years old and the lid was cracked.  </li>
            <li> Overall the product works very well, but how long will they last me, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s no way to protect yourself other than to wear silicone mitts), the curlers absolutely would not stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> Also I will be very cautious to make other orders in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is just a hot mess.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re bending over to find them, and even more of them spring out of your head causing your long (but still straight) hair to cascade down into your eyes, making the search for the pesky little devils that much harder still.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the clips will shoot across the room like bullets and become almost impossible to find, while the lovely pink rollers clatter to the floor and manage to roll under any available surface</li>
            <li> I basically used this item for less than 10 times then left it in a dry and clean place in my bedroom.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the thick, coarse side, so perhaps that&#x27;s why I don;t have a huge problem with them staying in place.</li>
            <li> I wanted multiple roller sizes, but it seems like the diameter of these rollers are smaller than my old set.  </li>
            <li> It is not worth the money as the rollers don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> So if there were better clips I would give a full rating, but I&#x27;m really disappointed with the design.</li>
            <li> Before you blame the hot rollers for not working, look up tutorials online, practice a little, and try again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a little unsure how to use hot rollers just look up a tutorial online and then get these.</li>
            <li> I found this set as a replacement, expecting to receive generally the same set.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave them in longer because I love tight curls.</li>
            <li> the only thing that if you have a thin hair like me and want to keep your curls for a long time i would recommend a hair spray , but not too strong , you can spray your hair and use the rollers, than after you are done, you can just spray it to all your hair from a distance and you are done!</li>
            <li> Actually they get a little too hot for me</li>
            <li> The rollers are nice with the stay cool ends and flocking, but the clips are awkward to use and too big for the small rollers.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the previous design.  </li>
            <li> When I went to my hairdresser 3 weeks after I&#x27;d been using them, she was surprised at how dry my hair was...</li>
            <li> I have long wavy-curly coarse hair and after drying my  hair and rolling it up, the hairsetter leaves my hair tamed, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;re correct; my review was of the Conair Ion Shine Instant Heat Hairsetter, which is predominantly cornflower blue in color and, apparently, discontinued.</li>
            <li> While they will hold the smaller rollers on they tend to slip and can barely manage the big rollers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat hot enough to curl anything, hair falls limp rapidly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;*ends are too hot on bare hands, im not sure how often i&#x27;d be using these without that</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair to begin with, so these rollers really make my hair curly when I use the medium or occasional small sizes.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted the rollers to give me both volume and loose natural looking curls .</li>
            <li> With waist-length straight hair of medium thickness, tight curls are just not an option.  </li>
            <li> Because the clips slip so much, the curl is limited to the ends of my hair, so I look a little like the old Midge doll.  </li>
            <li> One back log about it is , you might want to leave it for a considerable amount of time to make it hot enough , it says 10 mins of the box , but leave it for at least 20 mins</li>
            <li> need to admit that my hair is hard to handle and sometimes it might be complicated to roll it properly on the curlers, besides the fact that you&#x27;ll burn your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful enough, but in overall is a great product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they came in a little pouch, which is made of very flimsy material.  </li>
            <li> but they do leave little dents in my hair if I put too much hair on the rollers.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have had is the edges get a little too hot to touch if left on too long.</li>
            <li> It was hard to roll them right</li>
            <li> But it might curl your hair if it is not fine or straight.</li>
            <li> Yes they will burn your fingers if you touch the hot part, Yes if you drop the whole set the lid might crack (someone actually made that complaint!!)</li>
            <li> Not hot enough to redirect my natural curl.</li>
            <li> So, in the middle of the curl, there is an occasional flat \\&quot;whip\\&quot; mark.  </li>
            <li> I just wish there were a few more larger rollers and a few less smaller rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and have been using rollers for FOREVER, I have never had a problem with another other type of roller set.</li>
            <li> my hair was extremely frizzzy and the curls complete drooped</li>
            <li> I have long hair, but it would likely do the same for short hair.  </li>
            <li> The biggest problem is the clips - they are totally worthless - do not hold long hair to the curler and actually fly across the room when asked to do so, and they create lines where they actually DO hold.  </li>
            <li> And the rollers are too small for my hair, which is above shoulder-length; I want just lift and gentle curl</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to figure out which way they fit, and I usually have two rollers left that won&#x27;t fit back into the unit.   </li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair and there aren&#x27;t enough of the medium sized rollers, I can only do about one side of my head and that uses them all.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of really long hair, and I did not have enough rollers to do all my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (mid back)</li>
            <li> I have course thick but relaxed hair these rollers give me big bouncy curls and the prefect roller set ever , the only con is that I need more rollers then the unit has because my hair is so thick I have to roll smaller section so the clips will stay on</li>
            <li> They heat slow, and have to many small curlers.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair which is curl resistant but this hot curler set handles it with ease.  </li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble with them in my hair and sorta slipping off therefore having the hot rollers against my neck and face.</li>
            <li> It took a little over a week to get used to the metal clip, but I&#x27;ve noticed a definite new shine to my hair</li>
            <li> but I have to use the really small curlers just to get large curls.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is that the curlers don&#x27;t quite get as hot as she would want, and the curls don&#x27;t last quite as long.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, putting the rollers in gets less awkward with practice.</li>
            <li> so far today my curls have lasted for 5 hours--a record as they usually last less than 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with hot rollers and so far it hasn&#x27;t been too bad.  </li>
            <li> So the box should really say it includes medium, small &amp; super-small sizes.  </li>
            <li> (I usually don&#x27;t even have that much luck with a curling iron.)</li>
            <li> went to work from 10-4 and with a small touch of sebastian hair spray, my curls lasted through out the whole day.</li>
            <li> no matter how long I left them heat up</li>
            <li> Without a perm, my hair just falls flat and won&#x27;t hold a hair style.</li>
            <li> then my hair goes flat.</li>
            <li> curls does not stay long enough.</li>
            <li> long hair is back in style...</li>
            <li> I wish I could speak to how well the rollers work, but I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in long enough to find out.</li>
            <li> They never stayed in long enough for me to see how well the curlers worked.</li>
            <li> I personally like the flocked rollers, and these curl even the ends of long hair without kinking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering how long these are going to last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different construction, where there&#x27;s just a long metal row the rollers slide on to.</li>
            <li> My hair falls just below the shoulders, and it&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> The clips are large plastic claws that are hard to open and the heating feature of the clips requires you to heat two at a time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set to replace another Conair set of hot rollers that must have been at least 30 years old and passed down to me by my mother.  </li>
            <li> All the other hot rollers I used in the past would lock in curl that would last for days...</li>
            <li> , I wound up buying another set for everyday use and put the one with the snapped lid in the new set&#x27;s box.</li>
            <li> I have very long bleach blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I used the old wire clips from my previous set, however, the rollers do not heat the hair all the way through without the clips (and there is not room for both).  </li>
            <li> I just wish I had kept the old wire pins from a previous set.</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to break off at an alarming rate, but when I switched to these flocked curlers and used a lower heat, the situation improved enormously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although flocked like the larger - fast heating as well (crazy fast!)</li>
            <li> so a 3 star review went to 5 stars for both the curlers (which heat up CRAZY fast, the flocking also keeps them from tangling in your hair when you take them out) and for Conair&#x27;s customer service (I think it is in Mexico because I called twice, I accidentally hung up the first time) and both times they were different women but</li>
            <li> I miss my old rollers, which had the velvety cover on the roller and a softer heat that seemed to do less damage to my long hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually I use my rollers until they wear out, but I am going to donate these to the Salvation Army along with a NEW box of clips!</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers after reading other reviews, both good and bad.</li>
            <li> so the clip design is a little looser than my old set clips</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I like the felt material rollers as much as the rubber or hard plastic ones.  </li>
            <li> I have hard to curl stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really inconvenient (and not as safe) to have to plug them in/</li>
            <li> I have long (to my wrists) hair, and needed to curl it for a show.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to take a long time to heat up, though I didn&#x27;t time it.      </li>
            <li> I spend so long trying to curl my hair but sometimes have no time to go to a salon or do it myself....</li>
            <li> but if you need a mid-size like I do - it doesn&#x27;t take long to reheat the curler for re-use in seconds.  </li>
            <li> Only minus I can see because there is no place to store clips except plastic bag, otherwise it is</li>
            <li> This might be because they don&#x27;t have long teeth.</li>
            <li> When I use the rollers it takes twice as long and the curls aren&#x27;t guaranteed to stay, unless I use hairspray.  </li>
            <li> my long hair got tangled in the opening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT these did not work well on my long thicker hair at all.</li>
            <li> I have long relaxed hair</li>
            <li> Finally, they&#x27;re pink.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly past my shoulders and normal thickness.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight, processed, long hair that is so thick I&#x27;ve always needed two sets of rollers.</li>
            <li> For me, by far the most annoying feature is the \\&quot;split\\&quot; in the middle of the roller.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, straight, just below shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> These clips are absolute garbage and do not hold my thick, wavy hair at all.</li>
            <li> (I have naturally straight, thick hair.)  </li>
            <li> The clips are not nearly large enough for the rollers {which are themselves not large enough}.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get the right product after sending the wrong curlers back for second time.</li>
            <li> I needed a new set of curlers because the set I had didn&#x27;t have enough rollers for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is weird, because my hair is normally really easy to curl, and it stays until I wet my hair.  </li>
            <li> But, like some of the other reviews, the fluff doesn&#x27;t really last once you hit the air, especially living in San Francisco with the fog-moisture</li>
            <li> Yes if your hair is extremely thick and long the plastic clips may not be big enough to hold the roller in place, Yes if your hair is super thin and short you may have difficulty keeping them in place, and Yes there is a place to store the clips - its called a vanity drawer (or even a zip lock bag would do the trick!!)</li>
            <li> and I was convinced they wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my thick and heavy long hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that (which isn&#x27;t really a big problem)</li>
            <li> , What I received was Extreme instant heat hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely believe that this is due to my hair, rather than the product</li>
            <li> This is the only type of curler I use, the other type don&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has little time on their hands, but still wants  a polished finish everyday.</li>
            <li> I would definitely not recommend this product due to the instability of the rollers.  </li>
            <li> I gave the rollers 15 minutes to heat up and after rolling I left them in for 20 mins while I did other stuff.</li>
            <li> They are a little more complicated to use than need be</li>
            <li> The tiny ones are so small they would only work for very short hair.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase hot rollers initially because I have awkward, layered, SUPER thick, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> Putting them back in order is awkward as they have to be fit onto a holder  2.</li>
            <li> I put in some gel, blow dry and then put in the rollers-</li>
            <li> See, I have relatively thin hair on top of my head, and thick hair on the bottom</li>
            <li> The customer service operator was not helpful, rude and refused to let me talk to her supervisor or any one in authority, other then repeating I will have to pay for these supposedly supplied Smart Clips.</li>
            <li> single.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and curls my hair, but the curlers are slippery and make it difficult for me to wrap my hair around them, giving my strange kinks at the end of the strands.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that the clips are not strong enough so sometimes they hang loose....</li>
            <li> However, the constant use is quite damaging, and I waste TONS of hairspray to get the style not to go flat.</li>
            <li> Although my hair was long enough to wrap around the small rollers properly, it didn&#x27;t curl.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normally NOT frizzy but this produced frizz</li>
            <li> rollers stay loose and fall  off.  </li>
            <li> Tried countless times but curl only lasted a few hours, deffinately not one day!</li>
            <li> The curls don&#x27;t last long either...only a few hours.</li>
            <li> If I use the small and medium curlers all over and then go back over my entire head with the curling iron, I have celebrity curls all day.  </li>
            <li> I only use half the .clips</li>
            <li> Should have stuck with the metal clips, not only do they hold the curler to your head, but take up less room if need to travel with them.</li>
            <li> I had my previous set for over 4 years &amp; used daily.</li>
            <li> and I had to use different sizes, which ended up looking pretty weird.</li>
            <li> A little bit difficult, and not as big as I wanted, but for small rollers its ok.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair - try the larger roller model - these would be way to small for long hair./&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have long hair - try the larger roller model - these would be way to small for long hair.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of rollers for doing long (but not super long)</li>
            <li> It takes just a few minutes to heat up and the soft velvet lining on the rods make it less damaging to hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have noticed the same if I blow dry my hair with one of those ion round brushes too, so I think it is the ion thing that makes them not work.</li>
            <li> The only pitfall is the lid can not close tightly.  </li>
            <li> She finally got one out that she could put in her hair and got one good curl out of &lt;br /&gt;the deal, but is very disappointed.</li>
            <li> which are just a little cooler than the roller, so \\&quot;cool\\&quot; is relative).</li>
            <li> Only a little afterward for finishing.</li>
            <li> The clip style holders don&#x27;t hold as well and puts too much slack on the curl, thus resulting in a loose sloppy curl.</li>
            <li> my favorite part is even when you apply them badly</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go back to the wax curlers though, or at least something without the split in the middle and shell out the money for a 30 piece set.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you have to keep putting the clips on the posts to heat them, as there is only enouh room for three clips to heat, seems like there should be a place for all the clips to heat at once instead of using one, replacing it, using another, replacing it, etc.</li>
            <li> The edges of the curler are rough and tend to get caught in my hair.</li>
            <li> I received the pink rollers - which is what is now pictured on the website.</li>
            <li> Once again, I received the pink ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected....</li>
            <li> All I have to do is plug it in waitr a few minutes, put the rollers on and by the time the last roller is placed</li>
            <li> I spent $30.</li>
            <li> When traveling, just be careful how you pack it.   </li>
            <li> (I have the pink one because it supports breast cancer).  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get wet.  </li>
            <li> Work as expected.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this specifically for the wide clips for my wife&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> When my hair is wet</li>
            <li> After comparing a few different brands and kinds, settled on these....</li>
            <li> I gave these 4 stars because the clips they come with suck and cover does not stay tightly closed.</li>
            <li> Clips for rollers and rollers are too heavy for short hair.</li>
            <li> I was told to pack it up and drop it off at a UPS shipping center if I didn&#x27;t want the set.</li>
            <li> so finding a product that actually works for my hair is a blessing even if it has a few problems.</li>
            <li> all I was left with was limp hair covered in \\&quot;dents\\&quot; from the dang clamps!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no problem with these.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to wet them and blow them out.  </li>
            <li> I cut my hair into a short bob a few months ago and it&#x27;s now medium length.</li>
            <li> but then it became too heavy for the larger rollers and it would slide off.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have a mousse or some sort of spray, they might not stay that long, but generally they&#x27;ll stay for a couple of hours if you have thick hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I tired them on my daughter who has thin hair and they stayed in better on her</li>
            <li> They leave bad dents in my hair and just barely hold the rollers in if I&#x27;m lucky.  </li>
            <li> I am a total failure when it comes to doing anything hair related</li>
            <li> These clips were certainly NOT the solution.</li>
            <li> The springs are not strong enough to hold the rollers into place.  </li>
            <li> Medium are medium small and smalls are about the same or a little smaller.</li>
            <li> These heat up in 30 seconds and have enough heat to curl my hair in 30mins with really tight curls which my hair is down almost to my butt</li>
            <li> I have hair that is naturally a little wavy, I usually have no trouble holding a curl.</li>
            <li> The curls gets quite tight if you have médium long hair.</li>
            <li> The design of the rollers - with a gap all the way through - means you are grabbing close to metal and the heat can be high to the tough.</li>
            <li> before you put them at least i do cause I have thin and fine hair which is hard to keep the curles I have recently had hair extension removed and bleached and colored</li>
            <li> I tried different clips and they held, but when I unrolled the clip the curl that it created was very tight and suzy q like.  </li>
            <li> only negative, and it&#x27;s a minor one,</li>
            <li> My only tip is to use a little hair spray on the hair before wrapping the hair in the curlers!</li>
            <li> Once the curler is in, it is impossible for the cheap, plastic clips to hold it securely so it partially unrolls and flops around.</li>
            <li> By the time I go around curling my entire head, half of it is already going limp.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I like the rollers and the fact that it heats up very quickly; however, the clips to keep the rollers in are terrible.  </li>
            <li> well, its a pain and not a pretty hairstyle after.</li>
            <li> I spray it with hairspray (Aussie Extreme Hold), curl it, spray it again, let it set in the rollers, undo and spray it again,</li>
            <li> I saw some other reviews so I in advance bought other clips.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands, and have been sorely disappointed in all but Conair.  </li>
            <li> I had to take them out and put them in other containers so it was easier to get them when I needed them.    </li>
            <li> Furthermore, there&#x27;s no clip storage other than those three--</li>
            <li> I use them with my other curlers.</li>
            <li> I bought this the other day and they were $22.77 w/ Prime Shipping.  </li>
            <li> When I do try to be &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s extremely time consuming for me to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the other reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li> so she&#x27;d have enough small and medium rollers.</li>
            <li> AS WELL AS OTHER SETS I&#x27;VE HAD.</li>
            <li> I have to use other clips to hold rollers in place.</li>
            <li> The warmed clip heats the other end of the hair that&#x27;s not held on by the rollers and keeps the curl intact from start to the clip.</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers that the clips can cause creases in your hair</li>
            <li> the heck are you suppose to store the clips when not in use?&lt;br /&gt;*Cheap and flimsy rollers (due to the way they are suppose to be heated)&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to work for my hair type as it did for other people.</li>
            <li> I use clips from other roller sets.   </li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews, so I was concerned the pins wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair.  </li>
            <li> i bought other conair clips that are supposed to keep the curlers in place</li>
            <li> that you can lift one side of the unit to take out a roller while not losing any heat from the other side.</li>
            <li> Extreme heat in 75 seconds?</li>
            <li> Agree with other posts that the clamps leave a dent, bought some wire ones</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even compare the rollers aren&#x27;t the same size they are way too small to give any sort of curl.</li>
            <li> so I returned one set and kept the other I went with Revlons multi sized roller set.</li>
            <li> I have to use my other Conair clips to hold the curlers in place.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any of the big rollers, just the small and medium sized ones.</li>
            <li> I chose to order this despite other reviews saying the clips for the curlers don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I first was not impressed when I took out the clips.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thick hair that is a little kinky, runs down to my mid back, and reponds well to styling.</li>
            <li> AND YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BURN YOURSELF ON THE METAL CLIPS</li>
            <li> A LITTLE LOOSE BUT</li>
            <li> they were super disappointing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the clips a few times, but since my hair is so thick, I prefer my old pins.  </li>
            <li> Obviously nothing has broken yet but it seems to be sturdy enough and everything heats up as it should.</li>
            <li> I have had many sets of curlers, and theses are by far the worst.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that my fingers did get a little burnt from the rollers but a few people told me they just wear gloves while putting them in, I think I will try that next time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed by the quality of this stuff, even I loved how my hair looked like after using it.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have commented that the case is fragile - I am used to that and therefore treat it delicately</li>
            <li> Not hot enough to get my thick hair to curl.</li>
            <li> The jumbo size in this set is about half the size of the other jumbo rollers.  </li>
            <li> Stars due to less heat (although sufficient)</li>
            <li> The only bad thing,  like any hot roller, you get damaged hair, even if it is Ionic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything to review, as I ordered this hair setter twice, and both times was sent the wrong thing.  </li>
            <li> The only negative for this set are the clips.  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed a very recent reviewer complained her set did not have an on/off switch.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the clips.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually have any negative comments at all.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that the pins to hold the curlers SUCK.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to do it, but I feel like I&#x27;m in the dark ages.</li>
            <li> I think the majority of the negative comments were folks who were looking for something very specific and found that this set was not it.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get it to to work for me</li>
            <li> The teeth are only 1/8\\&quot; thick.</li>
            <li> Love the rollers, hate the clips.</li>
            <li> I really hate that part more than anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more an idiot on styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use the larger curlers since i have very long and very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I got down.  </li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s because the clip presses down on my hair and smooths it out.</li>
            <li> The clips do not hold the rollers well, they just slid down.  </li>
            <li> The covering doesn&#x27;t wear down, even after years of use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this unit on Amazon for $32 and now it is down to $22.  </li>
            <li> Day after I ordered, the set goes  down in price $5.</li>
            <li> Curlers are loose, slip a lot and have to be reclipped (and I have regular hair, not ultra thin).  </li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s thick and now a little above my shoulders...</li>
            <li> I use some of my &amp;#34;old clip&amp;#34; that I have from my previous Roller Kit.</li>
            <li> I have been using curlers to set my hair since I was at least in middle school, so I&#x27;ve been through quite a few sets.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to use any with these plastic clips, rather than the traditional metal U shaped pins and needless to say, I will stick with the traditional pin sets from now on.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s weird that it&#x27;s so much more expensive now.</li>
            <li> They made my hair SLIGHTLY wavy.</li>
            <li> I HAD the plastic u shaped snap on clips from my previous conair set that i used for a while, but when they disapeared (think hubby threw them out)</li>
            <li> These are so small, I have to use such small sections of hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Velvet/flocked rollers for less damage to hair</li>
            <li> and I felt like I was getting something less.  </li>
            <li> I am in disbelief that this happened to me twice in less than one week.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this unit less than a year and it did curl hair.  </li>
            <li> It takes about an hour and a half to do all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and have used it for less than 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Found them on sale at Kmart for half the price I paid.</li>
            <li> (One less thing to clutter my space.)      </li>
            <li> Seriously, I want my money back ASAP!</li>
            <li> No more sagging or slipping of rollers when I put them in.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty desperate for some volume</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t curl her hair!\\&quot;  because that&#x27;s not true.  </li>
            <li> However, the clips do not hold- at least not in my long hair.</li>
            <li> but I dont use the clips hot rather cold eliminating the clipmarks...</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> Both have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have used it on my thick, long hair without any problems.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick, long hair</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite long and also thick, but the curl stays all day.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to grip and clasp the roller tightly</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t, the rollers to stay in tight.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the clip not holding, but it doesn&#x27;t hold hair tight against the scalp.</li>
            <li> If I want a tight curl it does not happen.    </li>
            <li> the roller tightly which resulted in the clips continually falling off the roller.</li>
            <li> I thought I had found the new replacement, boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> but they made the curls a little too tight.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick heavy hair (length is at my bra line), so I have to use all of them at once to hold all my hair.  </li>
            <li> Plus the heating element only accepts three clips at a time, so every time you use a clip you have to replace it, which is annoying, and after the first three, the clips don&#x27;t have time to heat up before you use them.  </li>
            <li> They may work if you have extremly thin hair but do not even try if you have normal to thick hair.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are completely useless!</li>
            <li> so I am not familiar with anything else.</li>
            <li> I use them every day now because they take so little time to heat up and set my hair.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does state &amp;#34;ready in 2 minutes&amp;#34; but I think it&#x27;s a little longer.</li>
            <li> did find that the heat-resistant plastic clips are a little \\&quot;saggy\\&quot; when they&#x27;re clipped onto the roller.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!    </li>
            <li> I use hairspray with the curlers and that helps the curl stay a little longer</li>
            <li> towards the end of the day the curls fall a little but it still looks like I just did it</li>
            <li> /&gt;*there&#x27;s no way of storing the cord, not even a little cut out on the end of the plug like you get with vaccuum cleaner cords.</li>
            <li> will take a little practice, also I think&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and with these rollers, it makes it very curly and thick!  </li>
            <li> The metal clips that come with the rollers work fine for me, though some say that they hate them</li>
            <li> It take just a few minutes to remove them and all I need to do is run my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li> so it does not look dated like the old curlers used to make you look with boucy fake looking curls.    </li>
            <li> This is the third different set I have ordered in the past year (different brands) and I am yet again disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair kept getting caught in the slit and tangled up, it was pulling my hair and knotting my hair and a few of the rollers got so stuck I had to pull some hair out to get them out.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I use alot of the rollers they are quite heavy.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set now for a few years.  </li>
            <li> - you put another on - waste of time  4.</li>
            <li> I think they should be required to change the advertisement of this product if the clips are not available.</li>
            <li> Not fabulous, but then, I have difficulty getting my hair to keep a curl.  </li>
            <li> A few days ago I took it out</li>
            <li> but as I&#x27;m disabled I found that I needed my caregiver to work with them....</li>
            <li> Conair is a waste.</li>
            <li> This set is a waste of $30.</li>
            <li> few notes:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clips do not stay in place for a firm hold like metal clips&lt;</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY  </li>
            <li> They will not fit ramdonly placed.</li>
            <li> A FEW PLACES HERE</li>
            <li> She read the &lt;br /&gt;instructions, than plugged it in, and waited a few minuets.</li>
            <li> The curls tend to become limp after a while.</li>
            <li> Even though my hair becomes limp after a while, the curls are still visible at the ends even after a night of sleep.</li>
            <li> I do have to roll my hair a few times because the rollers sometimes fall out even with the clips.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> So not only is this an inferior product but Conair will not stand behind it.</li>
            <li> I always curled my hair for everyday plus my dance competitions.</li>
            <li> am impatient and wanted something in the moment.</li>
            <li> This is something I use almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a huge deal for me</li>
            <li> usually stay hidden on the shelf.        </li>
            <li> I have past the shoulder hair that is very thick and got tired of curling it with a curling iron that left them flat by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The rolls won&#x27;t hold up (they just slid down!!), minimum curling results,only a little curl at the ends</li>
            <li> They are not easy to travel because they are not compact    </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have the clips as advertised and the rollers were not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> First the bad...</li>
            <li> I was shocked the first time I used these.  </li>
            <li> (I know, it&#x27;s very weird), and is very silky.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair</li>
            <li> If you have medium long to long hair that is thick, this set of hot rollers might drive you insane.</li>
            <li> your hair comes out in very tight ringlet curls.</li>
            <li> The clips do NOT hold very tight.</li>
            <li> Clips are cheap and don&#x27;t hold the curlers in your hair, worst money that I&#x27;ve ever spent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean that after an hour the curl is a little limp,</li>
            <li> The bad news is that the large clamp-type clips do not hold the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li> EVEN AFTER LEAVING THE ROLLERS IN FOR OVER 20 MINUTES, THE CURL WAS VERY LITTLE AND FELL WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some curls were so tight and looked a little dumb.</li>
            <li> , I was shocked as I used it very</li>
            <li> Good &amp;#34;concept&amp;#34;, bad execution of design. :(</li>
            <li> They are so slick that my hair will not wrap around the curler.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE USED IN THE PAST.</li>
            <li> I noticed several reviewers said it took practice to use the rollers - if it takes practice to get it to work, it&#x27;s not a good product!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these awhile back and wrote a favorable review on them, but they seem to have become useless somehow.</li>
            <li> Even the jumbo size were waaaay too small.</li>
            <li> But I guess small hair strands help a lot....</li>
            <li> There was no static electricity in my hair after using it.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to work any of them properly....</li>
            <li> With this set, I had to use the &#x27;medium&#x27; and &#x27;small&#x27; rollers to get curl.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lazy like me, you return it and go buy a set you already know how to use/how it works.</li>
            <li> so it usually takes me about 30 to 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Are there two different models they are shipping at random?</li>
            <li> Me being an amateur, I thought it didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Totally silly to heat the clips --- holds only three at a time and each time you take one off</li>
            <li> the clips are too small to even clip over the roller.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like it or not yet.</li>
            <li> They must do some sort of quality assurance, so something is wrong with the entire process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem, and the only reason this is 3, not 5 starts is that the clip creates a weird crease in the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost been in tears from the result a few nights when I had no option but to go the way I looked or start all over and be late.  </li>
            <li> Working with multiple curlers can be difficult.</li>
            <li> i usually put the curlers in and then put on a cap</li>
            <li> In fact, there&#x27;s already a small crack on one side.    </li>
            <li> This set comes with a small fabric envelope, made to hold the clips.    </li>
            <li> There are parts missing and the unit does not work!</li>
            <li> Useless as it only warms three at a time.</li>
            <li> Rollers were to small for my hair.  </li>
            <li> There were a few negative, but this is what I was looking for</li>
            <li> /&gt;*the reason i feel it costs too much is that it&#x27;s a very inconvenient little set.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is very heavy, I do use a styling product to get the curl to stay in.  </li>
            <li> After seeing my wife use it I find that it has those cruddy little metal clips that slide right out of her hair.  </li>
            <li> I guess it I am not very good at this</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical due to some of the reviews here, but I went ahead and got it.</li>
            <li> Even when I stayed completely still (very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers)</li>
            <li> I really like it except that it is awkward to pick up!</li>
            <li> But I just can&#x27;t get used to a new \\&quot;badly designed, never should have been manufactured product\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m generally terrible with styling tools, but these are really easy</li>
            <li> Not very good for someone with thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, used very thin strips for curley hair for when I go out, but they would not stay in place.  </li>
            <li> and you wind up with weird loose curls</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product and will go back to using my 10 year old set of rollers.</li>
            <li> If you have arthritic or weak fingers and/or hands, the clips that hold the curlers in place will be too difficult to squeeze and hold open.</li>
            <li> Hard to say.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time trying to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> those with hard to hold hair</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell when rollers are heated</li>
            <li> , have a hard time getting the clips and curlers to stay put once it my hair</li>
            <li> So if your outlet is hard to get to..don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> The stupid clips they supply leave large dents in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Because this set is not ionic and I really wanted an ionic setter, I stupidly ordered a Babyliss set that also is advertised at Folica as ionic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to replace a set by Conair that I have had for over 10 years, which were used at least twice a week.  </li>
            <li> At least they didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> Use common sense and judgement when setting your expectations with this product.</li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is that the clips do not hold the curlers in place.  </li>
            <li> I called the company (Conair) and complained &amp; they said nothing.  </li>
            <li> Which sucks.</li>
            <li> My complaint is, why don&#x27;t these companies build in a slot for the clips?  </li>
            <li> I wish I could return them, but too late now.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and was hoping this would work instead of curling it</li>
            <li> it helps in your decision, my hair is mid-neck length and fairly thick.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat thick hair</li>
            <li> (I have medium length, thick hair).</li>
            <li> but my hair is so thick that I just run my fingers through it after it&#x27;s done and the creases are gone.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and even then then the provided clips don&#x27;t hold.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my thin hair, but learning to work with them.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> as litle as 15 minutes while doing your chores in the mean time</li>
            <li> I mean after an hour my hair looks like it did before I curled it at all.</li>
            <li> Even though there is a small case to hold them, sometimes they get lost!  </li>
            <li> I mean, it works if you know what you are doing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with these, since they are a lot of waste for a couple months of a product that doesn&#x27;t actually work as advertised...</li>
            <li> If you are lookign for small rollers, I would imagine these would be tough to beat for the price.</li>
            <li> They take a long time to put in and I&#x27;m afraid to move my head around while they set.  </li>
            <li> If someone has very short hair, it may work for you, but for me, I wish I never purchased these, it was a waste of my money, very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hard to manage hair that is curly underneath (cork screw) curls.</li>
            <li> Mybe Amazon should do a little fact checking and inspect the products they sell before they blindly put pictures on their web site.</li>
            <li> The ones that do stay in leave a really weird little crease from where they clip, causing &#x27;cowlick&#x27; type problems.  </li>
            <li> These rollers are useless, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> are not good for that.</li>
            <li> (if you get any at all) that have dents in them - not a good</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I discovered the hot rollers were not as pictured or described.  </li>
            <li> I had an older set from Conair with the pins to hold the rollers in and was getting very frustrated with the pins and rollers falling out.</li>
            <li> deffinetly recommend this product, I dont think you&#x27;ll be disappointed and not only that</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed when the curlers arrived with wire pins instead of the blue plastic clips that are advertised with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these when I&#x27;m running late!</li>
            <li> I bought this product over the weekend and the clips dont hold I have already emailed conairs corporate office and told them I am disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> So disappointed because my prior conair rollers lasted for 10 years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disgusted that their initial performance lasted less than 2 months.  </li>
            <li> but I have very thick hair and the clips</li>
            <li> I then did comparison shopping and that setter was anywhere between $15-30 less expensive on here than anywhere else online!</li>
            <li> only bad thing is that my set of rollers came with some weird pins to hold them in place that I can&#x27;t figure out how to work for the life of me.</li>
            <li> it has actual clips instead of the stupid pins that never stay in and 2)</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was late for church.    </li>
            <li> All I wanted to do was replace my existing set with the broken lid (</li>
            <li> Just not great for my hair type.</li>
            <li> but now that it&#x27;s broken with no hope of replacement</li>
            <li> They do not hold my thick, wavy hair and they also leave a weird indentation that gets \\&quot;burned\\&quot; into the hair.  </li>
            <li> Poor Design.  </li>
            <li> (I get tired of holding it</li>
            <li> I wanted some set in curlers because I was tired of my curling iron damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything would ever curl my thin hair.</li>
            <li> counter  and gets dusty</li>
            <li> Because the plastic that the hinged cover on this is made out of is SO THIN...</li>
            <li> I am not happy with these rollers.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s because my hair is so thin</li>
            <li> They were of poor quality and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> The clips that come with the set don&#x27;t hold the curlers tight, which is especially annoying if your hair is long, so I don&#x27;t use the clips.  </li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s a bit cumbersome if you have to transport it from room to room, and if you don&#x27;t grab it firmly by the base you can snap off the dome (or at least I can).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these if you have thick heavy hair, worthless.....</li>
            <li> The smaller rollers just fall out or you get \\&quot;dents\\&quot;-ugly!  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t grab very tightly at all, and for an area like around the face it is impossible to get them to stay.  </li>
            <li> After pondering what the others said about this setter, I&#x27;m rather confused with what I must be doing wrong.</li>
            <li> The clips are useless, they don&#x27;t hold my hair.  </li>
            <li> The clips are fairly useless with any amount of hair thickness as they will just pop off.  </li>
            <li> the jumbo set left my hair frizzy and with sad droopy curls !!!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say my curling iron</li>
            <li> I was set on buying it but still skeptical about the promised results.</li>
            <li> , they leave a weird ridge or dent in the curl.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I cannot use it, cannot turn it on or off.  </li>
            <li> my hair moves effortless and the shine in my hair will blind you</li>
            <li> These were useless.</li>
            <li> the end result was indeed lousy</li>
            <li> only thing I always hate is the clips!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Ridiculously expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now the manufacturers&#x27; fault if the retailer puts up the wrong description?</li>
            <li> The curls were not curly they had weird kinks in them and somehow had square shaping on some of them.</li>
            <li> the plastic claw clips are just useless.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> thats extremely difficult to curl without using lots of hairspray.</li>
            <li> Another trick for difficult to curl hair, like mine, is to wash it the night before.</li>
            <li> The metal pins are difficult to place, although they do hold well.  </li>
            <li> so it failed to &amp;#34;grasp&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The cons: The clips that come with this set are almost useless.</li>
            <li> I should have just bought a curly iron instead of these things, they are complicated and if you don&#x27;t know how to do it, you look like a witch.</li>
            <li> I found these difficult to use unless your into burning your hands.  </li>
            <li> The rollers flop forward so give me a curl going the wrong direction, and sometimes the roller just falls out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Is plastic getting expensive?  </li>
            <li> and I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> long blond hair...quite disgusted.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the clips that come with the set are terrible.</li>
            <li> I have used other conair rollers before with horrible results (a poof ball basically).  </li>
            <li> just disappointing</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s depressing.  </li>
            <li> The order of placing the rollers in the case when done is awkward and there is no place to store but three clips.  </li>
            <li> Securing them was difficult and painful.</li>
            <li> This set is terrible, dont waste your money, I just returned mine to Walmart where it belongs.</li>
            <li> but I the results were  disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out, and am at the awkward stage with my bangs.  </li>
            <li> Also the clips are terrible and DO NOT secure the curler.</li>
            <li> you just have to wrap it awkwardly around the unit which looks dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the roller set for me, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> It is weird!  </li>
            <li> Lame!</li>
            <li> How about mediocre heat in 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to put them in your hair and the clips are terrible -</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable to use. . .</li>
            <li> The flocking covering probably protects your hair, but it makes using product close to the roots very difficult</li>
            <li> It is impossible to control the heat of the rollers.  </li>
            <li> It also BURNS your scalp badly.</li>
            <li> AND THAT IT HAD ALOT BAD</li>
            <li> and I will be posting a bad report everywhere</li>
            <li> Just bad all around.</li>
            <li> I was shocked because they used to work so well.</li>
            <li> I was completely shocked when I opened this and saw the size of the curlers.</li>
            <li> When I took them out I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> the clips are terrible if you are not happy with them</li>
            <li> Disappointed in outcome in use.</li>
            <li> So bummed that I returned this ! :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this set.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that now I have to add it to a land fill because</li>
            <li> well... maybe Dolly Parton hair just isn&#x27;t attainable for me :(</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I got the plastic clips as shown {no issue with receiving the wrong product as others have} but they are HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed and will be returning this.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because it had no on/off button as described.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed because it does not have an on off switch.</li>
            <li> However, I am extremely disappointed with the wire hinge clips.  </li>
            <li> The plastic \\&quot;clips\\&quot; to hold your hair on the rollers cause a crease in my hair - that looks very awkward.  </li>
            <li> wanted to use it again, found it was actually broken!!!</li>
            <li> I prefer vertical curls and they won&#x27;t give them because of those stupid clips.  </li>
            <li> Stupid mistake.</li>
            <li> those stupid pins dont work well at all.  </li>
            <li> I think I may just use a straightener to get rid of those, but still annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate that sometimes they slip into the split though.</li>
            <li> The clips are worthless, they don&#x27;t stay in and leave a mark on your hair  2)</li>
            <li> I hate them.  </li>
            <li> I BURNED MY FINGERS ON THE ROLLERS, AND I HATE THE CLIPS.</li>
            <li> the curlers are also crap.  </li>

            <li> The clips are terrible.</li>
            <li> ATTENTION to the reviews saying that the clips that come with this set are terrible!</li>
            <li> They are truly awful and fell out of my hair as soon as I put them in!</li>
            <li> That is a lie since they do leave marks that look terrible.  </li>
            <li> Talk about awful.</li>
            <li> awful.  </li>
            <li> The clips are not the worst ever, but they are a  pain.</li>
            <li> Being said, my hair style has always been boring.</li>
            <li> This was the worst curler set I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>

            <li> in practice it&#x27;s the worst and seems like a bit of a gimmick.</li>
            <li> and then a nasty looking kink just before the curl starts.</li>
            <li> Then the clips they give you do leave a crimp in your hair so it looked awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> The clips are awful, leave a crimp mark in the hair, won&#x27;t hold the curler in place, flops all over the place and does not hold a curl at all.  </li>
            <li> Just terrible!</li>
            <li> The clips are horrible and have no grip whatsoever.</li>
            <li> but the clips they include are HORRIBLE.  </li>

            <li> works great but fingers still get hot at touch</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like the product she is used to the clairol hot rollers that she had for many years and these don&#x27;t meet her expectations</li>
            <li> I like the hot rollers, the sizes and the ease of use. The only issue I have is- the clips don&#x27;t hold as well as i would like. They hold OKAY but not fabulously. At least three times while putting hot rollers in my hair- one of the clips will slip and a hot roller with go crashing to the bathroom floor (which causes they to chip!). Besides that I like the product just fine, and I like the curl it gives me hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter got these rollers to take to college and she really enjoys them and says they get hot quickly.</li>
            <li> Returned. Not hot enough to redirect my natural curl.</li>
            <li> The rollers are great but the clips don&#x27;t hold as tightly as I would like.</li>
            <li> I am sending these back they were super disappointing no matter how long I left them heat up they were not hot enough to leave a hot curl executed look at all not those spring bouncy curls when you unroll just a wave with curl at end the clips do not hold tight to your head and on top of that the container holds 3 in with curlers and the remaining ones have to be put in a zip lock bag which means we would misplace at some point just disappointing I have always trusted consir</li>
            <li> I have always wanted wavy hair, not curly, but wavy and this was just the trick. The rollers are perfect because they are not hot to the touch so it&#x27;s easy to style them into the hair. The heated clips do wonders (however, I have seen some kinks from them and they sometimes are not big enough to hold the bigger rollers). With a little hairspray, you&#x27;re good to go for the rest of the day. I definitely recommend this product for everyone!</li>
            <li> If you have medium long to long hair that is thick, this set of hot rollers might drive you insane. The concept is great, but the clips are completely inadequate. They burn your fingers as you try to secure them and just do not seem big or round enough to cover the entire roller around your hair. Several just slipped right out as I tried to secure them, even with small amounts of hair and they hung down instead of more secured to the scalp like they should for optimum curls. I would hesitate to buy them. As far as when you do get one to hold right, the curl comes out nice and if you give yourself some spray, it will turn out ok. Otherwise, I recommend something different.</li>
            <li> I tried on 3 occasions to use these curlers.  They are so slick that my hair will not wrap around the curler.  There are no prongs to grab the hair to wrap around the curler.  Hair sticks up all around the curler and when I take them out, my hair is not curled, it is stuck out everywhere.  I boxed them up and put them up on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I bought this one as a X&#x27;mas gift to my sister. one week later, she told me she loves this one. It heats up fast and  only takes 10 minutes to have a very curly hair. I bought a second one to myself and tried it. My hair is hard to curl, but it is like magic after I put it on for 20 minutes.  There are many videos teaching you how to take advantage of the open center. You can pull the tail of your hair into the open center of the hot roller. It makes me easier in the process of curing my hair using the hot roller. The only pitfall is the lid can not close tightly.  I need to put a tape on it when travel. overall, I like this products and would recommend you to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with curls falling out of my hair, so I shouldn&#x27;t have expected so much from this. It did work better than the set of conair jumbo rollers, but the curl still fell out. I gave it 3 stars because I love that it comes with clips and not the metal pins. It heats up the clips, so you get heat from the inside and out. It did give my hair some body when the curl fell out, and I will take that! The edges of the curler are rough and tend to get caught in my hair. The only way to avoid this is to use insanely small amounts of hair, which would take more rollers than this has.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in outcome in use. Tried countless times but curl only lasted a few hours, deffinately not one day!</li>
            <li> This hot roller set curls hair nicely, but the plastic, heated clips that it comes with leaves crinkles in my hair.  Now, I am looking for a metal wire \\&quot;clip\\&quot; that will hopefully work better.  Hot rollers have been around forever, I really don&#x27;t understand why manufacturers cannot get it right.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to replace a set by Conair that I have had for over 10 years, which were used at least twice a week.  This product went well below my expectations.  The dot on the curlers turned white within the alloted time frame, but the curlers were not all hot and still had to wait 15 minutes.      The clips do not hold the rollers in place.  I have long hair, used very thin strips for curley hair for when I go out, but they would not stay in place.  I used the old wire clips from my previous set, however, the rollers do not heat the hair all the way through without the clips (and there is not room for both).  The clips have to be heated up to put over the roller to help heat/curl the hair from outside as well, so, without the heated clips, my hair was only curly for about 2-3 inches from the ends.      My daughter tried to use the set as well, she a short, bob type hair cut.  It was the same problem, the clips would not keep curler tight in place close to the head and many times fell out.  If someone has very short hair, it may work for you, but for me, I wish I never purchased these, it was a waste of my money, very unhappy.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of hot rollers. It worked very fast and the results were incredible. As soon as I finished putting the rollers in my hair I was able to take them out with full curls. I have very long hair and it curled my full head with two rollers still left over. I am very happy with my purchase. A very good investment!</li>
            <li> I always thought you needed the metals clips for roller  to stay in hair but after a short learing curve. I got down.  i wash my hair at night - come it out and let it dry naturally to elimate in static.  Bruch my hair in the morning and put the culers in.  I love the clips get hot too.  I must use sytling spray before rolling and clipping but not inconvenient and the results are fantastic.  Dont give up on this one.  The metal clips of 20 years ago I used caused breakage and slipends - these clips are awesome.  It took a few tries to get it to to work for me but I couldnt get ready for work with them.  Excellent Product so glad i got it - if they ever go which electric rollers dont last for ever - I hope this product is still around.  i tried to save money and buy cheap - ended up spending way more money trying to find a good prouct that works.  Now I have it.    Good Job Conair!!!</li>
            <li> The clips are horrible. The old school wire ones works much better and don&#x27;t leave huge dents in my hair. The curlers work well and heat up quickly. I just wish I had kept the old wire pins from a previous set. I&#x27;ll be ordering something else. Not to mention, there are too many small size curlers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all with the cheap plastic clips that are suppose to hold the curlers in place, they flip all over the place and leave creases in what should be a smooth curl.  AND they only have a area to *warm* 3 of these.  I guess your suppose to use one then replace it and use another.....well, its a pain and not a pretty hairstyle after.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to use this product because I usually straighten my hair and wanted to switch it up.  I have long, thick hair and this didn&#x27;t work well at all.  The clips are useless, they don&#x27;t hold my hair.  Also, I don&#x27;t recommend this product if you have a lot of hair because there&#x27;s not enough hot rollers and you&#x27;ll have to do 2 rounds.  I tried different clips and they held, but when I unrolled the clip the curl that it created was very tight and suzy q like.  These rollers are useless, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> heat on bothsides was a good idea but not for long thick hair. my hair wouldnt stay in curler. had to get out old clips to make it stay. I was told to roll from one end and around the middle so the thickness isn&#x27;t in the middle. I will try that.</li>
            <li> I have long (to my wrists) hair, and needed to curl it for a show.  Having heard great things about these I tried them, and while they won&#x27;t curl all my hair, if I knot my hair and then just curl the bottom half, these are great!  I spray it with hairspray (Aussie Extreme Hold), curl it, spray it again, let it set in the rollers, undo and spray it again, and then I&#x27;ve got (rigid) curls that last through two matinees and an evening performance!  I&#x27;m really pleased with the product and plan to use it sometime I don&#x27;t need 18 hrs. of curl, smile!</li>
            <li> These hot curlers are wonderful. I have past the shoulder hair that is very thick and got tired of curling it with a curling iron that left them flat by the end of the day. I used them for the first time today and they have lasted all day long!!! Even in 40 mile an hour wind! My hair came out incredibly shiny after I used these too which I have never had with any curling iron i owned. If you love your hair curled with all day hold, shine, and bounce these are for you!</li>
            <li> I love them.  They work great on my hair.  Right now hair is shorter so I am not using them.  But they give a nice quick curl.</li>
            <li> I bought the Conair instant heat rollers to replace my old Conair rollers which I was very happy with.  Unfortunaetly I found  that I did not like the new version as well as the old.  It does not heat up as fast and whereas the old had a high and low setting this only has one.  Also found that the heated clips leave dent marks in my hair which the wire clips did not.  I use the Conair super clips which I bought separately instead, would use my old wire clips if only I could find them.</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the &amp;#34;extreme heat&amp;#34; advertisement.  I have used the same hot curlers for 30 years because none compared to the high heat.  This one does.  However, the sizes of the curlers are quite small and would be good for short hair in a very curly style.  I have very long hair so these are not that good size wise.  The clips are fairly useless with any amount of hair thickness as they will just pop off.  They get 3 stars strictly because of the heat.  There is also NO on/off switch as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these hot rollers. I had an older set from Conair with the pins to hold the rollers in and was getting very frustrated with the pins and rollers falling out. The newer design of these clips is excellent. My hair is silky and the older pins just didn&#x27;t stay in very well. Another plus is that the clips fit all the roller sizes because of their design so you don&#x27;t have to search for the right size clip like the older sets. Bravo Conair and thanks for the speedy delivery Amazon !</li>
            <li> I bought the Conair CHV26IX Ion Shine Instant Heat Hair Setter 7/14/2005.  It is a great machine and heats up quickly and is easy to use.  I have no problems w/ the way it works, except the ends are hot to the touch.  Other than that (which isn&#x27;t really a big problem) it worked really well, the way it was supposed to work.</li>
            <li> THIS ELECTRIC ROLLER SET IS A LOT DIFFERENT FROM ANY ELECTRIC ROLLER I HAVE USED IN THE PAST. I LIKE THE CLIPS THAT HOLD THE ROLLERS IN THEY DONT GET HOT LIKE THE METAL CLIPS DO. WHEN I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME I LIKE MY RESULTS MY BOSS EVEN NOTICED MY HAIR..ASKED ME WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR..??? IF YOU DO BUY THIS ROLLER SET.. YOU SHOULD PRACTICE BEFORE USING IT...I WAS GLAD I DID.</li>
            <li> Do not like the clips that come with it. They do not hold and fall out. Also, does not get hot enough. I had to order different clips to hold curlers in</li>
            <li> The rollers are nice with the stay cool ends and flocking, but the clips are awkward to use and too big for the small rollers.  The clips fit the medium and large rollers, but the rollers still flop around on your head and are not secure at all.  The old style wire clips held much more securely and were less awkward to use.  I noticed several reviewers said it took practice to use the rollers - if it takes practice to get it to work, it&#x27;s not a good product!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best, they heat up quick, make nice curls in short amount of time and no static!  The clips also stay in nicely.  I would recommend these highly.  Big improvement over the old hot rollers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned these hot rollers for about 10 years and have loved using them. I have long wavy-curly coarse hair and after drying my  hair and rolling it up, the hairsetter leaves my hair tamed, soft and shiny. So when it got to the point that I&#x27;ve worn off come of the flocking, I decided to order another set from Amazon. Order arrive in just 2 days, but what I received was not the item that was pictured, which was the blue &amp; silver set with the jaw clips. I received the pink rollers - which is what is now pictured on the website. I contacted Amazon and they sent out another hairsetter, stating that I would receive what I ordered. Once again, I received the pink ones. I tried them out and did not like them near as well as the blue ones. Didn&#x27;t heat up as good at all, and I didn&#x27;t like the smaller rollers,or the new style clips, so I sent it back too. Since my 2 returns, Amazon has corrected the pic on their site - which is a totally different hairsetter. I&#x27;ll keep looking for my blue ones.</li>
            <li> I have very straight Asian hair - these clips do not hold the roller.  They just slip right out.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Conair Ion Shine instant heir setter which my wife had owned before &amp; was very satisfied with.  I received a similar Conair model that is almost as good.  Product was from Target.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price; however the clips dont secure the hair tightly around the rollers as i have seen in more expensive sets</li>
            <li> This set is the one I thought I had ordered.  However, I got the ones with the smaller rollers.  I have tried to make them work for my hair but no go.</li>
            <li> I bought it almost a month ago, and it still works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;I need to admit that my hair is hard to handle and sometimes it might be complicated to roll it properly on the curlers, besides the fact that you&#x27;ll burn your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful enough, but in overall is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a mousse or some sort of spray, they might not stay that long, but generally they&#x27;ll stay for a couple of hours if you have thick hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;In regards the heat, well, it actually gets hot pretty quickly, you just need to heat it for 5 minutes or so and it will be ready. Of course, it might vary depending in how defined you want your curls.&lt;br /&gt;And I almost forgot, some people mentioned that it comes with wire clips, at least mine came with butterfly clips. :)</li>
            <li> These curlers were a complete disappoinment.  I have an older version that I needed to replace and the quality of this new set is nothing like the old ones.  The size of the rollers is a joke, unless you have very short hair.  The clips are large plastic claws that are hard to open and the heating feature of the clips requires you to heat two at a time.  I ended up returning these rollers.</li>
            <li> As advertised by many hair curler fans, this product delivered soft voluminous curls. I followed the directions of some youtube video hair experts who recommended this heated rollers. I used the largest barrels on the top roll of hair and medium on the sides and small barrels for the rest of my head. It worked out perfectly. I only left them in for 10 minutes so the curls did not last the whole night. I am Asian so my hair straightens out really quickly so it&#x27;s not just these hot rollers. I will try leaving them in for 30 minutes next time.   Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought these awhile back and wrote a favorable review on them, but they seem to have become useless somehow. I used to get nice bouncy curls, but now the rollers don&#x27;t hold heat and when I unroll my hair it comes out frizzy, fuzzy and kinky. I was shocked because they used to work so well. I&#x27;ve taken good care of my set, I never leave it on or forget to turn it off for long periods, and I can&#x27;t imagine it wearing out so quickly, especially because I only use them maybe twice a week. I will not be buying another set, I think I&#x27;m going with the BabyLiss hot rollers this time.     P.S. They only come with three clips.</li>
            <li> This is garbage! The rolls won&#x27;t hold up (they just slid down!!), minimum curling results,only a little curl at the ends an I don&#x27;t have think hair. Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> love my curlers except they gave out after year was up 18 mos - but for almost daily use, that could be a plus.</li>
            <li> Overall very nice but I have very thick hair and the clips are not good for that. I use some of my &amp;#34;old clip&amp;#34; that I have from my previous Roller Kit. THe Conair system works fine and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers so save time getting ready in the morning. They heat up very fast and I can have my long hair up in rollers in about 10mins.  I can easily make breakfast, pack lunches, and get kids ready for school and the rollers stay in place.  It take just a few minutes to remove them and all I need to do is run my fingers through my hair and I am good to go.  The curls last all day and look even better the next day.  Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have advanced from pin curls, to rollers, and then to hot rollers over the ages. What I love about the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers is their \\&quot;new\\&quot; way of holding the roller in place. It took a little over a week to get used to the metal clip, but I&#x27;ve noticed a definite new shine to my hair, I think it&#x27;s because the clip presses down on my hair and smooths it out. I have fine hair that I have to have permed every 2 months (it is quite short). Without a perm, my hair just falls flat and won&#x27;t hold a hair style. Also, with short hair I don&#x27;t need the heated clip. I just use the clip unheated. I&#x27;m sure if my hair were longer, I would need the extra heat from the clip. I really love this product and am so glad I found it. Try it--I think you&#x27;ll love it!  P.S. Beauty stylists use this type of curler on their celebrity&#x27;s glamour photo shoots! (My cousin shared that information with me.)</li>
            <li> Awful, awful, awful.  I replaced an old Conair with the wire clips with this.  Very disappointed.  Curlers are loose, slip a lot and have to be reclipped (and I have regular hair, not ultra thin).  Hot clips used on top of head will leave lines/clip marks after you comb out, so I always use cool clips on top curlers.  Very uncomfortable to use. . . curlers turn out okay, for the most part, if you can put up with the hassle and don&#x27;t mind them feeling all loose and shaky all over  your head.</li>
            <li> Only one roller changes the color dot to show when heated and you have to heat the outer clips individually on the three spaces provided at the far right. So, if you need to use a particular size again that isn&#x27;t the one with the dot, there&#x27;s no way to tell if it&#x27;s heated or not. Then you have to wait for one of the three clips to heat as well. It is weird!  It seemed to take a long time to heat up, though I didn&#x27;t time it.      This is an ok set, but I sure wouldn&#x27;t rave about it. If not for the hassle, I&#x27;d return it.      I just ordered another set that looks like the one I used to have with the U-shaped clips (BaByliss Pro) and hopefully it will be what I&#x27;m thinking it is.</li>
            <li> I returned these.. and boy do I regret it !! I&#x27;m growing out my hair.. and decided to get the jumbo set (which comes with less rollers and also because the hot clips clamps didn&#x27;t hold the rollers as secure as I&#x27;d have liked.   I get the jumbo.. and they come with the hot clips (\\&quot;u\\&quot; shaped bent metal clip)..     I thought this was great because now I don&#x27;t have to buy those clips everyone raves about.. BIG MISTAKE !!!      First off...  This product worked better to distribute the heat and lessen the frizz .. because of the heatable metal clamps... so you not only get the heat on the inside of your hair.. but also the outside when you heat the clamps along with the rollers.. so it stays warm longer.. and makes the curl last longer too !!  I sooooo regret returning this.. now I&#x27;m going to get it again.. but hold onto some hot \\&quot;u\\&quot; shaped clips I got from ebay to make sure the rollers stay secure...  the jumbo set left my hair frizzy and with sad droopy curls !!!!!!!!!!!!  Also.. I miss the variety of roller size this product has to offer.. the jumbo set was cheaper.. and also a BIG JOKE !  So bummed that I returned this ! :(</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are completely useless! I have loooong thick straight healthy hair, and these rollers do not grip or curl well. The clips included are terrible, no grip at all. I hated using these rollers. I have a lot of hair, so I had curl about 1/2 my hair, reheat the rollers and then curl the rest. And the curls didn&#x27;t even come out well! I bought this to save time, not waste it. Should of stuck with the curling iron. Amazon return policy was so horrible, I decided not to return. Will be regifting. Amazon is good for buying books and not much else.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because there is no heat setting on the machine and I was convinced they wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my thick and heavy long hair. But after using it a few times, I&#x27;m impressed at how hot they get. The trick is to turn it on and not touch it for atleast five minutes. The different sized barrels are great for long and short hair. The only thing it lacks are good clips. The teeth are only 1/8\\&quot; thick. They don&#x27;t hold hair and leave teeth marks. The curlers are great, but buy your own clips!</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I have had a set of Conair hot rollers that lasted me for 10+ years.  So easy to use and gave me beautiful hair.  However, the flocking had worn off, so I was always burning my fingers, plus I had lost most of the pins.  I found this set as a replacement, expecting to receive generally the same set.  I wanted multiple roller sizes, but it seems like the diameter of these rollers are smaller than my old set.  Guess I needed a jumbo size to compare to what I had before.  I have long, thick heavy hair (length is at my bra line), so I have to use all of them at once to hold all my hair.  The rollers themselves are wonderful.  Great curl!  But the clips are horrible!!  They leave bad dents in my hair and just barely hold the rollers in if I&#x27;m lucky.  I&#x27;ll be looking for some metal pins to hold these in, but otherwise great set giving me lots and lots of curls that lasted two days.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the hair clips that come with these rollers.  They leave a very obvious line/crimp in the hair.</li>
            <li> I really really enjoy these rollers a lot! i bought them on here, because places like CVS wanted $20 more dollars for them, so the price was a steal!     Every time I put these in my hair I get tons and tons of compliments from different people.  I get big bouncy curls every time I use them, and they last for 6+ hours.  It really depends on the weather though which is kind of a no brainer.  I also love how fast they heat up, and how you can roll your head and in 10-15 mins have a whole head of bouncy curls.      You should throw away your curling iron and use these rollers instead.  Believe me you will never go back.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are amazing :) I have long thick stubbern hair and this is the only thing that gives me gorgeous curls. Even when I got to the hair salon it looks good for about 10 mins then my hair goes flat. I did my hair yesterday and it last 10+ hours !! When I was at work everyone kept asking me where I got my hair done because it look beautiful and NO ONE belived I did it myself :) Best hot rollers by far!!</li>
            <li> I had a Conair Instant Heat Travel Size Jumbo for about 10 years before it got destroyed while moving. I absolutely loved it and wanted the exact same thing but thought it would be nice to have the large and medium sized curlers as well, though I primarily use the jumbo. I was completely shocked when I opened this and saw the size of the curlers. Even the jumbo size were waaaay too small. I use them to give body to my straight long hair and none of the sizes were suitable for that. I immediately shipped it back and ordered the Travel Size like I had before. Very disappointed this wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was.</li>
            <li> I have had several sets of Conair rollers over the years.  The plastic clips that come with this product however are awful. They don&#x27;t seem to grip and clasp the roller tightly so the rollers end up flopping around your head and then fall out.  I was very disappointed with this product and will go back to using my 10 year old set of rollers.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and was hoping this would work instead of curling it and it doesn&#x27;t, the rollers to stay in tight. It works but not for the look I was going for, I&#x27;ll probably return it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this. The clips are terrible. They leave kinks in your hair. If they had different clips, I&#x27;d like the product.</li>
            <li> Love the rollers, hate the clips. They are really flimsy and won&#x27;t hold rollers in very well. I don&#x27;t like the added expense or hassle of trying to find something else, but I do like the performance of conair. Change the clips and you&#x27;ll have a great product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had long enough hair for hot rollers for a while. I really like these. They get nice and hot, are easy to use and the style stays in for a good long time, even in the hot, humid Texas weather.</li>
            <li> This was not the same as pictured.  I have had a set like this before and it has an ON/OFF switch, as the picture shows on this one I ordered.  When the Hot Rollers arrived, there is no ON/OFF switch.  I have to plug and unplug the set to use them.  I am not happy with this purchase.  I would not have ordered a set that did not have the ON/OFF switch.</li>
            <li> Wow that this works for me... I spend so long trying to curl my hair but sometimes have no time to go to a salon or do it myself....but now I take a minute to plug it by the time I take the clips apart the rollers are hot...then I just put the rollers in my head And voila....the only thing is that the clips are not strong enough so sometimes they hang loose.... But I guess small hair strands help a lot....</li>
            <li> I got this set for Christmas.  I give it 2 stars because it does heat up fast.  What I don&#x27;t like about it is I really wanted bigger curlers.  Not Conair&#x27;s fault.  Also, the clips do not hold your hair very well.  Especially if you try to roll on the top of your head.  They held ok on the sides if you were still. The teeth are just too short to really dig in and hold well. Another thing I don&#x27;t like, no on/off switch.  Plug it in, it&#x27;s on.  Unplug it to turn it off.  I would just prefer an on/off switch.  Returning.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product but never received the correct item from the seller.  I ended up returning both of the incorrect items and having my card refunded.</li>
            <li> This is my first hot roller.. I have long, fine hair and it works perfectly. Easy to use, heats up very quickly. But the best thing is that it gives amazing shine to my hair. First I could not believe it, it is very noticeable. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product does leave marks in your hair where the clips are. I think I may just use a straightener to get rid of those, but still annoying. This product also takes about 10 min to heat up fully, rather than the promised 2. The curls don&#x27;t last long either...only a few hours. I may take them back to get a more expensive set that will do a better job. The curls do look nice though. I have long straight hair.</li>
            <li> I like these curlers better than the old style.  They do not pull your hair, I was expecting larger rollers, but they do create a nice look, my hair is a little longer than shoulder lenght. I love using them to give me wome height on top, then let the end stay out of the curler so it does not look dated like the old curlers used to make you look with boucy fake looking curls.    I am glad I bought them but they do need to warm longer than I expected, especially once you have used them all and need to put a few back in to complete the curling.</li>
            <li> I was replacing a fav set that is no longer made, and it had to have an on/off switch.....This SAID it had on/off switch but it didn&#x27;t......It took an intervention with Amazon to send it back because product was not as pictured!</li>
            <li> Pros:   Very Hot Curlers. I love that they hold their heat well and heat up pretty quickly. I do get nice curls.    Cons:   I agree with other reviewers that the clips that come with the set are terrible. I&#x27;m glad I kept the ones from my old set.     I hate that sometimes they slip into the split though. I really hate that part more than anything. If they were solid rollers I&#x27;d give this 4 stars.     There are only 6 medium rollers and there are 6 tiny ones. Who uses 6 tiny rollers? Wish it had more mediums.      I think I&#x27;ll go back to the wax curlers though, or at least something without the split in the middle and shell out the money for a 30 piece set.</li>
            <li> I really like these, they are my first ones I have ever gotten so I am not familiar with anything else. I will say that the clips are really not that great I saw some other reviews so I in advance bought other clips. when I do try and use the clips they leave a big kink in the curl and does not look good especially for the curls on top of the crown. but overall they work well and the curls last for hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything to review, as I ordered this hair setter twice, and both times was sent the wrong thing.  I finally gave up.</li>
            <li> I have been using curlers to set my hair since I was at least in middle school, so I&#x27;ve been through quite a few sets.  This set is one of the many that I have owned and it&#x27;s great!  I mostly use the larger rollers, since my hair is longer and thicker.  These rollers are easy to use and heat up quickly.  The fabric around the outside of the rollers is velvety and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair.  I don&#x27;t use the clips that come with the rollers, instead I use pins from another Conair set that I had saved.  I&#x27;ve tried the clips a few times, but since my hair is so thick, I prefer my old pins.  Either way, this is a great product, and I will probably order it again when I need new curlers.</li>
            <li> Loved these new hot rollers.  The new clips are much easier to use and rollers felt more secure as opposed to older style of clips.  I loved the convenience of setting my hair while preparing for work &amp; having a full head of curls by the time I am ready to leave for work. The rollers did not burn; they were warm but tolerable. It has been more warm than usual and I am prone to frizz.  During my first and subsequent attempts, I was able to maintain my curls and my hair was less frizzy than when I use regular rollers. The new clips are just ideal. No more sagging or slipping of rollers when I put them in.  It stayed secure until I removed them.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers work great, really almost too great.  My hair gets so curly and stays in all day.  When I first pull them out it&#x27;s almost Delta Burke in the first season of Designing Women curly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it helps in your decision, my hair is mid-neck length and fairly thick.  Usually the curls fall out of my hair pretty quickly but when I use these they stay in all day!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this hair setter.  It heats quickly and is hot enough to curl the hair either dry or slightly damp.  The curler size selection is good - but if you need a mid-size like I do - it doesn&#x27;t take long to reheat the curler for re-use in seconds.  The curl lasts and I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These rollers a wonderful. I find them very easy to use, and my curls stay in, the clips are great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go back to curling my hair the way I remember doing it before all the new types.  I find this product is exactly what I was looking for.  The curler holders are so much better than the ol&#x27; days.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have been using hot rollers since I was a teen.  I have tried many brands, and have been sorely disappointed in all but Conair.  In my opinion, they are the best around.  The only negative for this set are the clips.  I much prefer the previous design.  They were light and flexible and held the rollers in place.  These clips are too small; do not hold the rollers securely, and they are made of hard plastic which is not the most comfortable material. Fortunately, I kept my old clips and they work fine with this set.     The rollers heat up quickly, and as promised give great shine to the hair.  I give a thumbs up!    Conair would be perfect if they could design a case that doesn&#x27;t break during travel.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product for anybody who ones instant curls in 15 minutes!!! as litle as 15 minutes while doing your chores in the mean time your hair is ready.. the only thing that if you have a thin hair like me and want to keep your curls for a long time i would recommend a hair spray , but not too strong , you can spray your hair and use the rollers, than after you are done, you can just spray it to all your hair from a distance and you are done! i love this product..i am sure you will too...</li>
            <li> I was shocked the first time I used these.  I have used other conair rollers before with horrible results (a poof ball basically).  These rollers are awesome.  They are easy to put it (no burning fingers here!).  The clips actually hold my hair really well.  They don&#x27;t fall out while you are waiting for them to cool.  When I took them out I was shocked.  I can not get this look even with a nice ceramic curling iron!  Easy to use, great results.  Definitely my best hair appliance purchase ever!</li>
            <li> Clips are cheap and don&#x27;t hold the curlers in your hair, worst money that I&#x27;ve ever spent.  If anyone has any ideas on a quality set of hot curlers please share?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this product.  I found various opinons in the reviews on the Conair hair clips but I now agree with all those that weren&#x27;t impressed with them.  This comes with wire clips that just don&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s very frugal of Conair to sell this hair setter with cheap clips.  To me that&#x27;s like selling a vase that doesn&#x27;t hold water very well.  Unless you already own some good clips and you don&#x27;t need the rollers very hot...I&#x27;d keep on looking.</li>
            <li> This Conair Heat Hair Setter works fine.  However, one of the reasons I ordered this was because of the new types of clips that was advertised in the product description. They were not, however, included.  I received the hair setter with the old style of clip which does not work well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all gussied up very often, but when I do, these new rollers do a great job!  I have thin hair and with these rollers, it makes it very curly and thick!  They heat up fast and the curl stays all day. I do recommend these rollers!</li>
            <li> I have to say that these work well but because the clips aren&#x27;t very strong it doesn&#x27;t stay tight and does get hot if touching your face. I suggest getting different slips for these.</li>
            <li> I have not tested out this product but I have no doubts it will exceed my expectations since I&#x27;ve seen the product being used on other people with exquisite results! Thanks amazon!  and yes, I will be lookin&#x27; sexy! :)</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me, but that&#x27;s not to say it will not work for you. My issues with this product was that I burned my fingers each time I tried to put the roller in my hair, you only get a few clips with the product and they didn&#x27;t work very well--At least they didn&#x27;t work well for me. I gave this product away and even that person didn&#x27;t want it. I may be a fan of some Conair products, just not this one.</li>
            <li> It seems almost impossible to find good hot rollers anymore. This is the third different set I have ordered in the past year (different brands) and I am yet again disappointed. I turned it on for a good 45 mins before I used the rollers and they didn&#x27;t get that hot even in that amount of time.  There are no \\&quot;pins\\&quot; to hold the rollers in your hair, only plastic clips that don&#x27;t hold the rollers that snug and every time I move my head it feels like they are going to fall out.  I have fairly long hair and there aren&#x27;t enough of the medium sized rollers, I can only do about one side of my head and that uses them all.  For me, by far the most annoying feature is the \\&quot;split\\&quot; in the middle of the roller.  The rollers don&#x27;t sit on pegs, they have a slit through the middle and you slide it onto a bar across the case, and that is how the roller heats, which is why it probably doesn&#x27;t get that hot.  My hair kept getting caught in the slit and tangled up, it was pulling my hair and knotting my hair and a few of the rollers got so stuck I had to pull some hair out to get them out.  Very, very annoying and painful, and I would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> When I first opened up the box to this set of hot rollers, I though it was not going to last me long because it seemed cheap. Once I started to hook it up and everything it heated up quite quick, but it made this sound like it was working really hard to heat the rollers. But I found out that looks can be deceiving. I love these hot rollers so much. Pros: the velvet rollers don&#x27;t burn my finger tips, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair when I remove them and they are light when on your head. Cons: the lid is kind of fragile which break easily (I chips apart of mine); also I&#x27;m not fond of the pins that comes with the rollers so I ended up using bobby pins, which works wonderfully. Overall the product works very well, but how long will they last me, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Conair Shine Instant Heat Hair Setter which was the same hair setter I had purchased a few years ago, because I was very satisfied with it. I was sent a different model which I found unsatisfactory in several different ways. I was very disappointed with your service, I ordered it online, paid shipping and waited a week, only to receive a different model that I could have purchased at the local Target, not paid shipping, and not waited a week. I won&#x27;t be a return customer.</li>
            <li> Tired of foam rollers and waiting for your hair to set in two or more hours?  I was and purchased this yesterday with good results.  There was no static electricity in my hair after using it.  For myself, I did need to use hairspray to hold the set, maybe you have the type of hair that might not.  The stay cool ends are important and the curlers are made well, as well as the clips.  The plastic case covering over the rollers as you heat them should stay down to create the appropriate environment for the ion process to work. That covering is very &amp;quot;chintzy&amp;quot; plastic that is easy to crack or break off, so be cautious when flipping it back and forth.</li>
            <li> For someone like me who is clueless about how to style hair, these are a dream come true. If curling irons have always made you look like abstract art, and not in a good way, and you&#x27;ve resigned yourself to having the hairstyle of an 11-year-old for the rest of your life, don&#x27;t be dis\\&quot;tress\\&quot;ed any longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair Ion Shine rollers are very easy to use, take very little time (five to 10 minutes to heat, a few minutes to roll, and about 10 minutes running around the house looking like Medusa while they set) and the results are gorgeous, natural-looking and last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am told by my hairdresser that they won&#x27;t damage hair, either. I&#x27;ve been using them for months and my fine hair (that&#x27;s meant as an adjective, not a self-congratulation) is as healthy as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative, and it&#x27;s a minor one, is that it&#x27;s a bit cumbersome if you have to transport it from room to room, and if you don&#x27;t grab it firmly by the base you can snap off the dome (or at least I can). But this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Incidentally, I wound up buying another set for everyday use and put the one with the snapped lid in the new set&#x27;s box. I keep it in my suitcase as my travel set.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM, 6/28/11:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to a comment by Carrie, you&#x27;re correct; my review was of the Conair Ion Shine Instant Heat Hairsetter, which is predominantly cornflower blue in color and, apparently, discontinued. Amazon switched out products on this page!</li>
            <li> With waist-length straight hair of medium thickness, tight curls are just not an option.  I am happy to report that this hairsetter creates long shiney waves that help to beautifully frame the face.  I feel as though I&#x27;m not burning my hair up when I use these rollers with their soft flocking.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My hair looks great and so far today my curls have lasted for 5 hours--a record as they usually last less than 45 minutes.  This was definately worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> If you have arthritic or weak fingers and/or hands, the clips that hold the curlers in place will be too difficult to squeeze and hold open. I had difficulty and hopefully can return this item. I am sure this product will be great if you can easily manipulate the clips. I liked the old style better.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to properly style my own hair.  In the old days I used giant rollers on wet hair and sat under a dryer for a couple of hours.  I&#x27;m too old to bother with that now.  So I tried curling brushes, irons, blow dryers, etc.  I was unable to work any of them properly....it seemed to me that I needed 3 hands to do it right.  So I thought I&#x27;d try hot rollers.    WOW! DOUBLE WOW!!!    This took no time at all, and I look great...like I just came from the salon.  I wasn&#x27;t even sure I was doing it right.  Maybe I wasn&#x27;t, but my hair came out with just the right amount of curl, smooth and shiny.......AND NO FRIZZ.  The big plasic clips made the rollers super easy to remove and left no marks on my hair.    If I have one criticism of this set, it&#x27;s that the smallest rollers are of no use to me.  I should have bought the \\&quot;all large\\&quot; or \\&quot;all jumbo\\&quot; roller sets.  But that&#x27;s a personal decision.    I&#x27;m 68 years old and can style my own hair for the first time in my life.  I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I already had a set of electric Rollers, but needed something with larger rollers. These rollers heat up in a flash, and in no time, you&#x27;ve got bouncy curls.  I had the hardest time finding Jumbo curlers, and am glad Conair thought to make a hair setter with mostly large rollers.  Try it, and I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;ll like it.  While I have very fine, easy to curl hair, it also worked well on my neice who has very thick-corse hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, made my hair look awesome, big improvement over curling iron. Problem is, 3rd time I used these hot rollers the plastic part of the rollers melted, shorted out the product for good. This was on the medium heat setting. I got it as a gift so don&#x27;t have a receipt for warranty. Lame!</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHSE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT WHAT IS ADVERTISED. The supplier of this product is not supplying the product as advertised. The unit should come with the SMART Clips(Plastic Clips) but instead is supplied with cheap wire clips that do not secure your hair. I purchased the product because of my fine hair and looked forward to the SMART Clips keeping the hair on the rollers. The Product shown and the insert in the package shows and states I should have these clips.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After contacting the supplier I am told that I would have to pay a further $4.95 +S/H to get these clips. Well why is this so,if I have paid for them and they were supposed to have these already supplied with the product purchased. The customer service operator was not helpful, rude and refused to let me talk to her supervisor or any one in authority, other then repeating I will have to pay for these supposedly supplied Smart Clips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the treatment I recieved with the Customer Service people at Conair I would never recommend their products to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because I was looking for hot rollers that had multi sized rollers and the tourmaline ceramic rollers caught my eye.  I too have used Conair hot rollers in the past and I really liked my compact jumbo roller set, unfortunately it was now in need to be replaced since it was over 10 years old and the lid was cracked.  I thought I had found the new replacement, boy was I wrong.  The clips do not hold the rollers well, they just slid down.  I liked the claw clip rollers from my jumbo set and the old metal rollers from my previous set ( Loaned to my sister and never got it back).    I don&#x27;t know what Conair was thinking trying to replace the clips for the curlers, these clips are no comparsion to the older claw clips and metal clips.  I hate these new clips, but I tried using my claw clips from my jumbo set and the hot rollers leave a nice curl with them.  The curl is nice and shiny and my hair is nice and soft.    I gave it a 3 star because of the clips, had it had the metal or claw clips I would have given it 5 stars.  I did contact Conair and I have yet to hear from them.  I am hoping they are developing replacement clips for this set.  Keep your fingers cross.</li>
            <li> The thing I like about hot rollers is they are easier than just a curling iron and then having to roll the curl backup and bobby pin until time to comb out hair.  These are easy to use, except that the clips don&#x27;t always stay on in place, sometimes they want to slip alittle and do not try to bend over as they will unroll with you.  I guess they are better than not.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the rollers. They heat up quite fast and I like the variety of sizes.  The only feature I don&#x27;t like is that there isn&#x27;t any holder for the clips.  they came in a little pouch, which is made of very flimsy material.  I had to take them out and put them in other containers so it was easier to get them when I needed them.    It will make it a real pain when I travel and have to figure out a place to store the clips so I don&#x27;t lose them!</li>
            <li> First - no blue clips came with it, as advertised.  Second - doesn&#x27;t curl very well. Edges of rollers pretty hot to handle, too.</li>
            <li> Wife uses it every day.</li>
            <li> What I ordered was Conair Ion Shine Instant Heat Hair Setter, What I received was Extreme instant heat hair setter.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t review the product because I did not get what I ordered!</li>
            <li> I tried these because reviews seemed generally positive.  I used them for 3 weeks and not once did the curl last for more than an hour.  I have fine, straight hair but have used other brands; all with better success.  When I went to my hairdresser 3 weeks after I&#x27;d been using them, she was surprised at how dry my hair was...NEVER had that problem before.  I do not recommend them at all.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and evenly.  Clips hold securely.  Well made.  Second time to buy this product, gave the first one to my daughter so had to buy a second one for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this some time ago, but when new, for some reason I never used it.&lt;br /&gt;Pulled it out of the cabinet to try it again, and only ONE curler heated up.&lt;br /&gt;So whatever I paid for it, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers after reading other reviews, both good and bad. I have a set of flocked heated rollers for use at home in Ireland (so Ireland/UK voltage, and couldn&#x27;t use them in the US) and I wanted a set to use for traveling in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAY ATTENTION to the reviews saying that the clips that come with this set are terrible! They are truly awful and fell out of my hair as soon as I put them in! When I did manage to get them to stay, they left marks on my hair. I didn&#x27;t get a chance to get u-shaped clips during this trip, but I definitely will for my next one - I ended up securing the rollers with regular kirby grips, which was not ideal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers themselves are good, but not great - I usually use the &#x27;jumbo&#x27; and &#x27;medium&#x27; rollers from my other set, and these create good volume and nice loose curls. With this set, I had to use the &#x27;medium&#x27; and &#x27;small&#x27; rollers to get curl. The packaging/instructions say they heat up in a few seconds - this is also not true - I would give them 5 minutes or more to reach a good heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because the edges aren&#x27;t raised, I found that my hair both slipped off the roller, and got caught in the gap where the roller sits onto the heating element - although that might possibly be solved by using the right clips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering how cheap these rollers are, I don&#x27;t regret buying them, but they do take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up quickly and don&#x27;t get too hot to handle but they don&#x27;t stay in my straight, fine hair, even with the claw clips.  I have to keep repositioning and reclipping them.  Plus the heating element only accepts three clips at a time, so every time you use a clip you have to replace it, which is annoying, and after the first three, the clips don&#x27;t have time to heat up before you use them.  Furthermore, there&#x27;s no clip storage other than those three--Conair didn&#x27;t even see fit to give us a zip-lok plastic bag to keep them in, you&#x27;re on your own there.  And the rollers are too small for my hair, which is above shoulder-length; I want just lift and gentle curl and I don&#x27;t get a smooth curl with these, although the curl doesn&#x27;t hold all that long anyway.  BE AWARE that the roller diameters they give you on the box seem to be for the plastic ENDS of the rollers, which are wider than the barrels you roll your hair on, so the rollers are smaller than you expect.  I can&#x27;t recommend these rollers to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about these hot rollers, I love them. This is the third set I bought. I bought one for myself and my sister and best friend kept borrowing it so I bought them each one for Birthdays and Christmas. I will never use a curling iron again! These heat up in 30 seconds and have enough heat to curl my hair in 30mins with really tight curls which my hair is down almost to my butt so it takes forever to curl with a curling iron. I would rate this item 400 stars if I could I love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected....maybe something a little better since it has the Conair name on it.  The rollers get plenty hot, but the clips are a pain to use and don&#x27;t hold.  They also leave crimping in the hair.  Wish I had purchased the jumbo rollers with the regular metal clips that hold better.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with something I probably won&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> They heat up really fast.  I do have to use a little hair spray because I have very straight, baby fine shoulder length hair. But the set stays in all day and even the next day. My hair is layered at the end, up about 2 inches, and I mainly use the big rollers to curl/flip up the ends and to add body to the rest. &lt;BR&gt;Anyhow I get so many complements when I roll my hair with these rollers. Everyone thinks I went to the hair dresser.    &lt;br /&gt;I happen to like the hinge clips but they do leave little dents in my hair if I put too much hair on the rollers.  But these hinge clips are easier for me to use than the old-fashioned wire clips.  Also, when I use alot of the rollers they are quite heavy.    The rollers don&#x27;t get too hot to touch either so no more burned fingers :-) and they are very gentle on my fine hair which is also great.  &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very pleased with them. I use them every day now because they take so little time to heat up and set my hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased them I met another lady who recommended them&lt;BR&gt;as well and she had much thicker hair than I do.  She said she really liked them but that the top broke off and that makes it difficult to travel with them.  I do plan on traveling with them as well so I am being extra careful not to break the top.</li>
            <li> They look nice, love the pink.  Doesn&#x27;t really make a nice, defined curl.  I have some cheaper ones that do a better job.  I don&#x27;t think I like the felt material rollers as much as the rubber or hard plastic ones.  Also, invest in some of the cheap, old fashioned style pens that will hold the rollers in more firmly. The clip style holders don&#x27;t hold as well and puts too much slack on the curl, thus resulting in a loose sloppy curl.</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight, just below shoulder length hair. These rollers worked GREAT FOR ME!! I actually purchased them at a CVS Drug store and had some \\&quot;cvs\\&quot; bucks and some additional savings so I only paid about $18 for them. But I am very pleased. They were SO much easier to use than the ones with metal clips, they go in fast, come out fast, and I definitely had lots of body. SO many of the negative comments left for this product were from misuse. Yes they will burn your fingers if you touch the hot part, Yes if you drop the whole set the lid might crack (someone actually made that complaint!!), Yes if you don&#x27;t roll them into your hair correctly you can end up with kinked ends, Yes if your hair is extremely thick and long the plastic clips may not be big enough to hold the roller in place, Yes if your hair is super thin and short you may have difficulty keeping them in place, and Yes there is a place to store the clips - its called a vanity drawer (or even a zip lock bag would do the trick!!) Use common sense and judgement when setting your expectations with this product. For me - with rather average, easy to curl hair - they are great and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> If you have thicker hair, the rollers WILL NOT STAY IN.  Furthermore, the clips will shoot across the room like bullets and become almost impossible to find, while the lovely pink rollers clatter to the floor and manage to roll under any available surface (perhaps they&#x27;re magnetic).  So you&#x27;re bending over to find them, and even more of them spring out of your head causing your long (but still straight) hair to cascade down into your eyes, making the search for the pesky little devils that much harder still.  I&#x27;m absolutely sure that one of those little clippy deals is still stuck in a potted plant or embedded in plaster somewhere.  Maybe two of them.  Hard to say.  Needless to say, I was late for church.    I sure wish that the manufacturer had put a disclaimer on the box.</li>
            <li> Though they do heat up quickly, I don&#x27;t care for the clips. The clips don&#x27;t seem to grasp my the curlers well and they leave a crease in my hair (shoulder length and fine - but I have tons of it). The &#x27;velvet&#x27; finish contributes to the curlers sliding right out. Also the edges of the curlers are too hot for my scalp.</li>
            <li> Size was not as advertised.</li>
            <li> These rollers are much easier to use than I initially thought they would be.  I was pretty desperate for some volume so I thought I&#x27;d give these guys a try (after reading a multitude of positive reviews). They really do give my a hair a \\&quot;bounce\\&quot;, that it did not have before.  I am currently growing my hair out so I believe I will need to purchase some jumbo sized rollers next.  The 3 sizes that this set comes with works for more of a shoulder length (or slightly longer) hair length (in my opinion). I say if you want some bounce in your hair, give these a try.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use a styling gel that helps the curls stay longer. Heats up well.    What I don&#x27;t like about it is that the clips are too large for the curlers, which means the curlers don&#x27;t stay rolled up all the way. I wish they had a variety size of clips to go with the variety size of curlers.</li>
            <li> I have used electric rollers (including Conair) for many, many years.  The box for these rollers says it includes jumbo, large &amp; medium rollers.  I bought another Conair set that includes jumbo &amp; super-jumbo.  The jumbo size in this set is about half the size of the other jumbo rollers.  So the box should really say it includes medium, small &amp; super-small sizes.  Also, the box says the clips do not leave crimp marks on your hair.  That is a lie since they do leave marks that look terrible.  I was extremely disappointed with this set.  All I wanted to do was replace my existing set with the broken lid (yes - the lids always break) but instead they had to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; things &amp; lie in the process.</li>
            <li> The clips leave indentations in my hair, which affects any style.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you have to keep putting the clips on the posts to heat them, as there is only enouh room for three clips to heat, seems like there should be a place for all the clips to heat at once instead of using one, replacing it, using another, replacing it, etc.</li>
            <li> If you like big dents and ridges in the top of your hair left by the roller clips, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this set  because my hair--thick, absolutely straight and body-less, but very fine--would not hold curling-iron curl.  Chose this one because of the number of rollers, the felt covering, and the plastic clips, which I thought would work fine.  Within the second month, one of the rollers became too hot to handle comfortably; now 3 release so much heat that my fingers burn when I use them, just like the ancient ones that would drip wax after a few years--not months.  In the 3rd or 4th months, the clips began slipping, and now the only ones that hold are the jumbos, which are really too big to do me any good.  I wound up buying  extra medium rollers--a pain because they aren&#x27;t sold on-line but must be ordered by phone.  I believe I paid $35.00 for the set, plus another $9.00 for the extra curlers.  I&#x27;m really procrastinating about buying another set of hot curlers because there may not be any that perform better than these.  That&#x27;s depressing.  Because the clips slip so much, the curl is limited to the ends of my hair, so I look a little like the old Midge doll.  I use a lot of hair spray, but the curl relaxes after 2-3 hours at the most.  I&#x27;m very disgusted that their initial performance lasted less than 2 months.  I would not recommend these.  I would have returned them, but K-Mart&#x27;s return limit is 60 days here, and they had obviously been used.  So I&#x27;m in the market again, albeit reluctantly.  My ancient Clairol curlers, made in the 70&#x27;s, lasted throughout high school, college, and graduate school.  Granted, they burned my fingers by then, but I had certainly gotten my parents&#x27; money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I got these and tried them for my hair. I have somewhat thick hair so I got a set with lots of curlers but to my surprise they were tiny rollers. I had to use all the rollers. I tried them on my hair and only the last 3-4 inches was curled. Some curls were so tight and looked a little dumb. Very disappointed... Gunna buy the Babyliss 30 rollers</li>
            <li> This is the first set of hot curlers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I wanted some quick and easy curls so I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend a good hour or so of quality time with my curling iron.  Needless to say my curling iron and I are still doing a lot of bonding and the hot curlers usually stay hidden on the shelf.        The curlers heat up well but I have to use the really small curlers just to get large curls.  If I use anything larger my hair will return to being pin straight in a matter of minutes.  The directions say to just let go of the curler and let it fall.  My hair gets tangled in the curler and I have to pull all kinds of hair out of the curler and it frizzes out.         The reason I keep the curlers is because my hair is waist length and pin straight.  If I use the small and medium curlers all over and then go back over my entire head with the curling iron, I have celebrity curls all day.  Would I buy this product again?  No. Do I regret buying it? Not at all.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and it seems to work fine for other people on here.  Just not great for my hair type.</li>
            <li> This product was advertised with metal clips to hold the curlers in place.  Instead it came with butterfly clips which crimp the hair where it holds onto the roller.  They are also very heavy when you have a head full of them.  The heating process did not work well either.  I sent them back as they were entirely unsatisfactory.  I could not use them.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews for the Conair hair setter I was set on buying it but still skeptical about the promised results. After I have tried other roller and curling irons and nothing compares to this great product!  All I have to do is plug it in waitr a few minutes, put the rollers on and by the time the last roller is placed I can take the first roller out, it works that fast. Since the rollers don&#x27;t feel hot to the touch I thought they were not working but wow whne I took them off my hair I had volumunous curls! Even running a hair brush over them did not mess them up! If you want great curls and don&#x27;t have much time to put into your hair this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> The product seem to be of good quality for the price we paid.  The wife used the item several times after the purchase and was pleased with the results every time and even started curling the children&#x27;s (girls) hair.  I would recommend the item for anyone else looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li> This is CHEAP JUNK. The curls go away after about 30 minutes... And I have easily curlable hair. These seem to actaully STRAIGHTen my hair, and leave it FRIZZY. It also BURNS your scalp badly. They do NOT shine your hair AT ALL. They may work if you have extremly thin hair but do not even try if you have normal to thick hair. I tried it, and my family and friends who also tested all agree these are junk. I really like the clips. I spent $30. on clips I guess? The clips are great. I use them with my other curlers. Spend a little bit more and get professtional ionic curlers. I swear you will be happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before and I&#x27;ve found these really easy to use.  The metal clips that come with the rollers work fine for me, though some say that they hate them (I read all the reviews before I decided to purchase).  My hair&#x27;s thick and now a little above my shoulders...it does have some curl of its own, but of course not the kind I want.  :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used hot rollers and I was very impressed.  They curled my hair within ten minutes.    My only con is that I have A LOT of hair, and I could have used one or two more rollers.  Also, it was hard to get the clips to hold my hair on the jumbo curlers, so I may order more of those.</li>
            <li> I bought this product elsewhere but I had to leave a review here as I researched it here.  It is not worth the money as the rollers don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.  The clips that came with this leave unsightly dents in my hair also.  I had to use the clips from my old set.</li>
            <li> I have never use hot rollers before.  I&#x27;m more an idiot on styling my hair.  I have long straight hair for almost 20 years and would like to have some wave to match a dress to be worn on my sister&#x27;s wedding.  I saw this product on the magazine, ordered it because the price is very reasonable.  After the 1st try using the unit on my own, I instantly love it.  The curl is exactly what I was looking for and expected.  It is user friendly and harmless to my hair.  I even tried on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  We both love it.    Not only the price and the wave came out good, the most amazing thing is..... It is quick.  It took me 20 minutes the most transforming from long, thick straight hair to bouncy soft wavy.     I have no issue with the clips came with the unit.  They all good.      Now, I can transform myself between straight &amp; wavy any time I want without spending fortune to go to a hair dresser.</li>
            <li> I purchased these earlier this week, b/c I have very straight, very fine, hair and wanted to give it some volume. I&#x27;d been using my roommate&#x27;s curlers, but wanted to try my own.  First - these would be great rollers if you&#x27;re looking for tighter curls (not waves), and if you&#x27;ve got shorter hair. They heat up super fast, they can get super hot, they have an on-off switch, and they&#x27;ve got \\&quot;cool touch\\&quot; ends (which are just a little cooler than the roller, so \\&quot;cool\\&quot; is relative). However, with my longer hair, it just wasn&#x27;t happening with the clips they provided.  With super straight hair, it&#x27;s really hard to find a way to curl my hair without a crease. These clips were certainly NOT the solution. It&#x27;s difficult to get the curler to stay with the clip, and when I could, I was almost guaranteed a nice crease where the clip met up with my hair. Talk about awful. Also, while I really liked the concept of heated clips, they were difficult to handle b/c they were so hot. They also didn&#x27;t seem built to hold a decent amount of hair on the curler, it was just kind of a mess.  Pros - quick heat, if you leave them on long enough they get good and hot, easy to use, and an on/off switch  Cons - curlers can get super hot, clips can get super hot, clips leave unsightly creases, and don&#x27;t hold hair on the curler all that well.  So if you&#x27;re willing to put the effort in, or go buy different clips, it&#x27;s a good set. If you&#x27;re lazy like me, you return it and go buy a set you already know how to use/how it works.</li>
            <li> I am a mom of 2 and this is perfect when I have a busy day. Rollers heat up in about a minute. It takes me about 10 mins to insert all of the rollers and another 10-15 to set. I usually leave them in longer because I love tight curls. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a quick hair fix. Plus, they come with clips so you don&#x27;t have to purchase them.</li>
            <li> I bought these together with the larger sized rollers also from Conair and I am ecstatic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always wanted salon finish curls but always dread the time it takes to curl my full head.  I own a couple of different sized curling irons and though i love how they curl my hair, it just takes forever to do my whole head. My hair falls just below the shoulders, and it&#x27;s pretty thick so it usually takes me about 30 to 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these Conair hot rollers, it only takes me about 7 to 10 min prepping time to put all the rollers in my hair! After that, I just let it sit and cool for about 10 to 15 minutes, all at the comfort of being able to do other things like do my makeup or watch TV.  After getting them to cool, i unroll them one by one and voila! Perfect curls! The multisized rollers create tighter curls and ringlets similar to Beyonce&#x27;s.  I would suggest getting the purpler set which comes with large and extra large rollers if you only want loose curls and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside are the roller clamps that came with it.  while its amazing that you can heat them also, they barely hold!! Although i do think that it&#x27;s a minor concern, the product still delivers even with this kind of clamp.  Also, I live in the Philippines so I had to get a separate voltage regulator as these are 120v. My mom owns an old conair hot rollers set which was dual voltage so I hope they come out with a dual voltage version for this as well.</li>
            <li> Having used electric hot rollers for many years, I needed to find a set that had bigger rollers, did not catch and break my hair, and heated quickly. I found all 3 in this Conair set. Other reviewers have commented that the case is fragile - I am used to that and therefore treat it delicately and I know it will be just fine. When traveling, just be careful how you pack it.   I have very fine hair that is below my shoulders and I tend to use a lot of the rollers just to gain some body - if I leave them in around 10-15 minutes, I get nice body and some curl. I love the foam cushioning which is very comfortable and my hair is easy to curl around the rollers.  All in all, this is a very good product, easy to use and I can see it would work on many hair types. It does take some experimentation to get the right tempature setting and the length of time needed to get the desired result.</li>
            <li> awful.  barelly heats up.  I have used many, and never had to throw one away before.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife.  She seems to be very satisfied with the product.  It makes her happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My rollers came with cheap plastic clips that were designed to hold the rollers in place... only they don&#x27;t hold the roller. These clips are absolute garbage and do not hold my thick, wavy hair at all. I&#x27;m 36 years old and have been using rollers for FOREVER, I have never had a problem with another other type of roller set. I have yet to use any with these plastic clips, rather than the traditional metal U shaped pins and needless to say, I will stick with the traditional pin sets from now on.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the clips not holding the hair well, they leave a weird ridge or dent in the curl. It looks ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Conair, get with it... stick with the traditional U pins, there&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;ve been used for years-- they work!</li>
            <li> heats up fast and creates nice curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the exact issue is, but these rollers only curl the bottom of my hair. Maybe 4-5 inches. I suspect this is because they do not get hot enough. The clips are not the worst ever, but they are a  pain. They look like they will be nice, but they don&#x27;t hold the hair quite as tight as I would like, and they leave a dent every. single. time. My stylist recommended hot rollers to me, saying they are the best way to get a curl that lasts all day, but the curls I get from this barely last an hour. I don&#x27;t mean that after an hour the curl is a little limp, I mean after an hour my hair looks like it did before I curled it at all. I have hair that is naturally a little wavy, I usually have no trouble holding a curl. I even used Redken spray starch will is great for holding curls, but still no luck. I&#x27;m very disappointed.   Also, I noticed a very recent reviewer complained her set did not have an on/off switch. Mine does have this switch. A big one right on front that you couldn&#x27;t miss.  Are there two different models they are shipping at random? That is a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this the other day and they were $22.77 w/ Prime Shipping.  And now it says almost $8 shipping, and $29.99.  So that&#x27;s weird that it&#x27;s so much more expensive now. (it&#x27;s still $22.77 @ Walmart.)  Anyways, these didn&#x27;t curl my hair.  They made my hair SLIGHTLY wavy. (I have naturally straight, thick hair.)  See that girl who posted 2 pictures, one w/ curly hair and one w/ straightish hair?  The straight hair is what my hair looked like AFTER I left the curlers in for 15 minutes.  This is weird, because my hair is normally really easy to curl, and it stays until I wet my hair.  My favorite curling iron is Conair&#x27;s infiniti curling wand. (I have the pink one because it supports breast cancer).  The clips also didn&#x27;t hold very well.  Pieces of my hair kept falling out of the curlers.  (Don&#x27;t think, \\&quot;Oh, that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t curl her hair!\\&quot;  because that&#x27;s not true.  Some of the pieces DIDN&#x27;T fall out, and even they didn&#x27;t curl.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set now for a few years.  I would consider myself an special occasion user of hot rollers (maybe 10 times a year).  Here are the pros:    1) There are plenty of rollers for doing long (but not super long) hair  2) They heat up quickly and are very hot to get a good curl  3) They take a beating and have moved across country with me and still keep going.    ... and of course the cons:  1) The clips are worthless, they don&#x27;t stay in and leave a mark on your hair  2) They are not easy to travel because they are not compact    I&#x27;d suggest getting the Conair-SPC10-Super-Clips to go along with these.    Best of luck and happy curls!</li>
            <li> I used it about ten times in 7 weeks and now the cheap plastic switch doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  Needless to say I cannot use it, cannot turn it on or off.  I never left it plugged in when not in use.  It didn&#x27;t get wet.  And their warranty is only good for 30 days.  In this day and age / throw away society I guess they don&#x27;t expect it to last any longer than 30 days before you have problems.  Prior to this I owned a Clariol hot roller set for 20 years before it died.  I am so disappointed that now I have to add it to a land fill because though it looks brand new it sure doesn&#x27;t work.  The set was wonderful but now that it&#x27;s broken with no hope of replacement it&#x27;s BOO to Conair.</li>
            <li> I have course thick but relaxed hair these rollers give me big bouncy curls and the prefect roller set ever , the only con is that I need more rollers then the unit has because my hair is so thick I have to roll smaller section so the clips will stay on but I don&#x27;t care I never had bouncy curls like this my hair moves effortless and the shine in my hair will blind you I will be purchasing another set!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying I was skeptical when I opened the box and felt the rollers which were very light and cheap feeling.  I told my husband not to get rid of the box as I really had a feeling they would be going back.  With that being said I quickly found out they are AMAZING!  I use to spend almost 45 minutes curling my whole head with a curling iron.  With these they heat up in 10 minutes, I wait for them to cool in my head but really only need to keep them in for 10 minutes and they make the most beautiful curls that last all day and into the next even when slept on.  I do use some hairspray to style but who doesn&#x27;t?  I highly recommend them and the clips keep these rollers in much much better than those metal pins.  I can run around the house, doing last minute chores before work and they stay put.  Never once have they fallen out.</li>
            <li> These were useless. Too heavy to stay in tight with these barely gripping clips. Not hot enough to get my thick hair to curl. Don&#x27;t buy these if you have thick heavy hair, worthless.....</li>
            <li> Work as expected.  I like them.</li>
            <li> Being said, my hair style has always been boring. When I do try to be &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s extremely time consuming for me to curl my hair. By the time I go around curling my entire head, half of it is already going limp. The only thing that ever worked and that I enjoyed using, up until now, is the Instyler I own. It&#x27; the first thing I actually thought made my hair look cute curled! However, the constant use is quite damaging, and I waste TONS of hairspray to get the style not to go flat. Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for a healthier alternative, and I ended up purchasing these hot rollers! One of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made! This is my very own first set, and I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the way my hair comes out with this. The hot rollers give my hair shiny, voluminous, and soft &amp;#34;romantic&amp;#34; curls. I use little to no hairspray at all, and my hair stays beautiful the entire day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I am one of those people who never put the time in to type up a review (and a long one at that!), but I&#x27;m in such of a good mood cause of my hair, I just had to! I read the negative reviews about the clips not holding very well, and I can tell you I experienced the same issue at first too. Then I found out it was the way i was rolling my hair into the barrels. You have to roll your hair in towards your scalp. Me being an amateur, I thought it didn&#x27;t matter. Oooh, it definitely does. Haha. The clips won&#x27;t secure your hair very well if you roll it the other way. So if your initial turn out isn&#x27;t so good, my advice is to try as much as you can to follow the directions to the T. Before you blame the hot rollers for not working, look up tutorials online, practice a little, and try again. You&#x27;re going to end up loving the way your hair looks! I know I do now!</li>
            <li> Although my hair was long enough to wrap around the small rollers properly, it didn&#x27;t curl.  Tried letting them heat longer with same result.  Also wanted to order more small rollers but could not find them on your website or on Conair.  The item number listed was deemed invalid.  Can you help with ordering?&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Cook</li>
            <li> i rally really like this, i just purchased this item at amazon and was glad on delivery too  I suggesst thought that you heat it up for a pretty good time at least for 30 minutes before you put them at least i do cause I have thin and fine hair which is hard to keep the curles I have recently had hair extension removed and bleached and colored rught after which it and so much more volume  cause of the nice curls especially when you have a choice of different size rollers in one</li>
            <li> I really like Conair rollers. These heat up quickly and are great to use, but with my short hair, I just prefer to use the jumbo rollers.  I tried these thinking they might work better.  They leave a much tigher curl than I want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that finally I find these rollers, I tried another brand, and all had  flows, not these. Only minus I can see because there is no place to store clips except plastic bag, otherwise it is A+ product (so far, I been using only for 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> I do like them because the curl looks good, lasts a couple of days and they heat up fast.  If they sit more than 10 mins they get pretty hot and burn my fingers, even the clips can get that hot.  Still, its not enough to bother me too much.  The clips do leave marks in my hair but fade fast enough to not bother me.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of curlers because my old set was just that - OLD.  This new set delivers great curls, and makes my hair look very full with lots of body.  I have naturally wavy hair to begin with, so these rollers really make my hair curly when I use the medium or occasional small sizes.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Different hair has different needs. With that in mind, I&#x27;d say these rollers would have been fantastic except that I could not keep them in my hair with the provided clips. In fact, I can&#x27;t keep MOST rollers in my baby-fine hair, so this was not a big shock.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The provided clips are convenient in that they&#x27;re all the same size; but, they&#x27;re really too big for the smallest-sized rollers. They fit fine on the bigger rollers, but they are still much too narrow to keep my super-straight hair from unwinding off the roller. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I contacted Conair, and they were fantastic about it. They offered to send me some alternative clips for free. Unfortuantely, they were the wire kind (even narrower than these plastic ones), so didn&#x27;t solve my problem. I ended up having to return this set and get a Remington one instead with longer, fitted, snap-on clips to hold my hair onto the rollers better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t generally have a lot of trouble with rollers falling out, these are otherwise very nice. The flocked surface makes rolling easy and is kind to your hair. The rollers get plenty hot (hotter than the alternative set I got) and there&#x27;s an included pouch to store the clips in.</li>
            <li> These may work well for someone with fine, easy to curl hair-but not for me.  My very hair is fine, but very thick &amp; straight-so the curl lasts about 2 hours at best, and that&#x27;s with spray or other holding product.  The rollers never seem to get really hot, and the clips only fit properly on the large size rollers.  The smaller rollers just fall out or you get \\&quot;dents\\&quot;-ugly!  The flocking covering probably protects your hair, but it makes using product close to the roots very difficult-you worry about gumming it up.  I&#x27;ve had many styling tools from Conair that I loved-but this is not one.</li>
            <li> The rollers and clips do not stay in place.  The order of placing the rollers in the case when done is awkward and there is no place to store but three clips.  It is impossible to control the heat of the rollers.  Their is no temperature control.</li>
            <li> get the Caruso steam rollers. I have tried 3 of these conair setters and the Caruso stayed in my thick hair and it was easy. The curls last. They are cheaper and come w a lot of diff. size rollers.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands for decades - these rollers have a few issues &amp; I cannot not recommend them - I returned them.    1. Putting them back in order is awkward as they have to be fit onto a holder  2. The clips simply don&#x27;t hold --- the pin type are much more secure  3. Totally silly to heat the clips --- holds only three at a time and each time you take one off - you put another on - waste of time  4. NO STORAGE for the clips -</li>
            <li> The clips that come with this don&#x27;t hold my hair up, in fact for most of the size rollers the clips are too small to even clip over the roller. I&#x27;m not that impressed with the hot rollers either. I will try to by separate clips from the store and maybe that will help but have seen better hot roller machines and this one is not that great.</li>
            <li> This set is reasonably priced and gives good results. I would recommend springing for extra rollers if you have long/thick hair. The clips that secure the rollers get quite hot, so be careful where you place them on your head. I would buy this product again and/or recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  Very easy to use, heats up very quickly.  I wish there was an automatic shut off safety feature, but otherwise, great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe these are worth the money. They don&#x27;t get or stay hot enough to cure. The seller was fine though so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> Both grand daughters are having a great time with this curler set</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product thinking that it would curl my hair, but the product did nothing for that.  My hair is very fine, and very straight so this did not help much. I had a hard time trying to curl my hair. When I thought it was &amp;quot;done&amp;quot; my hair was left bent. I would not try this product ever again. But it might curl your hair if it is not fine or straight.</li>
            <li> I was born, or blessed (depending on the occaision), with stick-straight, baby-fine hair.  This product allowed me to put gentle curls in that stayed. (I usually don&#x27;t even have that much luck with a curling iron.) Also, my hair had so much more volume when I pulled the rollers out--a big advantage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue was the clips. Because my hair is so fine, the clips wanted to fall out. I finally found a way that worked for me, and all it took was practice! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I loved the fact that I was able to use these rollers. In addition to my super fine hair, I have lots of layers, which usually don&#x27;t work with rollers. Because of the smooth texture, I was able to wrap as much or as little hair around the rollers to work with my style. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I am ready to reveal my curls to everyone else!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the Conair Tourmaline but didn&#x27;t like the clips. The set was excellent. These have the similar temperature control. They work great and help get rid of the frizz. I prefer the wire clips. When this stops working I&#x27;m going to buy the newer model and use the clips from this set. Gives a nice curl that seems to last. Sometimes it&#x27;s too curly when I first take it out. I would highly recommend these. I&#x27;ve tried others.</li>
            <li> this product is great. wish it had an auto off feature but otherwise this is my second one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curling my hair for over ten years and have tried several curling irons and curler sets inorder to find the perfect match. These curlers were definitely not the perfect match. The clips don&#x27;t work very well if at all, letting the rollers fall out of your hair. The curlers themselves get stuck in my hair, and the curls only last about an hour. This was the worst curler set I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> First of all, my rollers came with the fishy shaped looking clips.  I hate them.  They do not hold my thick, wavy hair and they also leave a weird indentation that gets \\&quot;burned\\&quot; into the hair.  So, in the middle of the curl, there is an occasional flat \\&quot;whip\\&quot; mark.  Additionally, my hair gets caught on the hinge part of the clip.  The lid cracked and broke off two weeks after I bought it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like these.  I miss my old rollers, which had the velvety cover on the roller and a softer heat that seemed to do less damage to my long hair.  Usually I use my rollers until they wear out, but I am going to donate these to the Salvation Army along with a NEW box of clips!</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the other reviews before ordering. I also had no clips. I think they should be required to change the advertisement of this product if the clips are not available. Curlers work well and I was in need of a new set, since after a while the cushioning comes off and it burns the hair.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews before ordering this product.  It didn&#x27;t have the clips as advertised and the rollers were not easy to use.  Securing them was difficult and painful.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I needed to replace the molecular curler set that finally wore out after about 12 years of tried and true service.  I could not find another set of these in the store so I \\&quot;settled\\&quot; on this product.  Let me tell you, I shouldn&#x27;t have...  The curl does not stay in my hair for more than about 45 mins (if that) sometimes it does not even LOOK like I  curled it.  My hair is VERY easy to curl and will HOLD curl all day when the right product is used.  The clips did not even work properly, I was always having to fix the rollers from coming out.  I finally got wise, got on line, found another set of Caruso Molecular Rollers and ordered them.  I will try to find someone who really does not want to have curly hair and give them this set....NEVER AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> I needed a new set of curlers because the set I had didn&#x27;t have enough rollers for my thick hair. It wasn&#x27;t until after I ordered these that I realized the ones I had already were also Conair! I am VERY happy with these curlers! They feel very familiar because of the other set I have...my only complaint is that I need more large ones than what is included in this set. However, now I&#x27;m heating up both sets, and FINALLY I can relax and set my hair the way I really WANT to!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these curlers, I think they&#x27;re great. They heat up quickly, and well. You can control how hot they get with a heat setting (1-12). I would have to disagree with K. Johnson, too, regarding the &#x27;flimsy plastic lid&#x27;. Reading her review nearly put me off buying these, but I find the lid is just fine. It&#x27;s not thick plastic, but I don&#x27;t see any need to be any thicker than it is....it does the job!</li>
            <li> Poor Design.  The plastic clips do not work as intended. They put a large crimp in my hair near my scalp.  I like nice soft \\&quot;even\\&quot; curls.  I have long hair, but it would likely do the same for short hair.  I cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased these hot rollers this past February in anticipation of some formal occasions coming up, and was pleased with the results they gave.    My hair is medium length and straight. The only way I could get my hair to curl would be if I washed my hair, set it in rollers (foam or otherwise), and slept overnight with them in.  But now I don&#x27;t have to sleep with curlers in.    This product offers a great solution for me. It is very effective on my straight hair. I often set my hair in these hot rollers, and then do my makeup and dressing. Leaving them in for that extra amount of time (maybe 30 minutes altogether) helps the curl stay longer.     I like the way the set looks on my counter, and I like that it has an onboard heater for 3 curler clips at a time. I also like that it has a cover over it, which helps keep out dust and makeup.     The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t offer any storage solution for the curler clips.</li>
            <li> My wife picked these out, and she loves them. She said the price is great, and that it works perfectly. She is very happy with it, she said she would buy the same model again if needed.</li>
            <li> These are so fast. They heat up in about 2 minutes and they&#x27;re ready to go.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the clips.  They don&#x27;t hold the curler in as tight as I would like and sometimes leave dents in my hair especially if I curl it under like I like to do with the top layer.  On the plus side all of the clips fit all of the curlers so you&#x27;re not hunting around for the matching clip like in the old days.  I do not have to use any mousse for body and the curl lasts all day.  My friend tried them out but didn&#x27;t care for them because she needed larger curlers. So while I&#x27;m in this long hair phase I will enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these guys after the heating element on my last set of hot rollers broke; there weren&#x27;t a lot of options at retail, and these looked gentle and like the clips would hold.  The set I got has the clamp-style clips shown in the photo (not the older-fashioned u-shaped metal clips.  The first few uses, I found that they worked OK if I let them heat up a LONG time (20+ minutes or more) and left them in a LONG time (until the rollers were completely cool).  Occasionally they get tangled in my hair because of their design, even though I remove them carefully, but that doesn&#x27;t happen super often.  The clamp-style clips do leave undesirable indentations, that last longer than the curl itself.  Finally - over a couple of months of infrequent use, they&#x27;ve basically stopped heating.  At this point, whether I heat them for five minutes or 25 minutes, I only wind up with a few curls, and most rollers don&#x27;t even heat enough to smooth my hair.  I&#x27;m really disappointed with these, since they are a lot of waste for a couple months of a product that doesn&#x27;t actually work as advertised... they&#x27;re definitely not \\&quot;instant heat.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Aside from the fact that it burns your fingers (there&#x27;s no way to protect yourself other than to wear silicone mitts), the curlers absolutely would not stay in my hair. It&#x27;s not as though I&#x27;m a first time hot curler user. I&#x27;ve been using them for many years. My first try took 15 minutes to get three rollers in and then I gave up. I went back a second time thinking it would be a matter of getting used to a new product. But I just can&#x27;t get used to a new \\&quot;badly designed, never should have been manufactured product\\&quot;. I can&#x27;t believe this product even got as far as the store shelf. I returned it after my second try which took an hour, I couldn&#x27;t move my head or the rollers slid out and the end result was indeed lousy and I did have the creases that they said would not happen. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Shame on you Conair!</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD THESE ROLLERS FOR SOME TIME NOW AND YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BURN YOURSELF ON THE METAL CLIPS AND AS FAR AS THE LID IT IS VERY INFERIOR AS WELL....ALTHOUGH CONAIR MAKES A GOOD HOT ROLLER THE ENGINEERS FELL SHORT ON THE METAL CLIPS AND LID... THE  CLIPS  CONDUCT HEAT AND BURN YOUR HEAD AND EARS AND THE LID CRACKS BUT AS FAR AS HOW THEY CURL YOUR HAIR THEY ARE THE BEST. I AM SURE THEY HAVE HAD TO HAVE SOME LAWSUITS OVER THIS.</li>
            <li> I love this hair curler set. I have purchased two of them now, one for each daughter. Both have long, thick hair and we find that it does an excellent job of providing just the right amount of curl for those occasions when you need it. It takes just a few minutes to heat up and the soft velvet lining on the rods make it less damaging to hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I always hate is the clips! Even though there is a small case to hold them, sometimes they get lost!  Replacement clip sets would be much appreciated. I think the curler set contains just the right number of each size of roller -- even better though would be to have two ore large ones!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the product delivered actually came with the accessories in the pictures.  I purchased this specifically for the wide clips for my wife&#x27;s hair.  After seeing my wife use it I find that it has those cruddy little metal clips that slide right out of her hair.  Mybe Amazon should do a little fact checking and inspect the products they sell before they blindly put pictures on their web site.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a 4.5 because my hair does curl very well.  See, I have relatively thin hair on top of my head, and thick hair on the bottom (I know, it&#x27;s very weird), and is very silky.  I got them when my hair was longer (waist length) and now my hair is shoulder length.  This product works well on both lengths and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  I don&#x27;t need any product, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the clips.  While they do keep the curlers in my hair, they also leave a dent in my hair.  I prefer vertical curls and they won&#x27;t give them because of those stupid clips.  But, you can fix the kink with a straightener or even a curling iron. or even prevent the kink by not heating them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. They give a great curl&lt;br /&gt;2. They heat up in less than 2 minutes (and get SUPER hot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The clips can leave a kink.</li>
            <li> The Hot rollers works fine. But the seller or company sold this product to me, clearly stated that it is a BRAND NEW ITEM, but when I open the box, there was hair in it, long blond hair...quite disgusted. Overall it works fine, but not so satisfy with it being used when it suppose to be brand new</li>
            <li> ... so she&#x27;d have enough small and medium rollers. The large ones are&lt;br /&gt;FAR too big. I also bought here another type of Conair clip which she likes better.&lt;br /&gt;For some ladies, this will just be a &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> My Review on the 22nd of March&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;In 2002, I bought the first hairdresser from CONAIR - hair setter. In fact, I fall in love with it, as it was my best friend since then. I didn&#x27;t know that all their hairdressers will give me as rewarding results until I tried this year three of their products, which are CONAIR CHV26IX, CS19JCS and CD 160DRCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair dressing has never been as easy. I&#x27;ve tried many from other brands but none worked with me and gave me salon results as CONAIR, I thought the problem was with my curly hair until I tried CONAIR ones. Their products are life saving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you CONAIR, you&#x27;ve always been my best friend wherever I go..  : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review on the 30th of July&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I loved this hair setter so much. I bought one for one of my relatives on May and today I&#x27;m going to order two hair setters for two of my friends. Buy it for yourself first, if you find it effective, don&#x27;t forget that YOUR BELOVED ONES DESERVE ONE  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Do not buy this machine.  Doesn&#x27;t heat hot enough to curl anything, hair falls limp rapidly.  This set is terrible, dont waste your money, I just returned mine to Walmart where it belongs.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that these curlers are wrapped in a soft velvety material that doesn&#x27;t burn your hands to touch like metal, and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair so much as metal seems to burn. It holds curl better than any brand or size curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I curled my hair at 9:30AM went to work from 10-4 and with a small touch of sebastian hair spray, my curls lasted through out the whole day. Even through work! Which I work in a humid hot area where most hair will fall flat within an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deffinetly recommend this product, I dont think you&#x27;ll be disappointed and not only that but it comes with a 1 year warranty, how great is that?</li>
            <li> I have very thick hard to manage hair that is curly underneath (cork screw) curls. These rollers smooths all the runaway curls and makes beautiful curls on my bone straight hair on top. Silky smooth. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great curler set. I have used it on my thick, long hair without any problems. I have also used it on my daughter&#x27;s fine long hair too! The only problem I have had is the edges get a little too hot to touch if left on too long. I simply open the plastic cover on that side to cool them a bit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The set features different size curlers, for different parts of the hair. It grasps nicely (even to fine hair) and is easy to roll. It&#x27;s exactly what I anticipated and is working well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those with hard to hold hair, I recommend a spray gel beforehand to keep the curl lasting longer.</li>
            <li> The rollers were really easy to use and the clips held my hair in place pretty well. I used a trick my sister showed me - to push them towards the scalp first and then rotate them upwards to hold them in place. I don&#x27;t actually have any negative comments at all. They actually work pretty well, so I found out that I don&#x27;t need to leave them in as long as I originally thought I did.</li>
            <li> The curlers were not as thick as my last set, but they seem to work great.  I was extremely disappointed when the curlers arrived with wire pins instead of the blue plastic clips that are advertised with it.  Amazon was helpful with their reply, but could not send the clips.  I contacted Conair who are currently sending the clips for no charge!  I will continue to buy their products!</li>
            <li> My title says it all. &lt;br /&gt;You can set your hair really fast! I love it for that. Want curly hair for work today? You don&#x27;t have to get up 3 hours before to get ready. I can set my hair in 5 minutes, then wait 5 minutes (brush teeth, make-up etc) then take them off. &lt;br /&gt;I have impossible-to-curl hair (have done 3 in home perms with my hair looking exactly the same as to when I started them).  &lt;br /&gt;The curls hold for most of the day which is more that I can say for the curling iron (I get tired of holding it so I don&#x27;t get good curls). &lt;br /&gt;So this is like many mini curling irons in your hair at the same time. &lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that my set of rollers came with some weird pins to hold them in place that I can&#x27;t figure out how to work for the life of me. So I ended up buying just a set of metallic cheap clampy pins to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> Not fabulous, but then, I have difficulty getting my hair to keep a curl.  On the bright side, putting the rollers in gets less awkward with practice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my rollers!! I wanted something better than foam rollers (which always made my curls too tight and took forever!) and a curling iron (the style never stayed.) Every time I do my hair with these I get tons of compliments (without fail) and the best thing is that they are so easy and fast! I&#x27;ve used these when I&#x27;m running late! When my hair is wet I put in some gel, blow dry and then put in the rollers-my curls last all day! Even when I brush through it a few times it&#x27;s still great. The metal holders work fine and I keep them in the pouch they send you. My hair is fine and flat with a bit of natural wave-I never knew what to do with it but now I love doing my hair with these! I put the smallest rollers on my bottom layer, the biggest in the middle and the medium size in the front. If you&#x27;re a little unsure how to use hot rollers just look up a tutorial online and then get these. That&#x27;s what I did.  This product is my life saver!</li>
            <li> I ordered these rollers from Amazon, and received the rollers with 20 metal pins instead of clips, so I called Conair and they promptly shipped the 20 clips to me at no charge. The roller heats up fairly quickly, but can get a little too hot, so I usually open one side of the cover when I&#x27;m ready to roll. Each set comes with 3 different sizes of rollers.</li>
            <li> THIS SET CURLED WELL IF YOU COULD OPEN THE LID, BECAUSE IT&#x27;S KIND OF HARD. I BURNED MY FINGERS ON THE ROLLERS, AND I HATE THE CLIPS. THEY DIG MY SCALP. I JUST DIDN&#x27;T LIKE IT AS WELL AS OTHER SETS I&#x27;VE HAD.</li>
            <li> I really like the Conair Ion Shine hair setter.  I find the curls last longer and it leaves my hair shiny and in good condition.  Not like the old hairsetters for sure!  Your hair looks like it was done in a salon!</li>
            <li> Yes, these rollers will curl your hair. But the clips leave significant crimp marks, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way around it. The lovely curls are definitely marred by the marks. Too bad!</li>
            <li> The roller set is quick to heat and there are enough rollers for my hair (just past shoulder length, pretty fine, lots of layers). I&#x27;m hardly a professional, and was hoping hot rollers would be simple enough that I could set, cool, and go. While my hair was more voluminous than usual, the staying power (with a setting spray) wasn&#x27;t incredible. I&#x27;d definitely believe that this is due to my hair, rather than the product -- even professional stylists can&#x27;t get my hair to hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to note that the product description is inaccurate -- rather than coming with \\&quot;20 wire hair clips,\\&quot; as advertised, the set came with large plastic clips which leave noticeable crimps in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well... maybe Dolly Parton hair just isn&#x27;t attainable for me :(</li>
            <li> I received my roller set yesterday and have used it twice. It was my first time using hot rollers and I&#x27;m happy with the results. Obviously nothing has broken yet but it seems to be sturdy enough and everything heats up as it should. I only had to leave them in for fifteen minutes or so (I have medium length, thick hair). I recommend these.</li>
            <li> This is the only type of curler I use, the other type don&#x27;t stay in my hair. The only thing I&#x27;m not sold on is the clips.  I purchased other U-shaped clips as they work better for me.  When I the curlers cool completely before removing them, my hair stays curly - even the next morning!</li>
            <li> I purchased a Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers, Pink from the seller called &amp;#34;Gourmet Kitchen Gallery&amp;#34; on May 11, 2013. I basically used this item for less than 10 times then left it in a dry and clean place in my bedroom. A few days ago I took it out wanted to use it again, found it was actually broken!!! It can&#x27;t be heated up anymore, I was shocked as I used it very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed by the quality of this stuff, even I loved how my hair looked like after using it. Since this item was posted from the states and I am currently living in Singapore, I waited for quite a while for it to arrive. I would want to return this item and get 100% refund or change to a new item. Also I will be very cautious to make other orders in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope someone can get back to me the ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;Jenny</li>
            <li> Wife likes it and uses it multiple times a week. Only negative is that the curlers don&#x27;t quite get as hot as she would want, and the curls don&#x27;t last quite as long. Still a good set for the cost.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers, especially the variable heat setting.  My hair was starting to break off at an alarming rate, but when I switched to these flocked curlers and used a lower heat, the situation improved enormously.</li>
            <li> I found this Conair Instant hair set of rollers very nice but as I&#x27;m disabled I found that I needed my caregiver to work with them....She prefered the curling iron which is faster for her.    Also don&#x27;t like the fact that there was no street or city/state address so just returned them to Amazon.com but felt uneasy about this..until I got a response that they were received by Amazon.       At the postoffice I tried to get a delivery confirmation but was told they don&#x27;t do this without a regular address... Just a suggestion I think most people would prefer a regular address to send back returns.    Thanks anyway    Betty</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many conair hot roller sets I&#x27;ve bought over my life - 10, 15?  They&#x27;re ok (just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;) for about a month, then they don&#x27;t get hot anymore and are useless.  I&#x27;ve never seen an alternative hot roller set until Caruso, so I&#x27;m gonna give those a try.  Conair is a waste.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had better clips from my older little conair hot roller and these now work like a charm. I think the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; clips are advertised and sold separately. Sneaky sneaky... They&#x27;re the same exact clips that came with my old roller set.</li>
            <li> These are great hot rollers overall. I have fine baby-like hair so the clip design is a little looser than my old set clips so no 5 stars from me. Also, the rollers themselves are somewhat smaller than my old set. The largest are not jumbo size but large. Medium are medium small and smalls are about the same or a little smaller. I only use half the .clips so I would imagine that it comes with enough clips to do just about everyone&#x27;s hair. The velvety material seems to be generous enough. It&#x27;s does state &amp;#34;ready in 2 minutes&amp;#34; but I think it&#x27;s a little longer.</li>
            <li> The clips do not secure the rollers very well.  I have to use other clips to hold rollers in place.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and gave almost too much curl. The large rollers could have bee bigger but worked Ok. Decided to get my hair cut so now an addition to my guest room.</li>
            <li> I love these hot rollers. They&#x27;re easy to use and give my hair body. I have straight hair and it usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl long, but these work great on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers for probably 25 years, but now that I&#x27;m going to look for a job again and want some variety in my look (and for going out too), so I bought these. I just have to say that I like this new technology, with the fast heat up, the ionic ceramic rollers and the slit in the clips. It just makes things a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that the heat-resistant plastic clips are a little \\&quot;saggy\\&quot; when they&#x27;re clipped onto the roller. This might be because they don&#x27;t have long teeth. I do like that they warm up and fast too, though. I don&#x27;t want tight curls against my head, I like the look of curls and waves more towards the lower 2/3 of my now shoulder-length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the way it works is that the unit is plugged in and then you can switch it on or off. The rollers heat up in 2 minutes, or so it says and they&#x27;re flocked so they&#x27;re warm to the touch but not scalding when held. They have a slit in them to hold the ends of hair in place. The hair is rolled up and the warmed clip is put on. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the clip not holding, but it doesn&#x27;t hold hair tight against the scalp. It kind of sags a good inch or so down from the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave mine on for 10 minutes and then unroll. This is more than sufficient to give me curls. I was surprised when I first started using these, because the curl was pretty tight. I like waves so use the two largest rollers. The warmed clip heats the other end of the hair that&#x27;s not held on by the rollers and keeps the curl intact from start to the clip.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of hot rollers and I love them. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smart clips they leave kinks in your hair. and don&#x27;t hold vary well. Other then that the curls stay for hours and they are nice and bouncy. I don&#x27;t even have to use product in my hair to help it from falling.</li>
            <li> I love these hot rollers! Included in the box, is an order form for ordering more rollers in various sizes!</li>
            <li> THESE WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A GIFT.  THEY DON&#x27;T HEAT UP ENOUGH AND DON&#x27;T HOLD A LOT OF HAIR ON THE ROLLER.  THE CLIPS SUPPLIED ARE USELESS, THEY FLY OFF THE ROLLER OR DON&#x27;T HOLD AT ALL.  EVEN AFTER LEAVING THE ROLLERS IN FOR OVER 20 MINUTES, THE CURL WAS VERY LITTLE AND FELL WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT PURCHASE NOR CAN I RECOMMEND THESE.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is a pain in the butt to curl. I put these in let them cool, take them out, bam perfect hair. I have  broke the top shell traveling and dropping it but still works perfect.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and recipient was quite pleased, except there is no storage space for the cord or the clips. Maybe something to consider in the future design.</li>
            <li> This easy to do my hair &amp; look good but I don&#x27;t like the chips! they don&#x27;t hold the hair have use pins on my hair! that side in the roller!</li>
            <li> I love this! Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner! It works fast &amp; efficient! Love how my hair looks &amp; good for a lazy day since little work involved</li>
            <li> easy to use,heats super fast very convienient! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!&lt;br /&gt;3 size rollers make the job faster and heated clips makes hair style stay longer!</li>
            <li> Lovely set of rollers that won&#x27;t stay in my hair with the provided clips.  I strongly suggest you keep looking.  This set is a waste of $30.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple different hot rollers and I like this one the best because 1) it has actual clips instead of the stupid pins that never stay in and 2) it has enough rollers for my hair and heats up in 75 seconds as stated. I do agree with other reviewers that the clips can cause creases in your hair but my hair is so thick that I just run my fingers through it after it&#x27;s done and the creases are gone. I also like that the rollers aren&#x27;t made out of plastic, their material helps to stay in my hair better. I will be keeping this set!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get the right product after sending the wrong curlers back for second time. I really wanted the Conair Ion Shine Instant Heat Hair Setter, but they obviously never had them in stock in the 1st place so I am very dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t recieve what I ordered!!!</li>
            <li> This Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Roller in pink are meant to curl you hair. I have long and thick hair.  When I use the rollers it takes twice as long and the curls aren&#x27;t guaranteed to stay, unless I use hairspray.  For myself I have to use all the curlers, witch there is not enough of the same size to use on all my hair at the same time.  The clips don&#x27;t always hold the rollers. Even though they do get hot fast, too hot to touch. Leaving me to get burned. This product would be a last resort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay overall. A little bit difficult, and not as big as I wanted, but for small rollers its ok.</li>
            <li> I love it so much !! Great buy. Works wonderfully. Heats up fast and curls last. I&#x27;m satisfied!!. Worth it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like it or not yet. I mean, it works if you know what you are doing. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t. ha ha It&#x27;s a learning process for me, but overall I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> These are excellent hot rollers. There is an on and off switch, graduated sizes of rollers, but probably not enough to cover an entire head. I had an older large set of hot rollers to compliment this set. With the addition of the two, this works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue, which is a big one, the clips that come with this set do not work. You can place them on the rollers and they slide off. I am not sure what the problem is with hot roller sets. It makes no sense to me that they do not have clips that work. They must do some sort of quality assurance, so something is wrong with the entire process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended For Hot Rollers Only. prisrob 06-28-15</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift. My friend said she uses it a lot and loves it. Light and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I like this hair setter! The only thing I would like different is the clips.  If it had the clips like they had before (big plastic loop) I would give this a 5 star rating.  I still have my older clips, so it worked out for me.</li>
            <li> I am giving these curlers their starts because they do a great job in terms of speed. The curlers do their job and curl. The problem, and the only reason this is 3, not 5 starts is that the clip creates a weird crease in the hair. Different clips would be nice!</li>
            <li> These curlers didn&#x27;t have the clips as shown in the picture. They heat slow, and have to many small curlers. The picture looked as if they were large and medium.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer!</li>
            <li> Cons - just about everything -&lt;br /&gt;*Clips don&#x27;t hold hair&lt;br /&gt;*Takes much longer than 85 secs to heat up&lt;br /&gt;*Only heats 3 clips at a time...then what?? Wait.&lt;br /&gt;*Where the heck are you suppose to store the clips when not in use?&lt;br /&gt;*Cheap and flimsy rollers (due to the way they are suppose to be heated)&lt;br /&gt;*Ridiculously expensive for what you get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pros that I can see. They lost the moment the clips didn&#x27;t hold the rollers in.</li>
            <li> I got the hot rollers as a Christmas gift (2013).&lt;br /&gt; I did a lot of research into hot rollers and which ones would be best for me. I wanted these ones as they are multisided, heated up fast and they have the felt material over the roller. the felt is great as when I had tested out the ones which were rubbery with bumps it got caught and tangled in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair and not much of it. my hair is straight but flat so I wanted the rollers to give me both volume and loose natural looking curls . I love the rollers as they give me exactly that,  volume and curl that lasts hours and it turned out great even with my first go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only reason I gave it a 4 is that they are very hot in your hand making it more difficult to apply when you lack hot roller experience. my favorite part is even when you apply them badly he results are still great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(if you are Australian like me or from other countries that don&#x27;t have the same power adapter as in America be sure to get a universal power adapter from your local shopping center with this purchase :) )</li>
            <li> There is no on/off switch as stated and shown.  I sent mine back.  I want a unit that has a switch and doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in for each use.</li>
            <li> curls does not stay long enough.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair which is curl resistant but this hot curler set handles it with ease.  Normally I would use the hot electric curlers but it only lasts for a day or two.  Conair extreme gives me big beautiful curls for days.  I use a small amount of mousse and in fifteen to twenty minutes I have a gorgeous style.  Notice the time!  I am African American and the recommended time will not work for me, however if it curls my hair it will work for anyone.</li>
            <li> These rollers do not work well for fine hair. The rollers do not get hot enough for the curl to stay. I used these and it was a wast of my time and money. The curl did not stay in my hair. My hair is fine and dose not hold a curl easily. I read the reviews and I was excited to try these but I the results were  disappointing.</li>
            <li> The clips shown are not the clips shipped with the product. They are the clamp type clips and they don&#x27;t stay in and leave indentations. Plus, there is no where to store them.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this  roller set as it was from Conair. I was not disppointed! This baby heats up really quick, and does the job. My hair always comes out smooth and bouncy not frizzy. I would recommend this product to anyone who has little time on their hands, but still wants  a polished finish everyday. Keep up the good work Conair!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of hot rollers, and overall I&#x27;m very pleased. The set is compact and attractive, and there are more than enough rollers included to set my thick, straight, just-past-shoulder length hair. The curl holds nicely even after just ten minutes, and the heated clips are a nice touch. I was unsure about using different sized rollers, but I did some research on how to use them and found that using the largest rollers on top, medium ones in the middle, and smallest on the bottom of my head as advised works great. You can also use just one or two sizes in batches, letting them reheat for a minute each time for curls that are all the same size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers don&#x27;t heat as quickly as advertised. Even though the indicator dot turns white in about a minute, the rollers are still quite cool. I let them heat for 3-5 minutes, which isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I can get dressed and make my tea while I wait for them to heat and I still have plenty of time in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips sometimes leave kinks in my hair, but I think with practice that can be avoided. I do wish there was some kind of clip storage, but I just kept the box it came in and keep them in there for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to friends, it really can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are the bomb they don&#x27;t get tangled in your fair cool to touch no burns and very nice curl, This was a great purchase</li>
            <li> Whoever thought of these new clips hasn&#x27;t used hot rollers before!  If you have thick, long hair these clips do not hold your hair in.  I would return if I hadn&#x27;t tried them.  Been using hot rollers for 30 years.  Should have stuck with the metal clips, not only do they hold the curler to your head, but take up less room if need to travel with them.</li>
            <li> My old one died after four years, and I got a new one right away.  The clips that come with the set don&#x27;t hold the curlers tight, which is especially annoying if your hair is long, so I don&#x27;t use the clips.  The traditional electric roller pins are available on Amazon and the soft covering on this product&#x27;s curlers gives the pins something to grip into so the curlers stay where you want them to stay. The covering doesn&#x27;t wear down, even after years of use.  There&#x27;s no hard spiky bumps on the curlers.  I haven&#x27;t had the problem some have had with burned fingers because I don&#x27;t let it heat for more than a couple of minutes--it&#x27;s hot enough by then. I&#x27;ve used a lot of roller sets, and I like this one the best, even if the clips are worthless.</li>
            <li> I love the curlers.  They heat up fast, and are EVENLY hot.  the tips make sure you are not constantly burning yourself.  The plastic clips are the killer for this set.  The springs are not strong enough to hold the rollers into place.  I HAD the plastic u shaped snap on clips from my previous conair set that i used for a while, but when they disapeared (think hubby threw them out) i started using these:  [[ASIN:B001QX7NTQ Scunci No slip Grip Chunky Clips]]  until i can find some better clips.  It works for now, but the curlers themselves are definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Used for a short time-then one time after heating up for just 6 minutes, the plastic clips melted to the holder and one roller end melted.  By the way, the clips didn&#x27;t hold the hair anyway.</li>
            <li> Good quality for this Price. The curls gets quite tight if you have médium long hair. I have now longer hair and the results looks now better as the curls look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike is that my fingers get constantly burned, .. I guess it I am not very good at this but it would be gread if it came with a special glove to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;Top product, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how these would for me... My hair breaks and frizzes so easily. my hair stylist suggested using velvet hot rollers for styling. After comparing a few different brands and kinds, settled on these.... and so glad I did. I finally got a chance to use them for the first time today and all I can say is WOW..... never would have guessed but these made my (usually) inbetween-textured, usually dull hair, look and feel SO GOOD! and they were super easy and quick to use. I pinned up the top half of my hair (crown and bangs) and curled the back and sides, let them sit for about a minute, took those out, clipped that section to the side and took down the top of my hair... curled those and again, once the rollers were all in I let them sit about 30 seconds before begining to take them out, starting from the first one I put in. This all took less than 10 minutes and with practice, I&#x27;m sure would take about 5 minutes. So easy and the result is awesome!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay in very well. I have thick long hair. These are so small, I have to use such small sections of hair. But the clips don&#x27;t hold well enough. Im better off using an iron or wand.</li>
            <li> I gave these to my sister for her birthday.  She can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> I have used hair rollers since arrival and am pretty well pleased.      The one complaint I have is that the clips do not hold the curlers in place.  If I want a tight curl it does not happen.    Otherwise it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out, and am at the awkward stage with my bangs.  Curling irons were just taking too long, so for the first time in years I decided to try hot rollers again.  I read a lot of reviews and decided on this set.  I like everything about it, and know that it would do a good job IF the rollers would stay in!  The clips are horrible.  They don&#x27;t grab very tightly at all, and for an area like around the face it is impossible to get them to stay.  The ones that do stay in leave a really weird little crease from where they clip, causing &#x27;cowlick&#x27; type problems.  I&#x27;ve almost been in tears from the result a few nights when I had no option but to go the way I looked or start all over and be late.  I just bought another set with the old fashioned skinny wire hooks, as most seem to use the clips nowadays and I don&#x27;t see how any clips would not leave creases.  These are going in my next garage sale.</li>
            <li> I gave these 4 stars because the clips they come with suck and cover does not stay tightly closed. These are the first set of rollers I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;m pleased with them. I also bought the super clips that come in a box of 10 and they hold the rollers in place. The clips in this set don&#x27;t hold well. They hold your hair but not the roller and the hair and not in place. I had a lot of trouble with them in my hair and sorta slipping off therefore having the hot rollers against my neck and face. Other than that they do curl well with the right clips to keep them in place. And the curl stays in your hair over night.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Velvet/flocked rollers for less damage to hair&lt;br /&gt;- Produces a nice curl&lt;br /&gt;- Heated clips seem to give a better set to the curl&lt;br /&gt;- Quick heat up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Clips leave dents in my fine hair&lt;br /&gt;- Clips do not stay in place for a firm hold like metal clips&lt;br /&gt;- Only 3 clips can be heated at once&lt;br /&gt;- Unit does not come with anything to hold extra clips&lt;br /&gt;- Roller has a slit in the middle where it fits onto the heating element, when unrolling the roller my long hair got tangled in the opening.&lt;br /&gt;- End of rollers are a bit hot when rolling your hair onto the roller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the unit. With the rollers getting tangled in my hair and the plastic clips leaving dents and not staying in place I just didn&#x27;t think it was worth keeping.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my hair.</li>
            <li> Clips for rollers and rollers are too heavy for short hair. Indicator light for hot rollers too dull. It is hard to tell when rollers are heated</li>
            <li> I think I will really enjoy these once I get used to the dry heat, and they do get hot! I&#x27;m used to the steam rollers, but couldn&#x27;t find any new ones. And if nothing else they look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> idid not like it as mutch as my old one did notr like the claps the felt every time ue pu it on the hot rollrs</li>
            <li> I bought my first Conair Hot rollers similar to this one which I used for over 25 years. I like the material on the roller to help protect my hair from getting too hot. It comes with only 3 clips which isn&#x27;t enough if you want to use more than three rollers at a time. This problem is easily solved by purchasing clips separately ($1-$3 for a set of 4) at any general merchandise store. I bought several hair clips made for holding your hair back and use them with my curlers. They actually work much better than the clips that come with the Hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Super small rollers...your hair comes out in very tight ringlet curls. Probably best for short hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of these.  They are great.  I had my previous set for over 4 years &amp; used daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set before...so I reordered without hesitation - only the rollers I received do not have an on/off switch and it&#x27;s really inconvenient (and not as safe) to have to plug them in/pull the plug to control the power.</li>
            <li> These are the worst rollers  the clips will not hold your hair...DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY  they are horrible for what you pay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the rollers once so far but for someone that&#x27;s completely inept and using stuff like this it was very easy to use, heated up quickly, and gave great results.  Would definitely recommend this product and the product itself is small enough to be convenient for easy storage.  Very happy</li>
            <li> I have had many sets of curlers, and theses are by far the worst.  The plastic \\&quot;clips\\&quot; to hold your hair on the rollers cause a crease in my hair - that looks very awkward.  I called the company (Conair) and complained &amp; they said nothing.  :(  I took them to the Goodwill.</li>
            <li> I initially bought the Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers - these came with metal, not the plastic clips shown and I felt like I was getting something less.  Not so!  That model does a fabulous job and the wire clips keep the curler in place nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for this new set... I bought the smaller roller set because I recently cut my hair for the  spring/summer so the larger diameter set doesn&#x27;t really have enough hair to hold in nicely.  I thought these would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although flocked like the larger - fast heating as well (crazy fast!) - the plastic clips I wanted for the larger do not hold at all in my hair.  I have enough hair - it is on the medium/thick side, I don&#x27;t &#x27;over-load&#x27; or &#x27;under-load&#x27; the curler but the clips just do not hold.  They flop around on your head instead of staying in place. and you wind up with weird loose curls (if you get any at all) that have dents in them - not a good sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with this item at all and it is going back.  I sent them a message on fb but no hopes of hearing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better clip system is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  Call 1-800-3CONAIR and tell them you purchased this set and the clips are terrible if you are not happy with them but rather then return the whole set - would they please supply you with the metal version of the clips that fit this model.  The number for the clips is CHV26IVR-clips.  They only cost $1.50 and .50 for shipping so they actually just sent them for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the review with the new clips: tried them with the meal clips - and they are awesome so a 3 star review went to 5 stars for both the curlers (which heat up CRAZY fast, the flocking also keeps them from tangling in your hair when you take them out) and for Conair&#x27;s customer service (I think it is in Mexico because I called twice, I accidentally hung up the first time) and both times they were different women but both Spanish accents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These curlers are perfect for my mew shorter summer hair cut.  If you have long hair - try the larger roller model - these would be way to small for long hair./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These curlers are perfect for my mew shorter summer hair cut.  If you have long hair - try the larger roller model - these would be way to small for long hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted some set in curlers because I was tired of my curling iron damaging my hair. I love the low price as well as the look of these. And they do the job!</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to work for my hair type as it did for other people. I have very fine streight hair shoulder length hair and after using the product for a week, I found the cutlers did not get hot enought for my hair to keep the curl, no matter how long I left them in. I went back to using hot curlers that are just plastic which get much hotter and works much better in curling my hair</li>
            <li> The good thing about these hot rollers is that they heat up fast and curl one&#x27;s hair well.  The bad news is that the large clamp-type clips do not hold the rollers in place.  I have thick hair and even then then the provided clips don&#x27;t hold.  When placing a smaller amount of hair on each roller, the rollers still don&#x27;t hold in place.  I have to use my old wire clips to to secure rollers. I would definitely not recommend this product due to the instability of the rollers.  Forget about walking around.  The rollers fall out.</li>
            <li> First of all the price of this setter went from $22.77 to over $36.00 in one week&#x27;s time!! Not sure why such a huge price increase and I&#x27;d like to say the reason was because this setter is worth every penny, but I&#x27;d be lying. It&#x27;s advertised quite extensively on here as being an ionic hair setter. It ISN&#x27;T! There is a higher end model which is the Conair Ion Shine, and that particular model IS an ionic setter. After reading the reviews on here I thought I was getting a great deal for paying less than $25.00 for a true ionic setter. But alas, if it sounds too good to be true, than it usually is. It breaks my heart to read many of the reviews here about this set from women who just love their new \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; set because the ions make it so that the setter does not damage the hair. Obviously they believed, as I did when I purchased this setter, everything I read. So caveat emptor..if having an ionic setter is important to you, than look elsewhere. As far as the clips that come with this set, I guess I am in the minority as I thought having heated clips was a great feature. It doesn&#x27;t matter that they only give you enough room to place 3 at a time on the heating elements, because as you take one off to use, just replace it with a cool one. By the time you get back to the 1st clip, it&#x27;s heated quite nicely. The heated clips do help the curl process in my opinion. They stay in my hair quite nicely but they do tend to \\&quot;drop\\&quot;. My hair is on the thick, coarse side, so perhaps that&#x27;s why I don;t have a huge problem with them staying in place. If I had fine hair, I think I&#x27;d pass on these and go with the old fashioned wire clips.     Because this set is not ionic and I really wanted an ionic setter, I stupidly ordered a Babyliss set that also is advertised at Folica as ionic. I paid much more for it than I would have had I purchased the same set here. Well imagine my frustration when I received the Babyliss only to find that it is also NOT IONIC! I am in disbelief that this happened to me twice in less than one week. I am also upset at Folica in general. When I emailed their customer service I was given no apology. In fact they blamed it on Babyliss saying that Babyliss provides them with item descriptions. Huh? It&#x27;s now the manufacturers&#x27; fault if the retailer puts up the wrong description? I was told to pack it up and drop it off at a UPS shipping center if I didn&#x27;t want the set. Lessoned well learned. I should have purchased the replacement setter at Amazon. Their CS department is second to none, their prices are much better than Folica&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve always been happy with Amazon in general. I got miffed about buying what I thought was an ionic hair setter, so I cut off my nose to spite my face and went with this pricey Babyliss set at Folica. Stupid mistake. As a side note...I found out that Conair bought out Babyliss so personally I would not waste my money on the Babyliss brand again. Since they make both brands, why shell out the extra money? Not worth it!    Update: After returning the Babyliss 30 set that was not ionic to Folica, I came on here and read every review on every hair setter over again. While I swore I would not \\&quot;waste\\&quot; my money on a Babyliss because they were actually made by Conair, I bought a Babyliss on here at Amazon, anyway. The reason? Basically I went by the customer reviews on here. The [[ASIN:B00317BRWE BaByliss Pro BABHS40 Ceramic and Ionic 30-Roller Hair Set]] just had the best reviews. I then did comparison shopping and that setter was anywhere between $15-30 less expensive on here than anywhere else online! All the setters under the Conair label simply offered nothing that came even close to this Babyliss. So, with budget out the window, I shelled out the $63.90 with free 2nd day Prime shipping. I just reviewed the Babyliss  on here and gave it 5 stars and a glowing review. The setter is more expensive than its competition but sometimes you just get what you pay for. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Babyliss Professional Model BABHS40. There&#x27;s just no comparison.</li>
            <li> It works great. I just wish there were a few more larger rollers and a few less smaller rollers.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, but the clips do not hold the rollers in place. I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair texture you&#x27;d need to have so that these would work.</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers because I needed a quick and easy way to curl my hair. I love how the rollers and clips are both heated to add extra setting power for the hair. BUT these did not work well on my long thicker hair at all. The curls were not curly they had weird kinks in them and somehow had square shaping on some of them. The clips also did not secure the rollers onto my head as every time I moved the clips allowed a lot of movement and some would easily fall out. Because these did not work very well for me I wanted to return them and try something else, and guess what?! YOU have to pay for return shipping, which could be anywhere between $6-$10! This company does not cover shipping for return products and they have to approve of the return before you are even eligible to return it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review by saying that I have been using hot rollers for over 20 years -- pretty much every day.  I have hair that is about four inches longer than my shoulders and  holds a curl pretty well.   I bought these curlers two weeks ago and have been using them daily. The set comes with \\&quot;8 jumbo, 6 large, 6 medium rollers\\&quot; and plastic claw clips. The rollers are not actually jumbo.large/medium: they are large/medium/small. This actually works better for me, as I already own a set of all jumbo (1.5 inch) rollers.   These rollers do a good job of curling my hair, and I like the three sizes, but the unit has some serious design flaws:  1) The different sized rollers have to be placed exactly the way the set comes. They will not fit ramdonly placed. It is very difficult to figure out which way they fit, and I usually have two rollers left that won&#x27;t fit back into the unit.   2) the plastic claw clips are just useless. They can&#x27;t hold the weight of the two larger sized rollers -- they will only support the smallest size. I use clips from other roller sets.   3) The curlers get TOO hot. I leave them out for 15 seconds to cool before I put in my hair or I risk burning my hair and scalp.   4) There is no place to store the clips, and no pouch that comes with unit.  I purchased this unit on Amazon for $32 and now it is down to $22.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the rollers, but would not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I READ MOST OF THE REVIEWS ON HERE BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS ITEM,I DIDNT THINK IT WOULD WORK CONSIDERING IT WAS SO CHEAP AND THAT IT HAD ALOT BAD REVIEWS.I GOT IT YESTERDAY AND TRIED IT AND I LOVE IT.MY HAIR IS SHOULKDER LENGTH MAYBE A TAD LONGER.I DCONT SEE HOW IT COULD HAVE CURLED ANY BETTER.THE CLIPS THAT SECURE YOUR HAIRNARE A LITTLE LOOSE BUT STILL WORK IF AS LONG AS YOUR NOT JUMPING UP AND DOWN,THE CURLERS HEAT UP REALLY FAST AND I ACTUALLY ENJOYED PETTING THEM IN, MOSTLY COOL TO THE TOUCH EXCEPT A FEW PLACES HERE N THERE ONTHE ENDS WHERE THE SOFT METERIAL ISNT COVERING,IVE ONLY USED IT ONCE BUT IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIANCE, THE CURLS IT GIVES ARE WONDERFULL AND LASTEDEVEN OVERNIGHT,HAIRSPRAY HELPED IM SURE.. I RECOMEND THIS ALTHOUGH IT IS ONLY MY SECOND SET OF HAIR CURLERS</li>
            <li> This hair roller system is the best I have ever used. Mine cam with 20 plastic clips and it works wonderfully. I love it. I am so happy I got it. I was a little skeptical due to some of the reviews here, but I went ahead and got it. I am so glad I did. It heats quickly. The clips are the best part because I can&#x27;t use those wire clips. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the product came in excellent conditions. i don&#x27;t have another comment about it. thank you for everything, grettings. see you later</li>
            <li> This is just a hot mess. Left my hair frizzy and curls fell out. Also this is the one where the clips do not heat up.</li>
            <li> long hair is back in style...these do the trick!</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up super fast! But hated the roller clips had to go out and buy some. All in all a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> They work great if I put alot of gell in my hair first. I have hard to curl stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> Instant flawless curls! Pop in hair, do make up, then take out on the go. Best impulse buy I have ever purchased. I didn&#x27;t think anything would ever curl my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for Wal-Mart for $10 cheaper than Amazon was selling it for, but I still wanted to leave a review because it is a great product it just has one minor hiccup. The curlers are perfect for my fine hair, the curls stay even with only a light mist of hair spray. My only problem with the product is that the clips don&#x27;t fit around the curlers so it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair in place. I had to order some larger clips just to make sure the curlers stayed in place. After this problem was fixed, I don&#x27;t have any more complaints. I was very happy to find that it curled my hair perfectly the way I wanted, and they stayed for hours afterwards. I have long, thin hair so finding a product that actually works for my hair is a blessing even if it has a few problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this product over the weekend and the clips dont hold I have already emailed conairs corporate office and told them I am disappointed in this product and I will be posting a bad report everywhere this item is sold. The only good thing about this item is they do heat up fast.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this unit less than a year and it did curl hair.  However, my wife plugged it in and it immediately began to smoke.  Within seconds the curler ends and clips melted onto the heating elements!  Very dangerous! Needless to say, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think these hair rollers are great. I have long relaxed hair thats extremely difficult to curl without using lots of hairspray. I gave the rollers 15 minutes to heat up and after rolling I left them in for 20 mins while I did other stuff. My curls where so soft and full of body and I did not need to use any hairspray for the set. Only a little afterward for finishing. The plastic lid is fragile and should be handled with care as not to break it. Another trick for difficult to curl hair, like mine, is to wash it the night before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over all Im very pleased with this product&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> I have two sets of these hot rollers. I use the larger curlers since i have very long and very thick hair. Always had good experience with Conair products and recommend them.  FYI...also they work well with shine and root-lift stylers</li>
            <li> &amp;#65279;My wife just bought one of these sets and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to try it. She read the &lt;br /&gt;instructions, than plugged it in, and waited a few minuets. When she pulled one of the rollers out &lt;br /&gt;of it&#x27;s hole, the bottom end was hanging from melted plastic. She pulled out another one with the &lt;br /&gt;same result. She finally got one out that she could put in her hair and got one good curl out of &lt;br /&gt;the deal, but is very disappointed. We are going to return these things as soon as we can.</li>
            <li> This hair setter has a few short comings, but is still an overall great product. First the bad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual curlers can sometimes be too hot to touch both when they come out of the heater and even after you put it in your hair. Working with multiple curlers can be difficult. This is especially true if you have thick and/or long hair; the slits in the curlers can easily catch stray strands of hair and create frustrating messes of tangles. Good curls is a matter of getting a feel for what your hair needs. Related to this, good curls take a lot of time (though this depends on the length of your hair) and definitely a lot of patience. Smaller and hotter curlers left in for a longer time is usually best for my hair. It takes about an hour and a half to do all of my hair. The curls tend to become limp after a while. Also, because of the number of curlers actually in the setter the entire set is not too compact and not too convinient for travel. Also consider the type of hair. I have fairly thick hair that is a little kinky, runs down to my mid back, and reponds well to styling. Based on what other reviews have said, results depend on the kind of hair you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now the good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the hair setter is really easy; just plug it in and wait for it to heat up. The curls come out bouncy and shiny without the feeling of having fried them to death. Being able to work with multiple curls make it slight faster than a curling iron. Even though my hair becomes limp after a while, the curls are still visible at the ends even after a night of sleep. As a matter fact, I rather like the curly at the ends look; it isn&#x27;t as overwhelming as the full-on bounce of when the curls are first set in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite its short comings, this hair setter makes great looking curls with practice and patience.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with hot rollers and so far it hasn&#x27;t been too bad.  I do have to roll my hair a few times because the rollers sometimes fall out even with the clips.  My hair is very fine so this could me the reason.  If anyone has any input on this I would appreciate it.  Anyway, I do get a nice curl in the end.  So again for my first set, I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> In 5 minutes I have my hair ready. I love it!</li>
            <li> These are typical hot rollers.  There are too many small and not enough large rollers for my hair.  I thought the heated clips would help with that giving me some time to reheat roller as I took them out of my hair to use again.  Not so!  Clips are worthless!  Perhaps they work on thicker hair, but I have baby fine hair and they just wouldn&#x27;t stay on!  I wish someone would make a hot roller set with all 1-1/4 rollers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is amazing but these rollers are just so so!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and these rollers have no problem curling them! They heat up quickly and do a great job. Much easier than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Conair Hot Roller Set because you stated it had a on/off switch.  It does not have an on/off switch, it has a light that comes on when it is on.  I wanted a set that you could turn on or off with a switch..</li>
            <li> I bought this product and have used it for less than 6 months.  One of the heating rails has stopped working and the unit melted one of the rollers so it won&#x27;t go back on the roller.  The design of the rollers - with a gap all the way through - means you are grabbing close to metal and the heat can be high to the tough.</li>
            <li> My last set of rollers finally died after years and years of use and I decided to get a new set. I should have done a bit more homework before purchasing these but I saw that they had a fairly good rating and were a great price so I went ahead and ordered them without actually reading the reviews. These are terrible! I got the plastic clips as shown {no issue with receiving the wrong product as others have} but they are HORRIBLE! The clips are not nearly large enough for the rollers {which are themselves not large enough}. Not only are the clips not big enough to go around the curler and hold it in place but they are too heavy so not being able to \\&quot;anchor\\&quot; them at the scalp/root makes the whole curler/clip combo fall loose and kid of hang about 2 inches from where they should be. Also, the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are superficial at best and really there&#x27;s just a blunt edge to them which leaves a dent/crease in each curl.&lt;br /&gt;If it were a matter of clips alone however I would have just said to order a better set separately; unfortunately it&#x27;s not JUST the clips....the curlers are also crap.  They are too small and more importantly don&#x27;t get anywhere near hot enough. I have fine to average hair that hits just below my shoulders and usually holds a curl easy, with these rollers my hair had lost 100% of the curl after just 60 minutes and all I was left with was limp hair covered in \\&quot;dents\\&quot; from the dang clamps!&lt;br /&gt;Do yourselves a favor and spend the extra $10 on another set of better rollers.</li>
            <li> My daughter owns a set of these, and I like the way they work -- with the deluxe clips.  My hair is thin, getting more so all the time.  I think that perhaps the velcro rollers I&#x27;ve been using have contributed to my problem (since they tug on the hair as they&#x27;re being removed), so I am going to buy a set for myself.  After reading the reviews stating that the good clips don&#x27;t come with the sets offered here, I&#x27;ve decided to actually go to the store and purchase them.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Many thanks for the reviews, you have saved me some headaches.</li>
            <li> I got this product in a timely manner, the product worked great..BUT...i didnt receive the clips with the rollers. Instead, they sent me 20 pins.. NOT what I wanted or what I ordered. I had to call CONAIR and struggle with them just to send me 10 clips for free.. Dont order this product if you want the clps..</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and curls my hair, but the curlers are slippery and make it difficult for me to wrap my hair around them, giving my strange kinks at the end of the strands. I&#x27;m hoping that more practice will solve this problem.</li>
            <li> Who would design a hair setter with no place to hold the pins?  They come in a separate pouch, which means it would be too easy to pack the hair setter and forget the pins.  The top is flimsy, and although the cord can be wrapped around the bottom, there is no clip to hold it.  How much would it have cost to add on a tiny plastic clip or two?  The metal pins are difficult to place, although they do hold well.  The curls made with the setter are pretty good, but it seems to me that this little appliance was designed by someone who had never used one and had never consulted anyone who did.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with this product.  I read some of the other reviews, so I was concerned the pins wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair.  I have absolutely no problem with these.  I also like being able to set the heat factor.  I have really thick fine hair that takes forever to blow dry and style, so to be able to just throw it up in curlers while I do my makeup is great.  Since my hair is very heavy, I do use a styling product to get the curl to stay in.  It also doesn&#x27;t damage the hair the way the old products did.</li>
            <li> first of all, do NOT buy this from amazon.  they will overcharge you and i purchased mine for like 20 bucks at drugstore.com.  that being said, these curlers are awesome.  i&#x27;ve been very impressed with my hair (which is pretty dry and unhealthy so it curls easily).  My hair holds the curls and looks shiny - also, it only takes about 15 min to set.      My hair looks flippy and cute right now because i curled it the night before!  yay.    my only complaint is that the pins to hold the curlers SUCK.  ugh.  what a pain in the butt.  i have to hold my head annoyingly still so the curlers dont slip out.  those stupid pins dont work well at all.  i usually put the curlers in and then put on a cap so i can go around without them falling out.      i bought other conair clips that are supposed to keep the curlers in place but they sucked as well.  i will be giving them a neg review for sure.  still, the curlers themselves are great!</li>
            <li> This hot roller set is definitely worth the $25 I paid.  It sets your hair beautifully every time.  3 different size rollers and an adjustable temperature setting so you can really customize your style.  I do wish there were some jumbo size rollers in this set, and I don&#x27;t really like the clips that come with it.  I do like that you can lift one side of the unit to take out a roller while not losing any heat from the other side.</li>
            <li> The rollers only warmed up to &amp;#34;luke warm&amp;#34; - even let them heat up for 30 minutes and there was no difference. The &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; clips really aren&#x27;t warm after sitting on the warming rack, the spring on the clip wasn&#x27;t that strong so it failed to &amp;#34;grasp&amp;#34; the roller tightly which resulted in the clips continually falling off the roller. Good &amp;#34;concept&amp;#34;, bad execution of design. :(</li>
            <li> They heat up nice and fast but the clips are kind of flimsy and don&#x27;t hold the rollers in place very well. I have never used hot rollers before so maybe I just need some practice.</li>
            <li> I have used electric curlers for 25 years and this is the worst product I have ever purchased. Extreme heat in 75 seconds? Lie! How about mediocre heat in 10 minutes! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Also the clips are terrible and DO NOT secure the curler. Just bad all around.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is determined to be straight.  I had a set of curlers that were starting to go out on me (they took 45 minutes to heat up and did not hold the curl).  I recently decided to replace it with the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Hot Rollers, since I was interested in curlers that would heat up quickly.  They heat up just as quickly as they say.  They are incredibly hot and do a great job of putting in a curl that holds.  Like I said, I have the kind of hair that wants desperately to be straight, and my curl stays all day with these curlers.  They are fairly hot on the edges, but I have yet to find any curlers that won&#x27;t be challenging to handle for more than a minute.  I would definitely recommend these to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> The stupid clips they supply leave large dents in your hair.  I also didn&#x27;t feel like they got hot enough to do anything.  I have very little curls and a huge dent.  Don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
            <li> This curler set is awesome becuase it heats up so fast, the curls are great and last all day....but, because of the clamps (that I was really excited about) it leaves a crease in your hair at the top of your curl.  So now I have to get out my curling iron or straightener to get that crease out.  If I roll the curls high enough on top of my head I don&#x27;t get the crease, but I will be looking for a different set of curlers because of the crease problem.  I guess the old metal hooks are better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used curlers in a while but I like these, have a hard time getting the clips and curlers to stay put once it my hair but I could be putting in too much hair.  The curlers have been better on my hair than the hot iron I was using everyday.  Again, can&#x27;t beat the price.  I returned a set of curlers that where cost over $80.00 because I didn&#x27;t like them, these are great for the price.</li>
            <li> These rollers melted - so bizarre - clearly defective. So disappointed because my prior conair rollers lasted for 10 years!</li>
            <li> I have had these for over a year and just love them. They are super easy to use and hold the curl all day!!! The only thing I would inprove is more space to heat up clips at one time but other than that I am a fan forever!!</li>
            <li> I received my order today. There is no on/off switch. The rollers themselves seem to work well however the clips are worthless. They do not hold the curlers in place very well at all. I am sending this back and getting something else.</li>
            <li> This item is simply AMAZING!! I don&#x27;t have to spend hours to roll my hair&lt;br /&gt;Thank you soooooooooooo much. I spend few minutes to use them and I leave them for at most 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The best thing about these hot rollers is that they do put super curls in your hair!  It had the look of a curling iron with a quarter of the time.  Without product they kept curl in my hair into the next day, though they did fall over time; it took washing my hair to get rid of all the wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the clips DO NOT work on the jumbo size rollers (especially on top of the head).  They take a long time to put in and I&#x27;m afraid to move my head around while they set.  These grey clips work better for the other size rollers just not the largest.  I&#x27;m going to get a different set of clips for the biggest ones since I really like the set overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. After using it, I realize that I would be better off with more rollers that were the same size. My hair (fine) took a lot of rollers and I had to use different sizes, which ended up looking pretty weird. Maybe with more practice, I can do better. However, I find myself wishing I had purchased the one with all large rollers. It would be consistent, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are just looking to throw a few rollers in the bottom for wave or on the top for volume, this set might work for you.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like I do then don&#x27;t buy this. The clips did not hold my hair at all and they almost fell out. I tired them on my daughter who has thin hair and they stayed in better on her but the clips still don&#x27;t work the best. I&#x27;m disappointed and will be returning this.</li>
            <li> I tried 2 different hot roller sets (Conair, Revlon) before arriving at this one. I&#x27;m happy to report that this one is a keeper, though I have also come to the conclusion that so far there is no such thing as a perfect hot roller set for under $50, but this one is pretty close. The pros: The rollers heat up really fast. Like lightening fast, which is great if you are in a rush though you can also leave them to heat for longer. They get nice and hot but not so hot that you&#x27;ll end up with third degree burns if you happen to touch one. The end result is beautiful bouncy curls that last all day (I have really thick straight hair so for me that&#x27;s a big deal) The cool touch tips are nice and do help to cut down on the amount of times that you&#x27;ll accidentally touch the roller. Also there is a nice variety of roller sizes with an good number of each particular size. Finally, they&#x27;re pink. Hooray. The cons: The clips that come with this set are almost useless. While they will hold the smaller rollers on they tend to slip and can barely manage the big rollers. In addition they will leave a indentation on your hair. (I would recommend buying a couple sets of Conair Super Clips which are fabulous and hold any size roller securely to your head) Also the clip heating feature on this set is a good idea in theory but in practice it&#x27;s the worst and seems like a bit of a gimmick. The plastic clips get REALLY hot and if you manage not to burn your fingers when you pick them up you&#x27;ll definitely feel the heat if they happen to touch your neck or ear. Finally, and this is just personal preference, but it would be nice if the cord could be wrapped underneath for storage. In short I really like the rollers on this set, however the clips suck. Though considering the other 2 sets I&#x27;ve tried this one definitely comes out on top.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the service or quality. I&#x27;ve had it about 2 weeks, and used it twice. I love these.</li>
            <li> I should have just bought a curly iron instead of these things, they are complicated and if you don&#x27;t know how to do it, you look like a witch.</li>
            <li> This is the first I&#x27;ve tried hot rollers. I have super stubborn, super straight hair that will not hold a curl. Period! I struggled getting the rollers in place the first few times but the curls turned out beautiful and lasted majority of the day.</li>
            <li> When I received this item it was clear that it had been repackaged. The actual product box looked worn and used and had lots of tape. Additionally, there weren&#x27;t any product instructions included with this item. I paid nearly $39 for this product and found same exact product at local retailer for nearly $10 less brand new. Very disappointed that I was overcharged for a used product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this last week and received it shortly after.  I was disappointed because it had no on/off button as described.  In order to turn it on you have to plug it in.  I contacted amazon and they sent me a return label which I will do.  I&#x27;m thinking that this particular product is no longer available.</li>
            <li> Good and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> I found these difficult to use unless your into burning your hands.  After one use they now reside on my closet shelf until I make my next trip to the GoodWill.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set at Target yesterday and was excited to give it a try today as my old set from the 70&#x27;s finally stopped working. First of all, this is not ionic and it does not control frizz. In fact my hair was MUCH more frizzy after using this than before and I had to spray the dickens out of it with hairspray to calm down the frizzies. My hair is normally NOT frizzy but this produced frizz so the claim that it controls frizz is false at best.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly there are only 3 warmers for the plactic clips so you can&#x27;t warm all the clips at once. I thought I&#x27;d be smart and get around this by putting the clip on the space left by a roller when I removed it, but that was a huge mistake. The clip melted and now won&#x27;t open.&lt;br /&gt;The clips do not hold the hair securely. I like to get a nice tight roll with the roller right up next to my scalp and then secure the roller when I set my hair. I&#x27;ve learned this from my beautician mother and from the many beauticians I&#x27;ve known through my dad&#x27;s business. In short, I know how to curl hair properly. Once the curler is in, it is impossible for the cheap, plastic clips to hold it securely so it partially unrolls and flops around. Then when you remove the clip and the roller you are left with an inch of hair that is not set and then a nasty looking kink just before the curl starts. Combine that with the frizziness that this set produces and you end up with a pretty strange looking hairdo.&lt;br /&gt;I called the company to see if there was something I was doing wrong or if there was anything else I could do to produce better results instead of returning the product. They told me that this was how the clips worked and there was nothing else to do. I asked about obtaining a set of metal clips that are similar to the old fashioned hot roller clips and she offered to sell them to me. I asked if the company would be willing to send me a set for free since the ones that come with the rollers are inferior and she said, \\&quot;no, they are for sale\\&quot;. So not only is this an inferior product but Conair will not stand behind it. I was wiloing to give this another try with better clips if they would have sent them to me but since they won&#x27;t even do that, I&#x27;ll be returning it. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I like the design of the smooth rollers, unlike the old school hot rollers.  This is a nice option for different styling for my very thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but I&#x27;ve always had a problem with frizz and my curls having a uniformed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these do give a nice curl towards the bottom, the top looks all wrong. The clips do NOT hold very tight. Many rollers fall out during use and don&#x27;t keep the roller at your scalp. The clips also cause dents near the top of your curls. I had to resort to curling the top layer of my hair with a large barrel iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can salvage the outer layers of your hair, the curls created by these hot rollers will last all day and look very nice. However, if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on your hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> Better than expected... ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this set to replace another Conair set of hot rollers that must have been at least 30 years old and passed down to me by my mother.  I loved that set!  This set does a wonderful job on my hair which goes down to the middle of my back with long layers and is naturally wavy.  I use the largest size rollers for a natural looking curl.  I had been using the medium size rollers but they made the curls a little too tight.  My only complaint is that the smart clips leave some crimping at the top roots of my hair, not the lower curls.  Sometimes I have to wet them and blow them out.  I wish they still made them with the metal pins instead.  That is why this product received 4 instead of 5 stars.  I know another reviewer said this product is not as advertised and came with plastic pins.  I wonder if she had ordered a different product by mistake because mine came as advertised.  Because of the design of the case, I don&#x27;t see how wire pins could come with it.  Three of the smart clips are located in the case and heat up with the curlers.  As you use them you can replace them with more clips so they can heat up as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of hot rollers! They heat up quickly and curl well.  I like the three sizes of rollers and also the butterfly clips work very well.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my thin hair, but learning to work with them.</li>
            <li> Nope. Nope. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot Rollers are like bras and mascara. Not just in the sense that you are trying to take something and maximize it to it&#x27;s fullest potential, but also that they are highly personal. Not everyone likes the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like velvet rollers that get HOT but protect my fingers and ears and I like a wire prong style clip that doesn&#x27;t flop all over my head.&lt;br /&gt;These plastic butterfly style clips don&#x27;t hold the curler in place so all I get is some wimpy end curl and not the volume at the root that drive me to set my hair in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay. These burn. Which sucks. But I&#x27;m going to see what I can do about replacing the plastic clips for metal. (The metal clips I already own are too small and shoot across the bathroom when I try to use them with this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot rollers used to be everywhere but they seem to be becoming scarce. And the rollers are HUGE. These rollers are merely large, not JUMBO, but they don&#x27;t give curl so much as wave. Le sigh.</li>
            <li> They are a little more complicated to use than need be</li>
            <li> Just ok. Found them on sale at Kmart for half the price I paid. Have to watch prices here</li>
            <li> I really looked around and studied up before buying this.  It works well for me.  Senior, thinning, white hair.  With ease of use, this gives body and waves and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  Nice selection of sizes and helpful guidebook.</li>
            <li> I really like my xtreme hot rollers. I&#x27;ve had them about 6 months and use them regularly. I can use different combinations of roller sizes to come out with a bunch of different looks which is really nice. I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m generally terrible with styling tools, but these are really easy and I enjoy using them. They&#x27;re even easy enough to use in a rush, so long as I plug them in ahead of time. Now for the gripes. It claims to heat in an \\&quot;xtreme\\&quot; 3 minutes, and according to the instructions the light will change to notify the user when they&#x27;re ready for use. My light never changed, so for the first few weeks I was rather perplexed as to when to start using the rollers. Lastly, I have short hair and could really seriously use some more of the small and medium rollers, but they aren&#x27;t available in stores or online. The only place to get them is through mail order. I guess I&#x27;ll have to do it, but I feel like I&#x27;m in the dark ages. I can&#x27;t be the only one who needs more rollers, they should be easier to get!</li>
            <li> The clips are so cheap!! They aren&#x27;t nearly strong enough to hold your hair in place. I wish I could speak to how well the rollers work, but I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in long enough to find out. If you are lucky enough to get the clips to work, be prepared to sit very still until the rollers are cool!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I like the rollers and the fact that it heats up very quickly; however, the clips to keep the rollers in are terrible.  They barely fit around the rollers, and I find I have to restrict my activities (normal house chores) when wearing them for fear they&#x27;ll fall out.  So if there were better clips I would give a full rating, but I&#x27;m really disappointed with the design.</li>
            <li> rollers heat up but wire clips do not hold ....rollers stay loose and fall  off.  Very bad design. conair needs to design a clip that works on large rollers.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever return items because it&#x27;s such a hassle. But this, is being returned immediately. The idea is actually very good- it has a side heater to heat up the clips as well as the rollers, a feature I&#x27;ve never seen before. However, the clips do not hold- at least not in my long hair. No matter how many times I tried, the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds. Even when I stayed completely still (very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers) they would still fall out. They never stayed in long enough for me to see how well the curlers worked.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they curl great, other times not so much. Agree with other posts that the clamps leave a dent, bought some wire ones and I&#x27;m much happier</li>
            <li> After pondering what the others said about this setter, I&#x27;m rather confused with what I must be doing wrong. I rather like most about the setter, but my problem is that I can&#x27;t seem to get the roller clamps to hold the rollers in place. The rollers flop forward so give me a curl going the wrong direction, and sometimes the roller just falls out of my hair. It&#x27;s fast and it curls very nicely and quickly. I&#x27;d love to know the answer to my dilemna.</li>
            <li> I always curled my hair for everyday plus my dance competitions. I needed curls for my solo, but i need to be able to curl my hair fast. When i found these they were perfect! I was able to curl my hair fast, but still have nice curls.</li>
            <li> First I purchased a very similar item but that did not have the on and off switch up front. I am glad that I returned that and ordered this instead. Also, the rollers are great but I dont use the clips hot rather cold eliminating the clipmarks...</li>
            <li> The clips are worthless they can&#x27;t hold hold the rollers whatsoever. I also received a different model of this item, I specifically ordered the one pictured with the on/off switch and received one that doesn&#x27;t have the switch. Really annoying to not receive what you ordered. I have a much older version of hot rollers that I have to replace after about 10 years and thought this would be the same thing as what I had. It doesn&#x27;t even compare the rollers aren&#x27;t the same size they are way too small to give any sort of curl. I hate this item and I would never recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because it does not have an on off switch. So if your outlet is hard to get to..don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> The color is much softer than pictured. Like a light pink/purple pearl. Prettier in my opinion. The clips hold well enough. Gets hot enough. Easy to use. I ordered the one with an on/off switch pictured, and the one without any was shipped. Curl holds well.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item the one thing that I liked was the fact that Conair said these rollers would not crinkle your hair. Well I tried them and first of all, the rollers got so hot they burnt my head. Could not leave them in at all because of the heat. Then the clips they give you do leave a crimp in your hair so it looked awful. Returned them right away, and I would not recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> My son got this as a present for her sister, she ask for it, but I can not  said she is using it.  sits in the  bathroom  counter  and gets dusty</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair. I used a setting spray for hot rollers and tried spraying my hair to keep the curl in but to no avail. I tried it three different times with the same results. Maybe it&#x27;s better if you have some type of body in your hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this for Christmas from me.  She loves it!  Her hair is especially shiney now!</li>
            <li> Is plastic getting expensive?  Because the plastic that the hinged cover on this is made out of is SO THIN...I would describe it as \\&quot;fragile.\\&quot;  In fact, there&#x27;s already a small crack on one side.    The on/off switch was also faulty - I had to jiggle it back and forth to get it to turn on initially.  It would only stay on if I kept the switch positioned in the middle.    This is by FAR the poorest quality set of hot rollers I have ever bought.      I only gave it two stars because it DID heat up evenly, and the rollers themselves would be nice in a better \\&quot;house.\\&quot;    Thank goodness the switch was faulty and part of it arrived cracked, since you can return defective items and not pay for the return shipping on Amazon!</li>
            <li> These were well made, great clips, and good reviews. But the bottom line is they just don&#x27;t curl my hair. I have noticed the same if I blow dry my hair with one of those ion round brushes too, so I think it is the ion thing that makes them not work. All the other hot rollers I used in the past would lock in curl that would last for days...so if yoy have naturally wavy/curly hair be cautious!</li>
            <li> I have very long bleach blonde hair. I have never been able to use hot rollers in the past. I got these at a local drug store, and I love them. I can roll my hair without even looking in a mirror. It stays all day without any hairspray, and I get so many compliments on my hair. The only bad thing,  like any hot roller, you get damaged hair, even if it is Ionic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
            <li> These work great.  The adjustment on the heat setting allows for a wide range of heat, with the highest setting getting very hot.  They heat up fast, within about 5 minutes.  I personally like the flocked rollers, and these curl even the ends of long hair without kinking.  A good set of hot rollers, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I like these rollers.  I was wary because of the lid comments, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be pleased. I found the lid to be just fine. Just know that you probably will never travel with them; it&#x27;s a big set of rollers!  I like the fact that the lid stays affixed to the rollers. (One less thing to clutter my space.)      My complaint is, why don&#x27;t these companies build in a slot for the clips?  I have trashed perfectly adequate electric rollers in the past when I couldn&#x27;t find their clips. This set comes with a small fabric envelope, made to hold the clips.    I guess the temperature gauge would be useful to some, but I just leave it on the &#x27;high&#x27; setting.</li>
            <li> I really like this product of Conair , its 3 different sets of sizes is suitable for different lengths of hair. Gets pretty hot &amp; helps your curls get fast &amp; firm.  One back log about it is , you might want to leave it for a considerable amount of time to make it hot enough , it says 10 mins of the box , but leave it for at least 20 mins</li>
            <li> Admittedly, This was the first hot rollers I have ever used. That being said, I know I have some practice to do to get the curls I want. However, I dont need to have used hot rollers before to tell you that the plastic ends on the rollers feel super cheap. When you unroll your hair from the roller your hair will get all caught in the middle cutout. Also, the clips DO leave marks on your hair. Further, the clips feel kinda flimsy and do not hold the roller in place very well. I have a lot of really long hair, and I did not have enough rollers to do all my hair at the same time. The rollers did heat up quickly and it was nice being able to heat up the clips. Overall, I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> They heat up good I have to wind my hair around roller so they will stay in maybe thats the way you do it,the clips get hot too, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Rollers are not what was advertised. There is no on/off switch. Thanks all for telling me that fact. They do not heat in 60 seconds, more like minutes. The clips do not hold the rollers in place. Maybe longer hair would allow them to work better. Mine is shortish and I have to use the wire clips from old set. Glad I have them. Day after I ordered, the set goes  down in price $5. This has happened before, but this time  I am not so thrilled with my purchase that I want to pay more. 3 stars because they do heat and curl.</li>
            <li> Horrible! The clips are awful, leave a crimp mark in the hair, won&#x27;t hold the curler in place, flops all over the place and does not hold a curl at all.  Just terrible!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law who has long thin hair - this has transformed her hair into a full head of beautiful dazzling curls and she LOVES them. She had never used hot rollers ever and now is HOOKED on them! I am So glad she&#x27;s enjoying them - I&#x27;ve had hot rollers myself for 25 years and they are a MUST when it comes to style and manageability.</li>
            <li> I love them! I&#x27;m very happy with the curlers!!</li>
            <li> clips to hold rollers are very cheap, but they work.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and these rollers don&#x27;t work AT ALL.  My hair will stay curled (marginally curled, at that) for a max of 30 minutes, even using styling product.  Also, the clips leave dents; I much prefer the wire holders.  With my fine hair, the clips never stay in place and I&#x27;m constantly &amp;#34;reclipping&amp;#34; the roller into place.  Also, they don&#x27;t seem to get very hot, which may be part of the reason they don&#x27;t curl effectively.</li>
            <li> Not very good for someone with thick curly hair.  Need higher heat</li>
            <li> I really love this. Its fast and easy and dont burn my hair. I would buy this afain as a gift for someone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering how long these are going to last. After heating the first time, one of the rollers won&#x27;t even fit back onto the heating element. It&#x27;s a different construction, where there&#x27;s just a long metal row the rollers slide on to. They are OK, but just OK.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these hot rollers! I cut my hair into a short bob a few months ago and it&#x27;s now medium length. The rollers curled my hair beautifully and created volume. The rollers get nice and hot very quickly and you don&#x27;t have to keep them in long to get the desired look. The set comes with enough clips as well (more than 3).</li>
            <li> mine came with the plastic clips that fit any size of roller.  I really like it except that it is awkward to pick up!</li>
            <li> The hot rollers do the job, except I use the clips from my old Remington set. The clips that came with the set are not useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this set because I travel a lot and the curlers stay in place during movement.  The actual rollers are not holding up to wear.  The heat is too much for the plastic on the bottom of the rollers.  The plastic becomes brittle and the bases break off.  Each side has three skinny prongs underneath and they just snap off.  I emailed the company and got no response about replacement rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this set for about 9 months.  I do not expect it to last two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old set, the Clairol Deluxe hairsetter, lasted 20 years!!!  My recommendation: Go to Ebay and get a set of those!</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this set. I was hesitant to purchase hot rollers initially because I have awkward, layered, SUPER thick, shoulder length hair. I&#x27;d watched some demonstrations with this particular kit on youtube and was intrigued, but it was double the price at my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cut to the chase - the price is right, the curls come out VERY nice, the rollers and clips don&#x27;t burn your fingers, and it&#x27;s a fast, easy process for cute curls that last all day. They may leave a kink or two occasionally, but it&#x27;s the only &#x27;meh&#x27; factor I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to review and purchase another set for a birthday present, that&#x27;s how happy it has made me.</li>
            <li> I bought these and the jumbo rollers for my wife a year ago. She uses the jumbo ones almost everyday because these ones are a bit small and she wants more of a wavy look.  I love how her hair looks! They seem to be just as good as the jumbo ones which we gave 5 stars to.  If you are lookign for small rollers, I would imagine these would be tough to beat for the price.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I discovered the hot rollers were not as pictured or described.  I specifically bought them because they were advertised as having an on/off switch and I would not have to plug them in with each use.  However, there is no on/off switch on this product.</li>
            <li> Love using these! I am a total failure when it comes to doing anything hair related and I can easily get the curls I want using these! My only tip is to use a little hair spray on the hair before wrapping the hair in the curlers!</li>
            <li> I have stick straight, processed, long hair that is so thick I&#x27;ve always needed two sets of rollers. When my house burned I had to buy more. This set does heat very well and I enjoyed the easy clips but they kind of left a dent on my hair and didn&#x27;t want to stay in place. My cousin has shoulder length, fine hair and looks amazing after using than the whole set in about 1/2 hour.&lt;br /&gt;I like to get volume on the top and this didn&#x27;t cut the mustard for me so I returned one set and kept the other I went with Revlons multi sized roller set. They use the old-school clips that don&#x27;t move. If I was to put two and two together I bet the the Revlons pins would help tremendously. The other thing I like to do is spray some hairspray while the rollers are in and with these clips is covers most all of the hair. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly, and rolled smoothly into my hair. I have a feeling these curlers work best with average hair that doesn&#x27;t go to far in either the super thick or super thin direction. I leave them in until they cool and then resist combing for my hair for until the last minute. I use hairspray with the curlers and that helps the curl stay a little longer</li>
            <li> She said it was the best hot roller she has ever had, including ones costing much more. Definitely buy this if you have the need.</li>
            <li> The clips do not hold the rollers at all!  I put the rollers in my hair and attach the clip and within seconds, the clip is falling off and the roller is rolling right out of my hair.  It does give good curl, when the clips finally hold....but so frustrating.  I wish I could return them, but too late now.</li>
            <li> There are parts missing and the unit does not work! IT won&#x27;t heat up at all. Seriously, I want my money back ASAP! T</li>
            <li> The rollers literally fell out my first time using them. The clips are horrible and have no grip whatsoever. My hair is slightly past my shoulders and normal thickness. The \\&quot;stay cool\\&quot; edges of the rollers burned my fingers. I haven&#x27;t tried any other kind of clip other than what is sold with the set. I can&#x27;t tell you how well they curl because I couldn&#x27;t get the rollers to stay in my hair. I am not happy with these rollers.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are great.  Heat up very quickly, and the one size fits all clips work perfectly. Hair is ready to go in five minutes, start to finish.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of rollers, and thank goodness I didn&#x27;t spend money on these as they were a gift. They get so hot it&#x27;s hard to put them in your hair and the clips are terrible - this slip right out of my hair. I have to use my other Conair clips to hold the curlers in place. And the heated areas that are supposed to warm the clips? Useless as it only warms three at a time.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers, Got them as a gift as I read they are good for fine hair. I am asian and have really thinning fine hair and did not want anything that would damage my hair even more or make it fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were the answer. Not only do they hold my curls ALL DAY, but I get compliments all the time from people who say their hair doesnt hold any curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is coarse, medium length and thin/fine. I don&#x27;t use any of the big rollers, just the small and medium sized ones. towards the end of the day the curls fall a little but it still looks like I just did it</li>
            <li> gift for daughter in law, delivery was before Christmas. very nice set of curlers</li>
            <li> My favorite hot rollers!!!</li>
            <li> So much faster for me than using a curling iron! I curl my hair everyday, and I love these!! They&#x27;re worth it!</li>
            <li> It was finally time for me to update my old Conair set. My last set I purchased (well my mom did) 13 years ago. This set is smaller. Also, have very fine hair and the plastic clips leave dents in my hair. The old set had metal pins. There is no where to store the clips either. I wish I would have never gotten rid of my old set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fine hair, I don&#x27;t recommend this product. For other hair types, or maybe someone more experienced with hair than myself, it works well, heats quickly, sets quickly and is a good brand.</li>
            <li> As someone who is normally a big goofball when it comes to styling my hair, I was hesitant to get these after reading reviews. I&#x27;ve never even used hot rollers before and wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be the right purchase for a beginner. Well I am happy I got these. They are insanely easy to use and heat up super fast. Actually they get a little too hot for me and I use a heat protecting glove when I use them so it&#x27;s no biggy. Anyway, I&#x27;m just going to list pros and cons..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;*none of the curlers are too big. it seems like way too many sets out there have massive curlers and that&#x27;s a big turn off to me.&lt;br /&gt;*20 is more than enough to do my entire head. (but i have super thin, fine hair)&lt;br /&gt;*i am impatient and wanted something in the moment. these are sold at a lot of stores so picking up a pack is easy&lt;br /&gt;*these are super easy to use. maybe it&#x27;s because my hair is so thin but i find that i dont really have a problem with the clips that everyone complains about. i do feel like they could have more grip but it&#x27;s not a huge deal for me&lt;br /&gt;*these give me really soft, romantic curls. i feel like a disney princess when i style my hair with this. sooo pretty. honestly if i had had this set when i got married, i would have used it to style my own hair for the wedding.&lt;br /&gt;*it&#x27;s all very fast. i love that i dont have to sleep on a wet head full of curlers or a sock bun to get the look that i want. this is the fastest way of styling my hair that i&#x27;ve found yet.&lt;br /&gt;*hair looks a lot more shiny after using these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;*ends are too hot on bare hands, im not sure how often i&#x27;d be using these without that glove.&lt;br /&gt;*the price is a bit nuts. it sells for even more on the official conair site than it does here or in store. i feel like for what it is, it costs too much. this set should be $19.99, MAYBE 25 bucks at the most.&lt;br /&gt;*the reason i feel it costs too much is that it&#x27;s a very inconvenient little set. there is no place to store the 17 clips besides the 3 that stay on the burners. this unit is pretty massive and i feel like they should have included a drawer somewhere to hold the clips.&lt;br /&gt;*lid doesn&#x27;t clasp shut, it just kind of rests on the unit. not a big deal but that bugs me. i like lids that close.&lt;br /&gt;*there&#x27;s no way of storing the cord, not even a little cut out on the end of the plug like you get with vaccuum cleaner cords. you just have to wrap it awkwardly around the unit which looks dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think that&#x27;s pretty much all i can say about it. i am happy with it will use it a lot but it needs a lot of changes to be perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly bald, at least far more than I would like so clearly I didn&#x27;t them for my use. My wife on the other hand is very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It heats well and the quality is really great!  The product arrived as the seller stated and was more than what I expeted! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Rollers were to small for my hair.  But my grand daughter can use them.</li>
            <li> This hot roller set has a variety of sized rollers and has easy clips.  The heat of the rollers is not as hot as my old Clairol Travel set but it does the job.  I advise buyers to leave the rollers in until they cool for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all roller sets, if you have very very straight hair, I advise you to use styling products to maintain the curl and body of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four Stars due to less heat (although sufficient)</li>
            <li> Work amazingly!! Absolutely love!!</li>
            <li> I do not like these and will return them.  They do heat up fast, but there is no storage place for all the extra clips.  You have to find a baggie or bowl to put those in.  The clips do not hold the rollers in place.  The rollers flop around my head no matter how I place the clips.  Not the roller set for me, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and was g exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for Xmas 2013 so she could stop using mine.</li>
            <li> Clips are easy to use,  but not very stable.  Hatred clips are a joke.  Newer model has retractable cord.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair Hot Rollers for 30+ years and didn&#x27;t give a second thought to purchasing this product, as I&#x27;ve always been very satisfied with my Conair products.  However, I am extremely disappointed with the wire hinge clips.  I have VERY fine hair and the clips don&#x27;t hold at all!  The rollers are multi-sized so with my current hair style, the different sizes work great.  They heat up quickly.  The case is a newer, sleek version of cases past and nice looking and a size that is easy to travel with as well.  I know it&#x27;s a safety feature, but I don&#x27;t like having to use the plug as my on/off switch.  I have to plug it in to heat and unplug when I am finished.</li>
            <li> IT GETS SO HOT AFTER ONLY A SHORT TIME BEING ON THAT IT BURNS MY SCALP. I NEVER USE IT.</li>
            <li> excellent product, very good, highly recommend, good quality and good price, thanks for the confidence, very good, thank you, thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best hot roller set and I even take it with me traveling. I don&#x27;t use the clips but have the Conair large clips - they are better.</li>
            <li> Like very much, it does exactly like it says on the website. it pretty enough to leave out, it  heats up&lt;br /&gt;very fast love that. I never worked with the clips before that will take a little practice, also I think&lt;br /&gt;the Velcro  on the rollers makes your hair shiner. I recommend this product highly. Gabi</li>
            <li> This is really a good hot roller device. Easy to use, plenty of rollers, compact in size but perfect for a head of hair.  I really like it and praise the thought that went into the design.</li>
            <li> I have been using hot rollers for many years. I use them every day.  I was very disapponted.  I like a solid roller, but I was willing to give these a try.  It was hard to roll them right and then the clips didn&#x27;t hold them.</li>
            <li> WOW! I love these! Ok first of all, I have never used any hot rollers before and I was scared! I thought that 20 rollers would NEVER do all my hair and I was wrong. I have long hair (mid back) and it&#x27;s thick. All 20 did my entire head! These heat up quick and once I was done putting them all in I started to take them out. The timing was just right. My only complaint was that my fingers did get a little burnt from the rollers but a few people told me they just wear gloves while putting them in, I think I will try that next time. All in all a GREAT product especially for beginners like me!</li>
            <li> Love the rollers, I do not like the clips that came with the set, however I have my own clips and used them they work perfect.</li>
            <li> Made my wife very happy, she says they work perfectly, she likes that they hear rapidly</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this before I bought it. There were a few negative, but this is what I was looking for so I bought it. I am very pleased with this set of curlers and would recommend. I think the majority of the negative comments were folks who were looking for something very specific and found that this set was not it. I did receive the clips with this set.</li>
            <li> I chose to order this despite other reviews saying the clips for the curlers don&#x27;t work.  I did it because I had pins from an older set of rollers that I assumed would work.  The rollers themselves work fine.... but the clips they include are HORRIBLE.  Would not stay in my hair 50% of the time, and left a line when they did.  I cannot imagine why conair continues to include these clips.  I cannot use the ones included and do have to use older pins.  I would NOT order this product until they fix the clip situation</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.  It heats up quickly and there are different size rollers which is perfect for my hair style, the only drawback is sometimes the rollers are a little hot to handle.  Otherwise it is great and my hair looks great after using the rollers.</li>
            <li> Like the concept, rollers work great, clamps are a miss for me. The clamps are too flimsy to hold the curlers in place. The counter weight placed against the scalp while using the old style pins keep your curlers in place MUCH BETTER!!!  Also it would have been nice if they would have put a little lip on the top lid. This would make it much easier to go in and out to repeatedly put clamps on the warmer rungs. Just a design suggestion from a user :-) All in all it&#x27;s a nice curler set for the price... I use mine every day!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what the designers were thinking.  The large and medium rollers are okay.  The tiny ones are so small they would only work for very short hair.  I don&#x27;t know anyone who has the different lengths of hair for which this mish-mash of sizes would be appropriate.  That said, the curlers heat up quickly and release the hair without tangling.  The biggest problem is the clips - they are totally worthless - do not hold long hair to the curler and actually fly across the room when asked to do so, and they create lines where they actually DO hold.  I&#x27;m sorry I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> They heat up very quickly and they hold all night!!!</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are great but the clips will not hold my hair so I use my old clips that look like claws instead that came with my hot shot rollers.</li>
            <li> I received the item, but it was not in the box that has all the descriptions or user guide.  I first was not impressed when I took out the clips.  They were of poor quality and flimsy.  When I pulled the unit out of the box the lid was broke.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying Hot Rollers off line.  Go to the store!!</li>
            <li> I thought this heat setter was one of Conair&#x27;s best that came out on the market... much better than the old plastic \\&quot;prickly teeth\\&quot; rollers. I love \\&quot;big hair\\&quot; so this makes it nice &amp; fluffy after i take the rollers out. But, like some of the other reviews, the fluff doesn&#x27;t really last once you hit the air, especially living in San Francisco with the fog-moisture; my hair will eventually \\&quot;droop\\&quot;, sometimes before i get to work! I thought the clips were especially good in the beginning but then it became too heavy for the larger rollers and it would slide off. So i have some other plastic clips that have a straight edge rather than rounded like these &amp; they seem to hold on better to the big rollers. I&#x27;ll be taking a perm by end of the year, so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see if the fluff will stay on longer after the perm. I love all the various sizes, i didn&#x27;t realize i had ordered it with the 3 sizes and it&#x27;s nice because i use the smaller ones on the sides. And the top doesn&#x27;t flip back like some of the other readers said, mine stays upright (for now) anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me helmet head, my co-workers do!</li>
            <li> heats up fast. works great. need a lot of hairspray for it to las though. love it! its great, had it for a week and ive alredy used it 4 times! any hair length!</li>
            <li> I bought these over a year ago and still love them.  This is something I use almost everyday.  Well made and easy to use rollers.  Heats up super fast.  Awesome set.</li>
            <li> These heat up fast.  The holders are easy to put in and effective to hold up the roller.  My hair is quite long and also thick, but the curl stays all day.  I found a good way to save time was by putting in my rollers and taking them out when I get to my destination.  (15-20 mInutes)</li>
            <li> 1. I use it on my synthetic hair and it does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;2. Leaves the synthetic hair nice smooth a shiny&lt;br /&gt;A good purchase</li>
            <li> The curls didnt last me 30 seconds when I got out the door. my hair was extremely frizzzy and the curls complete drooped it didnt have the \\&quot;just took my rollers out \\&quot; effect</li>
