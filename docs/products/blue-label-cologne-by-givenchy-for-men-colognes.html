            <li>I am rating the product NOT Amazon&#x27;s service for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this perfume for more than 2 years</li>
            <li>and I LOVE</li>
            <li>This cologne is outstanding, it&#x27;s one of those colognes that you don&#x27;t smell it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I have never found it at a better price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed having this cologne in my collection -</li>
            <li>I love scented</li>
            <li>This has always been one of my favorite colognes, &amp; I have alot.</li>
            <li>job Amazone :)</li>
            <li>Have had many compliments on the smell of the cologne .</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I just love the scent.  </li>
            <li>The perfume is sooooo strong</li>
            <li>it is STRONG and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like strong cologne</li>
            <li>Great deal and would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance-my staff likes it when I apply it-not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh scent for the summer.</li>
            <li>I thought they were great, distinctive modern updates of older colognes (the Pour Homme advertising originally even seemed to reference a 70&#x27;s Givenchy scent,</li>
            <li>It has a very light refreshing scent that does not give me a headache (most perfumes and colognes give me an instant migraine!)</li>
            <li>nothing unique.</li>
            <li>It is an aqua/blue type of scent, but quite unique.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>I used these two parfumes for 3 years, and I know the original smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great I have used it for a long time and will continue if they will make it.</li>
            <li>, they are now willing to buy it is very rich in its aroma</li>
            <li>I love this scent, I wanted to try something different then the popular brands out there.  </li>
            <li>, she loves it; it is alot like Tommy H&#x27;s True Star.</li>
            <li>so I like not having a cologne like Cool Water or Aqua DiGio that everyone else wears too.</li>
            <li>Its a sweet clean/shower smell.</li>
            <li>bought this based on reviews, not bad.</li>
            <li>We got it super fast!!  </li>
            <li>We ordered this item and couldn&#x27;t believe how fast we received it!!</li>
            <li>Very good long lasting clean smell that is not over powering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh with just a little touch of citrus and everyone always tells me how great I smell when I have it on.</li>
            <li>They are the only two colognes I own.</li>
            <li>Its pricey but its worth your collection.</li>
            <li>Manly (in a good sense) and classic blue spicy.</li>
            <li>Will recommend fr the cool urban sexy guy....</li>
            <li>fragrance is nothing special or unusual.</li>
            <li>Try as many as you can; finding the right one is a very personal thing.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought this cologne</li>
            <li>I just had to come back and say I still love this cologne, and the Armani crowd has not caught up with me yet because I have not smelled it on anyone out there yet.</li>
            <li>but it did not seem to last more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this !!</li>
            <li>Delivery is indeed fast!</li>
            <li>In reality, these parfumes differ much!</li>
            <li>Moreover, in my package Givenchy blue label and Givenchy pour homme are absolutely identical - a cheap odecolone!</li>
            <li>It was brand new and just what we wanted!!</li>
            <li>it remains for whole day.</li>
            <li>Now not only does he enjoy it</li>
            <li>It defines masculinity and is very versatile.</li>
            <li>This spray is really a head turner.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and I really like this</li>
            <li>Excellent product , I have bought a lot of perfumes by amazon ,and this is one of the few that smell last for long time.</li>
            <li>sweet, inviting, sophisticated, but humbly subtle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now the older Givenchy Gentleman cologne seems fresher.</li>
            <li>kind of a disappointment being its from givenchy.expected much more</li>
            <li>No negative remarks.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Gentleman\\&quot;--the new 2002 tag was \\&quot;The Gentleman is back\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne as not many wear it and it is something I have to order</li>
            <li>I previously liked Armani and was looking for something along the lines of Aqua di Gio which I now refuse to wear because every male in the age group slightly below frat boy and slightly above mid-life crisis seems to be wearing it!!!</li>
            <li>For several years the Pour Hommes and the PI were favorites of mines, along with many, many other poeple, so much so that random aquaintances would correctly ID them on me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is suitable for young and old, formal and casual.</li>
            <li>Out of a dozen+ colognes I bought, including other very common ones like Lagerfeld Classic and the originla Polo, the Givenchy Pour Hommes (especially the blue label) and original PI are the only ones that I don&#x27;t even enjoy smelling anymore.</li>
            <li>Will order this product again in the near future.  </li>

            <li> there are dozens of other colognes that smell similar.</li>

            <li> not funny</li>

            <li> Came quicker than I expected!!!</li>
            <li> Try it only if you are tired of smelling like everyone else.</li>
            <li> and I wear it just about everyday as a result.</li>
            <li> not original!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read numerous reviews about cologne online being fake</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if this one was or not.</li>
            <li> Makes chicks cream their pants as the walk past Givenchy &#x3D;</li>
            <li> But no spontaneous remarks about liking it either.</li>
            <li> probable chinese fake production!</li>
            <li> Slowly the scents became so common, imitated in grocery store bodywashes, that putting on the colognes seemed boring and pointless.</li>
            <li> If you want to Blind buy</li>
            <li> I recommend for the office or casual.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is fake!</li>
            <li> These two are FAKE!</li>
            <li> ((( Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the first time I bought this cologne and I am very happy with it I&#x27;ve Received a lot of compliments about it. It is a refreshing sense that you can use every day I would recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> Well I purchased this for my husband as valentine gift as he had already used it earlier and it was really good. The perfume is sooooo strong it remains for whole day. Actually the day it arrived I tested it on my husband&#x27;s nightwear he was wearing and it didn&#x27;t go till i washed it. I love it and my husband loves it tooo.</li>
            <li> I previously liked Armani and was looking for something along the lines of Aqua di Gio which I now refuse to wear because every male in the age group slightly below frat boy and slightly above mid-life crisis seems to be wearing it!!! I had to change my style up and this was it. Try it only if you are tired of smelling like everyone else. It is a nice &#x27;date scent&#x27;...sweet, inviting, sophisticated, but humbly subtle. I&#x27;m hoping the Armani crowd is not reading this coz I do not want you messing up a good thing for me...lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;03/22/2012 - I just had to come back and say I still love this cologne, and the Armani crowd has not caught up with me yet because I have not smelled it on anyone out there yet.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is a fan of this cologne. It&#x27;s not easy to come by at big department stores save for Sears. Now not only does he enjoy it but I do too!</li>
            <li> i love blue label i was so afraid that this would be fake or not good but it&#x27;s the true thing go for it is an awesome perfume .</li>
            <li> Came quicker than I expected!!! My husband lives this cologne... It makes for a great gift!! Definitely Will buy again from this seller!!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I bought Givenchy Blue Label to get away from the Givenchy Pour Homme (purple bottle) users in my country (even tought the purple one has a better and more sophisticated scent). I was amazed.  This is an excellent perfume, fresh, unique. You will catch a lot of women and turn a lot of heads. Con or pro (depends on your point of view): you will get noticed from afar while you don&#x27;t smell the perfume on yourself sometimes. It hold for a good time too.  This perfume is a winner, trust me.</li>
            <li> I have received many complements on how good I smell when I wear this. It has a very light refreshing scent that does not give me a headache (most perfumes and colognes give me an instant migraine!)</li>
            <li> I love this scent, I wanted to try something different then the popular brands out there.  I even get compliments for this one all the time from my friends</li>
            <li> The scent of this fragrance is amazing. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot compliments from wearing it and I wear it just about everyday as a result.</li>
            <li> I remember smelling magazine inserts of the blue and bergundy bottle pour hommes beginning in 2002, along with the PI cologne. I thought they were great, distinctive modern updates of older colognes (the Pour Homme advertising originally even seemed to reference a 70&#x27;s Givenchy scent, \\&quot;Gentleman\\&quot;--the new 2002 tag was \\&quot;The Gentleman is back\\&quot;). For several years the Pour Hommes and the PI were favorites of mines, along with many, many other poeple, so much so that random aquaintances would correctly ID them on me. Slowly the scents became so common, imitated in grocery store bodywashes, that putting on the colognes seemed boring and pointless. Out of a dozen+ colognes I bought, including other very common ones like Lagerfeld Classic and the originla Polo, the Givenchy Pour Hommes (especially the blue label) and original PI are the only ones that I don&#x27;t even enjoy smelling anymore. They were excellent, too good for their own good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the older Givenchy Gentleman cologne seems fresher.</li>
            <li> not ground breaking. bought this based on reviews, not bad. nothing unique. there are dozens of other colognes that smell similar. kind of a disappointment being its from givenchy.expected much more</li>
            <li> I am rating the product NOT Amazon&#x27;s service for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this perfume for more than 2 years and I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;(I am a college student)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is suitable for young and old, formal and casual. It defines masculinity and is very versatile. Just the perfect potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally recommend it. Amazon&#x27;s price is among the cheapest.</li>
            <li> This cologne is outstanding, it&#x27;s one of those colognes that you don&#x27;t smell it but others will, lasts along time  and people will ask for the name, I will always have this one on hand, I totally recomend it, get the big bottle for the money</li>
            <li> I was shopping with my girlfriend in London and we sampled many EDTs and this is the one we liked the best on me. I love it, she loves it; it is alot like Tommy H&#x27;s True Star. They are the only two colognes I own. Try as many as you can; finding the right one is a very personal thing. AND have a female friend along when you go shopping. Then buy it on Amazon to save $$.</li>
            <li> We ordered this item and couldn&#x27;t believe how fast we received it!! We got it super fast!!  It was brand new and just what we wanted!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for 4 years and along with Bvlgari Pour Homme it&#x27;s one of my favorites. It&#x27;s a very fresh scent for the summer. But, as with any cologne or perfume - it&#x27;s a very individual thing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product , I have bought a lot of perfumes by amazon ,and this is one of the few that smell last for long time. and the smell is very different from all the other colognes</li>
            <li> As soon as it touches my skin mouths begin to water.. Not for everyone but if it&#x27;s for you then it&#x27;s liquid GOLD.</li>
            <li> Will recommend fr the cool urban sexy guy....This spray is really a head turner.[[ASIN:B000C1Z5UC Givenchy Blue Label By Givenchy For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> Manly (in a good sense) and classic blue spicy. Amazing fragrance. Great deal and would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne as not many wear it and it is something I have to order so I like not having a cologne like Cool Water or Aqua DiGio that everyone else wears too.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this scent for my Hubby... and now my 14 year old son has been using it too... smells amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Fake...fake...fake!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I get great comments on it. I have never found it at a better price. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> If you want to Blind buy I recommend this one. Its a sweet clean/shower smell. It is an aqua/blue type of scent, but quite unique. Its pricey but its worth your collection.</li>
            <li> Me encanta este Perfume! Un muy buen regalo!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lo tengo guardado para el arbolito en navidad!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lo recomiendo, es muy sexy!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured Great product. Will order this product again in the near future.  Not disappointed at all.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed having this cologne in my collection - it&#x27;s not too strong and is perfect for spring. It does seem to fade as the day goes on, though.</li>
            <li> There is another comment that said this is the safe pick if you are flying blind in making a cologne decision.  It is a really good scent, and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it.  The price was very good, and I received the product timely.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance-my staff likes it when I apply it-not overpowering. No negative remarks.But no spontaneous remarks about liking it either.Will finish it but probably not reorder.</li>
            <li> fragrance is nothing special or unusual.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice but it did not seem to last more than an hour. I&#x27;ve read numerous reviews about cologne online being fake so I am not sure if this one was or not. I can say this year I bought cologne at Perfumania and it is STRONG and lasts all day. I will spend the extra $ from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the blue label before. Excellent fragrance. My wife loves it. My friends and people who don&#x27;t know ask about this fragrance all the time. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I went to see my dad and he could not stop talking about how good this stuff smelled so I bought him some. He jokes now that it smells so good he refuses to take a bath! um....not funny but I do get it!</li>
            <li> exquisite really love my walk I love scented and I really like this, people ask me a lot for this and I point out, they are now willing to buy it is very rich in its aroma</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorite colognes, &amp; I have alot. This will stay on me for a day or 2</li>
            <li> I do like the product and have to say the service and price are exceptional great.I&#x27;m going to reorder this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job Amazone :)</li>
            <li> Very good long lasting clean smell that is not over powering. Have had many compliments on the smell of the cologne . Highly recommend this !!</li>
            <li> Love the stuff. Wish they were still selling it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but strong.¡</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like strong cologne and that&#x27;s why GBL is great with a wonderful smell. It&#x27;s my top 5! I recommend for the office or casual.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift from a close friend who found it on my wish list!  It&#x27;s now almost July and I still have tons left in spite of the fact that I use it regularly.  I just love the scent.  It&#x27;s fresh with just a little touch of citrus and everyone always tells me how great I smell when I have it on.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 perfumes from Dealsbreaker - Givenchy pour hommme and Givenchy blue label. Delivery is indeed fast! However, the smell is fake! I used these two parfumes for 3 years, and I know the original smell. These two are FAKE! not original! Moreover, in my package Givenchy blue label and Givenchy pour homme are absolutely identical - a cheap odecolone! In reality, these parfumes differ much! probable chinese fake production! Perhaps, Dealsbreaker hoped that in Uzbekistan, noone could feel the difference. ((( Very disappointed! NOT recommend to buy from this supplier!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great I have used it for a long time and will continue if they will make it. It arived very quick in good shape.</li>
            <li> Makes chicks cream their pants as the walk past Givenchy &#x3D; an orgasm in a bottle. It&#x27;s scent sends females into a cycle of uninterpretable need for the contents of your \\&quot;package\\&quot;</li>
