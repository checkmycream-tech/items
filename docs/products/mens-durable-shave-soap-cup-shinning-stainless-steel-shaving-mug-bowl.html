    <ol>
            <li>Best way to shave.</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT!  </li>
            <li>Took a while to arrive, but what a great buy!  </li>
            <li>Fits my Williams shaving soap perfectly!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, great product!</li>
            <li>My wife bought one of these for me for Christmas, thinking she was doing a wonderful thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect size.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a shaving cup!</li>
            <li>I used a stick of Arko soap in mine and it pressed into shape in the bottom perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Works perfect for shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Perfect size soap cup.</li>
            <li>Suits my needs perfectly</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Awesome shaving cream cup for the price</li>
            <li>it works wonderfully, I use it all the time.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>This shaving cup is perfect.</li>
            <li>but it turned out to be the perfect size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all ideal for working up a lather with a brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful if impractical for use in shaving.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size,  good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this shaving cup.</li>
            <li>Looks great, cleans up great.  </li>
            <li>It is great for travel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size for travel.</li>
            <li>nice, fits col. conk perfectly</li>
            <li>So the bowl is usable, and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>It is great, however, for pre-soaking your shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>nice and good quality !!</li>
            <li>This bowl works great</li>
            <li>great shaving bowl</li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>I use this as my travel bowl because of the size and it floats very nicely when you want to rewarm you lather for another go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice.  </li>
            <li>Fits most shave bars perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still nice though!</li>
            <li>Not that great for making a lather but works well as a basin to warm up your brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can also recommend when in a hurry for a good shave, Alba Botanica/mango-vanilla cream shave in a tube, or Cremo Shave Cream and Kiss</li>
            <li>It does a good job when making a lather.</li>
            <li>What is this bowl good for?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality though</li>
            <li>The bowl has a good weight and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A great item to go with the  Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand, which I also purchase.  </li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s the perfect size for a quick lather.  </li>
            <li>This is very cute.</li>
            <li>Great product love it</li>
            <li>Ok this bowl is great</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>Two stars because it is nice, just not functional for my shaving brush and soap.</li>
            <li>Nice cup.  </li>
            <li>great item worth it</li>
            <li>easily like you would think!</li>
            <li>bowls are easy to clean and won’t break when dropped in the sink as well as being a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great cup, add a little more weight And would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I simply Love it.</li>
            <li>will order more fits well with safety razo use as holder for razor or shaving soap dish  </li>
            <li>I bought two of these stainless steel bowls and they are the perfect size to fit the hand comfortably (the soap doesn’t turn in the bowl; they are a snug fit) for the Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shaving Soap with aloe Vera and Shea butter that I purchase for $1.59 at Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I’ve tried many of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>OK, but I purchased a ceramic one, I like better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic?</li>
            <li>I bought this cup when looking for something more compact to use for shaving.</li>
            <li>My favorite soap -- Van Der Hagen &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; Shave Soap -- juuust fits in the diameter, and lines up almost to the top of the bowl.</li>
            <li>I should have known better given the price.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The 6.5 cm size is about the size of a 1/3 cup measuring cup and costs a bit more.  </li>
            <li>I would love this thing if it was 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li>; deeper, I don&#x27;t want a mammoth soap dish; at the same time it&#x27;s the perfect size for Colonel</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>A good lather ends up spilling right over the sides.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold a puck because it doesn&#x27;t need one: a sliver or two as pictured makes a quick and effective lather.</li>
            <li>Sits nicely on Chrome Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s easy to clean and looks nice.</li>
            <li>Best $3 ever spent.</li>
            <li>more recommendations; Aveeno Shaving Balm &amp; Aveeno fragrance free baby lotion is almost identical in ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than this, It is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>Heats up easily.</li>
            <li>All that said, it&#x27;s a nice stainless steel mug/cup/container and may have many uses.</li>
            <li>I fill it with hot water before i shave to warm up bowl for a nice hot lather.</li>
            <li>Nice bowl, not bad, on the small side which is actually perfect for my brush.</li>
            <li>The packaging was fine</li>
            <li>you will enjoy the cups aesthetic appeal.</li>
            <li>but it is way too light.  </li>
            <li>The shaving soap doesn&#x27;t fit in the cup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These bowls fit comfortably in my hand while I whip lather with my Badger Hair or Boar Bristle Shaving brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am comfortable with.  </li>
            <li>While shaving, the cup fit well in my hand, but</li>
            <li>stainless steel looks nice with my razor and brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also incredibly smooth on the inside</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to is what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>My silver tip brush doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>your brush will barely fit in the cup</li>
            <li>overall impression is that this shaving cup is a great value for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really need something that looks nice.  </li>
            <li>Your shaving soap doesn&#x27;t fit?  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful stainless steel bowl double walled.  </li>
            <li>This shave soap cup is a bit smaller than I was expecting, but it&#x27;s very nice-looking and should be perfect for my husband&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day gift along with a brush and my homemade shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and simple with a nice clean look.</li>
            <li>I put a 2&amp;#34; chromed steel ball bearing in it which fit and balanced it and made an artistic paper weight for my desk.</li>
            <li>to clean.  </li>
            <li>My Face Shave Cream that may be used alone or added to the brush with the Van Der Hagen soap for a super smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rinses clean in seconds.</li>
            <li>No problem keeping it clean.</li>
            <li>When I was looking for one, I wanted a stainless steel metal one that had a good quality and matched my existing razor, holder, and brush (stainless steel) set.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t make a great lather in this bowl because there is not much room to swirl the brush, and the handle hits the sides.</li>
            <li>very lightweight  will not buy more</li>
            <li>also this is too light to be useful</li>
            <li>I purchased it on a whim and have been pleasantly surprised by it, a nice compact soap cup for a bathroom cabinet or travel (if you can fashion a lid for it).</li>
            <li>This item is not bad.</li>
            <li>However, it is smaller in diameter but taller than most other soap cups, which isn&#x27;t particuarly the best design.</li>
            <li>If it were not for this sharp edge I would be perfectly happy with the bowl.</li>
            <li>Use tube soap and a wee bit of hot water and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>All in all I would definitely recommend it and am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really small for a shaving mug, most of the soaps I own barely fit.</li>
            <li>At first, though, I found the bowl so lightweight that I thought it was plastic!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and looks very classy on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice unbreakable, double walled - one piece, stainless steel, cup at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>took forever to get here but for this price, worth it</li>
            <li>Not much room to create a good soap/cream lather.  </li>
            <li>guess i&#x27;ll find a way to use it on my shins, cuz dealing with customs for an overseas return isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>but it feels like plastic worth a metal finish.</li>
            <li>Works nicely with Shaving Cream, Personally I like Prorase soap rather than cream .  </li>
            <li>The right size.  </li>
            <li>The right weight.  </li>
            <li>The right price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is, i have no problem making a nice lather with a full badger hair brush but don&#x27;t expect a lot of lather due to the size.  </li>
            <li>Double wall polished stainless steel keeps the contents warm.</li>
            <li>Search &amp;#34;Amco Round Condiment Cup&amp;#34; and you will see a better, more practical, set of 6 cups.  </li>
            <li>it works well, is light weight, and is compact enough to fit well in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>baby lotion comes in a larger size in a pump bottle for just a dollar more and works as well as the shaving</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Please be aware of the size before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was my first cup, so</li>
            <li>The shape and size is more in line with a Chinese tea cup.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my brother as a gift he loves that he can sit in hot water and it heats up his shaving cream</li>
            <li>I would love to have an extra 1/2 inch in diameter.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>First off, what you see in the photo is NOT what you&#x27;ll receive.  </li>
            <li>this is my first shaving cup ever</li>
            <li>Works exactly like its supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice though for other uses.</li>
            <li>addition, this came mailed from China in a thinly-padded envelope rather than being included boxed nicely with the other things she ordered.  </li>
            <li>Great item was a bit smaller than I expected</li>
            <li>I use this cup to get my brush ready after getting it hot under the faucet water.  </li>
            <li>Took a few weeks to get in, as described, but is a surprisingly quality product I enjoy using daily.</li>
            <li>works good for a drip pan for shaving brush but way too small for soap</li>
            <li>only pros is that it&#x27;s lightweight (hollow walls), keeps the lather fairly warm, and looks nice next to my chrome razor/brush stand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This might work OK for those using shaving creams in a tube where you can squeeze a small bit into the cup, but this is just far too small to effectively use with soaps - nothing but the smallest will fit, and there is very little room available to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li>If shipping time is not an issue I would certainly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t use a large brush or bar/cake soap.</li>
            <li>For what I needed it works just fine, but I may eventually end up moving to a larger one.</li>
            <li>Nice little bowl.  </li>
            <li>It complements my combination chrome-plated brush and razor stand very well.</li>
            <li>but being it was stainless steel</li>
            <li>If you place a stainless steel handled brush into it with water, it tips over.  </li>
            <li>Stainless</li>
            <li>Lighter than it looks and very well made.  </li>
            <li>However, VDH &amp;#34;Luxury&amp;#34; Soap is too big too fit.</li>
            <li>Sent this to my buddy and he loves it, really likes the fact it is real badger tail.</li>
            <li>Straight from China.</li>
            <li>Supposed to be stainless steel</li>
            <li>Holds heat very well.</li>
            <li>Works really well as a shave soap cup.</li>
            <li>I still use this when traveling since it fits nicely an a travel bag, but I have moved back the the standard coffee mug for every day needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be surprised if they last more than a couple months in my traveling gear.</li>
            <li>but it was very cheap and other than the size</li>
            <li>Its more useful as a small teacup or large shot</li>
            <li>Use one for shaving and then you have 5 more for other utility use.  </li>
            <li>I get it &amp;#34;re-warmed&amp;#34; after every lather for a triple pass shave and it helps keep the lather warm without having to dip the brush into hot water, killing the thick lather I just made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shiny cup, but it&#x27;s too small to use to mix shaving cream with a brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice, small shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li>You can spend $6.00 on this cup and not be able to use it, or, you can spend $10.00 (including $5.00 shipping) for a set of 6 stainless cups that are big enough to use as shaving mugs.  </li>
            <li>the finish is nice but the thing is way too small.</li>
            <li>Bought this small one so that it would sit nicely on my shelf in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable being stainless steel very simple design and just the right size for a travel shave brush.</li>
            <li>my experience, this is an outstanding shaving soap that works as well as the fancy and much more expensive shaving soaps</li>
            <li>I will say that I do have trouble creating a good lather with my standard shave brush using shave cream.</li>
            <li>Looks decent and has kept up.</li>
            <li>On the small side but no stains in shower after several months now... does the trick and looks nice!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it at this price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems like a high quality bowl and</li>
            <li>You can fit a a soft bar in there and mold it, BUT it would be hard to fit your brush in there to get any soap out of it.</li>
            <li>Good price and quality, however a bit small, barely enough room to work my badger brush.</li>
            <li>Check the dimensions included in description to make sure you understand that this is not a huge bowl or mug.</li>
            <li>Its not hard to do.</li>
            <li>great little bowl, and little</li>
            <li>Nice little cup, but my Williams shaving Soap barely fits it needs to be a little bit larger to do a good job, or I need to buy smaller soap.</li>
            <li>For all the other soaps they may have to shave the soap and pack it in to get it to fit.</li>
            <li>The top outside edge is very sharp to the touch, a real detraction.</li>
            <li>Although the dimensions were listed, the cup is not practical for holding any kind of standard round shaving soap bar.  </li>
            <li>Too small to be super useful but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Sure its small</li>
            <li>Works okay but somewhat small.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, especially since I could not bring myself to spend a lot on what is essentially a mug with a different handle.  </li>
            <li>The inside diameter of the cup is the same as the O.D. of the standard round shaving soap block, it&#x27;s a nice tight fit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t go this route early.  </li>
            <li>I use an old coffee mug for a shaving mug and its twice the size of this...</li>
            <li>and it is stainless steel and will last a lifetime</li>
            <li>The bowl is solidly constructed, and the stainless shows no sign of rust yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is much lighter than it looks in the picture, but it seems like it will last.</li>
            <li>of the reviews complained about the soap fitting into the cup, well for the glycerin soap users (like me, I use Col. Conk)</li>
            <li>Tiny bowl, picture very misleading.</li>
            <li>A bit small for a typical shave brush to get up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Small but works fine</li>
            <li>This was much smaller than I realized and although for some it might be OK, it was too small for me.</li>
            <li>for comparison, my standard shaving bowl is 2.5\\&quot; high and 3.5\\&quot; in diameter.</li>
            <li>It is too small for my brush to even fit in let alone lather any soap in.</li>
            <li>this is a cheap metal shinning bowl though what you&#x27;d use it for, i don&#x27;t know cuz it&#x27;s too small for shaving.</li>
            <li>A normal puck shaped shaving soap will definitely not work.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s just really, really light and thin stainless steel.</li>
            <li>This bowl is way too small to get a good lather, even with a small badger brush.</li>
            <li>It takes up little space on top of my small sink, so that&#x27;s really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I use it for shave soap, and it is a cool little cup!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cup, but a little too small for a shaving cup.  </li>
            <li>and then there&#x27;s a little more room around it, but not a Whole lot; the bottom of the bowl is slightly smaller than the width of a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Cannt find soap small enough to fit it</li>
            <li>I didnt give it 5 stars simply because its pretty small and feels very cheap/light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 2 inch tall, 3 inch wide stainless steel bowl designed to help men shave, not compensate.</li>
            <li>I used to use a plastic cup, but now I&#x27;m extra classy</li>
            <li>Much more durable than the ceramic ones I have broken.</li>
            <li>Is tiny is size and is hard to find a soap bar that will fit in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than expected but is shaped very well for working up a lather on a brush.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just as expected if your looking for a decent sized cup</li>
            <li>trick is to add a few drops of my homemade shaving oil; grape seed (a few drops of oil of peppermint for I love the smell)</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s apparently chromed steel shell not solid steel because it feels lighter than aluminum) and flips over if you put anything in it like keys or coins, etc.</li>
            <li>It is a small bowl useful for travel, but does not hold heat well.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not easy and it doesn&#x27;t create very much.</li>
            <li>Much smaller than I expected, not big enough to really use for shaving.</li>
            <li>It is small, but I think it&#x27;s just the right size for my purposes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to store wherever you have a tiny little bit of room since it is not a larger bowl, and outside of trouble scooping out the lather</li>
            <li>It is just wide enough that the soap fits in it, and there isn&#x27;t much open space above a new bar of soap.</li>
            <li>It was a little smaller than I had expected but nothing worth deducting a star over.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good little cup, but a bit small for my needs, How ever that just may be a preference on my part as the cup does hold the ordinary cake of shave soap well.</li>

            <li> EXCELLENT!  </li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive, but what a great buy!  </li>
            <li> Fits my Williams shaving soap perfectly!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, great product!</li>
            <li> My wife bought one of these for me for Christmas, thinking she was doing a wonderful thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect size.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a shaving cup!</li>
            <li> I used a stick of Arko soap in mine and it pressed into shape in the bottom perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Works perfect for shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect size soap cup.</li>
            <li> Suits my needs perfectly</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Awesome shaving cream cup for the price</li>
            <li> it works wonderfully, I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> This shaving cup is perfect.</li>
            <li> but it turned out to be the perfect size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all ideal for working up a lather with a brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful if impractical for use in shaving.  </li>
            <li> Perfect size,  good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this shaving cup.</li>
            <li> Looks great, cleans up great.  </li>
            <li> It is great for travel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size for travel.</li>
            <li> nice, fits col. conk perfectly</li>
            <li> So the bowl is usable, and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> It is great, however, for pre-soaking your shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> nice and good quality !!</li>
            <li> This bowl works great</li>
            <li> great shaving bowl</li>
            <li> Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this as my travel bowl because of the size and it floats very nicely when you want to rewarm you lather for another go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice.  </li>
            <li> Fits most shave bars perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still nice though!</li>
            <li> Not that great for making a lather but works well as a basin to warm up your brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can also recommend when in a hurry for a good shave, Alba Botanica/mango-vanilla cream shave in a tube, or Cremo Shave Cream and Kiss</li>
            <li> It does a good job when making a lather.</li>
            <li> What is this bowl good for?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality though</li>
            <li> The bowl has a good weight and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A great item to go with the  Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand, which I also purchase.  </li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s the perfect size for a quick lather.  </li>
            <li> This is very cute.</li>
            <li> Great product love it</li>
            <li> Ok this bowl is great</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Two stars because it is nice, just not functional for my shaving brush and soap.</li>
            <li> Nice cup.  </li>
            <li> great item worth it</li>
            <li> easily like you would think!</li>
            <li> bowls are easy to clean and won’t break when dropped in the sink as well as being a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great cup, add a little more weight And would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I simply Love it.</li>
            <li> will order more fits well with safety razo use as holder for razor or shaving soap dish  </li>
            <li> I bought two of these stainless steel bowls and they are the perfect size to fit the hand comfortably (the soap doesn’t turn in the bowl; they are a snug fit) for the Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shaving Soap with aloe Vera and Shea butter that I purchase for $1.59 at Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I’ve tried many of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> OK, but I purchased a ceramic one, I like better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic?</li>
            <li> I bought this cup when looking for something more compact to use for shaving.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap -- Van Der Hagen &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; Shave Soap -- juuust fits in the diameter, and lines up almost to the top of the bowl.</li>
            <li> I should have known better given the price.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The 6.5 cm size is about the size of a 1/3 cup measuring cup and costs a bit more.  </li>
            <li> I would love this thing if it was 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li> ; deeper, I don&#x27;t want a mammoth soap dish; at the same time it&#x27;s the perfect size for Colonel</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> A good lather ends up spilling right over the sides.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a puck because it doesn&#x27;t need one: a sliver or two as pictured makes a quick and effective lather.</li>
            <li> Sits nicely on Chrome Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s easy to clean and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Best $3 ever spent.</li>
            <li> more recommendations; Aveeno Shaving Balm &amp; Aveeno fragrance free baby lotion is almost identical in ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than this, It is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Heats up easily.</li>
            <li> All that said, it&#x27;s a nice stainless steel mug/cup/container and may have many uses.</li>
            <li> I fill it with hot water before i shave to warm up bowl for a nice hot lather.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl, not bad, on the small side which is actually perfect for my brush.</li>
            <li> The packaging was fine</li>
            <li> you will enjoy the cups aesthetic appeal.</li>
            <li> but it is way too light.  </li>
            <li> The shaving soap doesn&#x27;t fit in the cup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These bowls fit comfortably in my hand while I whip lather with my Badger Hair or Boar Bristle Shaving brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am comfortable with.  </li>
            <li> While shaving, the cup fit well in my hand, but</li>
            <li> stainless steel looks nice with my razor and brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also incredibly smooth on the inside</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to is what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> My silver tip brush doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> your brush will barely fit in the cup</li>
            <li> overall impression is that this shaving cup is a great value for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really need something that looks nice.  </li>
            <li> Your shaving soap doesn&#x27;t fit?  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful stainless steel bowl double walled.  </li>
            <li> This shave soap cup is a bit smaller than I was expecting, but it&#x27;s very nice-looking and should be perfect for my husband&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day gift along with a brush and my homemade shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and simple with a nice clean look.</li>
            <li> I put a 2&amp;#34; chromed steel ball bearing in it which fit and balanced it and made an artistic paper weight for my desk.</li>
            <li> to clean.  </li>
            <li> My Face Shave Cream that may be used alone or added to the brush with the Van Der Hagen soap for a super smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rinses clean in seconds.</li>
            <li> No problem keeping it clean.</li>
            <li> When I was looking for one, I wanted a stainless steel metal one that had a good quality and matched my existing razor, holder, and brush (stainless steel) set.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t make a great lather in this bowl because there is not much room to swirl the brush, and the handle hits the sides.</li>
            <li> very lightweight  will not buy more</li>
            <li> also this is too light to be useful</li>
            <li> I purchased it on a whim and have been pleasantly surprised by it, a nice compact soap cup for a bathroom cabinet or travel (if you can fashion a lid for it).</li>
            <li> This item is not bad.</li>
            <li> However, it is smaller in diameter but taller than most other soap cups, which isn&#x27;t particuarly the best design.</li>
            <li> If it were not for this sharp edge I would be perfectly happy with the bowl.</li>
            <li> Use tube soap and a wee bit of hot water and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> All in all I would definitely recommend it and am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really small for a shaving mug, most of the soaps I own barely fit.</li>
            <li> At first, though, I found the bowl so lightweight that I thought it was plastic!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and looks very classy on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice unbreakable, double walled - one piece, stainless steel, cup at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> took forever to get here but for this price, worth it</li>
            <li> Not much room to create a good soap/cream lather.  </li>
            <li> guess i&#x27;ll find a way to use it on my shins, cuz dealing with customs for an overseas return isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> but it feels like plastic worth a metal finish.</li>
            <li> Works nicely with Shaving Cream, Personally I like Prorase soap rather than cream .  </li>
            <li> The right size.  </li>
            <li> The right weight.  </li>
            <li> The right price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is, i have no problem making a nice lather with a full badger hair brush but don&#x27;t expect a lot of lather due to the size.  </li>
            <li> Double wall polished stainless steel keeps the contents warm.</li>
            <li> Search &amp;#34;Amco Round Condiment Cup&amp;#34; and you will see a better, more practical, set of 6 cups.  </li>
            <li> it works well, is light weight, and is compact enough to fit well in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> baby lotion comes in a larger size in a pump bottle for just a dollar more and works as well as the shaving</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Please be aware of the size before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was my first cup, so</li>
            <li> The shape and size is more in line with a Chinese tea cup.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my brother as a gift he loves that he can sit in hot water and it heats up his shaving cream</li>
            <li> I would love to have an extra 1/2 inch in diameter.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> First off, what you see in the photo is NOT what you&#x27;ll receive.  </li>
            <li> this is my first shaving cup ever</li>
            <li> Works exactly like its supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice though for other uses.</li>
            <li> addition, this came mailed from China in a thinly-padded envelope rather than being included boxed nicely with the other things she ordered.  </li>
            <li> Great item was a bit smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I use this cup to get my brush ready after getting it hot under the faucet water.  </li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to get in, as described, but is a surprisingly quality product I enjoy using daily.</li>
            <li> works good for a drip pan for shaving brush but way too small for soap</li>
            <li> only pros is that it&#x27;s lightweight (hollow walls), keeps the lather fairly warm, and looks nice next to my chrome razor/brush stand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This might work OK for those using shaving creams in a tube where you can squeeze a small bit into the cup, but this is just far too small to effectively use with soaps - nothing but the smallest will fit, and there is very little room available to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li> If shipping time is not an issue I would certainly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t use a large brush or bar/cake soap.</li>
            <li> For what I needed it works just fine, but I may eventually end up moving to a larger one.</li>
            <li> Nice little bowl.  </li>
            <li> It complements my combination chrome-plated brush and razor stand very well.</li>
            <li> but being it was stainless steel</li>
            <li> If you place a stainless steel handled brush into it with water, it tips over.  </li>
            <li> Stainless</li>
            <li> Lighter than it looks and very well made.  </li>
            <li> However, VDH &amp;#34;Luxury&amp;#34; Soap is too big too fit.</li>
            <li> Sent this to my buddy and he loves it, really likes the fact it is real badger tail.</li>
            <li> Straight from China.</li>
            <li> Supposed to be stainless steel</li>
            <li> Holds heat very well.</li>
            <li> Works really well as a shave soap cup.</li>
            <li> I still use this when traveling since it fits nicely an a travel bag, but I have moved back the the standard coffee mug for every day needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be surprised if they last more than a couple months in my traveling gear.</li>
            <li> but it was very cheap and other than the size</li>
            <li> Its more useful as a small teacup or large shot</li>
            <li> Use one for shaving and then you have 5 more for other utility use.  </li>
            <li> I get it &amp;#34;re-warmed&amp;#34; after every lather for a triple pass shave and it helps keep the lather warm without having to dip the brush into hot water, killing the thick lather I just made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shiny cup, but it&#x27;s too small to use to mix shaving cream with a brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice, small shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li> You can spend $6.00 on this cup and not be able to use it, or, you can spend $10.00 (including $5.00 shipping) for a set of 6 stainless cups that are big enough to use as shaving mugs.  </li>
            <li> the finish is nice but the thing is way too small.</li>
            <li> Bought this small one so that it would sit nicely on my shelf in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable being stainless steel very simple design and just the right size for a travel shave brush.</li>
            <li> my experience, this is an outstanding shaving soap that works as well as the fancy and much more expensive shaving soaps</li>
            <li> I will say that I do have trouble creating a good lather with my standard shave brush using shave cream.</li>
            <li> Looks decent and has kept up.</li>
            <li> On the small side but no stains in shower after several months now... does the trick and looks nice!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it at this price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems like a high quality bowl and</li>
            <li> You can fit a a soft bar in there and mold it, BUT it would be hard to fit your brush in there to get any soap out of it.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality, however a bit small, barely enough room to work my badger brush.</li>
            <li> Check the dimensions included in description to make sure you understand that this is not a huge bowl or mug.</li>
            <li> Its not hard to do.</li>
            <li> great little bowl, and little</li>
            <li> Nice little cup, but my Williams shaving Soap barely fits it needs to be a little bit larger to do a good job, or I need to buy smaller soap.</li>
            <li> For all the other soaps they may have to shave the soap and pack it in to get it to fit.</li>
            <li> The top outside edge is very sharp to the touch, a real detraction.</li>
            <li> Although the dimensions were listed, the cup is not practical for holding any kind of standard round shaving soap bar.  </li>
            <li> Too small to be super useful but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Sure its small</li>
            <li> Works okay but somewhat small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, especially since I could not bring myself to spend a lot on what is essentially a mug with a different handle.  </li>
            <li> The inside diameter of the cup is the same as the O.D. of the standard round shaving soap block, it&#x27;s a nice tight fit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t go this route early.  </li>
            <li> I use an old coffee mug for a shaving mug and its twice the size of this...</li>
            <li> and it is stainless steel and will last a lifetime</li>
            <li> The bowl is solidly constructed, and the stainless shows no sign of rust yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is much lighter than it looks in the picture, but it seems like it will last.</li>
            <li> of the reviews complained about the soap fitting into the cup, well for the glycerin soap users (like me, I use Col. Conk)</li>
            <li> Tiny bowl, picture very misleading.</li>
            <li> A bit small for a typical shave brush to get up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> Small but works fine</li>
            <li> This was much smaller than I realized and although for some it might be OK, it was too small for me.</li>
            <li> for comparison, my standard shaving bowl is 2.5\\&quot; high and 3.5\\&quot; in diameter.</li>
            <li> It is too small for my brush to even fit in let alone lather any soap in.</li>
            <li> this is a cheap metal shinning bowl though what you&#x27;d use it for, i don&#x27;t know cuz it&#x27;s too small for shaving.</li>
            <li> A normal puck shaped shaving soap will definitely not work.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s just really, really light and thin stainless steel.</li>
            <li> This bowl is way too small to get a good lather, even with a small badger brush.</li>
            <li> It takes up little space on top of my small sink, so that&#x27;s really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use it for shave soap, and it is a cool little cup!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cup, but a little too small for a shaving cup.  </li>
            <li> and then there&#x27;s a little more room around it, but not a Whole lot; the bottom of the bowl is slightly smaller than the width of a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Cannt find soap small enough to fit it</li>
            <li> I didnt give it 5 stars simply because its pretty small and feels very cheap/light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 2 inch tall, 3 inch wide stainless steel bowl designed to help men shave, not compensate.</li>
            <li> I used to use a plastic cup, but now I&#x27;m extra classy</li>
            <li> Much more durable than the ceramic ones I have broken.</li>
            <li> Is tiny is size and is hard to find a soap bar that will fit in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than expected but is shaped very well for working up a lather on a brush.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as expected if your looking for a decent sized cup</li>
            <li> trick is to add a few drops of my homemade shaving oil; grape seed (a few drops of oil of peppermint for I love the smell)</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s apparently chromed steel shell not solid steel because it feels lighter than aluminum) and flips over if you put anything in it like keys or coins, etc.</li>
            <li> It is a small bowl useful for travel, but does not hold heat well.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not easy and it doesn&#x27;t create very much.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected, not big enough to really use for shaving.</li>
            <li> It is small, but I think it&#x27;s just the right size for my purposes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really easy to store wherever you have a tiny little bit of room since it is not a larger bowl, and outside of trouble scooping out the lather</li>
            <li> It is just wide enough that the soap fits in it, and there isn&#x27;t much open space above a new bar of soap.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I had expected but nothing worth deducting a star over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little cup, but a bit small for my needs, How ever that just may be a preference on my part as the cup does hold the ordinary cake of shave soap well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not really sure that I more expensive mug would really create a better lather, but I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> Though the bowl is of decent weight and sturdy, all one piece design, the bowl is so small it is almost impossible to work up a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is much too small tiki use with soap and brush.</li>
            <li> Immediately after opening it, I noticed how small it really was.</li>
            <li> It will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I should have spent the extra money to get something that is actually big enough to create a lather in.  </li>
            <li> Wash first using a paper towel and not a fabric towel - it will dirty your towel on the first wash.</li>
            <li> Are these people applying cream with a toilet brush perhaps?  </li>
            <li> The soap fits, it&#x27;s just pretty shallow.  </li>
            <li> The cup was smaller than I expected, and I had to cut the soap up to get it in, but it works well</li>
            <li> Strange..</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It retains heat really well, and it&#x27;s just big enough to fit mos brushes, as well as being heavy enough in the base so as not to tip over.</li>
            <li> I do wish it was a little bigger since I use an Omega 49 brush and its too big for this bowl.</li>
            <li> Seems fine but very small hard to whip up lather with the Col. Conk lime soap.</li>
            <li> Pitiful far too small.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it has some loose pieces of metal inside it that rattle around.</li>
            <li> This results in some overflow of soak from the cup and a slight nuisance of rinsing the outside of the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is about half a cup deep and 3inches around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to fit into a dopp kit but with the lack of a lid that would make it difficult.  </li>
            <li> a little smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> ; after I rinse with plenty of cold water and pat dry with a towel; I splash a bit of Witch Hazel and let it sit while I clean my razor, cup and brush before applying my shaving balm; Witch Hazel kept in the fridge is invigorating.</li>
            <li> Material may be stainless, but it is quite thin.</li>
            <li> It is much harder to whip up the soap into a lather because of it&#x27;s dimensions.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll find yourself having a tiny bit of trouble trying to scoop out the lather from the bowl.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this is a little smaller than other shave bowls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a large bowl</li>
            <li> My brush barely fits into it and its very hard to whip up a later in it.</li>
            <li> Way too small for even a smaller shave soap.</li>
            <li> Too small to hold standard shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Way too small for shaving, or anything larger than a wee Bay Shrimp Cocktail.</li>
            <li> There just is not enough room in the small bowl to produce a lather in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it much due to</li>
            <li> Wish I would have listened to the other reviews here.  </li>
            <li> This cup won&#x27;t work well with any soap other than the liquid ones.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is people not taking the time to read and exercise due diligence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit small for using with standard shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and poorly made, poorly handled after manufacture.</li>
            <li> It is not very shiny looking, seems slightly irregularly shaped, and came shipped with a dent in it.</li>
            <li> NOT worth the four bucks.</li>
            <li> The quality is average although it is &amp;#34;shinning&amp;#34; [sic].  </li>
            <li> Not worth my time or price to return it.</li>
            <li> Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> The advertised price ($4.19) also slightly increased (to $5.59) after order was placed in &amp;#34;cart&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I would give it less than a star if I could.</li>
            <li> So with very little room to work up a lather and can not hold a brush, I&#x27;m not really seeing a use for it....</li>
            <li> unfortunately the first one arrived badly dented but the seller corrected that issue promptly I like this bowl for the look and because it is dual walled so you can put hot water without having to feel the heat in your hand</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bowl seems small.</li>
            <li> However, even after pouring my soap into this cup, my brush has little room to circulate.</li>
            <li> Rim is a little ragged.</li>
            <li> I agree with some other reviews that it is too small.  </li>
            <li> A little small in diameter for the typical shave soap bars (which are little round discs).  </li>
            <li> I had assumed they were saying this since the cup would not fit a regularly-sized soap puck.</li>
            <li> shaving gets really messy when using this</li>
            <li> /&gt;The diameter of the interior opening is approximately 3 inches and depth is about the same.  </li>
            <li> The add should have indicated the height and diameter of the product, so I would not have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> what a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I may be off base here, but how do you get a lather when you can&#x27;t fit soap into the shave cup?  </li>
            <li> This will NOT fit a Col. Cronk puck unless one breaks the puck into pieces.</li>
            <li> would recommend this cup as a travel cup if you need to shave, but not for everyday needs.</li>
            <li> I use a standard badger hair shaving brush, so I am confused by people saying it doesn&#x27;t hold their brush.  </li>
            <li> you can accept that the cup is a little small (not prohibitively, though)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little small, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Just be warned it&#x27;s a little small, for comparison it can hold the brush</li>
            <li> Small little bowl.</li>
            <li> As a result of the poor packaging, the bowl arrived badly dented - like a full can of soda that you dropped on the ground.</li>
            <li> Was way to small to use.</li>
            <li> I thought the reviewers were foolish, because they were complaining about the cup&#x27;s small size.</li>
            <li> Kinda small, but it works well.</li>
            <li> This is a small bowl</li>
            <li> Too small to use as a shaving soap cup.</li>
            <li> this cup was too small to hold my soap.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely small &amp;#34;Shave Soap cup&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Too small to stir a shave brush in.</li>
            <li> Almost too small to just insert a brush, without trying to move it.</li>
            <li> As some of the others have reviewed, yes, this is a small bowl</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get this if you can deal with a small one than I recommend it</li>
            <li> And it may be amall but its not too small.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the price, even though others warned me that it was small.</li>
            <li> This cup is too small for a cake of shave soap.  </li>
            <li> This bowl is small.</li>
            <li> Too small.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small size.  </li>
            <li> This bowl is hefty, but it&#x27;s small.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, it&#x27;s way to small.  </li>
            <li> A small cup for my liquid soap.</li>
            <li> It is just way to small to handle a cake that we use in the states.</li>
            <li> Too small but workable, so small that I bit the bullet and got a G20 shaving scuttle from Georgetown pottery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone who just needs a small bowl for lathering for shaving.</li>
            <li> idiotically small.</li>
            <li> but as everyone says it is small so if you want a small shaving bowl this is the one.</li>
            <li> It is really small.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s to small to use,I&#x27;m keeping my change in it.</li>
            <li> small but functional.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was a bit worried that it would be too small for just about everything</li>
            <li> If you mix your lather in a bowl then apply the lather to your face, then this bowl IS too small for your needs.</li>
            <li> Alternatively you want to take your shaving brush to an oriental grocery store and look at their small porcelain and melamine bowls.  </li>
            <li> Conks small size soaps.</li>
            <li> Its a small shaving cup.  </li>
            <li> I feel like these people should have bought a small mixing bowl.</li>
            <li> There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this bowl other than it is next to useless for shaving due to its diminutive size.</li>
            <li> I carelessly ignore other reviews saying it was too small thinking &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> so it is hard to generate foam soap</li>
            <li> I found this bowl to be useless for a wet shave and ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I could at least use it as a preshave soak for the brush</li>
            <li> I will honestly never use the bowl.  </li>
            <li> This is way to small for a shave cup!</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was just manufactured poorly or it had been damaged before we got it.</li>
            <li> This shaving is way to small looks like it needs to be toys department, not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Poor.</li>
            <li> Sometimes these items are ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the soap I was using likes to foam a bit, so</li>
            <li> and I find it&#x27;s difficult to build up a lather in.  </li>
            <li> as the expensive ones</li>
            <li> It is VERY thin and photos make it look thicker.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived dirty (covered in fingerprints), scratched, and dented.</li>
            <li> Useless!</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a wonderful stainless steel bowl double walled.  It&#x27;s beautiful if impractical for use in shaving.  I will likely use this bowl elsewhere. It is much too small tiki use with soap and brush.</li>
            <li> Way too small for even a smaller shave soap. Not a fan</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected, not big enough to really use for shaving. Looks nice though for other uses.</li>
            <li> Was way to small to use.</li>
            <li> Too small to hold standard shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this cup, I read the reviews. I thought the reviewers were foolish, because they were complaining about the cup&#x27;s small size. I had assumed they were saying this since the cup would not fit a regularly-sized soap puck. However, even after pouring my soap into this cup, my brush has little room to circulate. This results in some overflow of soak from the cup and a slight nuisance of rinsing the outside of the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can accept that the cup is a little small (not prohibitively, though) you will enjoy the cups aesthetic appeal. It complements my combination chrome-plated brush and razor stand very well.</li>
            <li> Kinda small, but it works well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t go this route early.  Best way to shave.</li>
            <li> took forever to get here but for this price, worth it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really small for a shaving mug, most of the soaps I own barely fit. shaving gets really messy when using this</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here. It was stuck at the chicago area post office. Other than this, It is the perfect size. I fill it with hot water before i shave to warm up bowl for a nice hot lather.</li>
            <li> Though the bowl is of decent weight and sturdy, all one piece design, the bowl is so small it is almost impossible to work up a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diameter of the interior opening is approximately 3 inches and depth is about the same.  I found this bowl to be useless for a wet shave and ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> This is a small bowl and I knew that, as I didnt get this for creating a lather. I face lather with an arko stick and got this bowl to soak my brush in. I do wish it was a little bigger since I use an Omega 49 brush and its too big for this bowl. It still gets the job done for me though.</li>
            <li> Best $3 ever spent. Sure its small but so are the tiny chinese hands that made this thing. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Too small to use as a shaving soap cup.</li>
            <li> this cup was too small to hold my soap. The add should have indicated the height and diameter of the product, so I would not have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely small &amp;#34;Shave Soap cup&amp;#34;.  I knew it would be going in to it but being it was stainless steel I was hoping I could at least use it as a preshave soak for the brush but it is way too light.  If you place a stainless steel handled brush into it with water, it tips over.  So with very little room to work up a lather and can not hold a brush, I&#x27;m not really seeing a use for it....maybe a shot glass?</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!  Took a while to arrive, but what a great buy!  Fits my Williams shaving soap perfectly!</li>
            <li> Product arrived dirty (covered in fingerprints), scratched, and dented. Cheap and poorly made, poorly handled after manufacture. Way too small for shaving, or anything larger than a wee Bay Shrimp Cocktail. Too small to stir a shave brush in. Almost too small to just insert a brush, without trying to move it.</li>
            <li> As some of the others have reviewed, yes, this is a small bowl and it&#x27;s perfect for travel.  It&#x27;s very durable being stainless steel very simple design and just the right size for a travel shave brush.</li>
            <li> It lite, and won&#x27;t pit or tarnish. It won&#x27;t break when dropped. I simply Love it. You will also. Bye</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Wash first using a paper towel and not a fabric towel - it will dirty your towel on the first wash. Otherwise, great product!</li>
            <li> a little smaller than I thought but it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> This is about half a cup deep and 3inches around. Might work as a travel shave cup but not an at home mug or bowl.</li>
            <li> very lightweight  will not buy more</li>
            <li> This bowl is advertised as a shaving bowl?!? I carelessly ignore other reviews saying it was too small thinking &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t need the bowl to be that large.&amp;#34; Once it arrived I found out what they had been talking about. It is too small for my brush to even fit in let alone lather any soap in. Buy a different product.</li>
            <li> It is indeed pretty small for a soap cup I haven&#x27;t used it because I&#x27;ve bought my soap in a container but it was very cheap and other than the size it&#x27;s just as expected if your looking for a decent sized cup don&#x27;t get this if you can deal with a small one than I recommend it</li>
            <li> Not that great for making a lather but works well as a basin to warm up your brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why this is advertised as a shaving mug, as it&#x27;s only about the size of an expresso coffee cup....I use an old coffee mug for a shaving mug and its twice the size of this...also this is too light to be useful (it&#x27;s apparently chromed steel shell not solid steel because it feels lighter than aluminum) and flips over if you put anything in it like keys or coins, etc. I put a 2&amp;#34; chromed steel ball bearing in it which fit and balanced it and made an artistic paper weight for my desk.</li>
            <li> will order more fits well with safety razo use as holder for razor or shaving soap dish  great item worth it</li>
            <li> Very small. The shaving soap doesn&#x27;t fit in the cup.</li>
            <li> I didnt give it 5 stars simply because its pretty small and feels very cheap/light. That being said, what do you expect for the price? And it may be amall but its not too small. It fits in the palm of my hand and a Col. Conks soap puck fits snug inside it. All in all I would definitely recommend it and am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was much smaller than I realized and although for some it might be OK, it was too small for me. On another note it does seem to be made well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie. I bought this because of the price, even though others warned me that it was small. They were correct. I can&#x27;t make a great lather in this bowl because there is not much room to swirl the brush, and the handle hits the sides. It&#x27;s annoying.&lt;br /&gt;The only pros is that it&#x27;s lightweight (hollow walls), keeps the lather fairly warm, and looks nice next to my chrome razor/brush stand.</li>
            <li> Pitiful far too small. Useless!</li>
            <li> This shave soap cup is a bit smaller than I was expecting, but it&#x27;s very nice-looking and should be perfect for my husband&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day gift along with a brush and my homemade shaving soap.  Can&#x27;t wait to put it all together.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  The right size.  The right weight.  Stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.  The right price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this cup to get my brush ready after getting it hot under the faucet water.  I get it &amp;#34;re-warmed&amp;#34; after every lather for a triple pass shave and it helps keep the lather warm without having to dip the brush into hot water, killing the thick lather I just made.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these stainless steel bowls and they are the perfect size to fit the hand comfortably (the soap doesn’t turn in the bowl; they are a snug fit) for the Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shaving Soap with aloe Vera and Shea butter that I purchase for $1.59 at Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, this is an outstanding shaving soap that works as well as the fancy and much more expensive shaving soaps and I’ve tried many of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My trick is to add a few drops of my homemade shaving oil; grape seed (a few drops of oil of peppermint for I love the smell) almond, tea tree, aloe and castor oil to my brush before I apply the lather to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also recommend when in a hurry for a good shave, Alba Botanica/mango-vanilla cream shave in a tube, or Cremo Shave Cream and Kiss My Face Shave Cream that may be used alone or added to the brush with the Van Der Hagen soap for a super smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two more recommendations; Aveeno Shaving Balm &amp; Aveeno fragrance free baby lotion is almost identical in ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The baby lotion comes in a larger size in a pump bottle for just a dollar more and works as well as the shaving balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bowls fit comfortably in my hand while I whip lather with my Badger Hair or Boar Bristle Shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowls are easy to clean and won’t break when dropped in the sink as well as being a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last tip; after I rinse with plenty of cold water and pat dry with a towel; I splash a bit of Witch Hazel and let it sit while I clean my razor, cup and brush before applying my shaving balm; Witch Hazel kept in the fridge is invigorating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 2 inch tall, 3 inch wide stainless steel bowl designed to help men shave, not compensate. Heats up easily. Doesn&#x27;t hold a puck because it doesn&#x27;t need one: a sliver or two as pictured makes a quick and effective lather. Rinses clean in seconds. Doesn&#x27;t take up space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $5 it costs a fraction of that &amp;#34;art of shaving&amp;#34; crap. Planning a shave tomorrow, or a spa treatment? Just shave.</li>
            <li> Great cup, add a little more weight And would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is junk. NOT worth the four bucks.</li>
            <li> This product was so tiny I cannot use it...disappointing.</li>
            <li> This item is not bad. It was a little smaller than I had expected but nothing worth deducting a star over. The reason I gave this item three stars is because it took FOREVER to ship. I ordered this item on the second and it arrived on the seventeenth. If shipping time is not an issue I would certainly recommend this item. However, this item ships from Hong Kong so don&#x27;t expect to get it soon.</li>
            <li> This place needs to test their products will all sizes of shaving soaps before making a product. what a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this shaving cup. It does a good job when making a lather. Also, it&#x27;s easy to clean and looks nice.</li>
            <li> This cup is too small for a cake of shave soap.  I may be off base here, but how do you get a lather when you can&#x27;t fit soap into the shave cup?  I don&#x27;t use tube shave cream, so maybe that&#x27;s how you use it.  I think I&#x27;ll use this as a shot glass. ;)</li>
            <li> My wife bought one of these for me for Christmas, thinking she was doing a wonderful thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might work OK for those using shaving creams in a tube where you can squeeze a small bit into the cup, but this is just far too small to effectively use with soaps - nothing but the smallest will fit, and there is very little room available to work up a good lather. A normal puck shaped shaving soap will definitely not work. Please be aware of the size before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this came mailed from China in a thinly-padded envelope rather than being included boxed nicely with the other things she ordered.  As a result of the poor packaging, the bowl arrived badly dented - like a full can of soda that you dropped on the ground. However, it is too small/inexpensive to hassle with a return.</li>
            <li> Perfect size,  good price.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality, however a bit small, barely enough room to work my badger brush.</li>
            <li> Looks great, cleans up great.  A little small in diameter for the typical shave soap bars (which are little round discs).  A bit small for a typical shave brush to get up a good lather.  Look for one about an inch larger in diameter.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t give its height or diameter, it tips over from the brush alone, would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This bowl is small. I will say that I do have trouble creating a good lather with my standard shave brush using shave cream. There just is not enough room in the small bowl to produce a lather in my opinion. However using shave soap I can create an acceptable lather. Double wall polished stainless steel keeps the contents warm. It is great for travel but I would not use it at home where I can keep a much larger bowl.</li>
            <li> I use this cup every morning when I shave. Easy to clean and looks very classy on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  It&#x27;s a great size for travel.</li>
            <li> So I rated it 2 stars because 2 stars &#x3D; &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; which is how i feel.  It&#x27;s a nice shiny cup, but it&#x27;s too small to use to mix shaving cream with a brush.  It was my first cup, so I didn&#x27;t know what size cup I am comfortable with.  I ordered a shaving factory mug and I absolutely love it.  Perfect size.  I got what i paid for with this cup.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for a birthday present. It works for what he needs. Rim is a little ragged. Not sure if it was just manufactured poorly or it had been damaged before we got it.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, small shaving bowl.  It stays in the shower since I shave there and it hasn&#x27;t shown any sign of rusting or discoloring and i&#x27;ve been using it for a over a month.  I would highly recommend it at this price.</li>
            <li> It is a small bowl useful for travel, but does not hold heat well.  I opted for a ceramic mug and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> nice, fits col. conk perfectly</li>
            <li> I am returning this &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; cup.  Although the dimensions were listed, the cup is not practical for holding any kind of standard round shaving soap bar.  The quality is average although it is &amp;#34;shinning&amp;#34; [sic].  You can spend $6.00 on this cup and not be able to use it, or, you can spend $10.00 (including $5.00 shipping) for a set of 6 stainless cups that are big enough to use as shaving mugs.  Use one for shaving and then you have 5 more for other utility use.  Search &amp;#34;Amco Round Condiment Cup&amp;#34; and you will see a better, more practical, set of 6 cups.  Call one of them a &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; cup and your&#x27;re in business!.</li>
            <li> Great price for a shaving cup! Sometimes these items are ridiculously expensive. It&#x27;s just metal. It will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> OK, but I purchased a ceramic one, I like better.  I&#x27;ll find sue use for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than expected but is shaped very well for working up a lather on a brush.  It&#x27;s small enough to fit into a dopp kit but with the lack of a lid that would make it difficult.  I used a stick of Arko soap in mine and it pressed into shape in the bottom perfectly.  I purchased it on a whim and have been pleasantly surprised by it, a nice compact soap cup for a bathroom cabinet or travel (if you can fashion a lid for it).</li>
            <li> Nice little bowl.  Lighter than it looks and very well made.  Works perfect for shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Did I misread? Sized tiny for Lego jacuzzi...it looks like metal, sounds like metal...weighs nothing. What&#x27;s it made of? It&#x27;s magic?</li>
            <li> great little bowl, and little it is, i have no problem making a nice lather with a full badger hair brush but don&#x27;t expect a lot of lather due to the size.  I use this as my travel bowl because of the size and it floats very nicely when you want to rewarm you lather for another go.</li>
            <li> Two stars because it is nice, just not functional for my shaving brush and soap. It&#x27;s tiny and falls over if I set my brush inside the cup while I shave.</li>
            <li> I disagree with another reviewer&#x27;s comment.  This will NOT fit a Col. Cronk puck unless one breaks the puck into pieces. There is room for a brush so it is feasible to use it as a shave soap cup. The shape and size is more in line with a Chinese tea cup. I suspect it was manufactured for that purpose but some marketer is selling it for another use. All that said, it&#x27;s a nice stainless steel mug/cup/container and may have many uses.</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to get in, as described, but is a surprisingly quality product I enjoy using daily. Much more durable than the ceramic ones I have broken.</li>
            <li> Perfect size soap cup. Fits in one hand.</li>
            <li> Too small.  The soap fills the entire cup.  The lather comes out onto your hand.</li>
            <li> My husband lives this for shaving!</li>
            <li> I bought this cup when looking for something more compact to use for shaving. Immediately after opening it, I noticed how small it really was. While shaving, the cup fit well in my hand, but unfortunately the soap I was using likes to foam a bit, so my soap did not stay in the cup. I still use this when traveling since it fits nicely an a travel bag, but I have moved back the the standard coffee mug for every day needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this cup as a travel cup if you need to shave, but not for everyday needs.</li>
            <li> Small but works fine and it is stainless steel and will last a lifetime</li>
            <li> This is very cute. I wish there were a slightly bigger version.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it much due to it&#x27;s small size.  Not much room to create a good soap/cream lather.  I would recommend getting a bigger shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and product was as advertised. This is a very nice unbreakable, double walled - one piece, stainless steel, cup at a very reasonable price. The inside diameter of the cup is the same as the O.D. of the standard round shaving soap block, it&#x27;s a nice tight fit. I would highly recommend this product to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DonS.&lt;br /&gt;10/18/14</li>
            <li> As others have said, this is a little smaller than other shave bowls. It takes up little space on top of my small sink, so that&#x27;s really what I was looking for. My favorite soap -- Van Der Hagen &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; Shave Soap -- juuust fits in the diameter, and lines up almost to the top of the bowl. So the bowl is usable, and I&#x27;m happy with it. However, VDH &amp;#34;Luxury&amp;#34; Soap is too big too fit. So you might want to measure the soap you use ... the inside of the bowl is 2.5&amp;#34; diameter and about 1.5&amp;#34; tall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stainless steel looks nice with my razor and brush. At first, though, I found the bowl so lightweight that I thought it was plastic! But I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s just really, really light and thin stainless steel. A magnet sticks to it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband. He uses it dauily and loves it. Fits most shave bars perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl, not bad, on the small side which is actually perfect for my brush. The top outside edge is very sharp to the touch, a real detraction. If it were not for this sharp edge I would be perfectly happy with the bowl.</li>
            <li> This bowl is hefty, but it&#x27;s small.  It&#x27;s also incredibly smooth on the inside and I find it&#x27;s difficult to build up a lather in.  It is great, however, for pre-soaking your shaving brush.  It retains heat really well, and it&#x27;s just big enough to fit mos brushes, as well as being heavy enough in the base so as not to tip over.</li>
            <li> Suits my needs perfectly</li>
            <li> Great item was a bit smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Sent this to my buddy and he loves it, really likes the fact it is real badger tail. Goes well with a shaving bowl too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little small, but gets the job done. Looks decent and has kept up.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have listened to the other reviews here.  As others have said, it&#x27;s way to small.  You can work up a lather but it&#x27;s not easy and it doesn&#x27;t create very much. Not worth my time or price to return it. Will keep this as a sauce dipping bowl in my kitchen or something. I&#x27;d skip this if I were you.</li>
            <li> The cup was smaller than I expected, and I had to cut the soap up to get it in, but it works well</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. A small cup for my liquid soap. This cup won&#x27;t work well with any soap other than the liquid ones.</li>
            <li> Too small to be super useful but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Seems like a high quality bowl and the finish is nice but the thing is way too small. My brush barely fits into it and its very hard to whip up a later in it.</li>
            <li> This bowl is way too small to get a good lather, even with a small badger brush. Would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> nice and good quality !!</li>
            <li> The bowl is solidly constructed, and the stainless shows no sign of rust yet. My only complaint is that the bowl seems small. It is just wide enough that the soap fits in it, and there isn&#x27;t much open space above a new bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaving cream cup for the price</li>
            <li> I gave this to my brother as a gift he loves that he can sit in hot water and it heats up his shaving cream</li>
            <li> I like the product material, shape and size but the cup I received was damaged.  There was a crease only on the inside wall of the cup.  The packaging was fine so I believe it must have been damaged during manufacturing.  This item should also have been inspected before it was packaged and shipped.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap.  I should have spent the extra money to get something that is actually big enough to create a lather in.  I will honestly never use the bowl.  Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> One of the two bowls I ordered one came with a 1&amp;#34; crack on the inside. Material may be stainless, but it is quite thin. I&#x27;ll be surprised if they last more than a couple months in my traveling gear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than it looks in the picture here. It&#x27;s still nice though!</li>
            <li> Shaving cup had a rather &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; or dingy finish, and was much smaller than it looked in the photos.  The advertised price ($4.19) also slightly increased (to $5.59) after order was placed in &amp;#34;cart&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Seems fine but very small hard to whip up lather with the Col. Conk lime soap.</li>
            <li> Works okay but somewhat small. I would love to have an extra 1/2 inch in diameter. Can&#x27;t beat the travel practicality though.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Check the dimensions included in description to make sure you understand that this is not a huge bowl or mug. I find that it&#x27;s the perfect size for a quick lather.  It is very lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> this is a cheap metal shinning bowl though what you&#x27;d use it for, i don&#x27;t know cuz it&#x27;s too small for shaving. by the time it arrives you&#x27;ll have forgotten you ordered it, as it arrives from china and there&#x27;s no \\&quot;ships from\\&quot; detail in any of this site&#x27;s item descriptions. only after paying is a 30-45 day shipping estimate given. guess i&#x27;ll find a way to use it on my shins, cuz dealing with customs for an overseas return isn&#x27;t worth it.  looks like i can&#x27;t add pictures for this item. diameter is 2.75\\&quot;, height is &lt;2\\&quot;. for comparison, my standard shaving bowl is 2.5\\&quot; high and 3.5\\&quot; in diameter.</li>
            <li> Bought this small one so that it would sit nicely on my shelf in the shower.  Sometimes regret not getting a larger one.  A good lather ends up spilling right over the sides.  For what I needed it works just fine, but I may eventually end up moving to a larger one.</li>
            <li> I would give it less than a star if I could. It is just way to small to handle a cake that we use in the states.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go with a razor as a gift. I was really disappointed. I should have known better given the price. It is not very shiny looking, seems slightly irregularly shaped, and came shipped with a dent in it. I might add it took over a month to receive. Straight from China.</li>
            <li> Too small but workable, so small that I bit the bullet and got a G20 shaving scuttle from Georgetown pottery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is much lighter than it looks in the picture, but it seems like it will last. However, it is smaller in diameter but taller than most other soap cups, which isn&#x27;t particuarly the best design. It is much harder to whip up the soap into a lather because of it&#x27;s dimensions.</li>
            <li> Supposed to be stainless steel but it feels like plastic worth a metal finish. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to is what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> Poor. Cannt find soap small enough to fit it</li>
            <li> First off, what you see in the photo is NOT what you&#x27;ll receive.  The bowl shipped is thinner in thickness then it appears in the photo and tapers at the opening. It is VERY thin and photos make it look thicker.  This is not a shaving soap bowl. It&#x27;s too small. You can fit a a soft bar in there and mold it, BUT it would be hard to fit your brush in there to get any soap out of it. It&#x27;s just about the size opening as the width of my brush. My silver tip brush doesn&#x27;t fit. What is this bowl good for? It&#x27;s only use is for soaking your brush before shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice.  On the small side but no stains in shower after several months now... does the trick and looks nice!</li>
            <li> This bowl works great, I use it all the time, the only thing about it is that it is pretty small and you&#x27;ll find yourself having a tiny bit of trouble trying to scoop out the lather from the bowl. It&#x27;s good quality though and it&#x27;s really easy to store wherever you have a tiny little bit of room since it is not a larger bowl, and outside of trouble scooping out the lather it works wonderfully, I use it all the time. Would recommend it to anyone who just needs a small bowl for lathering for shaving. Just be warned it&#x27;s a little small, for comparison it can hold the brush and then there&#x27;s a little more room around it, but not a Whole lot; the bottom of the bowl is slightly smaller than the width of a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cup, but a little too small for a shaving cup.  I&#x27;d like to find something else, but have not yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this for shaving..but.. use it on my walker to store coins..when cleaning out my purse.. and then walking it to my office to put into my coin counter. Strange.. but works well for me.</li>
            <li> great shaving bowl unfortunately the first one arrived badly dented but the seller corrected that issue promptly I like this bowl for the look and because it is dual walled so you can put hot water without having to feel the heat in your hand</li>
            <li> Even though it  doesn&#x27;t look an old-school shaving mug, it still does the job and I really love it. buy this one</li>
            <li> idiotically small. your brush will barely fit in the cup so it is hard to generate foam soap</li>
            <li> Small little bowl. Litterally fits in the palm of your hand. Holds heat very well. Would recomend.</li>
            <li> Ok this bowl is great but as everyone says it is small so if you want a small shaving bowl this is the one.</li>
            <li> This item is not the size they advertise it. It is really small. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Fits perfectly in the palm of your hand. It&#x27;s nice and simple with a nice clean look. It is what it is, no frills no thrills. The biggest problem is people not taking the time to read and exercise due diligence. It&#x27;s not a large bowl so you can&#x27;t use a large brush or bar/cake soap. Use tube soap and a wee bit of hot water and you&#x27;ll be fine. READ PEOPLE, READ</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little cup, but a bit small for my needs, How ever that just may be a preference on my part as the cup does hold the ordinary cake of shave soap well.</li>
            <li> Neat Bowl, but it&#x27;s to small to use,I&#x27;m keeping my change in it.</li>
            <li> as described. small but functional. Sits nicely on Chrome Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors</li>
            <li> I use it for shave soap, and it is a cool little cup! Doesnt break, bend, or ding easily like you would think!</li>
            <li> This shaving cup is perfect. When I was looking for one, I wanted a stainless steel metal one that had a good quality and matched my existing razor, holder, and brush (stainless steel) set. After reading the reviews I was a bit worried that it would be too small for just about everything but it turned out to be the perfect size. The bowl has a good weight and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the reviews complained about the soap fitting into the cup, well for the glycerin soap users (like me, I use Col. Conk), this is not an problem that 10 seconds in a microwave can&#x27;t fix (melt the puck and pour it into the cup). For all the other soaps they may have to shave the soap and pack it in to get it to fit. I found that creating a lather inside the cup to be impractical, but using it to hold the soap and lathering on your face to be an acceptable trade off. If you mix your lather in a bowl then apply the lather to your face, then this bowl IS too small for your needs. I appreciate things that are compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression is that this shaving cup is a great value for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend on buying another one for a gift set that I am making for my brother.</li>
            <li> Works just how you need it to. No problem keeping it clean. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit small for using with standard shaving soap.  The soap fits, it&#x27;s just pretty shallow.  The item was shipped and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected. It&#x27;s not at all ideal for working up a lather with a brush. Would not buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> This is way to small for a shave cup! Its more useful as a small teacup or large shot glass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I guess my husband bought it specifically in this size. Maybe for his shaving cream that is a cream that come in a squeeze tube? He likes it. But he also has bigger shave cups he uses as well. He uses this tiny one for a specific soap.</li>
            <li> A great item to go with the  Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand, which I also purchase.  If you like simple and functional; this is it.</li>
            <li> The 6.5 cm size is about the size of a 1/3 cup measuring cup and costs a bit more.  Works nicely with Shaving Cream, Personally I like Prorase soap rather than cream .  Alternatively you want to take your shaving brush to an oriental grocery store and look at their small porcelain and melamine bowls.  They won&#x27;t show dried soap as much.</li>
            <li> Just as stated&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice&lt;br /&gt;Same as the expensive ones</li>
            <li> works good for a drip pan for shaving brush but way too small for soap</li>
            <li> I would love this thing if it was 1&amp;#34; deeper, I don&#x27;t want a mammoth soap dish; at the same time it&#x27;s the perfect size for Colonel Conks small size soaps.</li>
            <li> Looks just like it does in the picture. I don&#x27;t like it because it has some loose pieces of metal inside it that rattle around. Does the job though.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it to soak my safety razor and badger hair brush before I shave.  I used to use a plastic cup, but now I&#x27;m extra classy</li>
            <li> This shaving is way to small looks like it needs to be toys department, not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Is tiny is size and is hard to find a soap bar that will fit in it.</li>
            <li> this is my first shaving cup ever so I have nothing to compare it to but I don&#x27;t have any desire to try another. it works well, is light weight, and is compact enough to fit well in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Works really well as a shave soap cup. It is small, but I think it&#x27;s just the right size for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I agree with some other reviews that it is too small.  I shave in the shower so getting some lather on my hands is not that big of a deal for me and I don&#x27;t really need something that looks nice.  I guess for the price it&#x27;s okay, especially since I could not bring myself to spend a lot on what is essentially a mug with a different handle.  I&#x27;m also not really sure that I more expensive mug would really create a better lather, but I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> Nice cup.  Works exactly like its supposed to.  I am unsure what all these one star reviews are complaining about.  Its a small shaving cup.  I use a standard badger hair shaving brush, so I am confused by people saying it doesn&#x27;t hold their brush.  Are these people applying cream with a toilet brush perhaps?  Your shaving soap doesn&#x27;t fit?  Break a piece off.  Its not hard to do. I feel like these people should have bought a small mixing bowl.</li>
            <li> There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this bowl other than it is next to useless for shaving due to its diminutive size. I did not read the description closely enough as I was blinded by the price.</li>
            <li> Nice little cup, but my Williams shaving Soap barely fits it needs to be a little bit larger to do a good job, or I need to buy smaller soap.</li>
            <li> Tiny bowl, picture very misleading.</li>
