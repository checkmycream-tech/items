            <li>If that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for, great, but otherwise, beware!</li>
            <li>, Burt&#x27;s had a brilliant idea to combine the two together.</li>
            <li>and it loved it!</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>It also smells very nice, like hibiscus flowers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What is so nice about this lip balm, is that it is tinted!</li>
            <li>moisture with a hint of color&amp;#62;&amp;#62; really nice!</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>The Hibiscus color is a good nearly-natural.  </li>
            <li>The color is good to my lip and moisture as well.</li>
            <li>it applies smoothly and does not dehydrate lips, and it is the perfect balanced hint of color for my lips.</li>
            <li>You have to apply a good amount to make the color show.  </li>
            <li>and my wife says it&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Good mortursing with good colour</li>
            <li>I can apply it quickly and don&#x27;t have to worry about it being perfect.</li>
            <li>great for the lips, just love the tint and glossy appearance.</li>
            <li>Hibiscus is a gorgeous peachy-pink, warm shade.</li>
            <li>it is just the right amount of color with perfect ingredients backing it up.</li>
            <li>This is the best chap stick ever with the right hint of color.  </li>

            <li>Love the color and the ingredients!</li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>This balm moisturizes my lips amazingly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s an amazingly versatile color.</li>
            <li>Nice color and finish</li>
            <li>there is a nice feeling about using this product.</li>
            <li>Gives my lips a nice shade.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Makes you look nice without looking made up.</li>
            <li>so I ordered the Rose</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, and a nice color.</li>
            <li>But, honestly, its not that noticeable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I went online to get lip balm, but I really liked this one for how my lips felt after I used this.</li>
            <li>This lip balm goes on smooth, has a pleasant smell and taste, but it doesn&#x27;t make my lips look tinted at all.</li>
            <li>The best one I&#x27;ve ever used so far!</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and feels lovely.</li>
            <li>The color is not as nice as the pomegranate either, but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Good,all natural ingredients are my best friend.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is great in all aspects except, it makes my lips look very wrinkly, and the smell isn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li>Still, the lip balm is a beautiful color and very tinted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great in between for those parents with teens or pre-teens getting interested in cosmetics.</li>
            <li>The lip balm is flavorless, has no scent, and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Seems very cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY fair so aired on the lighter side</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more tints.</li>
            <li>I love the feel and look of Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this tinted lipgloss.</li>
            <li>If I use a nude lip liner under it, it stays on longer and gives a more &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>I usually love their products, but not this one.</li>
            <li>i just love this balm in the shade hibiscus.</li>
            <li>just love this product, and have placed it on my Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>For me the hibiscus color is better.  </li>
            <li>I love lip balms</li>
            <li>and I can for sure say that I love this one.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it moisturizes so well</li>
            <li>In person, it was more of an orangish/coral-like color.  </li>
            <li>On me, it grew more orange in tone as time passed.  </li>
            <li>Love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But otherwise, it&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li>I was worried the color would be too intensely red, however, I just tried it on and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically ever so slightly more pigmented than my lips</li>
            <li>It does go on smooth, and is nice and buttery.</li>
            <li>I love Burt Bee lip balms.</li>
            <li>Guess we&#x27;ll be getting more.</li>
            <li>Neutragena makes a much better brand,  </li>
            <li>you get more product, and their&#x27;s has sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Love this&lt;br /&gt;Burt</li>
            <li>, I have these on subscription, need I say more?</li>
            <li>Right amount of color without ever overdoing it and a good moisturizer for the lips.</li>
            <li>You have a wonderful balm made with Shea butter and lots of other wonderful things, and you also have a nice, clean tint added to your lips, making you look more alive. :)</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, it leaves my lips soft and moist.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very cool toned, and this color clashed with my undertones.</li>
            <li>I have several of them and they have a very good tint to them.</li>
            <li>Before I use this one I just make sure that I&#x27;ve either exfoliated my lips or just layer it with another gloss, cause the color is fantastic by itself as well.</li>
            <li>I believe this is one purchase best made, initially, in person, so you can find your true color.  </li>
            <li>As far as lip balm goes, the colors are great.</li>
            <li>This is a good option for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to wear lipstick for whatever reason, but who still wants some tint to their lips.</li>
            <li>Very moist, and light color, effect is good, can be a lipstick can also when the lipstick,i like this one</li>
            <li>A little more orangy than I prefer but still a cute color and feels great on, very smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, but could be a touch darker.</li>
            <li>Glides on smooth.</li>
            <li>Its not as smooth or as moisturizing as their chapsticks I have used, and it dries out my lips.</li>
            <li>I have always been a Burt&#x27;s Bee fan, as I have tried almost all the lip balms available, tested them, and found Burt&#x27;s keeps my lips</li>
            <li>It feels like nice light moisture similar to vasoline on your lips, but has the addition of a nice bit of tint.  </li>
            <li>This is so smooth and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>All Natural, goes smoothly on your lips, smells good and has just a hint of color.</li>
            <li>The whole line of Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balls provide a lovely sheer color, as well as great hydration for your lips.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, adds a great tint that isn&#x27;t extreme but is still significant color.</li>
            <li>Nice colors, keep the lips soft with a bit of color.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li>Lovely tint and very moisturizing</li>
            <li>one thing every lady knows, is lip stick makes you lot a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>If the color had been true to what was pictured, I would have given this 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It seems to last quite a while and is a good value for the price.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, natural looking color and good moisturization.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so easy to carry and leaves my lips moisturized with some nice sheer color.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is just the right color.  </li>
            <li>Super moist, with a hint of color.  </li>
            <li>However for someone with more warmth or yellow in their skin, I think they&#x27;d love this.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it, it came on like silk and felt pleasant until about an hour later when I noticed that my lips looked chapped when they were never chapped before!</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>I love the hibiscus color, it&#x27;s nice and not too dark.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of hydrating my chapped winter lips when I apply it a few times throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Doubt you can find any better natural product at this price.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find something very similar, but with a hint of color, so I bought their tinted lip balm in Hibiscus and Rose colors.  </li>
            <li>Nice color and applies like a Chapstick, only the color lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised with the smooth application and the moisturizing ability!</li>
            <li>The actual feel and smell of the product is nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown away lipstick because this feels good and has enough color to sub for the real thing.</li>
            <li>As a no-hassle individual about my makeup, I think this lip balm gives my lips a nice but natural pop of color without needing a mirror to make sure it&#x27;s staying inside my lip lines (which I would have to do with lipstick).</li>
            <li>I provides a lovely, natural alternative to lipstick.</li>
            <li>The color is worth it.</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t the right color family for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost out of my first tube right now, so</li>
            <li>Not as pink as appeared in the picture--more of an earthy peach-- still love it though!</li>
            <li>I contemplated so long which color to choose, and in the end I bought the red dahlia color, which seems to be the most popular color.</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>found at meijers on clearance after i bought the first tube on amazon.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li>The color really does stand out, and continues to soften and moisturize your lips!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a years-long fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, so I&#x27;m glad to say this works in a similar fashion.</li>
            <li>I tried it on for the first time</li>
            <li>Thanks, Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li>So much nicer and cheaper!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for in a lip balm - very rich and moisturizing and has a tint that actually shows!</li>
            <li>good for low key makeup when you want your lipcolor to be pretty but not overpowering</li>
            <li>It looks more natural, soft, and dewy.  </li>
            <li>Recently I wanted to try the tinted ones, even though my lips tend to chap (and when my lips chap you can see the color on the chapped portions more intensely).</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice tint of soft, red color.</li>
            <li>I live in the very hot Southwest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle but very nice.</li>
            <li>A subtle red is best way to describe.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, but also comes off just as easily so frequent application may be necessary.</li>
            <li>I go through a lot of lip balms because my lips get chapped really easily in the hot, dry weather and tend to flake and crack</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love the hint of color that it provides, though it was darker than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light on my lips, adds just enough color, and I&#x27;ve had compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Does not show up very well, and I ordered a darker shade.</li>
            <li>Overall, this can definitely be worn as a regular moisturizing lip balm that gives a great tint</li>
            <li>I much prefer the lip shimmers from Burts Bees.</li>
            <li>Very emollient without being greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>If you already have pigmented lips, this shade may not be all that noticeable, but if you&#x27;re like me and your lips aren&#x27;t very pigmented, you might like that</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t get much for the price.  </li>
            <li>Bees Tinted Lip Balm, Hibiscus so much</li>
            <li>So with my coloring I find myself not wearing this as much as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite moisturizing, and it can kind of cling to dead skin on my lips.</li>
            <li>As far as moisturizing goes, it&#x27;s all right-</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips from becoming dry.  </li>
            <li>I hoped that since I&#x27;m ok with some other Burts Bees products, this one wouldn&#x27;t cause issues.  </li>
            <li>Color is very nice and natural though subtle.</li>
            <li>I got my friend the same color, and since her lips are significantly lighter than mine you can see the pink more clearly, but it looks just as fantastic, just in a different way!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good lip balm, as nearly all Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms are, but there&#x27;s hardly any color to it at all</li>
            <li>The color seems to really enhance and mix very well with my natural colors, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more of a sheer and creamy consistency, but the color definitely shows up.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t last very long--about as long as you&#x27;d expect a tinted chap stick to stay on--but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is always high quality.</li>
            <li>it could be a little more moisturizing though.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I personally ordered the  Hibiscus Lip Tint, and I find it adds just the right amount of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more red, but it is on the pink side.</li>
            <li>Non chemical and looks very natural on you.</li>
            <li>I think the red dahlia may be a little better on someone more olive toned or black skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems to last a good few hours, doesn&#x27;t have too odd of a taste, and smells pretty</li>
            <li>I only wish it would stay on a little longer, and I wish the color was a touch more saturated.</li>
            <li>It give lips moisture and a natural looking enhanced color</li>
            <li>I am 32, but my skin is sensitive and acne prone.  </li>
            <li>Use it frequently to keep color on my lips all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of person that nearly always needs something on my lips whether it be gloss, chapstick or lisptick</li>
            <li>I often have difficulty finding the complete color selection, so ordering through Amazon overcomes that difficulty.</li>
            <li>and it does not differ from my natural lip color in any way.</li>
            <li>Feels &amp; looks natural.</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned with reddish-blonde hair and blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>Lips look naturally pink/red.</li>
            <li>They were soft and I didn&#x27;t feel I had to re-use it soon afterward.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pale and wanted a light color</li>
            <li>I had to find a replacement for my old blistex color tinted lip balm that was discontinued,  After many tries of other products this one is the closest I have found.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously not moisturizing enough to be a lip balm.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of regular Burt&#x27;s Bees beeswax lip balms, DO NOT BUY THIS as it is seriously not even close to being as moisturizing as the beeswax ones.</li>
            <li>But I do use it daily and like the soft, natural color it imparts.</li>
            <li>The tint adds a touch of femininity that most other lip balms do not offer and/or can not sustain for a few hours.</li>
            <li>The color is slightly different, a little more orange than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It will stain your morning java cup (barely), but won&#x27;t show up on someone else&#x27;s cheek.</li>
            <li>As far as the color I got the hibiscus and the red dahlia.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the picture was actually a different color attached accidentally to the Hibiscus-tinted product, or if the picture is just completely misleading.  </li>
            <li>I chose Hibiscus because it is basically the same color as my lips only a bit darker/more vivid.  </li>
            <li>This lip balm comes packaged in a cute but unnecessary cardboard tube that lists the ingredients, (they are not listed on the actual lip balm).</li>
            <li>However, I was expecting it to provide more color to the lips, it only adds a very subtle tint.  </li>
            <li>Great daytime wear when I just want a little color but no lipstick, plus it protects my lips from chapping in cold weather.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is quite pale and white on my legs but somewhat of an orange tan on my regularly exposed skin, certain areas I have just turn red in the sun.  </li>

            <li> If that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for, great, but otherwise, beware!</li>
            <li> , Burt&#x27;s had a brilliant idea to combine the two together.</li>
            <li> and it loved it!</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t into makeup (like I am), this is a great &#x27;in between&#x27; product, that leaves your feeling made up, without the effort.</li>

            <li> bought 4 for 1.79 each and would recommend this brand for sure!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> It also smells very nice, like hibiscus flowers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What is so nice about this lip balm, is that it is tinted!</li>
            <li> moisture with a hint of color&amp;#62;&amp;#62; really nice!</li>
            <li> Loved it.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> The Hibiscus color is a good nearly-natural.  </li>
            <li> The color is good to my lip and moisture as well.</li>
            <li> it applies smoothly and does not dehydrate lips, and it is the perfect balanced hint of color for my lips.</li>
            <li> You have to apply a good amount to make the color show.  </li>
            <li> and my wife says it&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Good mortursing with good colour</li>
            <li> I can apply it quickly and don&#x27;t have to worry about it being perfect.</li>
            <li> great for the lips, just love the tint and glossy appearance.</li>
            <li> Hibiscus is a gorgeous peachy-pink, warm shade.</li>
            <li> it is just the right amount of color with perfect ingredients backing it up.</li>
            <li> This is the best chap stick ever with the right hint of color.  </li>
            <li> It has just the right touch of color with excellent moisturizing.</li>
            <li> the color is light and beautiful</li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> I love it replaces my lipstick anyday!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the color and the ingredients!</li>
            <li> love this!</li>
            <li> This balm moisturizes my lips amazingly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s an amazingly versatile color.</li>
            <li> Nice color and finish</li>
            <li> there is a nice feeling about using this product.</li>
            <li> Gives my lips a nice shade.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Makes you look nice without looking made up.</li>
            <li> so I ordered the Rose</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, and a nice color.</li>
            <li> But, honestly, its not that noticeable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went online to get lip balm, but I really liked this one for how my lips felt after I used this.</li>
            <li> This lip balm goes on smooth, has a pleasant smell and taste, but it doesn&#x27;t make my lips look tinted at all.</li>
            <li> The best one I&#x27;ve ever used so far!</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and feels lovely.</li>
            <li> The color is not as nice as the pomegranate either, but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Good,all natural ingredients are my best friend.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great in all aspects except, it makes my lips look very wrinkly, and the smell isn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li> Still, the lip balm is a beautiful color and very tinted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great in between for those parents with teens or pre-teens getting interested in cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The lip balm is flavorless, has no scent, and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Seems very cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY fair so aired on the lighter side</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more tints.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and look of Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this tinted lipgloss.</li>
            <li> If I use a nude lip liner under it, it stays on longer and gives a more &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I usually love their products, but not this one.</li>
            <li> i just love this balm in the shade hibiscus.</li>
            <li> just love this product, and have placed it on my Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> For me the hibiscus color is better.  </li>
            <li> I love lip balms</li>
            <li> and I can for sure say that I love this one.</li>
            <li> Most of the time it moisturizes so well</li>
            <li> In person, it was more of an orangish/coral-like color.  </li>
            <li> On me, it grew more orange in tone as time passed.  </li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But otherwise, it&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li> I was worried the color would be too intensely red, however, I just tried it on and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically ever so slightly more pigmented than my lips</li>
            <li> It does go on smooth, and is nice and buttery.</li>
            <li> I love Burt Bee lip balms.</li>
            <li> Guess we&#x27;ll be getting more.</li>
            <li> Neutragena makes a much better brand,  </li>
            <li> you get more product, and their&#x27;s has sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Love this&lt;br /&gt;Burt</li>
            <li> , I have these on subscription, need I say more?</li>
            <li> Right amount of color without ever overdoing it and a good moisturizer for the lips.</li>
            <li> You have a wonderful balm made with Shea butter and lots of other wonderful things, and you also have a nice, clean tint added to your lips, making you look more alive. :)</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, it leaves my lips soft and moist.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cool toned, and this color clashed with my undertones.</li>
            <li> I have several of them and they have a very good tint to them.</li>
            <li> Before I use this one I just make sure that I&#x27;ve either exfoliated my lips or just layer it with another gloss, cause the color is fantastic by itself as well.</li>
            <li> I believe this is one purchase best made, initially, in person, so you can find your true color.  </li>
            <li> As far as lip balm goes, the colors are great.</li>
            <li> This is a good option for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to wear lipstick for whatever reason, but who still wants some tint to their lips.</li>
            <li> Very moist, and light color, effect is good, can be a lipstick can also when the lipstick,i like this one</li>
            <li> A little more orangy than I prefer but still a cute color and feels great on, very smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine, but could be a touch darker.</li>
            <li> Glides on smooth.</li>
            <li> Its not as smooth or as moisturizing as their chapsticks I have used, and it dries out my lips.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Burt&#x27;s Bee fan, as I have tried almost all the lip balms available, tested them, and found Burt&#x27;s keeps my lips</li>
            <li> It feels like nice light moisture similar to vasoline on your lips, but has the addition of a nice bit of tint.  </li>
            <li> This is so smooth and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> All Natural, goes smoothly on your lips, smells good and has just a hint of color.</li>
            <li> The whole line of Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balls provide a lovely sheer color, as well as great hydration for your lips.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, adds a great tint that isn&#x27;t extreme but is still significant color.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, keep the lips soft with a bit of color.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li> Lovely tint and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> one thing every lady knows, is lip stick makes you lot a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> If the color had been true to what was pictured, I would have given this 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It seems to last quite a while and is a good value for the price.  </li>
            <li> Pretty, natural looking color and good moisturization.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so easy to carry and leaves my lips moisturized with some nice sheer color.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is just the right color.  </li>
            <li> Super moist, with a hint of color.  </li>
            <li> However for someone with more warmth or yellow in their skin, I think they&#x27;d love this.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it, it came on like silk and felt pleasant until about an hour later when I noticed that my lips looked chapped when they were never chapped before!</li>
            <li> Very pretty color.</li>
            <li> I love the hibiscus color, it&#x27;s nice and not too dark.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of hydrating my chapped winter lips when I apply it a few times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Doubt you can find any better natural product at this price.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find something very similar, but with a hint of color, so I bought their tinted lip balm in Hibiscus and Rose colors.  </li>
            <li> Nice color and applies like a Chapstick, only the color lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised with the smooth application and the moisturizing ability!</li>
            <li> The actual feel and smell of the product is nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown away lipstick because this feels good and has enough color to sub for the real thing.</li>
            <li> As a no-hassle individual about my makeup, I think this lip balm gives my lips a nice but natural pop of color without needing a mirror to make sure it&#x27;s staying inside my lip lines (which I would have to do with lipstick).</li>
            <li> I provides a lovely, natural alternative to lipstick.</li>
            <li> The color is worth it.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t the right color family for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out of my first tube right now, so</li>
            <li> Not as pink as appeared in the picture--more of an earthy peach-- still love it though!</li>
            <li> I contemplated so long which color to choose, and in the end I bought the red dahlia color, which seems to be the most popular color.</li>
            <li> Like it very much.</li>
            <li> found at meijers on clearance after i bought the first tube on amazon.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li> The color really does stand out, and continues to soften and moisturize your lips!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a years-long fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, so I&#x27;m glad to say this works in a similar fashion.</li>
            <li> I tried it on for the first time</li>
            <li> Thanks, Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> So much nicer and cheaper!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in a lip balm - very rich and moisturizing and has a tint that actually shows!</li>
            <li> good for low key makeup when you want your lipcolor to be pretty but not overpowering</li>
            <li> It looks more natural, soft, and dewy.  </li>
            <li> Recently I wanted to try the tinted ones, even though my lips tend to chap (and when my lips chap you can see the color on the chapped portions more intensely).</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice tint of soft, red color.</li>
            <li> I live in the very hot Southwest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but very nice.</li>
            <li> A subtle red is best way to describe.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply, but also comes off just as easily so frequent application may be necessary.</li>
            <li> I go through a lot of lip balms because my lips get chapped really easily in the hot, dry weather and tend to flake and crack</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the hint of color that it provides, though it was darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light on my lips, adds just enough color, and I&#x27;ve had compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Does not show up very well, and I ordered a darker shade.</li>
            <li> Overall, this can definitely be worn as a regular moisturizing lip balm that gives a great tint</li>
            <li> I much prefer the lip shimmers from Burts Bees.</li>
            <li> Very emollient without being greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> If you already have pigmented lips, this shade may not be all that noticeable, but if you&#x27;re like me and your lips aren&#x27;t very pigmented, you might like that</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t get much for the price.  </li>
            <li> Bees Tinted Lip Balm, Hibiscus so much</li>
            <li> So with my coloring I find myself not wearing this as much as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite moisturizing, and it can kind of cling to dead skin on my lips.</li>
            <li> As far as moisturizing goes, it&#x27;s all right-</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips from becoming dry.  </li>
            <li> I hoped that since I&#x27;m ok with some other Burts Bees products, this one wouldn&#x27;t cause issues.  </li>
            <li> Color is very nice and natural though subtle.</li>
            <li> I got my friend the same color, and since her lips are significantly lighter than mine you can see the pink more clearly, but it looks just as fantastic, just in a different way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lip balm, as nearly all Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms are, but there&#x27;s hardly any color to it at all</li>
            <li> The color seems to really enhance and mix very well with my natural colors, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is more of a sheer and creamy consistency, but the color definitely shows up.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last very long--about as long as you&#x27;d expect a tinted chap stick to stay on--but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is always high quality.</li>
            <li> it could be a little more moisturizing though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I personally ordered the  Hibiscus Lip Tint, and I find it adds just the right amount of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more red, but it is on the pink side.</li>
            <li> Non chemical and looks very natural on you.</li>
            <li> I think the red dahlia may be a little better on someone more olive toned or black skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems to last a good few hours, doesn&#x27;t have too odd of a taste, and smells pretty</li>
            <li> I only wish it would stay on a little longer, and I wish the color was a touch more saturated.</li>
            <li> It give lips moisture and a natural looking enhanced color</li>
            <li> I am 32, but my skin is sensitive and acne prone.  </li>
            <li> Use it frequently to keep color on my lips all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that nearly always needs something on my lips whether it be gloss, chapstick or lisptick</li>
            <li> I often have difficulty finding the complete color selection, so ordering through Amazon overcomes that difficulty.</li>
            <li> and it does not differ from my natural lip color in any way.</li>
            <li> Feels &amp; looks natural.</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned with reddish-blonde hair and blue eyes.  </li>
            <li> Lips look naturally pink/red.</li>
            <li> They were soft and I didn&#x27;t feel I had to re-use it soon afterward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and wanted a light color</li>
            <li> I had to find a replacement for my old blistex color tinted lip balm that was discontinued,  After many tries of other products this one is the closest I have found.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously not moisturizing enough to be a lip balm.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of regular Burt&#x27;s Bees beeswax lip balms, DO NOT BUY THIS as it is seriously not even close to being as moisturizing as the beeswax ones.</li>
            <li> But I do use it daily and like the soft, natural color it imparts.</li>
            <li> The tint adds a touch of femininity that most other lip balms do not offer and/or can not sustain for a few hours.</li>
            <li> The color is slightly different, a little more orange than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It will stain your morning java cup (barely), but won&#x27;t show up on someone else&#x27;s cheek.</li>
            <li> As far as the color I got the hibiscus and the red dahlia.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the picture was actually a different color attached accidentally to the Hibiscus-tinted product, or if the picture is just completely misleading.  </li>
            <li> I chose Hibiscus because it is basically the same color as my lips only a bit darker/more vivid.  </li>
            <li> This lip balm comes packaged in a cute but unnecessary cardboard tube that lists the ingredients, (they are not listed on the actual lip balm).</li>
            <li> However, I was expecting it to provide more color to the lips, it only adds a very subtle tint.  </li>
            <li> Great daytime wear when I just want a little color but no lipstick, plus it protects my lips from chapping in cold weather.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is quite pale and white on my legs but somewhat of an orange tan on my regularly exposed skin, certain areas I have just turn red in the sun.  </li>
            <li> The color was fantastic and subtle, and seemed almost a brighter natural dark pink!</li>
            <li> Feels just like Burt&#x27;s Bees regular lip balm and lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: For those with dry lips who are worried about this product, put on a layer of Burt&#x27;s Bees regular lip balm before applying this tinted balm.</li>
            <li> Leaves my lips dry and in need of regular lip balm.</li>
            <li> When I say a tint that actually shows, what I mean is that in just one glide, you can really see the color on your lips, considering that you are using a balm, not a lipstick or a lip stain.</li>
            <li> The long lasting products dry my lips out.</li>
            <li> touch - so be careful if you put on a white shirt or scarf!</li>
            <li> Stays on and moisturize my lips all day long.</li>
            <li> The color is not overpowering and it keeps my lip moist for a long time.</li>
            <li> Yet one applicator lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The color is not overpowering and it keeps my lips moist for a long time.  </li>
            <li> By far the most disappointing thing about this balm, though, is that it caused me to break out!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely try other colors soon.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about this product because it wasn&#x27;t as dark as I was hoping it would be, but it has really grown on me .  </li>
            <li> Some complain that the color isn&#x27;t dark enough.</li>
            <li> When I turn it to full, it got broken!</li>
            <li> In short, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Only wish is I had picked a slightly darker shade.</li>
            <li> Color looks super fake.</li>
            <li> Could not live with out it!</li>
            <li> (Denver, Co is a very dry climate with lots of sun.)</li>
            <li> I have very very dry lips.</li>
            <li> I tried 3 colors and none of them had any actual tint to them apart from maybe making my lips look a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this if you are looking for a lip balm that adds just a little bit of color, and does not have a scent or flavor.</li>
            <li> Keep one in my purse, by the tv remote and with makeup.  </li>
            <li> The 5th was empty.</li>
            <li> Exercise caution when ordering, or you will be returning an empty tube of lip balm in the mail.</li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> The Hibiscus tint is a natural looking shade that is subtle.</li>
            <li> Prevents my lips from cracking and bleeding due to Sjogren&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever wear lipstick, and the only lip balm I like is Burt&#x27;s Bees pomegranate.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously not worth your money.</li>
            <li> The color is not as dark when worn as it shows in the photo.  </li>
            <li> Some other tinted lip balms eventually make my lips dryer, like I may be a little allergic to them or something.  </li>
            <li> It does not wear like a stain, a lipstick (where lips look drier, less plump) or a gloss (where lips look cakey),  </li>
            <li> The color was not true to the picture shown.  </li>
            <li> Slight tint just adds a little color on those drab winter days.</li>
            <li> I also like the little cardboard case it comes in.</li>
            <li> I wish it had been a little darker in color.</li>
            <li> Although the smell may be a bit off-putting since it has a heavy wax smell.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have repurchased this a few times now and will keep buying.  </li>
            <li> and I need to switch to a plain lip ointment for a few days.</li>
            <li> The texture is somewhat dry and cakey, and the color is a bit artificial looking and flat, with little shine.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it feels like it&#x27;s drying my lips out after a few days of continuous wear</li>
            <li> There is no shine from this product, which I usually prefer, but wouldn&#x27;t expect from a lip balm anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to describe</li>
            <li> Order at least one tube per month.</li>
            <li> The lip balm stick had those big air holes and it was very difficult to turn in the stick.</li>
            <li> Very painful inflamed blackheads on the edge of my mouth, which I haven&#x27;t gotten in years specifically because I&#x27;ve avoided certain lipsticks and balms.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the tint is imperceptible.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me feel addicted like some chapsticks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a weird taste, the color is subtle and keeps my lips from chapping.</li>
            <li> wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It adds a tint of color but isn&#x27;t fake looking.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Obsessed.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pathetic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love it.  wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive.  found at meijers on clearance after i bought the first tube on amazon.  bought 4 for 1.79 each and would recommend this brand for sure!!</li>
            <li> I picked up a couple of tubes of the hibiscus one at my local Books-a-Million a while back, and I haven&#x27;t used lipstick since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect color and consistency for me.</li>
            <li> This is perfect! it is just the right amount of color with perfect ingredients backing it up. This balm moisturizes my lips amazingly. Highly recommend! I will be buying more tints.</li>
            <li> Not as pink as appeared in the picture--more of an earthy peach-- still love it though!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!  Nice color and finish</li>
            <li> I had to find a replacement for my old blistex color tinted lip balm that was discontinued,  After many tries of other products this one is the closest I have found.  Doesn&#x27;t have a weird taste, the color is subtle and keeps my lips from chapping.</li>
            <li> Color looks super fake.</li>
            <li> the color is light and beautiful</li>
            <li> Bought the Hibiscus color. I was expecting more red, but it is on the pink side. Still, the lip balm is a beautiful color and very tinted.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps lips moist. Although the smell may be a bit off-putting since it has a heavy wax smell.</li>
            <li> Super moist, with a hint of color.  Awesome lip gloss alternative!</li>
            <li> I love the feel and look of Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. Non chemical and looks very natural on you. there is a nice feeling about using this product. Doubt you can find any better natural product at this price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;m almost out of my first tube right now, so I&#x27;ll probably be ordering another soon. I have the hibiscus color and it&#x27;s really pretty. It does a great job of hydrating my chapped winter lips when I apply it a few times throughout the day. The only downside is that, like lipstick, it will stain anything your lips touch - so be careful if you put on a white shirt or scarf! I also like the little cardboard case it comes in. I can keep it in my bag and not worry about the tube inside opening or getting damaged.</li>
            <li> I love this tinted lipgloss. It&#x27;s subtle but very nice. I always get complimented and asked about it.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this in stores.  It give lips moisture and a natural looking enhanced color which is what I prefer over lipstick.  I can apply it quickly and don&#x27;t have to worry about it being perfect. If I use a nude lip liner under it, it stays on longer and gives a more &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Pretty, natural looking color and good moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t last very long--about as long as you&#x27;d expect a tinted chap stick to stay on--but that&#x27;s ok. The long lasting products dry my lips out. This is great!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about this product because it wasn&#x27;t as dark as I was hoping it would be, but it has really grown on me .  The color seems to really enhance and mix very well with my natural colors, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to last a good few hours, doesn&#x27;t have too odd of a taste, and smells pretty decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great in between for those parents with teens or pre-teens getting interested in cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Some complain that the color isn&#x27;t dark enough. I think it&#x27;s perfect. Gives my lips a nice shade. Glides on smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, keep the lips soft with a bit of color.</li>
            <li> This is seriously not moisturizing enough to be a lip balm. If you&#x27;re a fan of regular Burt&#x27;s Bees beeswax lip balms, DO NOT BUY THIS as it is seriously not even close to being as moisturizing as the beeswax ones. As for the color, it is also lacking. I am brown-skinned but have pinkish lips, and even I have to coat my lips with five layers of this stuff for any noticeable color to show. It&#x27;s pathetic. In fact, I think it actually dries my lips out! The first time I wore it, it came on like silk and felt pleasant until about an hour later when I noticed that my lips looked chapped when they were never chapped before! This is seriously not worth your money. It&#x27;s not a proper lip balm, and it doesn&#x27;t even have a proper tint.</li>
            <li> Its not as smooth or as moisturizing as their chapsticks I have used, and it dries out my lips. I usually love their products, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I am 32, but my skin is sensitive and acne prone.  I hardly ever wear lipstick, and the only lip balm I like is Burt&#x27;s Bees pomegranate.  I keep several tubes at one time, in my purse, home, work desk-- I love it so much, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I was hoping to find something very similar, but with a hint of color, so I bought their tinted lip balm in Hibiscus and Rose colors.  The texture is somewhat dry and cakey, and the color is a bit artificial looking and flat, with little shine.  By far the most disappointing thing about this balm, though, is that it caused me to break out!  Very painful inflamed blackheads on the edge of my mouth, which I haven&#x27;t gotten in years specifically because I&#x27;ve avoided certain lipsticks and balms.  I hoped that since I&#x27;m ok with some other Burts Bees products, this one wouldn&#x27;t cause issues.  I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Perfect color.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a great product. It just isn&#x27;t the right color family for me. I&#x27;m very cool toned, and this color clashed with my undertones. However for someone with more warmth or yellow in their skin, I think they&#x27;d love this.</li>
            <li> I love the hint of color that it provides, though it was darker than I expected. Regardless, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer and I would recommend to others.  It will stain your morning java cup (barely), but won&#x27;t show up on someone else&#x27;s cheek. If you aren&#x27;t into makeup (like I am), this is a great &#x27;in between&#x27; product, that leaves your feeling made up, without the effort.</li>
            <li> I chose Hibiscus because it is basically the same color as my lips only a bit darker/more vivid.  It looks wonderful on!  Not just shade selection, but texture.  The color really does stand out, and continues to soften and moisturize your lips!  It does not wear like a stain, a lipstick (where lips look drier, less plump) or a gloss (where lips look cakey),  It looks more natural, soft, and dewy.  I definitely recommend to anyone!  Red Dahlia will be my next purchase!</li>
            <li> The color is perfect for daytime wear.  For evening, I use it over my lipstick.  Keeps my lips from becoming dry.  Use it frequently to keep color on my lips all day.  Like that the color is not pinkish nor is it a bluish red.  A subtle red is best way to describe.  Keep one in my purse, by the tv remote and with makeup.  Order at least one tube per month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that nearly always needs something on my lips whether it be gloss, chapstick or lisptick (Denver, Co is a very dry climate with lots of sun.) I can&#x27;t boast this product enough as it&#x27;s just a dreamy combination of all the above. It&#x27;s moisturizing, adds a great tint that isn&#x27;t extreme but is still significant color. I&#x27;ll purchase this religiously henceforth.</li>
            <li> I like this instead of lipstick throughout the day because I can add color without precision - meaning I don&#x27;t need to find a mirror as I do with regular lipstick. It&#x27;s light on my lips, adds just enough color, and I&#x27;ve had compliments on it. No chemical nasties and no animal testing. Simple.</li>
            <li> All Natural, goes smoothly on your lips, smells good and has just a hint of color. I just love it!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would last longer when applied. However I do like the moisturizing quality and the color. Just need it to last longer.</li>
            <li> The Hibiscus color is a good nearly-natural.  I often have difficulty finding the complete color selection, so ordering through Amazon overcomes that difficulty.</li>
            <li> As a natural strawberry blonde, I struggle with finding shades that aren&#x27;t too pink without being too brown. Hibiscus is a gorgeous peachy-pink, warm shade. The color selector on Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; website selected it for me, and it&#x27;s spot on. I&#x27;m a years-long fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, so I&#x27;m glad to say this works in a similar fashion. I only wish it would stay on a little longer, and I wish the color was a touch more saturated. But I do use it daily and like the soft, natural color it imparts.</li>
            <li> I love the hibiscus color, it&#x27;s nice and not too dark. With this balm, I get the moisture and color without the hassle of lipstick. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, but also comes off just as easily so frequent application may be necessary. I would still purchase this again and would try a different color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lip balm, as nearly all Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms are, but there&#x27;s hardly any color to it at all and it does not differ from my natural lip color in any way. I was hoping for a red tinted lip balm as my go-to merlot lip balm has been discontinued and I&#x27;m looking for a replacement. I&#x27;ll keep this and use it as I would a regular lip balm, but it in no way replaces my rep tint lip balm.</li>
            <li> The color is good to my lip and moisture as well.</li>
            <li> Lovely tint and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Does not show up very well, and I ordered a darker shade.</li>
            <li> I use this every day instead of lipstick or regular lip balm. It adds a tint of color but isn&#x27;t fake looking.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Only wish is I had picked a slightly darker shade. I&#x27;m VERY fair so aired on the lighter side it&#x27;s fine, but could be a touch darker. Goes on nice and feels lovely. Try it if you are a burst bees fan. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Great color &amp; texture. Feels &amp; looks natural. Makes you look nice without looking made up. I&#x27;ve subscribed to this &amp; will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Really great color. Very sheer and lightweight. Stays on and moisturize my lips all day long. Would definiteley recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> i just love this balm in the shade hibiscus. it applies smoothly and does not dehydrate lips, and it is the perfect balanced hint of color for my lips. this is a staple in my cosmetic bag and i wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> Nice color and applies like a Chapstick, only the color lasts longer.  Moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Burt&#x27;s Bee fan, as I have tried almost all the lip balms available, tested them, and found Burt&#x27;s keeps my lips the moistest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so nice about this lip balm, is that it is tinted! I live in the very hot Southwest. I am not a big makeup fan either.&lt;br /&gt;But one thing every lady knows, is lip stick makes you lot a whole lot better. And what every lady in the southwest knows is that lip balm saves your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Burt&#x27;s had a brilliant idea to combine the two together. You have a wonderful balm made with Shea butter and lots of other wonderful things, and you also have a nice, clean tint added to your lips, making you look more alive. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this product, and have placed it on my Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> I like this quite a bit.  Some other tinted lip balms eventually make my lips dryer, like I may be a little allergic to them or something.  This one doesn&#x27;t have that effect on me.  It feels like nice light moisture similar to vasoline on your lips, but has the addition of a nice bit of tint.  As far as the color I got the hibiscus and the red dahlia.  My skin tone is quite pale and white on my legs but somewhat of an orange tan on my regularly exposed skin, certain areas I have just turn red in the sun.  I have no hint of olive color to my skin.  For me the hibiscus color is better.  I think the red dahlia may be a little better on someone more olive toned or black skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been big on lipsticks, but I&#x27;ve always been a chapstick louver. The whole line of Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balls provide a lovely sheer color, as well as great hydration for your lips. I personally ordered the  Hibiscus Lip Tint, and I find it adds just the right amount of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is just the right color.  Like it very much.</li>
            <li> A little more orangy than I prefer but still a cute color and feels great on, very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love lip balms and I can for sure say that I love this one. The color was fantastic and subtle, and seemed almost a brighter natural dark pink! It&#x27;s so hard to describe but it&#x27;s an amazingly versatile color. I got my friend the same color, and since her lips are significantly lighter than mine you can see the pink more clearly, but it looks just as fantastic, just in a different way! I go through a lot of lip balms because my lips get chapped really easily in the hot, dry weather and tend to flake and crack if I don&#x27;t apply balm all the time. Recently I wanted to try the tinted ones, even though my lips tend to chap (and when my lips chap you can see the color on the chapped portions more intensely). So I&#x27;d been eyeing this one for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried it on for the first time I was really surprised with the smooth application and the moisturizing ability! It didn&#x27;t have that gross and sticky, waxy feel that some chap sticks have and it loved it! Most of the time it moisturizes so well that my lips don&#x27;t chap and I don&#x27;t have to worry about how the tint brings out peeling lips, but sometimes it does happen. Before I use this one I just make sure that I&#x27;ve either exfoliated my lips or just layer it with another gloss, cause the color is fantastic by itself as well. Overall, this can definitely be worn as a regular moisturizing lip balm that gives a great tint and I&#x27;ve recommended it to a lot of friends!</li>
            <li> great for the lips, just love the tint and glossy appearance.</li>
            <li> This is so smooth and moisturizing. Unfortunately the tint is imperceptible. I tried 3 colors and none of them had any actual tint to them apart from maybe making my lips look a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Great color and hydrating.</li>
            <li> The color was not true to the picture shown.  In the picture, the color appears to have a pinkish/berry look to it.  In person, it was more of an orangish/coral-like color.  I don&#x27;t know if the picture was actually a different color attached accidentally to the Hibiscus-tinted product, or if the picture is just completely misleading.  Out of curiosity, I applied it.  On me, it grew more orange in tone as time passed.  I am very fair-skinned with reddish-blonde hair and blue eyes.  This was definitely NOT my color.  The actual feel and smell of the product is nice.  It does moisturize well.  I believe this is one purchase best made, initially, in person, so you can find your true color.  Once you know what suits you, then you can order it online.  If the color had been true to what was pictured, I would have given this 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This lip balm goes on smooth, has a pleasant smell and taste, but it doesn&#x27;t make my lips look tinted at all. I basically bought a $5 flavored chapstick. I much prefer the lip shimmers from Burts Bees. I have several of them and they have a very good tint to them. This was a disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> I do like the Burt&#x27;s Bees colors quite a bit. As far as lip balm goes, the colors are great. My one complaint is that it feels like it&#x27;s drying my lips out after a few days of continuous wear and I need to switch to a plain lip ointment for a few days.</li>
            <li> This is the best chap stick ever with the right hint of color.  I have been buying these for sometime now.</li>
            <li> I love it replaces my lipstick anyday! Right amount of color without ever overdoing it and a good moisturizer for the lips. Lips look naturally pink/red.</li>
            <li> Lives up to all the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  Very emollient without being greasy or sticky.  Slight tint just adds a little color on those drab winter days.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! It is so easy to carry and leaves my lips moisturized with some nice sheer color.  The color is not as dark when worn as it shows in the photo.  I have repurchased this a few times now and will keep buying.  It seems to last quite a while and is a good value for the price.  Thanks, Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> moisture with a hint of color&amp;#62;&amp;#62; really nice!</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm. The color is not overpowering and it keeps my lip moist for a long time. Burt&#x27;s bees are great</li>
            <li> yummy stuff. I&#x27;ve thrown away lipstick because this feels good and has enough color to sub for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I have very very dry lips. The only lip balm works for me is the Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Lip Stick ($21). However, as I am looking for products for my baby, I find this substitute that only costs $6 but works for me too! I bought the Hibiscus. It&#x27;s moisturizing and add a tint of red but not to much for my everyday office outfit. I would definitely try other colors soon.</li>
            <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees. I&#x27;m pale and wanted a light color so I ordered the Rose and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm has replaced lipstick/lip gloss and chapstick for me.  So much nicer and cheaper!</li>
            <li> Prevents my lips from cracking and bleeding due to Sjogren&#x27;s. Color is very nice and natural though subtle. Because I drink tea and water throughout the day, I must reapply often. Yet one applicator lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This lip balm comes packaged in a cute but unnecessary cardboard tube that lists the ingredients, (they are not listed on the actual lip balm). The lip balm is flavorless, has no scent, and goes on very smoothly. As far as moisturizing goes, it&#x27;s all right- it could be a little more moisturizing though. The Hibiscus tint is a natural looking shade that is subtle. If you already have pigmented lips, this shade may not be all that noticeable, but if you&#x27;re like me and your lips aren&#x27;t very pigmented, you might like that it adds just a bit of color. There is no shine from this product, which I usually prefer, but wouldn&#x27;t expect from a lip balm anyway. Overall, I would recommend this if you are looking for a lip balm that adds just a little bit of color, and does not have a scent or flavor. (Your boyfriend will appreciate this when you&#x27;re making out-- just thought I&#x27;d throw that out there!)</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm.  However, I was expecting it to provide more color to the lips, it only adds a very subtle tint.  You have to apply a good amount to make the color show.  It is, by no means a lipstick.</li>
            <li> I am on my third stick of the Hibiscus color. I love it. It leaves a nice tint of soft, red color. It goes on like butter, yet is not oily. The tint adds a touch of femininity that most other lip balms do not offer and/or can not sustain for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I wish it had flavor and scent like Burt&#x27;s Bees pomegranate chapstick does. But otherwise, it&#x27;s an OK product. The color is not as nice as the pomegranate either, but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I contemplated so long which color to choose, and in the end I bought the red dahlia color, which seems to be the most popular color. I was worried the color would be too intensely red, however, I just tried it on and it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s basically ever so slightly more pigmented than my lips so it moisturizes my lips while evening out my lip color. It does for my lips what foundation does for skin. No this is not a lipstick but I hope everyone knows to expect that based on the reviews already.</li>
            <li> Obsessed. Perfect natural-looking color. Doesn&#x27;t make me feel addicted like some chapsticks.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in a lip balm - very rich and moisturizing and has a tint that actually shows! When I say a tint that actually shows, what I mean is that in just one glide, you can really see the color on your lips, considering that you are using a balm, not a lipstick or a lip stain. In short, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees! IDK what else to say.</li>
            <li> Good,all natural ingredients are my best friend. and I like the color</li>
            <li> Very moist, and light color, effect is good, can be a lipstick can also when the lipstick,i like this one</li>
            <li> Like it a lot!  Just the right amount of color!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great in all aspects except, it makes my lips look very wrinkly, and the smell isn&#x27;t amazing. It does go on smooth, and is nice and buttery.</li>
            <li> No chapped lips here.  Smells wonderful but not overpowering.  Just a hint of color to bring life to my face</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, it leaves my lips soft and moist.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Tried and tested, works well</li>
            <li> This is the perfect tinted lip balm! Feels just like Burt&#x27;s Bees regular lip balm and lasts just as long. I got the hibiscus color and it is just enough tint to make it look like I am wearing color. It also smells very nice, like hibiscus flowers. It is more of a sheer and creamy consistency, but the color definitely shows up. This is a good option for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to wear lipstick for whatever reason, but who still wants some tint to their lips. Love the color and the ingredients! All around, great product.</li>
            <li> As a no-hassle individual about my makeup, I think this lip balm gives my lips a nice but natural pop of color without needing a mirror to make sure it&#x27;s staying inside my lip lines (which I would have to do with lipstick). It&#x27;s also not as shiny as lipgloss and not as drying as lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: For those with dry lips who are worried about this product, put on a layer of Burt&#x27;s Bees regular lip balm before applying this tinted balm. I find it helps the tint to not settle into my lip creases as well.</li>
            <li> I love Burt Bee lip balms. It has just the right touch of color with excellent moisturizing. I provides a lovely, natural alternative to lipstick.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an extra to another item and my wife says it&#x27;s good stuff.  Guess we&#x27;ll be getting more.</li>
            <li> I ordered 5 of these lip balms, and 5 containers arrived in a timely manner, but only 4 of them actually had lip balm in them. The 5th was empty. Exercise caution when ordering, or you will be returning an empty tube of lip balm in the mail.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, and a nice color. It&#x27;s not quite moisturizing, and it can kind of cling to dead skin on my lips. But, honestly, its not that noticeable. I&#x27;ll just have to keep my lips moisturized. The color is worth it.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t get much for the price.  Neutragena makes a much better brand,  you get more product, and their&#x27;s has sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went online to get lip balm, but I really liked this one for how my lips felt after I used this. They were soft and I didn&#x27;t feel I had to re-use it soon afterward.</li>
            <li> I have been used this product for a year! I absolutely love it!! The best one I&#x27;ve ever used so far!</li>
            <li> As  I&#x27;m used to with Burt&#x27;s Bees, this is a wonderful lip balm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe this, but it almost seems like it would melt if you put it in your purse. Seems very cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.  The color is not overpowering and it keeps my lips moist for a long time.  Burt&#x27;s Bees are great products!</li>
            <li> Good mortursing with good colour</li>
            <li> as expected. Burt&#x27;s Bees is always high quality.</li>
            <li> Gave them as a stocking stuffer people seemed to like them!</li>
            <li> I do like this lip Balm. I wish it had been a little darker in color. Trying to get away from lipstick.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. But it does not moisturize lips. Leaves my lips dry and in need of regular lip balm.</li>
            <li> The lip balm stick had those big air holes and it was very difficult to turn in the stick.When I turn it to full, it got broken!</li>
            <li> love this! Could not live with out it!</li>
            <li> Just an FYI- this color is ORANGE.  Don&#x27;t let the pics fool you.  ORANGE.  If that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for, great, but otherwise, beware!</li>
            <li> good for low key makeup when you want your lipcolor to be pretty but not overpowering</li>
            <li> Great daytime wear when I just want a little color but no lipstick, plus it protects my lips from chapping in cold weather. Love this&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm, Hibiscus so much, I have these on subscription, need I say more?</li>
            <li> I like these a lot. I have problems with lipstick. I&#x27;ve been told I&#x27;m probably allergic to something in it because my lips burn and chap . These work great, I get color with no burning or chapped lips.</li>
            <li> The color is slightly different, a little more orange than I expected.  So with my coloring I find myself not wearing this as much as I hoped.  But the quality is great; what you&#x27;d expect from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
