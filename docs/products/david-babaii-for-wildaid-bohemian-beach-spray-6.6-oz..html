    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I stumbled across this product!    </li>
            <li>I have been using the Beach Spray with the Volcanic Ash Root Amplifier for about a week now, and I am truly impressed!</li>
            <li>The wave is incredible!</li>
            <li>It is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>It was not my intention to share my life story, lol, but I am so happy with this product, and I know how embarrassing the perimenopause, thinning hair thing can be.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;ve sprayed anything into it after using the product which is great.</li>
            <li>now that i&#x27;ve used it my wavy style is  just great</li>
            <li>Price is fair and it does what it promises. ...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe there are good reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it and am on this site because I need to order another bottle!</li>
            <li>DOES WHAT IT SAYS AND MORE!</li>
            <li>This hair product I think is best if your hair already has some wave, and doesn&#x27;t have as much of a tendency to frizz.</li>
            <li>This stuff thickens up my hair and gives it awesome texture and body, which makes my hair so much easier to style.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it very strong, and honestly don&#x27;t notice it at all</li>
            <li>It sure did: my hair got nice fat waves, nicely defined without being crunchy.</li>
            <li>the scent is an OK coconut smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, it&#x27;s not smelly - just fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I am totally in love with it.</li>
            <li>A testament to my love for this product</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>The best part is that I can often go an extra day before shampooing, which boggles my mind!</li>
            <li>I just had to go look in the mirror again to make sure I was telling the truth,</li>
            <li>although I am having good results with my Paul Mitchell moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, I can only imagine what great results I will get with the David Babaii products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not the best product because I guess I would need a little bit stronger of product to keep waves and be able to scrunch it without having problems with frizz.  </li>
            <li>It makes for an easy hair day.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff, and it also keeps my hair from getting oily as quickly.  </li>
            <li>But this is very light, I can still run my fingers through my hair (actually feels smoother than with the Aveda products) and I have good style and body.    </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I use this product to give it body back and it works remarkably.  </li>
            <li>This beach spray smells great, like the beach, and a few squirts gives my hair volume and curls and the ingredients are more natural than most hair styling products.</li>
            <li>I was looking into hair extensions, tried hair regrowth products, and often had to wear a baseball cap to run a quick errand.</li>
            <li>My hair looks even better than it did yesterday, where it would normally be stuck to my scalp, with bald patches showing...</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and very wavy.  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly fine hair and it gives me just the right amount of body and waves, without making my hair feel like it has too much product in it.</li>
            <li>Now I need a more natural hair spray, any suggestions?</li>
            <li>One of my friends noticed right away the difference in my hair as well.  </li>
            <li>and I found that I still had kind of a lot of frizz factor if I used it in my hair after I showered and let me hair air dry.  </li>
            <li>I have lots of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, silky and goes flat.  </li>
            <li>Gives great body and enhances my natural waves of my fine, but thick hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks David!</li>
            <li>But I ran out of my favorite hair product and tried this last week...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t compare it to a hairspray at all, although I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the technical comparison.</li>
            <li>In fact, I shampooed Sunday afternoon, it is now Tuesday morning, and I could definitely go out now without doing much more to my hair than fluffing it with my hands.</li>
            <li>The smell is exactly like hair spray - not beachy at all.  </li>
            <li>Thanks David Babaii!</li>
            <li>I tried it first blow drying with a diffuser</li>
            <li>This spray has a nice scent that disappears after application, so it can be combined with other products if desired.</li>
            <li>I love the girls long wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>that also looks healthy ... not frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li>Atlanta is very hot and humid this time of year, and most products make my hair a sweaty, gunky mess.</li>
            <li>The smell is very beachy/ tropical, and it did help my hair keep some wave.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t know what it wants to be: not quite straight, not quite curly.</li>
            <li>Pros: natural ingredients; cruelty free; dispenses in a nice, fine mist; nice, light scent; multiple uses depending on desired effect; lots of product for a reasonable price  Cons: can weigh hair down if overapplied to dry hair (this is all in the way it&#x27;s applied though); dulls shine a bit due to salt</li>
            <li>I have very baby fine, dry hair, with an oily scalp.</li>
            <li>And if I put a small amount of texturizing paste on my hands and dust the ends of my hair with it after using this product and diffusing, the result is really amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product has a fresh, barely noticeable scent.</li>
            <li>Hang my head upside down for more lift.</li>
            <li>I added on a bit more product just now, and it did not get all crunchy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend...</li>
            <li>This product is like a normal hair spray.</li>
            <li>As advertised it definitely helped my hair be a bit wavier and fun.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite looks is the wind-blown sea-water dried look after I&#x27;ve been to the beach.</li>
            <li>This product sat under my bathroom sink for ever - I got it as a gift but have been loyal to Aveda&#x27;s Phemollient for so long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely hooked!</li>
            <li>I used to pile different products one on top of the other to solve these problems and ending up getting greasy unmanageable hair that I had to wash every day.  </li>
            <li>(I usually clip it up while it finishes drying, for more lift).</li>
            <li>Instead of weighing my hair down with more stiff hair spray, I wet it with this very light product and then restyle.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, frequently limp hair, and spritz this into my roots before blowdrying for some extra body and hold -</li>
            <li>My hair really looks like it did in my younger beach days, and it feels like hair, not stiff at all.</li>
            <li>When my hair is still a bit damp, I add a bit of Amplifier to my roots, and let my hair finish drying naturally.</li>
            <li>David Babaii has a website where you can order directly, and all the products were sold out, so I went to Amazon.</li>
            <li>This has really solved a big problem for me!</li>
            <li>For soft, touchable hair, I prefer the Sedu spray.</li>
            <li>I use it on damp hair (2-3 pumps then massage over scalp) and my hair develops this bouncy, shapely, thick and manageable texture that I love.  </li>
            <li>I must admit that I liked the idea behind this product - a natural styling spray.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair full of body, with a little bit of texture and hold, but still soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>: I accidentally dropped the bottle the other day, and got extremely upset thinking I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use the</li>
            <li>I agree with the other comments, there is not strong scent, when it sprays it has a nice beachy smell, but it doesn&#x27;t stick around long</li>
            <li>I grew up by the beach on Long Island, and now live in Atlanta, so I know what the ocean and salt air does to my hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling dry like straw - not thick and curly like when I&#x27;m actually at the beach.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, but finely textured hair with a long layered cut.</li>
            <li>It does bring out the natural wave in my hair, but it leaves the ends really dry and frayed looking.</li>

            <li> I agree with the other comments, there is not strong scent, when it sprays it has a nice beachy smell, but it doesn&#x27;t stick around long</li>
            <li> I grew up by the beach on Long Island, and now live in Atlanta, so I know what the ocean and salt air does to my hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling dry like straw - not thick and curly like when I&#x27;m actually at the beach.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, but finely textured hair with a long layered cut.</li>
            <li> It does bring out the natural wave in my hair, but it leaves the ends really dry and frayed looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands of beach spray, and none work as well as the David Babaii For Wild Aid Beach Spray.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely wavier than if I let my hair dry without the product.</li>
            <li> I can also run wet hands through my hair to bring out the volume later in the day or the next day.  </li>
            <li> and I thought maybe that was why it looked so dry, but it does the same when I air dry.</li>
            <li> And overall it leaves my normally shiny hair looking dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I generally use 5 sprays on my damp hair after I get out of the shower- 3 around the roots of my hair and 1 spray down the length of each side of my hair.</li>
            <li> I also use it on dry hair when I want more texture and \\&quot;grit\\&quot; to my hair - used this way, it does have the potential to weigh hair down and \\&quot;dirty it up,\\&quot; but</li>
            <li> My hair was very long and the weight may have caused the waves to fall out a bit faster.    </li>
            <li> I lift up my hair from the scalp, and squeeze and scrunch while I blow dry.</li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> It gets a little flat and flyaway by the second day.  </li>
            <li> I live in Houston TX and have hair that is thick but tends to frizz</li>
            <li> Typically, I get a bit of lift for a few hours, and by the end of the day, my roots are flat, and my hair is starting to look greasy at the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have thin flyaway hair that also tends to get greasy really fast.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m careful about what I use on it.</li>
            <li> I have a non-colored, poofy (not curly, but definitely not straight), Caucasian hair.  </li>
            <li> I use about 5 or 6 spritzes of the Beach Spray on my wet hair</li>
            <li> I wear it in a chin length bob that I wash every other day and straighten.  </li>
            <li> I get alot of lift, without alot of frizz or dryness, as I have found with other body building, hair thickening products.</li>
            <li> I can run my fingers through my hair to fluff it up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other products in this line,</li>
            <li> I was using the Sedu beach spray and decided to give this a try based on some other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have spent an inordinate amount of time blow drying my hair upside down with every styling product known to mankind.</li>
            <li> Has a subtle smell that isn&#x27;t noticeable past the initial spray and doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy at all, even 2 or 3 days later.</li>
            <li> it also weight down the hair and makes it tangle.</li>
            <li> (I have a chin length, slightly layered bob).</li>
            <li> I picked it up a few weeks ago and can&#x27;t imagine going without it now!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused why people are so worked up about the smell</li>
            <li> It is less expensive at the Babaii site, so check that out.</li>
            <li> I have thin dull hair and David Babaii&#x27;s Wildaid Hair Spray</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I will not go over into how it dried my hair to a straw, but one thing you have to know - this stuff STINKS!</li>
            <li> But, alas!</li>

            <li> This is a fantastic product.  I have thin dull hair and David Babaii&#x27;s Wildaid Hair Spray gives it bounce that also looks healthy ... not frizzy or dry. Price is fair and it does what it promises. ... (what a concepst) Thanks David!</li>
            <li> This product is like a normal hair spray. does not create curls or a lot of body. it also weight down the hair and makes it tangle. the scent is an OK coconut smell.</li>
            <li> This product sat under my bathroom sink for ever - I got it as a gift but have been loyal to Aveda&#x27;s Phemollient for so long I never use anything else. But I ran out of my favorite hair product and tried this last week... I&#x27;m completely hooked! I don&#x27;t compare it to a hairspray at all, although I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the technical comparison. But this is very light, I can still run my fingers through my hair (actually feels smoother than with the Aveda products) and I have good style and body.    I agree with the other comments, there is not strong scent, when it sprays it has a nice beachy smell, but it doesn&#x27;t stick around long so if you don&#x27;t like your hair products clashing with your body lotions or perfumes this works well.    Love it!</li>
            <li> I have thin flyaway hair that also tends to get greasy really fast.  I used to pile different products one on top of the other to solve these problems and ending up getting greasy unmanageable hair that I had to wash every day.  This product solved all of my problems.  I use it on damp hair (2-3 pumps then massage over scalp) and my hair develops this bouncy, shapely, thick and manageable texture that I love.  It also keeps my roots from turning oily without drying out the ends.  I can also run wet hands through my hair to bring out the volume later in the day or the next day.  It&#x27;s not sticky, it&#x27;s not smelly - just fabulous!  Highly recommend...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed. I have thin hair so I&#x27;m careful about what I use on it. This beach spray smells great, like the beach, and a few squirts gives my hair volume and curls and the ingredients are more natural than most hair styling products. Now I need a more natural hair spray, any suggestions?</li>
            <li> This hair product I think is best if your hair already has some wave, and doesn&#x27;t have as much of a tendency to frizz. I live in Houston TX and have hair that is thick but tends to frizz and I found that I still had kind of a lot of frizz factor if I used it in my hair after I showered and let me hair air dry.  The smell is very beachy/ tropical, and it did help my hair keep some wave. It&#x27;s just not the best product because I guess I would need a little bit stronger of product to keep waves and be able to scrunch it without having problems with frizz.  As advertised it definitely helped my hair be a bit wavier and fun. Maybe I just need hair spray to set it. My hair was very long and the weight may have caused the waves to fall out a bit faster.    As you can guess, this isn&#x27;t my go-to product. I would probably recommend this to someone who has finer hair that doesn&#x27;t frizz like mine.</li>
            <li> I have lots of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, silky and goes flat.  This stuff thickens up my hair and gives it awesome texture and body, which makes my hair so much easier to style.  One of my friends noticed right away the difference in my hair as well.  I absolutely love this stuff, and it also keeps my hair from getting oily as quickly.  Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> that is why I bought it.  I love the girls long wavy hair.  I read an article that this is what the stylist uses on the set.  It is great stuff.  I am totally in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have a non-colored, poofy (not curly, but definitely not straight), Caucasian hair.  I wear it in a chin length bob that I wash every other day and straighten.  It gets a little flat and flyaway by the second day.  I use this product to give it body back and it works remarkably.  I don&#x27;t use it to get waves but to provide texture and body.  I love it and am on this site because I need to order another bottle!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product. I picked it up a few weeks ago and can&#x27;t imagine going without it now!    I have fine, straight, frequently limp hair, and spritz this into my roots before blowdrying for some extra body and hold - it leaves my hair full of body, with a little bit of texture and hold, but still soft and touchable. I also use it on dry hair when I want more texture and \\&quot;grit\\&quot; to my hair - used this way, it does have the potential to weigh hair down and \\&quot;dirty it up,\\&quot; but it&#x27;s all in how you apply, and it depends on what you&#x27;re looking for.    A testament to my love for this product: I accidentally dropped the bottle the other day, and got extremely upset thinking I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use the pump(but then I managed to fix it - yay!). I&#x27;m so happy I stumbled across this product!    Pros: natural ingredients; cruelty free; dispenses in a nice, fine mist; nice, light scent; multiple uses depending on desired effect; lots of product for a reasonable price  Cons: can weigh hair down if overapplied to dry hair (this is all in the way it&#x27;s applied though); dulls shine a bit due to salt</li>
            <li> I have very baby fine, dry hair, with an oily scalp. I am also going through perimenopause, so my hair has gotten even thinner in the last 3 years. I can see my very white scalp through my medium brown hair. Yuck! I have spent an inordinate amount of time blow drying my hair upside down with every styling product known to mankind. Typically, I get a bit of lift for a few hours, and by the end of the day, my roots are flat, and my hair is starting to look greasy at the scalp. By the next day, I have to start all over again.  I have been using the Beach Spray with the Volcanic Ash Root Amplifier for about a week now, and I am truly impressed! I use about 5 or 6 spritzes of the Beach Spray on my wet hair (I have a chin length, slightly layered bob). I lift up my hair from the scalp, and squeeze and scrunch while I blow dry. Hang my head upside down for more lift. When my hair is still a bit damp, I add a bit of Amplifier to my roots, and let my hair finish drying naturally. (I usually clip it up while it finishes drying, for more lift). This stuff is fantastic! I get alot of lift, without alot of frizz or dryness, as I have found with other body building, hair thickening products. The best part is that I can often go an extra day before shampooing, which boggles my mind! In fact, I shampooed Sunday afternoon, it is now Tuesday morning, and I could definitely go out now without doing much more to my hair than fluffing it with my hands. My hair looks even better than it did yesterday, where it would normally be stuck to my scalp, with bald patches showing...I&#x27;ve got a wavy, bed head thing going on. I added on a bit more product just now, and it did not get all crunchy or weighed down. My hair is actually bouncy!  I grew up by the beach on Long Island, and now live in Atlanta, so I know what the ocean and salt air does to my hair. Atlanta is very hot and humid this time of year, and most products make my hair a sweaty, gunky mess. I can run my fingers through my hair to fluff it up! It was not my intention to share my life story, lol, but I am so happy with this product, and I know how embarrassing the perimenopause, thinning hair thing can be. I was looking into hair extensions, tried hair regrowth products, and often had to wear a baseball cap to run a quick errand. My hair really looks like it did in my younger beach days, and it feels like hair, not stiff at all. The wave is incredible! I just had to go look in the mirror again to make sure I was telling the truth, lol. I hope others get the same results I did. David Babaii has a website where you can order directly, and all the products were sold out, so I went to Amazon. It is less expensive at the Babaii site, so check that out. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other products in this line, although I am having good results with my Paul Mitchell moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, I can only imagine what great results I will get with the David Babaii products. This has really solved a big problem for me!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe there are good reviews for this product.  My hair is fine and very wavy.  The smell is exactly like hair spray - not beachy at all.  It leaves my hair feeling dry like straw - not thick and curly like when I&#x27;m actually at the beach.  I&#x27;m in the process of trying to return it.</li>
            <li> I like this product in the summer time. It makes for an easy hair day. Just spray it on a your done. It does give the beachy look i was lookinjg for</li>
            <li> DOES WHAT IT SAYS AND MORE! Gives great body and enhances my natural waves of my fine, but thick hair. Has a subtle smell that isn&#x27;t noticeable past the initial spray and doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy at all, even 2 or 3 days later. My hair doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;ve sprayed anything into it after using the product which is great. I generally use 5 sprays on my damp hair after I get out of the shower- 3 around the roots of my hair and 1 spray down the length of each side of my hair. Works like a charm every time. Thanks David Babaii!</li>
            <li> This product has a fresh, barely noticeable scent. I use it when my bangs start to droop. Instead of weighing my hair down with more stiff hair spray, I wet it with this very light product and then restyle.</li>
            <li> well i saw this item in seventeen magazine and i just couldnt wait to use it , now that i&#x27;ve used it my wavy style is  just great</li>
            <li> I was using the Sedu beach spray and decided to give this a try based on some other reviews. I have thick, but finely textured hair with a long layered cut. It does bring out the natural wave in my hair, but it leaves the ends really dry and frayed looking. And overall it leaves my normally shiny hair looking dry and dull. I tried it first blow drying with a diffuser and I thought maybe that was why it looked so dry, but it does the same when I air dry. For soft, touchable hair, I prefer the Sedu spray. This spray has a nice scent that disappears after application, so it can be combined with other products if desired.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I liked the idea behind this product - a natural styling spray. But, alas! I will not go over into how it dried my hair to a straw, but one thing you have to know - this stuff STINKS! It smells like a sweaty (coumarin), salty (sea salt) coconut (\\&quot;beach\\&quot; association?) and it lingered on my fingers for 2 days. I&#x27;ve never been happier to take a shower.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands of beach spray, and none work as well as the David Babaii For Wild Aid Beach Spray.  I have incredibly fine hair and it gives me just the right amount of body and waves, without making my hair feel like it has too much product in it.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t know what it wants to be: not quite straight, not quite curly. One of my favorite looks is the wind-blown sea-water dried look after I&#x27;ve been to the beach. I&#x27;d heard that there were products out there that simulated this effect, and I decided to purchase this one to see if it did the trick.  It sure did: my hair got nice fat waves, nicely defined without being crunchy. It&#x27;s definitely wavier than if I let my hair dry without the product. And if I put a small amount of texturizing paste on my hands and dust the ends of my hair with it after using this product and diffusing, the result is really amazing.  I&#x27;m a little confused why people are so worked up about the smell... I didn&#x27;t find it very strong, and honestly don&#x27;t notice it at all once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
