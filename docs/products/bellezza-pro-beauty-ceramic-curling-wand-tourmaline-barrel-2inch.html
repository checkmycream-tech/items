            <li>I love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>but I love this curler!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for me, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>This is AMAZING</li>
            <li>I would recommend this best for long hair great quality</li>
            <li>very easy to use</li>
            <li>Probably because there were differing size reviews from so many people (2 inches, 1 1/4, 1 inch ..which is it???)  </li>
            <li>will keep my hair curled longer than 10 minutes, so I bought this thinking it would be better for my hair</li>
            <li>I love this curler.</li>
            <li>Bellezza is one of my favorite brands for quality hair tools.</li>
            <li>I love the thickness of the barrel and the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curling wand.  </li>
            <li>The barrel is definitely closer to 1 inch, but perfect for my medium-length hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, it does NOT automatically shut off after a period of time unused, so make sure that you unplug or switch off the wand as soon as you are done.</li>
            <li>It gives perfect curls and I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love it - the size of the barrel is true to the description online.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the product is fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, great lasting curls!</li>
            <li>Who advertises a wand as 2 inches (which is HUGE) and sends you a one inch wand???  </li>
            <li>and it was huge..</li>
            <li>Great for big curls!</li>
            <li>Excellent curler - does not smell, leaves my hair shiny &amp; keeps that beachy curl in my normally STRAIGHT hair all day with minimal product added.  </li>
            <li>I was able to curl my whole head in about 10 - 15 mins.</li>
            <li>The ceramic barrel heats up super quick and never burns my hair.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick &amp; is very hot</li>
            <li>Creates really nice big curls, easy to use, gets super hot fast.</li>
            <li>I bought a Hot Tools true 2 inch wand</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you right now</li>
            <li>I have had several wands before, and this one is hands down the best!</li>
            <li>Curler gets extremely hot even with the glove.  </li>
            <li>This Iron had NO temp control on it and it gets so hot that it fried my hair</li>
            <li>This was the largest wand barrel I could find, and the curls stay pretty well if I have product.  </li>
            <li>This is smaller than my 1-1.5 in wand, doesn&#x27;t give a good curl and probably double the price.</li>
            <li>so this gives me the nice loose, natural looking waves.</li>
            <li>It does not work very well.</li>
            <li>I am a real customer.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend Bellezza products to all you thick-haired ladies out there!</li>
            <li>It heats up so quickly and stays hot the entire time you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>Yes, the other reviews are correct in that it&#x27;s not really a 2&amp;#34; barrel, but it worked great for my purposes...</li>
            <li>Is super frizzy and this curler made it seem like I hoped out of a hair - styling commercial!</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it work perfectly with it and the curls last so long</li>
            <li>I honestly never leave reviews, but I felt compelled to say that this wand is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t laying flat &amp; hot on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>It is about 1 1/4 inches (FAR FROM 2 INCHES).</li>
            <li>only warning is that this product gets EXTREMELY hot, so using the protective glove is necessary.  </li>
            <li>and it barely works.</li>
            <li>Makes pretty curls, but did not last as long as expected.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The curling iron was placed for at least a minute and did not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> , it was too late to return.</li>
            <li> I called my aunt, who is a cosmetologist, and said it might be because its a 2 inch thick barrel.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> unfortunately did not curl my hair at all, but</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always been difficult for me to find a product that would get my hair to hold curls for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> My SO was disappointed and</li>
            <li> , It was extremely annoying.</li>
            <li> I would, my mom bought it for me and by the time she gave it to me, I tried it and hated it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m dense but I, nor my boyfriend, could figure out how to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews that said it was one inch and bought this anyway.  Probably because there were differing size reviews from so many people (2 inches, 1 1/4, 1 inch ..which is it???)  I should have listened!  I&#x27;m telling you right now, THIS IS ONLY 1 INCH.  I should have uploaded a picture, but I held it next to my 1 inch wand and it is the SAME SIZE.  I could have dealt with 1 &amp; 1/4, but it is NOT. It&#x27;s 1 inch I promise you!  Who advertises a wand as 2 inches (which is HUGE) and sends you a one inch wand???  I bought a Hot Tools true 2 inch wand and it was huge.. unfortunately did not curl my hair at all, but that&#x27;s how I know the Bellezza is NOT 2 inches.  I&#x27;m sure the Bellezza works great for a 1 inch, but I have that already.  If you want a great working 1 inch wand, return this overpriced thing and get the 1 inch Bed Head wand. Why spend $50 for a 1 inch?  Ugh, today&#x27;s dishonest world.</li>
            <li> I got this about a week or two ago. It does not work very well. I have always used regular curling irons and nothing will keep my hair curled longer than 10 minutes, so I bought this thinking it would be better for my hair and it barely works. I called my aunt, who is a cosmetologist, and said it might be because its a 2 inch thick barrel. Im sending it back and getting a 1 inch and see how that works.</li>
            <li> Great for big curls! I would recommend this best for long hair great quality</li>
            <li> This wand has been amazing! Each time I use this wand I have beautiful bouncy curls! I am a real customer.</li>
            <li> I love this curler. The ceramic barrel heats up super quick and never burns my hair. Bellezza is one of my favorite brands for quality hair tools. I also have this curler in the 1/2 inch it&#x27;s equally amazing!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great lasting curls!</li>
            <li> The Curling Iron itself did not work on my hair. The curling iron was placed for at least a minute and did not hold a curl. Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
            <li> Is super frizzy and this curler made it seem like I hoped out of a hair - styling commercial! I love the thickness of the barrel and the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Creates really nice big curls, easy to use, gets super hot fast. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I honestly never leave reviews, but I felt compelled to say that this wand is absolutely amazing. I have very thick hair so it&#x27;s always been difficult for me to find a product that would get my hair to hold curls for an extended period of time. I experimented yesterday morning, and curled my hair before work and the curls were still present this morning when I woke up...without using hairspray!!! I would HIGHLY recommend Bellezza products to all you thick-haired ladies out there!</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;You all need to try it because it is awesome and it is the best curling wand ever</li>
            <li> I love it I have thick hair and it work perfectly with it and the curls last so long</li>
            <li> Curler gets extremely hot even with the glove.  Makes pretty curls, but did not last as long as expected. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have had several wands before, and this one is hands down the best! I would recommend buying it. DO IT. you won&#x27;t regret ut</li>
            <li> This is advertised as a 2 inch curling wand. It is NOT 2 inches in width. It is about 1 1/4 inches (FAR FROM 2 INCHES). My SO was disappointed and we are looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is not a 2 inch barrel. About 1 1/4 inches. Otherwise the product is fine.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she could not get her hair to curl with it.  Ended up having to return it.</li>
            <li> Love it - the size of the barrel is true to the description online. I was a little skeptical as others said they received something smaller, but this one was true to size. My hair is long so this gives me the nice loose, natural looking waves. Heats up quick &amp; is very hot so you don&#x27;t need to leave your hair on it too long. I was able to curl my whole head in about 10 - 15 mins. &amp; my hair is down to the small of my back.</li>
            <li> It was for my wife she loved it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling wand.  The barrel is definitely closer to 1 inch, but perfect for my medium-length hair.  I have not noticed any damage/drying and I have used it almost every day for the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only warning is that this product gets EXTREMELY hot, so using the protective glove is necessary.  Also, it does NOT automatically shut off after a period of time unused, so make sure that you unplug or switch off the wand as soon as you are done.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! It heats up so quickly and stays hot the entire time you&#x27;re using it. It gives perfect curls and I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical from the low price but I love this curler! Loose, flowy curls and they last forever!</li>
            <li> Excellent curler - does not smell, leaves my hair shiny &amp; keeps that beachy curl in my normally STRAIGHT hair all day with minimal product added.  Worth every penny.  The only adjustment they could make to this would be a little stand so it isn&#x27;t laying flat &amp; hot on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I would not repurchase. You get the same curls with a regular curling iron. The glove helps, but it&#x27;s not entirely heat-free. You still have to be very careful when using this curling wand.</li>
            <li> This Iron had NO temp control on it and it gets so hot that it fried my hair the one and only time I used it.  I also didn&#x27;t like the cord at the end going off to one side, It was extremely annoying.</li>
            <li> The barrel isn&#x27;t quiet as big as I was expecting, but through pinning and other techniques I can get the big curls I want.  I have long, coarse hair and this makes it look nice and shiny, no frazzled ends with!  This was the largest wand barrel I could find, and the curls stay pretty well if I have product.  Good wand for the price.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for me, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> great product love it!</li>
            <li> If I could give it zero stars I would, my mom bought it for me and by the time she gave it to me, I tried it and hated it, it was too late to return. I Wanted a two inch wand since I already have a 1-1.5in tapered wand, I wanted a bigger curl. This is smaller than my 1-1.5 in wand, doesn&#x27;t give a good curl and probably double the price.</li>
            <li> This works great! Yes, the other reviews are correct in that it&#x27;s not really a 2&amp;#34; barrel, but it worked great for my purposes...I&#x27;d say maybe 1.5&amp;#34; or so.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with it!!</li>
            <li> product as described, works great. very easy to use</li>
    </ol>
