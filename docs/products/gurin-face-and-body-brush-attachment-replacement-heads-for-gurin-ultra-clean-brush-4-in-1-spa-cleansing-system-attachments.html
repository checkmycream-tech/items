            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as good as the ones that came with my brush.</li>
            <li>I have the Dermabrush system and these replacement attachments fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>These work good</li>
            <li>Happy to say they fit!</li>
            <li>It would probably be flawless if I used it consistently.</li>
            <li>Love them all!</li>
            <li>When I get out of the shower, I feel very very clean and exfoliated!</li>
            <li>She says they are great quality and just like the original ones that came with her Dermabrush.</li>
            <li>Combine that with rotation and it might not be the best for folks with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Glad I purchased spares for the brush</li>
            <li>I love having spare parts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m creative,  </li>
            <li>fits a different brand of face &amp; body brush perfectly.</li>
            <li>you :)</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I just received my attachments and am so pleased I plan to order another set.  </li>
            <li>Love my Gurin</li>
            <li>I got the body and face brush, I love it.</li>
            <li>The face brush works great, I have some acne problems and its kept it in check very well.</li>
            <li>Fit my DermaBrush device exactly and price was great.</li>
            <li>Does a wonderful job and doesn&#x27;t ruin when it gets wet.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect, and fit very well; also HIGH QUALITY!</li>
            <li>Kind of a fun way to wash your face.</li>
            <li>Worked fine together</li>
            <li>great to have the extra attachmenta when you lose one</li>
            <li>but i got it thinking it would fit</li>
            <li>It did seem to help smooth the skin.  </li>
            <li>Great extra for the Youthful Advantage cleaning brush</li>
            <li>I bought these replacement brush heads at a good price, ten bucks :).</li>
            <li>It feels good to wash your face with these and afterwards your skin feels really soft.</li>
            <li>Very useful to have.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are soft so aren&#x27;t good to clean a mans face.</li>
            <li>I love that there is a body brush attachment, it cleans really well.</li>
            <li>These fit perfectly, were a good price, and I really like the combination of soft and slightly less soft brushes.</li>
            <li>I would love to see a multi pack of just the facial brush, since that gets the most use from me.</li>
            <li>Due to the brush stimulation, my skin has a nice healthy glow after each cleaning.  </li>
            <li>- I overdid it the first time, and my face was bright pink for about 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>it really gets my face clean and refresh.</li>
            <li>The replacements fit on to the device quite fine and the quality is no different from the ones that came with the starter kit.</li>
            <li>Only wanted the two BRUSHES, but am okay with having to purchase the set of 4.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I cut the time in half (2 minutes) and used less pressure the second time -- really great outcome, just enough exfoliation and skin looked like i just finished a good cardio workout - a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these for my new Dermabrush Advanced Cleansing System and they fit and work the same as the ones that came with it.</li>
            <li>To make sure that I could give an honest review, I continued using the same cleansing and moisturizing regimen that I previously thought wasn&#x27;t working.  </li>
            <li>: I recommend this set if you want soft, clean skin.</li>
            <li>My bf and seven year old thought it was so cool.</li>
            <li>This is a good replacement set, the down side is that I cannot use the face brush because my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast also.</li>
            <li>was really hopeing i could use this</li>
            <li>Very cost-effective.  </li>
            <li>They shipped prime so they arrived fast.</li>
            <li>All I really wanted were the brushes</li>
            <li>Sure, it was cheap, but cheap and useless doesn&#x27;t count for much.</li>
            <li>Perfect--basically identical to the original set, only much cheaper than the official versions.</li>
            <li>I got this set because one of the original pieces I had in a set by a different t brand name broke.</li>
            <li>The sponge is - how to describe - maybe more porous..... diff than a typical makeup sponge.  </li>
            <li>Amost Can&#x27;t Live Without It.  </li>
            <li>While they fit and operate properly, the ones I received are diff from the ones that came with my device and are different than pictured here.  </li>
            <li>my skin is smooth and I typically break out from anything and everything-</li>
            <li>Large brush: I used it to scrub my entire body for one week.  </li>
            <li>They look as though the bristles are about to come out, but so far they have not</li>
            <li>I wish there was a way to order just the facial brush but nevertheless these replacement heads are the real deal</li>
            <li>Low and behold this system made an absolute difference.</li>
            <li>The delivery was on time and the packaging was professionally done.  </li>
            <li>Too soft no exfoliation.</li>
            <li>The facial brush is gentle, yet thorough when cleansing my face, and the body brush helps to get rid of the &amp;#34;ashe&amp;#34; on the skin as it exfoliates.  </li>
            <li>like it so far.</li>
            <li>Overall, I recommend this product, but you should adjust how you use it (mainly pressure and duration) based on your skin&#x27;s sensitivity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough and my facial skin doesn&#x27;t get pulled and tugged, just a thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are convex vs having a flat surface, are shorter, and are a little more stiff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They were far softer than the last brushes I ordered for her and theyv lasted a couple of weeks of once a day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(only used the face attachment so far).</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve used the large brush on my underarm area and noticed that it isn&#x27;t so dark under there.  </li>
            <li>The actual handheld part sounds like its dying even with brand new batteries and just doesn&#x27;t seem to measure up to the other model I have</li>

            <li> The texture is smoother, the dark spots are fading, my pores aren&#x27;t as big and my skin isn&#x27;t as oily.</li>
            <li> used the previous purchase option that Amazon has to reorder the same brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the stone when my feet were wet, but will have it try it when dry.  </li>
            <li> it was what I expected.</li>
            <li> will figure out alternative uses for the other 2 since I can&#x27;t use face makeup</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months</li>
            <li> I like how it removes all of the dead skin all over my body.</li>
            <li> These brushes were a complete disappointment to my wife.</li>
            <li> Usually you have to buy each one separate.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the really expensive brand for comparison.  </li>
            <li> And if she is disappointed then I am in also disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :( dang it.</li>

            <li> I bought these as replacements for my spa sonic skin care device. Perfect--basically identical to the original set, only much cheaper than the official versions. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> These brushes were a complete disappointment to my wife. And if she is disappointed then I am in also disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these brushes before and she loved them. They were not too rough and not too soft. They also lasted over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the previous purchase option that Amazon has to reorder the same brushes.  These were not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were far softer than the last brushes I ordered for her and theyv lasted a couple of weeks of once a day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it was not a quality product we received.</li>
            <li> Fit my DermaBrush device exactly and price was great.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my Gurin face and body brush!</li>
            <li> Works well with my device!</li>
            <li> I love it!! It works great!!</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft so aren&#x27;t good to clean a mans face.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased spares for the brush</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, great product!  :D</li>
            <li> great to have the extra attachmenta when you lose one</li>
            <li> I love having spare parts.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the really expensive brand for comparison.  I bought these to go with a reasonably-priced, non-Gurin device.  While they fit and operate properly, the ones I received are diff from the ones that came with my device and are different than pictured here.  I guess it&#x27;s just a matter of preference.  The bristles are convex vs having a flat surface, are shorter, and are a little more stiff.  Combine that with rotation and it might not be the best for folks with sensitive skin.  The sponge is - how to describe - maybe more porous..... diff than a typical makeup sponge.  Imho, these are a bit &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  They look as though the bristles are about to come out, but so far they have not and they are about half the cost of other brands.  So, since you can go through a few of these and several devices for the same price as one of the really expensive brands, I feel it&#x27;s a good place to start and to see what you like.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with the Vitagoods Spin for Perfect Skin, and a fraction of the cost of their replacement brushes. The Gurin brushes are great quality! I will definitely be purchasing this product again. I would love to see a multi pack of just the facial brush, since that gets the most use from me.</li>
            <li> I could never travel without this!</li>
            <li> This is a good replacement set, the down side is that I cannot use the face brush because my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to order just the facial brush but nevertheless these replacement heads are the real deal</li>
            <li> I use the face sized brush morning and night.  It&#x27;s gentle enough and my facial skin doesn&#x27;t get pulled and tugged, just a thorough cleaning.  I am prone to acne, and this product has helped reduce flare ups.  Due to the brush stimulation, my skin has a nice healthy glow after each cleaning.  I&#x27;ve used the sponge attachment twice with micro-dermabrasion crystals for extra exfoliation - I overdid it the first time, and my face was bright pink for about 24 hours.  I cut the time in half (2 minutes) and used less pressure the second time -- really great outcome, just enough exfoliation and skin looked like i just finished a good cardio workout - a healthy glow.  I always finish by dipping the brush or sponge in alcohol to disinfect it for next use.  Overall, I recommend this product, but you should adjust how you use it (mainly pressure and duration) based on your skin&#x27;s sensitivity.</li>
            <li> They are perfect, and fit very well; also HIGH QUALITY! Amost Can&#x27;t Live Without It.  Only wanted the two BRUSHES, but am okay with having to purchase the set of 4. I&#x27;m creative,  will figure out alternative uses for the other 2 since I can&#x27;t use face makeup and I use &amp;#34;The Egg&amp;#34; for feet...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months and I&#x27;ve truly seen a difference in my skin.  The texture is smoother, the dark spots are fading, my pores aren&#x27;t as big and my skin isn&#x27;t as oily. To make sure that I could give an honest review, I continued using the same cleansing and moisturizing regimen that I previously thought wasn&#x27;t working.  Low and behold this system made an absolute difference. Also, I&#x27;ve used the large brush on my underarm area and noticed that it isn&#x27;t so dark under there.  It would probably be flawless if I used it consistently.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this pack of brushes twice now for my grandmothers Dermabrush. She says they are great quality and just like the original ones that came with her Dermabrush. A lot cheaper as well. I will be ordering these again in the future. Delivery was fast also.</li>
            <li> fits a different brand of face &amp; body brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> You get all four in one box. I was surprise by this find. Usually you have to buy each one separate. So its a good deal for a box of four!&lt;br /&gt;thank you :)</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time and the packaging was professionally done.  The replacements fit on to the device quite fine and the quality is no different from the ones that came with the starter kit. I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Great to order replacements in a set. Very useful to have.  Great delivery time. Best Christmas gift for the girl who has everything.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Good price.</li>
            <li> this is very nice but i got it thinking it would fit my olay pro x nope....:( dang it. was really hopeing i could use this</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as the ones that came with my brush. Too soft no exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I just received my attachments and am so pleased I plan to order another set.  I have the Dermabrush system and these replacement attachments fit perfectly.  Very cost-effective.  The facial brush is gentle, yet thorough when cleansing my face, and the body brush helps to get rid of the &amp;#34;ashe&amp;#34; on the skin as it exfoliates.  I&#x27;ve used the stone when my feet were wet, but will have it try it when dry.  It did seem to help smooth the skin.  I have not used the foam attachment.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement brush heads at a good price, ten bucks :). They shipped prime so they arrived fast. I was worried they might not work on my spin brush. Mines by Acnefree not Gurin. Happy to say they fit! All I really wanted were the brushes but I found this to be the best deal and all the pieces are great.  The big brush is about the size of my palm.  My bf and seven year old thought it was so cool. They want a set for themselves d: I recommend this set if you want soft, clean skin. It feels good to wash your face with these and afterwards your skin feels really soft. Kind of a fun way to wash your face.</li>
            <li> These work good so I can have a set and my daughter can have a set. I like them all.</li>
            <li> This works great- my skin is smooth and I typically break out from anything and everything- but not this kit!</li>
            <li> I got this set because one of the original pieces I had in a set by a different t brand name broke. These fit perfectly, were a good price, and I really like the combination of soft and slightly less soft brushes.</li>
            <li> Great price and works great with my Dermabrush</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d just be getting the heads, that&#x27;s all I wanted and that&#x27;s what the product description said it would be.  They sent the entire system.  The actual handheld part sounds like its dying even with brand new batteries and just doesn&#x27;t seem to measure up to the other model I have (they&#x27;re the same knock-off face brush).  Sure, it was cheap, but cheap and useless doesn&#x27;t count for much.</li>
            <li> Love my Gurin it really gets my face clean and refresh. I have notice a difference in my skin and complexion.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my new Dermabrush Advanced Cleansing System and they fit and work the same as the ones that came with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Great extra for the Youthful Advantage cleaning brush</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase it was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Large brush: I used it to scrub my entire body for one week.  My skin feel so soft and remove dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;Small brush:  I used it w/Clinique 7 day scrub cream......helps my skin smoother and lighten some of my brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;Sponge: Used it to apply my moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Pumice:  after shower,  I used it to scrub my feet.  Love them all!</li>
            <li> The face brush is awesome.  Does a wonderful job and doesn&#x27;t ruin when it gets wet.  Like all the different attachments for whatever your need is.  Great quality too!</li>
            <li> I bought this set to use with my Derma  Brush. Worked fine together (only used the face attachment so far).</li>
            <li> I got the body and face brush, I love it. The face brush works great, I have some acne problems and its kept it in check very well. I love that there is a body brush attachment, it cleans really well. When I get out of the shower, I feel very very clean and exfoliated! The foot attachment is nice too!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I like how it removes all of the dead skin all over my body.</li>
            <li> like it so far. it serve the purpose</li>
