            <li>Many thanks...</li>
            <li>Price was good for the size advertised, but what I received was a slightly smaller bar than advertised.  </li>
            <li>Seriously the best soap on earth.</li>
            <li>as described arrived quickly</li>
            <li>it lathers good and gets u clean and dosent leave a residue it does leave u dry</li>
            <li>To Amazon&#x27;s credit, they quickly offered an adjustment or a refund.</li>
            <li>I suppose Irish Spring must be nice, or relates a good impression in potential buyers.  </li>
            <li>I loved the smell of Irish Spring, the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>so I feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Lathers well, smells good and lasts pretty long.</li>

            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of Irish Spring.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Irish Spring.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty much user error either way.  </li>
            <li>I can get exactly what I want at a reasonable price without fighting through the hoards of people.  </li>
            <li>Great deal to get this on Amazon as it&#x27;s usually slightly cheaper than in local stores plus no tax (for now)!</li>
            <li>I step out of the shower feeling super clean, and the soap also doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>Are you really reading reviews for soap?</li>
            <li>The fragrance is too much when the pack arrives - too much to overwhelm your senses.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>really like this soap and used it all the time, but I had to stop</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND REALLY LOVES THE ORIGINAL SCENT IRISH SPRING DEODERANT SOAP.</li>
            <li>The deer do not like the smell of Irish Spring original.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is great and the bar last long enough.</li>
            <li>If only that user would clean it up himself.</li>
            <li>My husband is a fireman and this is the only soap he will use to get really clean.  </li>
            <li>It turns out those Irish Spring commercials were right.  </li>
            <li>Stopped doing the subscribe and save due to price and lack of available products to achieve discount.</li>
            <li>A deodorant soap is essential in the hot summers in the desert.  </li>
            <li>We like Irish Spring Bath Bar Soap, and the 12-Count  of the Irish Spring Bath Bar Soap, in the Original, 3.75 oz.</li>
            <li>My man is Irish Clean with Irish Spring!</li>
            <li>Black soap lathers a whole lot and leaves me very dry (maybe even more than this).</li>
            <li>this is a classic and a necessary household staple.  </li>
            <li>i use this soap as a female (use different kinds) but every time i use this particular soap my bf goes crazy lol idk i guess he loves the smell</li>
            <li>It is a little puzzling because it does not lather very well if at all.</li>

            <li> It is a little puzzling because it does not lather very well if at all.</li>
            <li> HAS A MASCULINE ODER + IS EXTREMELY DRYING.</li>
            <li> It will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The bars last a long time if you let them fully dry after each use.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a little harsh on hands, especially if you used to gentle soaps with mosturizers.</li>
            <li> He uses it for his face only, will not use any other brand if I buy it.</li>
            <li> I checked the price at Walmart and it was either the same or less.  </li>
            <li> Ivory lathers and leaves me less dry.</li>
            <li> my husband will not try any other bar soap.</li>
            <li> it was packed very carefully.</li>
            <li> This has kept the deer from destroying my trees during rutting season and from eating them at other times.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my husband goes through about a bar a week, and it leaves a green goo on the shower deck if he misses the soapdish.  </li>
            <li> I cut these bars in half then drill a hole in through the side.  </li>
            <li> Also if you&#x27;re black</li>
            <li> I hang it in my garden in little pouches.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> You should not have to filled this stupid box out.  </li>
            <li> I like the green color</li>
            <li> It only happens with this soap, sadly.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with a proven brand like Irish Spring?  </li>
            <li> Thanks in advance for removing this stupid and senseless requirements!</li>
            <li> , I hate that you need to put a specific number of words on these reviews...</li>
            <li> I also always had that highly annoying sensation of itchiness in my sinuses while using it...</li>
            <li> I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> I HATE lotion soaps like dove that make you feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I hate to run out of essentials like this!</li>
            <li> If i want lotion I will use lotion, keep that crap out of my soap!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the richness of the lather,  will not use anything else  and it is great having it on my subscribe and save</li>
            <li> this is a classic and a necessary household staple.  I even used one bar to make 10 gallons of diy laundry soap from pinterest; works well....</li>
            <li> What can I say about Irish Spring?  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my husband&#x27;s skin.  My only complaint is that my husband goes through about a bar a week, and it leaves a green goo on the shower deck if he misses the soapdish.  I don&#x27;t know if all soap does that, but it&#x27;s pretty much user error either way.  If only that user would clean it up himself.</li>
            <li> I use this soap in the bathroom when I am taking a shower. Are you really reading reviews for soap? I guess I can&#x27;t judge since I am writing reviews.</li>
            <li> as described arrived quickly</li>
            <li> It turns out those Irish Spring commercials were right.  The man says he loves the scent and the lady says, &amp;#34;and I like it too!&amp;#34;  Of course, I don&#x27;t know if she is saying that she likes the scent on HIM or if she likes it for HERSELF...but in any case, I&#x27;m a lady and I do like it.  A deodorant soap is essential in the hot summers in the desert.  The fact that it smells like an herb garden is a plus.  I will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been to Ireland and don&#x27;t plan to ever go so this is as close as I&#x27;ll ever get.  And it makes my skin real clean too</li>
            <li> I love the smell and most importantly, it gets me clean.  Great gift for any filthy person you may know.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best soap on earth. I&#x27;ve used this all my life and $9 for 12 bars is a good deal. This soap smells so good and the scent lasts all day. Even makes the entire bathroom smell good from the boxes sitting on the shelf.</li>
            <li> My husband is a fireman and this is the only soap he will use to get really clean.  He&#x27;s used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is the only bath bar we use--&amp; I always like having a stocked cupboard. Between home &amp; our cabin, this means I never have to worry about running low.</li>
            <li> good quality! perfectly works!&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive and fulfilled satisfaction!&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time with no damages!&lt;br /&gt;good to recommend!&lt;br /&gt;No worry!&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy another one when I get chance to...</li>
            <li> I have been using Irish Spring-Deodorant Soap for over a decade. Great soap! It cleans and deodorizes me so I feel fresh.</li>
            <li> It is a regular soap. Nothing special abt it. I found it to be a little harsh on hands, especially if you used to gentle soaps with mosturizers. The fragrance is too much when the pack arrives - too much to overwhelm your senses. Once opened, it disappears fully.</li>
            <li> It keeps the deer away. I hang it in my garden in little pouches. The deer do not like the smell of Irish Spring original. It seems to keep them away.</li>
            <li> What can I say. Good cheap soap, lathers well, no deodorant or feeling of soap film on my skin. I will say it goes very quick, but at this price, comparable to Walgreens, can not complain.</li>
            <li> By far the best smelling bar soap.  I enjoy using it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Good soap, good good clean, I hate that you need to put a specific number of words on these reviews...</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of Irish Spring, the first time I used it. And I have been loving it ever since then. The smell reminds me of the embracing refreshing feeling our nature has to offer. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap so I buy it for him. That is good enough for me. I like it, but for me I use something more girly :-)</li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell of Irish Spring.  It&#x27;s a manly smell and not overpowering, though since I&#x27;ve been using this I find myself wearing a kilt and a beard more often.</li>
            <li> &amp;szlig;&amp;szlig;&amp;szlig;&amp;szlig;&amp;szlig;&amp;szlig;&amp;szlig;&amp;szlig;perfect! Many thanks...</li>
            <li> Irishy! Springy! Soapy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff hurts your eyes! And odor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dirt, too.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed receiving this package. The package was well derived on date. Great!!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price, would be nice if it returned to the subscribe &amp; save store though !</li>
            <li> The fragrance is great and the bar last long enough. In my opinion this is the best soap you can find in his class.</li>
            <li> CAN ANYONE TELL ME what ingredient in the soap could possibly make me so runny nosed and sneezy? It only happens with this soap, sadly. ...ok review below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this soap and used it all the time, but I had to stop, I couldn&#x27;t stand having all the boogers! I was constantly sneezing and  had to blow my nose. I don&#x27;t know what ingredient in the soap causes my allergy. I also always had that highly annoying sensation of itchiness in my sinuses while using it... I wonder what it is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if I weren&#x27;t allergic, hell yeah I would continue using it. it didn&#x27;t affect my skin. only nose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good soap. it has a nice fresh scent , but it&#x27;s not overpowering. it cleans well with no residue. good product.</li>
            <li> Obviously Irish Spring soap has been around for years.  It serves its purpose as a standard body soap.  I would not use this product on my face.  I ordered it from Amazon, and it saved me from making a trip to the store.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> this item arrived in perfect condition. it was packed very carefully. I live in Alaska and it comes a long way to me and it was in perfect condition</li>
            <li> You should not have to filled this stupid box out.  Thanks in advance for removing this stupid and senseless requirements!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap since I can remember.  I have tried others but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> We like Irish Spring Bath Bar Soap, and the 12-Count  of the Irish Spring Bath Bar Soap, in the Original, 3.75 oz. Bars for this price is a fantastic money saver.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but it does the job for what I buy it for.  I cut these bars in half then drill a hole in through the side.  I then loop a string through the hole and tie one on each of my trees.  This has kept the deer from destroying my trees during rutting season and from eating them at other times.  It will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I love delivery! This mega pack of soap will last some time. I hate to run out of essentials like this! Love the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; scent!</li>
            <li> I love buying in bulk and this is the perfect way to buy them.  My man is Irish Clean with Irish Spring!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Irish Spring. Great soap. Also, I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get mushy in the shower holder - it holds it shape great.</li>
            <li> Original Irish spring is a great soap. Lathers well, smells good, no residues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this 12 pack at Costco, but they stopped carrying it in my area, so now I get it from Amazon. This box lasts me about three years though, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it all that often.</li>
            <li> i use this soap as a female (use different kinds) but every time i use this particular soap my bf goes crazy lol idk i guess he loves the smell lol it lathers good and gets u clean and dosent leave a residue it does leave u dry but i use a body moisturizer anyway</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I buy via the Internet is to keep me out of the brick and mortar mega-mart retail stores.  I can get exactly what I want at a reasonable price without fighting through the hoards of people.  This is a great buy and provides me with a product that I know and trust. How can you go wrong with a proven brand like Irish Spring?  &amp;#34;Made for a man...but I like it too!&amp;#34; Lol!</li>
            <li> And on Amazon, it has a good price and ships for free if you are on Prime.  I suppose Irish Spring must be nice, or relates a good impression in potential buyers.  For all I know, an Irish Spring is like winter.  They paid a naming agency a lot of money for this one.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND REALLY LOVES THE ORIGINAL SCENT IRISH SPRING DEODERANT SOAP. ITS THE ONLY SOAP HE&#x27;LL USE. BUT I WOULDNT TOUCH IT. HAS A MASCULINE ODER + IS EXTREMELY DRYING. HAVING SAID THAT, IT GETS 5 STARS 4 QUICK DELIVERY, ARRIVING IN PRISTINE CONDITION AT A PRETTY GOOD PRICE + MAKES MY HUSBAND HAPPY.</li>
            <li> Soap is fine.  Price was good for the size advertised, but what I received was a slightly smaller bar than advertised.  To Amazon&#x27;s credit, they quickly offered an adjustment or a refund.</li>
            <li> This is one of several soaps my family will use. It is pleasent smelling and when you get it online, it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not the driest Ive used its still among the driest.. It is a little puzzling because it does not lather very well if at all. Ivory lathers and leaves me less dry. Black soap lathers a whole lot and leaves me very dry (maybe even more than this). This product should come with a disclaimer saying that you need baby oil and lotion. Also if you&#x27;re black I don&#x27;t recommend you ever use this soap- it will leave you with ashy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I hate the smell. Its called a \\&quot;deodorant soap\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t want to smell like powdered Tide laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> Good scent for most men. I step out of the shower feeling super clean, and the soap also doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry in the winter. The bars last a long time if you let them fully dry after each use. Great deal to get this on Amazon as it&#x27;s usually slightly cheaper than in local stores plus no tax (for now)!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Irish Spring.  I HATE lotion soaps like dove that make you feel greasy.  If you don&#x27;t like feeling greasy, Irish Spring is for you.  If i want lotion I will use lotion, keep that crap out of my soap!</li>
            <li> Has a great fresh smell! Makes me fell clean all over! I like the green color it goes with my bathroom.</li>
            <li> If you perspire a lot, this is the soap to buy, it works without breaking the bank and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> EXactly what I wanted for shower use and the make of soap that I have been using for many years</li>
            <li> Lathers well, smells good and lasts pretty long. I buy this over and over again and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I checked the price at Walmart and it was either the same or less.  Now I won&#x27;t have to think about my sons body soap for over a year....THAT&#x27;S A GOOD THING!  And the bonus was it has free S&amp;H!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product it beats our soaps here in Australia and so foaming rich when washing or showing lovely smell lingers on you body would recomend people try it out.</li>
            <li> my husband will not try any other bar soap. He uses it for his face only, will not use any other brand if I buy it. For some reason, this kind only helps keep breakouts away. I do not know if it a specific ingredient but, I would have to assume so. Plus- I have always loved the scent of the original!</li>
            <li> The soap is exactly what I was wanting, and it was perfectly priced.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the deal I got.</li>
            <li> Stopped doing the subscribe and save due to price and lack of available products to achieve discount.</li>
