            <li>Such a good buy!!  </li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>I thought that these would be really good because of the reviews, but they really aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Smears and comes off too easy.</li>
            <li>They go on smooth and don&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>The pencils are glide so smoothly on my skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth aplication.</li>
            <li>They go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth</li>
            <li>Smooth glide on.</li>
            <li>very nice and smooth, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Love them, glide on easy application, colours are vivid and smooth.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and very smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>Great colors, soft application (not those hard waxy kind of pencils), and it lasts!  </li>
            <li>Not quite as good as Ofra, Urban Decay, or Stila, but they go on smoothly, don&#x27;t smudge (I use eye and lip primer though), and last most of the day.</li>
            <li>If you like to experiment with fun eye makeup, these pencils are for you.</li>
            <li>You would think such inexpensive eyeliners wouldn&#x27;t be too nice</li>
            <li>Smooth and the colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li>I like the colors, they are soft and easy to smudge</li>
            <li>They shipped fast too!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>But it does not last for more than 5 hours for me and also not smudge proof.</li>
            <li>Nice, but white is pictured and did not get white which is why I bought this in the first place.</li>
            <li>Did they really ask me for a review.</li>
            <li>So yah for amazon, and not so much for misleading picture.</li>
            <li>Other colors are okay.</li>
            <li>Better than any other eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>but I use black the most</li>
            <li>These vibrant colors make my brown eyes pop</li>
            <li>The colours are vibrant and aside from the black one, they do not leak or smudge :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The colors go on smooth and stay all day, and they are very long which means they will last for a long time through many sharpenings.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that is physically correctable, but otherwise these are such a great value.</li>
            <li>These go on very soft but they stay in place.</li>
            <li>otherwise it does transfer to my upper eyelid during the day, but the powder prevents that pretty well.  </li>
            <li>That is pretty much what I expected.</li>
            <li>a little too smooth.</li>
            <li>Soft lead an</li>
            <li>They are so soft and under-pressed that even the lightest application will cause them to crumble and break of.</li>
            <li>I usually finish it with a light coat of translucent powder</li>
            <li>The get dull very quickly</li>
            <li>A little trick to sharpen but over all I really like them.</li>

            <li> I do find after applying that they do tend to smear a little bit; but not excessively.</li>
            <li> would definitely buy again, only down side was that i did not get the same colors listed, i still got 12 though</li>
            <li> I am even afraid to use it because of the strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the downside of the soft application is the volume of waste when sharpening.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that the set I received would have atleast 1 black eyeliner, but it had 2 brown ones, kind of disappointed..</li>
            <li> for the first 15 minutes, then they run and smear like crazy.</li>
            <li> I smudge a little after I apply</li>
            <li> Said to myself that maybe it is one of those things shown on 20/20 in which people mix harsh chemicals to make makeup products for money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few sets now as gifts and to collect every color.  </li>
            <li> I have olive colored skin so its hard to find eyeliner pencils that are a lighter shade that will show up on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Two came broken.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst set of pencils I have ever bought.</li>

            <li> These pencils are wonderful! They go on smooth and don&#x27;t smear. Great variety of colors. Phenomenal price! Get them while you can!</li>
            <li> She loves them! She loves the colors. Next time I&#x27;ll have to order the 25 CT set.</li>
            <li> The get dull very quickly but they look beautiful&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> LOOOOVE these eyeliners.  They go on nice and smoothly without any irritation.  Stays put all day.  I smudge a little after I apply and I do not get any smudges during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the variety of colors too.</li>
            <li> Wanted a softer gold color than came with the group.  Other colors are okay.</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliner pencils. I have olive colored skin so its hard to find eyeliner pencils that are a lighter shade that will show up on my skin tone. These vibrant colors make my brown eyes pop and i only need to fix it once during the day. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, the colors are bright and easy to apply.  I usually finish it with a light coat of translucent powder otherwise it does transfer to my upper eyelid during the day, but the powder prevents that pretty well.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Must have. Soft lead an they can b sharpened</li>
            <li> Awesome,colors are great...</li>

            <li> These are fantastic. The pencils are glide so smoothly on my skin. I truly love these. I&#x27;d recommend them for sure!</li>
            <li> Great colors and goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner texture is great and pigmented. Value for the money. But it does not last for more than 5 hours for me and also not smudge proof.</li>
            <li> I thought that these would be really good because of the reviews, but they really aren&#x27;t. Two came broken. The coloring is nice.... for the first 15 minutes, then they run and smear like crazy. Even using primer doesn&#x27;t keep them in place. They are so soft and under-pressed that even the lightest application will cause them to crumble and break of. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good price, good colours, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Great colors. Smooth aplication. A little trick to sharpen but over all I really like them.</li>
            <li> Second time buying this product. They go on so smoothly. Every color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> My goodness. Did they really ask me for a review. This is the worst set of pencils I have ever bought. It smells like chemicals. I am even afraid to use it because of the strong chemical smell. Never seen a pencil smell like this. Said to myself that maybe it is one of those things shown on 20/20 in which people mix harsh chemicals to make makeup products for money. Please don&#x27;t buy...</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price. See swatches here: http://www.primadonna-style.com/2014/06/quick-pick-italia-deluxe-ultra-fine.html</li>
            <li> Nice, but white is pictured and did not get white which is why I bought this in the first place. Amazon was great and issued a credit for it. So yah for amazon, and not so much for misleading picture.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick, great colors, goes on smooth. Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy..vibrant colors</li>
            <li> very nice and smooth, especially for the price. would definitely buy again, only down side was that i did not get the same colors listed, i still got 12 though</li>
            <li> Great colors, soft application (not those hard waxy kind of pencils), and it lasts!  If you like to blend, the control and consistency with the variety of shades makes these wonderful to use.  Only complaint is the downside of the soft application is the volume of waste when sharpening.  Not sure if that is physically correctable, but otherwise these are such a great value.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> You would think such inexpensive eyeliners wouldn&#x27;t be too nice but these are amazing.  Very pigmented, sharpen well, great colors.  Such a good buy!!  I&#x27;ve bought a few sets now as gifts and to collect every color.  Better than any other eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product</li>
            <li> a little too smooth. Smears and comes off too easy.</li>
            <li> Awesome I love these!! Smooth and the colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the set I received would have atleast 1 black eyeliner, but it had 2 brown ones, kind of disappointed.. It goes on smooth but I use black the most and that was not there, feel like that was not what was shown in the picture...Hence the 3 stars</li>
            <li> These are great; love the colors!  I do find after applying that they do tend to smear a little bit; but not excessively.</li>
            <li> Very smooth! Much better than the expensive brands. I&#x27;m going to buy more!</li>
            <li> Smooth glide on. Awesome!</li>
            <li> These are amazing! Very pigmented and very smooth to apply. Best liners I&#x27;ve ever bought. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love these eyeliners! The colours are vibrant and aside from the black one, they do not leak or smudge :)</li>
            <li> I have two collections of these, and for the price you&#x27;d think they were some Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild quality, but no. Not quite as good as Ofra, Urban Decay, or Stila, but they go on smoothly, don&#x27;t smudge (I use eye and lip primer though), and last most of the day.</li>
