            <li>I love OPI nail polish and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>but I may try layering it between the bottom and top coats of gel and see how it works.</li>

            <li>My all time favorite colour.</li>
            <li>Love this brand of polish.</li>
            <li>Love the neutral color of this polish.</li>
            <li>I think is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely neutral tone and matches everything.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite color.</li>
            <li>Love Opi, color is ok looks better on the picture</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, I use OPI nail polish a lot, love this shade, will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it lasts longer than most polish.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love OPI?</li>
            <li>I do love the color, Dulce de Lece.</li>
            <li>but I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>You can add more than one coat if you&#x27;d like but you don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>It has a very rich hue against my complexion and application was evenly distributed on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Very clean looking and put together.</li>
            <li>This polish is pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 bottles and they arrived quickly and packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li>I goes on smoothly and lasts for over a week without chips if you use a good fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t do a spectacular manicure - the polish was all over my cuticles and covered more area than I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you compare your old stuff to the OPI, I&#x27;.m sure that you won&#x27;t want to bother with the crummy polish, and you&#x27;ll be adding as many gorgeous colors from their seemingly unending range of color.f, but it&#x27;s going to take some time</li>
            <li>When you compare your old stuff to the OPI, I&#x27;.m sure that you won&#x27;t want to bother with the crummy polish, and you&#x27;ll be adding as many gorgeous colors from their seemingly unending range of color.</li>
            <li>Great professional, almost nude color.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>This polish chips to easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just an OK color--nothing special.</li>
            <li>Very glad I purchased, thinking about ordering another one because I don&#x27;t want to run out, shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>This just made me more cognizant of how much polish I had to use the next time, and now my nails come out perfectly and evenly.</li>
            <li>it looks super cute</li>
            <li>The lacquer itself is rich, creamy, and applies easily.</li>
            <li>Love love love this natural looking color.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Just did not go on smoothly at all for me.</li>
            <li>However put it on and proceeded to be amazed and strutted all over the house staring and appreciating the color and how it works with a light skin tone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li>pretty shade of polish--arrived in good shape and was exactly as described..</li>
            <li>It definitely takes two coats and a top coat to get good coverage and shine.</li>
            <li>Great color, soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>Opi is my favorite brand of nail polish and this color is so pretty.</li>
            <li>The color is very nice, but compared to the Sally Hansen line it looks much cheaper and harder to do your own nails...</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and extremely nice for shorter nails.  </li>
            <li>This is a very pretty color and goes on smoothly however  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the 6th day of my manicure, and with just slight touchups, it still looks good!</li>
            <li>Shining enough without sparkling and good quality.</li>
            <li>Just kind of classy and neutral.</li>
            <li>Color is true to the picture.</li>
            <li>A good solid color with no streaking and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan well and generally avoid sun exposure at my age anyway, but the combination looks great on my hands, and I think it would look very good on someone who does tan, or who is naturally darker year round.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty pinkish color.</li>
            <li>This is such a pretty color against my skin tone I am brown skinned about Jennifer Hudson&#x27;s complexion, like everyone else says this color would go good with every shade.</li>
            <li>Pretty!  </li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the swap in the picture!</li>
            <li>Love this natural color.</li>
            <li>I love the natural color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first appeared a bit more pink, but now appears more nude.</li>
            <li>This has just the right shine and color for summertime.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a south asian with dark neutral skin tone, and it turns out perfect.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford a clean sweep, as much as I&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>-- I can&#x27;t afford a clean sweep, as much as I&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The really nice thing is, it is hard to see mistakes because it blends with skin better then a bolder color.</li>
            <li>Looks very much like the picture.  </li>
            <li>The first time I wore it, although I loved it, a couple of the nails came out a little streaky.</li>
            <li>All occasion pretty and feminine and groomed.</li>
            <li>Love this color basic goes with everything</li>
            <li>and it does not last more than three days before it begins to chip off.</li>
            <li>(prying off the paint can top with screwdriver was the actual cause of the chip, I think).  </li>
            <li>these are of much higher quality than the crummy ones I was using.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like anything over flashy for my nails and this colour is perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this sophisticated soft pink.</li>
            <li>Kind a pink with chocolate</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package I was bummed...</li>
            <li>This is first time I have ever used OPI fingernail polish</li>
            <li>I thought it wouldn&#x27;t look good on my pale skin</li>
            <li>I am a light skinned black women and I love how this polish looks on my nails.</li>
            <li>Perfect for work, and it&#x27;s so natural that even if it chips, it&#x27;s not super obvious and you can add another coat to fix it up.</li>
            <li>I love it because you can wear it everyday or for a special occasion</li>
            <li>I was thrilled for the extra two to four days without chips, scratches or peeling polish, even though I made an apple pies and generally abused my hands.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty natural color.  </li>
            <li>It is a tad bit darker than it looks in the photo, but still very pretty and classy looking.</li>
            <li>This color is classic!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this polish.</li>
            <li>The color is much brighter.</li>
            <li>Very close to the color in the picture.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I was freaked to discover that it cost as much as it did, which was about six times as much as some of the polish</li>
            <li>the OPI polishes a try by doing three or four manicures with them, and see if you like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li>the OPI polishes a try by doing three or four manicures with them, and see if you like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li>it really goes with everything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very flattering neutral shade that doesn&#x27;t show chips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not mauve but more of a pink beige shade.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>First of all, you&#x27;ll notice that the brush is much wider and flatter than the normal.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is somewhere between fair and medium, at least at this time of year, with a rose-peach undertone.  </li>
            <li>I finished my manicure, I was shocked to discover that the polish stayed perfect for a minimum of five days, which is a first for me.</li>
            <li>A neutral color, goes on smoothly, lasts a long time</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve never tried an OPI polish before, they are different than most inexpensive nail polishes, and your manicure will be a very different experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe this color, but it&#x27;s a medium peach-beige which should look pretty good on a lot of different skin tones.  </li>
            <li>For the first couple of days I wore just the Dulce, then added a light coat or two of the \\&quot;Bond/World\\&quot; color for a little variety.  </li>
            <li>I am rating this product so highly because I love the pink/beige color--very toned down, natural, and yet not translucent.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I would spend this much on nail polish, but since I get professional pedicures, I figured, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel in a &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; mood; not too happy not to sad, so I wanted something that would show that.</li>
            <li>so far it is wearing very well.</li>
            <li>It would be fun to see what combinations others try with this relatively neutral polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft pinkish color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half Indian and half white and this colour is a beautiful neutral colour.</li>
            <li>I have a dark skin tone and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>It looks great by itself, but I (K. Lockwood) actually wanted to experiment with this as a base to my favorite OPI color from the Bond series, \\&quot;The World is Not Enough\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>OPI is long wearing and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the magic in the brushes, but I wound up buying OPI Natural Nail Base Coat &amp; Top Coat COMBO FULL SIZE .5 and OPI Dulce De Leche after I got a professional pedicure with Opi</li>
            <li>I love neutral polishes because they make my short stubby fingers look much less sausage like.</li>
            <li>Peachy natural shade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to replace my old polish with this stuff, but it&#x27;s going to take some time --</li>
            <li>Once you get used to them, give yourself a manicure with your old, &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; polish.  </li>
            <li>Once you get used to them, give yourself a manicure with your old, &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; polish.  </li>
            <li>Anyone seeking a good polish for everyday use should consider this, since it is difficult to imagine many clothing colors incompatible with it, and since its natural color tends to make any chipping less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I always use an undercoat and a top coat, so I do have the protection and the color will last at least a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the polish many times since then, as well as a few other OPI colors, and it wasn&#x27;t a flue:  </li>
            <li>Good color for nails that you want to look decent despite how bad they are.</li>
            <li>The bottom of the bottle for the latter is marked HL D18.  </li>
            <li>Love you nails are thin and flexible so polish tends to chip in a day or two.</li>
            <li>Even professional manicures last only two - three days on me before I have to remove the polish and go clear until it&#x27;s time for the next manicure.</li>
            <li>Also, it is my first manicure with OPI polishes, which are a whole lot more expensive than the $1.49 ones I usually grab on sale at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li>Pretty color, just a little darker than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>The polish seems to glide off the wide brush and onto your nail, and the polish itself seems smoother than normal.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t chip off right away like the less expensive brands.</li>

            <li> Love the color.  </li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> but I may try layering it between the bottom and top coats of gel and see how it works.</li>
            <li> Love the color.  </li>
            <li> It is okay</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> Omg i love this color</li>
            <li> My all time favorite colour.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of polish.</li>
            <li> Love the neutral color of this polish.</li>
            <li> I think is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely neutral tone and matches everything.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite color.</li>
            <li> Love Opi, color is ok looks better on the picture</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, I use OPI nail polish a lot, love this shade, will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I love the color and it lasts longer than most polish.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love OPI?</li>
            <li> I do love the color, Dulce de Lece.</li>
            <li> but I love the color.</li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> You can add more than one coat if you&#x27;d like but you don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> It has a very rich hue against my complexion and application was evenly distributed on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Very clean looking and put together.</li>
            <li> This polish is pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 bottles and they arrived quickly and packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li> I goes on smoothly and lasts for over a week without chips if you use a good fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t do a spectacular manicure - the polish was all over my cuticles and covered more area than I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you compare your old stuff to the OPI, I&#x27;.m sure that you won&#x27;t want to bother with the crummy polish, and you&#x27;ll be adding as many gorgeous colors from their seemingly unending range of color.f, but it&#x27;s going to take some time</li>
            <li> When you compare your old stuff to the OPI, I&#x27;.m sure that you won&#x27;t want to bother with the crummy polish, and you&#x27;ll be adding as many gorgeous colors from their seemingly unending range of color.</li>
            <li> Great professional, almost nude color.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> This polish chips to easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an OK color--nothing special.</li>
            <li> Very glad I purchased, thinking about ordering another one because I don&#x27;t want to run out, shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This just made me more cognizant of how much polish I had to use the next time, and now my nails come out perfectly and evenly.</li>
            <li> it looks super cute</li>
            <li> The lacquer itself is rich, creamy, and applies easily.</li>
            <li> Love love love this natural looking color.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Just did not go on smoothly at all for me.</li>
            <li> However put it on and proceeded to be amazed and strutted all over the house staring and appreciating the color and how it works with a light skin tone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> pretty shade of polish--arrived in good shape and was exactly as described..</li>
            <li> It definitely takes two coats and a top coat to get good coverage and shine.</li>
            <li> Great color, soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> Opi is my favorite brand of nail polish and this color is so pretty.</li>
            <li> The color is very nice, but compared to the Sally Hansen line it looks much cheaper and harder to do your own nails...</li>
            <li> Very natural looking and extremely nice for shorter nails.  </li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color and goes on smoothly however  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the 6th day of my manicure, and with just slight touchups, it still looks good!</li>
            <li> Shining enough without sparkling and good quality.</li>
            <li> Just kind of classy and neutral.</li>
            <li> Color is true to the picture.</li>
            <li> A good solid color with no streaking and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan well and generally avoid sun exposure at my age anyway, but the combination looks great on my hands, and I think it would look very good on someone who does tan, or who is naturally darker year round.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty pinkish color.</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty color against my skin tone I am brown skinned about Jennifer Hudson&#x27;s complexion, like everyone else says this color would go good with every shade.</li>
            <li> Pretty!  </li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the swap in the picture!</li>
            <li> Love this natural color.</li>
            <li> I love the natural color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first appeared a bit more pink, but now appears more nude.</li>
            <li> This has just the right shine and color for summertime.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a south asian with dark neutral skin tone, and it turns out perfect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford a clean sweep, as much as I&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -- I can&#x27;t afford a clean sweep, as much as I&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The really nice thing is, it is hard to see mistakes because it blends with skin better then a bolder color.</li>
            <li> Looks very much like the picture.  </li>
            <li> The first time I wore it, although I loved it, a couple of the nails came out a little streaky.</li>
            <li> All occasion pretty and feminine and groomed.</li>
            <li> Love this color basic goes with everything</li>
            <li> and it does not last more than three days before it begins to chip off.</li>
            <li> (prying off the paint can top with screwdriver was the actual cause of the chip, I think).  </li>
            <li> these are of much higher quality than the crummy ones I was using.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like anything over flashy for my nails and this colour is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this sophisticated soft pink.</li>
            <li> Kind a pink with chocolate</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I was bummed...</li>
            <li> This is first time I have ever used OPI fingernail polish</li>
            <li> I thought it wouldn&#x27;t look good on my pale skin</li>
            <li> I am a light skinned black women and I love how this polish looks on my nails.</li>
            <li> Perfect for work, and it&#x27;s so natural that even if it chips, it&#x27;s not super obvious and you can add another coat to fix it up.</li>
            <li> I love it because you can wear it everyday or for a special occasion</li>
            <li> I was thrilled for the extra two to four days without chips, scratches or peeling polish, even though I made an apple pies and generally abused my hands.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty natural color.  </li>
            <li> It is a tad bit darker than it looks in the photo, but still very pretty and classy looking.</li>
            <li> This color is classic!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this polish.</li>
            <li> The color is much brighter.</li>
            <li> Very close to the color in the picture.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I was freaked to discover that it cost as much as it did, which was about six times as much as some of the polish</li>
            <li> the OPI polishes a try by doing three or four manicures with them, and see if you like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> the OPI polishes a try by doing three or four manicures with them, and see if you like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> it really goes with everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very flattering neutral shade that doesn&#x27;t show chips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not mauve but more of a pink beige shade.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> First of all, you&#x27;ll notice that the brush is much wider and flatter than the normal.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is somewhere between fair and medium, at least at this time of year, with a rose-peach undertone.  </li>
            <li> I finished my manicure, I was shocked to discover that the polish stayed perfect for a minimum of five days, which is a first for me.</li>
            <li> A neutral color, goes on smoothly, lasts a long time</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve never tried an OPI polish before, they are different than most inexpensive nail polishes, and your manicure will be a very different experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe this color, but it&#x27;s a medium peach-beige which should look pretty good on a lot of different skin tones.  </li>
            <li> For the first couple of days I wore just the Dulce, then added a light coat or two of the \\&quot;Bond/World\\&quot; color for a little variety.  </li>
            <li> I am rating this product so highly because I love the pink/beige color--very toned down, natural, and yet not translucent.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I would spend this much on nail polish, but since I get professional pedicures, I figured, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel in a &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; mood; not too happy not to sad, so I wanted something that would show that.</li>
            <li> so far it is wearing very well.</li>
            <li> It would be fun to see what combinations others try with this relatively neutral polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soft pinkish color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Indian and half white and this colour is a beautiful neutral colour.</li>
            <li> I have a dark skin tone and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> It looks great by itself, but I (K. Lockwood) actually wanted to experiment with this as a base to my favorite OPI color from the Bond series, \\&quot;The World is Not Enough\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> OPI is long wearing and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the magic in the brushes, but I wound up buying OPI Natural Nail Base Coat &amp; Top Coat COMBO FULL SIZE .5 and OPI Dulce De Leche after I got a professional pedicure with Opi</li>
            <li> I love neutral polishes because they make my short stubby fingers look much less sausage like.</li>
            <li> Peachy natural shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to replace my old polish with this stuff, but it&#x27;s going to take some time --</li>
            <li> Once you get used to them, give yourself a manicure with your old, &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; polish.  </li>
            <li> Once you get used to them, give yourself a manicure with your old, &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; polish.  </li>
            <li> Anyone seeking a good polish for everyday use should consider this, since it is difficult to imagine many clothing colors incompatible with it, and since its natural color tends to make any chipping less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I always use an undercoat and a top coat, so I do have the protection and the color will last at least a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the polish many times since then, as well as a few other OPI colors, and it wasn&#x27;t a flue:  </li>
            <li> Good color for nails that you want to look decent despite how bad they are.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the bottle for the latter is marked HL D18.  </li>
            <li> Love you nails are thin and flexible so polish tends to chip in a day or two.</li>
            <li> Even professional manicures last only two - three days on me before I have to remove the polish and go clear until it&#x27;s time for the next manicure.</li>
            <li> Also, it is my first manicure with OPI polishes, which are a whole lot more expensive than the $1.49 ones I usually grab on sale at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Pretty color, just a little darker than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> The polish seems to glide off the wide brush and onto your nail, and the polish itself seems smoother than normal.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t chip off right away like the less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> at least not for me ;)).</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> long lasting and so glam</li>
            <li> The polish on one nail chipped, slightly, when I performed unexpected  sanding/priming of minor automobile damage</li>
            <li> I can wear this to work and it also matches all of my everyday clothing so there is no need to change polish frequently.</li>
            <li> It softens the grey tones of the taupe and brings up a bit of bronze.  </li>
            <li> Not a very flashy color but elegantly subtle.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this color, it&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li> Since the latter is a taupe that has micro-flakes of pink and green, I thought the \\&quot;Dulce de Leche\\&quot; would work well with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pale pink (definitely not nude...</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time when used with a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for two days, and it has performed as well/better than other polishes I use.  </li>
            <li> I received it a month and a half ago</li>
            <li> However it is about half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attached a few pictures.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned you can not go wrong when shopping for or using Opi.</li>
            <li> This polish makes my hands look long and thin, which is miraculous.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just made the big switch to gel polish</li>
            <li> Hard to find at stores.</li>
            <li> Lots of subtle tones in there.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the thick, gel like quality of the expensive brands like Butter or Dior.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Opi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes with everything and never looks bland, or boring.</li>
            <li> the brand wasn&#x27;t that crazy about this color.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to find in the retail marketplace.</li>
            <li> Not too flashy, not too boring.</li>

            <li> I do not care for the color and it does not last more than three days before it begins to chip off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this polish. I received it a month and a half ago and I&#x27;ve already worn it three times! I have a dark skin tone and it looks fantastic. I&#x27;ve attached a few pictures. It&#x27;s a pale pink (definitely not nude...at least not for me ;)). The first time I wore it, although I loved it, a couple of the nails came out a little streaky. This just made me more cognizant of how much polish I had to use the next time, and now my nails come out perfectly and evenly. Excellent color!</li>
            <li> My favorite color for my toes.  Goes with everything, unlike pinks and reds.</li>
            <li> Very pretty pinkish color.</li>
            <li> Love OPI nail polish. It&#x27;s the polish that doesn&#x27;t peel off my nails. I love all the pink/beige colors</li>
            <li> A beautiful shade! I&#x27;m a south asian with dark neutral skin tone, and it turns out perfect. Shining enough without sparkling and good quality. Very happy with this purchase. I will try another color of O.P.I.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color.  Opi is one of the Best nail polish I have used.</li>

            <li> great polish, found it not to be my shade</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color and goes on smoothly however  it didn&#x27;t last through one dish washing. I could almost just wipe it off.</li>
            <li> Love this color! At first appeared a bit more pink, but now appears more nude. The lacquer itself is rich, creamy, and applies easily.</li>
            <li> Very soft pinkish color. Love it</li>
            <li> One of my favorite OPI colors. It&#x27;s sexy vintage that looks great on toes!!!</li>

            <li> Love the color! I don&#x27;t think I will be changing colors anytime soon.  Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Just perfect color...</li>
            <li> pretty shade of polish--arrived in good shape and was exactly as described..</li>
            <li> Best opi I have! Took 7 days for it to start chipping!! Not kidding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for two days, and it has performed as well/better than other polishes I use.  The polish on one nail chipped, slightly, when I performed unexpected  sanding/priming of minor automobile damage (prying off the paint can top with screwdriver was the actual cause of the chip, I think).  I am rating this product so highly because I love the pink/beige color--very toned down, natural, and yet not translucent.  Anyone seeking a good polish for everyday use should consider this, since it is difficult to imagine many clothing colors incompatible with it, and since its natural color tends to make any chipping less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The color is not the correct color, the color name ( Dulce De Leche) is the correct name. The color is much brighter.</li>
            <li> Very close to the color in the picture. Almost a neutral color.</li>
            <li> Pretty color, just a little darker than I anticipated.  Definitely a good nude polish.  Lasts a long time when used with a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Bit too brownish for my taste but OPI quality!</li>
            <li> Perfect Summer Nude Nail Polish!  This has just the right shine and color for summertime.  Pinkish tone is perfect for most skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Good color payoff and easy to apply. It met my expectations</li>
            <li> Perfect color. I do not use it with a lamp. The really nice thing is, it is hard to see mistakes because it blends with skin better then a bolder color.</li>
            <li> The polish is wonderful, it compliments my skin color, because I wear it every day, it doesn&#x27;t chip off easily.</li>
            <li> Great value, good color</li>
            <li> LOVE this color!! This is my go-to work nude!</li>
            <li> OPI is the best, this color (Dulce de Leche) is great. Not too flashy, not too boring. Just kind of classy and neutral. Unfortunately, I just made the big switch to gel polish so I have no use for it but I may try layering it between the bottom and top coats of gel and see how it works. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Good quality nail polish</li>
            <li> Awesome. Neutral color goes great with everything love it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks OPI for making my nail cute!!!</li>
            <li> I thought the color would be different.  It is okay but not the great color I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> Peachy natural shade.</li>
            <li> Terrific color hope its never discontinued&lt;br /&gt;looks great w any outfit. Very clean looking and put together.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty natural color.  The polish is great and stays on without chipping or peeling! I love it.</li>
            <li> I had this in my wish list for a while and my husband purchased it for me. I love the natural color. I can wear this to work and it also matches all of my everyday clothing so there is no need to change polish frequently. I goes on smoothly and lasts for over a week without chips if you use a good fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> Opi is my favorite brand of nail polish and this color is so pretty. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t chip off right away like the less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> my standard, go-to neutral</li>
            <li> Love the color! It looks just like pictured. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love neutral polishes because they make my short stubby fingers look much less sausage like. This polish makes my hands look long and thin, which is miraculous. Also, it is my first manicure with OPI polishes, which are a whole lot more expensive than the $1.49 ones I usually grab on sale at the local drugstore. However, I saw the color in an ad, and decided I had to try this color. I was freaked to discover that it cost as much as it did, which was about six times as much as some of the polish I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never tried an OPI polish before, they are different than most inexpensive nail polishes, and your manicure will be a very different experience. First of all, you&#x27;ll notice that the brush is much wider and flatter than the normal. The polish seems to glide off the wide brush and onto your nail, and the polish itself seems smoother than normal. At first, I didn&#x27;t do a spectacular manicure - the polish was all over my cuticles and covered more area than I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get used to polish that doesn&#x27;t want to become part of the brush, you&#x27;ll appreciate the way it glides off the brush and onto your nail (and finger, if you&#x27;re like me.) It dries without runs or wrinkly areas. Plus, it looks shiny and deep looking, even without a topcoat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I finished my manicure, I was shocked to discover that the polish stayed perfect for a minimum of five days, which is a first for me. Even professional manicures last only two - three days on me before I have to remove the polish and go clear until it&#x27;s time for the next manicure. I was thrilled for the extra two to four days without chips, scratches or peeling polish, even though I made an apple pies and generally abused my hands. I&#x27;ve used the polish many times since then, as well as a few other OPI colors, and it wasn&#x27;t a flue:  these are of much higher quality than the crummy ones I was using. I&#x27;ll have to replace my old polish with this stuff, but it&#x27;s going to take some time -- I can&#x27;t afford a clean sweep, as much as I&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give the OPI polishes a try by doing three or four manicures with them, and see if you like them as much as I do. Once you get used to them, give yourself a manicure with your old, &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; polish.  When you compare your old stuff to the OPI, I&#x27;.m sure that you won&#x27;t want to bother with the crummy polish, and you&#x27;ll be adding as many gorgeous colors from their seemingly unending range of color.f, but it&#x27;s going to take some time -- I can&#x27;t afford a clean sweep, as much as I&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give the OPI polishes a try by doing three or four manicures with them, and see if you like them as much as I do.

            <li> Just did not go on smoothly at all for me. I always request OPI when I have my toes done and thought it would be nice for touch ups. I ended up giving this away.</li>
            <li> Good color for nails that you want to look decent despite how bad they are.</li>
            <li> love OPI products  always happy with products and use</li>
            <li> Love the color but it seems to chip within a day or so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe this color, but it&#x27;s a medium peach-beige which should look pretty good on a lot of different skin tones.  My skin tone is somewhere between fair and medium, at least at this time of year, with a rose-peach undertone.  It looks great by itself, but I (K. Lockwood) actually wanted to experiment with this as a base to my favorite OPI color from the Bond series, \\&quot;The World is Not Enough\\&quot;.  The bottom of the bottle for the latter is marked HL D18.  For the first couple of days I wore just the Dulce, then added a light coat or two of the \\&quot;Bond/World\\&quot; color for a little variety.  Since the latter is a taupe that has micro-flakes of pink and green, I thought the \\&quot;Dulce de Leche\\&quot; would work well with it.  It does a great job for summertime wear.  It softens the grey tones of the taupe and brings up a bit of bronze.  I don&#x27;t tan well and generally avoid sun exposure at my age anyway, but the combination looks great on my hands, and I think it would look very good on someone who does tan, or who is naturally darker year round.  It would be fun to see what combinations others try with this relatively neutral polish.&lt;br /&gt;NB: This is actually a report by K. Lockwood, not J. Lockwood, as the latter is my husband, and we share an account.</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT nail color!  It goes with everything and never looks bland, or boring. Thank goodness you carry it. It is nearly impossible to find in the retail marketplace.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with the color and the product.  The color was well represented by the photograph,went on beautifully and lasted. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li> Pretty!  Lots of subtle tones in there.</li>
            <li> Opi is a brand of nail color I can count on. It is constant in its quality and value. As far as I am concerned you can not go wrong when shopping for or using Opi. The only problem may be the color if you are unfamiliar with the shade and order on-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Dulce De Leche before, so I knew what the color was. It is a great nude, in fact it is my preferred color when I am I between summer and Fall shades. It goes on smoothyly, no steaks or globs. It does not ripple nor pill. I always use an undercoat and a top coat, so I do have the protection and the color will last at least a week. You cannot go wrong with Opi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 08-27-15</li>
            <li> Favorite nail polish.</li>
            <li> Omg i love this color i put it on my nails today it looks super cute</li>
            <li> The perfect color and OPI. Enough said!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite colour. I&#x27;m half Indian and half white and this colour is a beautiful neutral colour. I don&#x27;t like anything over flashy for my nails and this colour is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American with a complexion closest to Angela Bassett (P.S. I pray someday to be THAT in shape).  Anywho, I couldn&#x27;t stop polishing my nails with this color.  It has a very rich hue against my complexion and application was evenly distributed on my nails.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the magic in the brushes, but I wound up buying OPI Natural Nail Base Coat &amp; Top Coat COMBO FULL SIZE .5 and OPI Dulce De Leche after I got a professional pedicure with Opi My Address Is &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; (Opi Touring America Collection).  I never thought I would spend this much on nail polish, but since I get professional pedicures, I figured, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> great coverage stays on</li>
            <li> Perfect for that occasion that you need a color but don&#x27;t want a lot of attention drawn to your feet (or hands).</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty color against my skin tone I am brown skinned about Jennifer Hudson&#x27;s complexion, like everyone else says this color would go good with every shade. Very glad I purchased, thinking about ordering another one because I don&#x27;t want to run out, shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased this color because I tend to wear nail polish according to my mood or the weather. Sometimes I feel in a &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; mood; not too happy not to sad, so I wanted something that would show that. This is PERFECT for that! It&#x27;s true to your nail color if you&#x27;re of fair skin. It looks exactly like the swap in the picture!</li>
            <li> The color of this polish is beautiful, the product is good and not clumped or used.  Love this brand of polish.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, wears well and perfect color!</li>
            <li> Love the neutral color of this polish.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish ever in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I like a nice neutral, my hubby even liked it.</li>
            <li> I love this sophisticated soft pink. Kind a pink with chocolate it really goes with everything. I think is my favorite. And O. P. I. I love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this color! So happy when I found it on Amazon.  I ordered 4 bottles and they arrived quickly and packaged nicely.  This is a lovely neutral tone and matches everything.  I would definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> perfect natural color, love it!</li>
            <li> Lighter than anticipated. Good polish. Not my favorite color.</li>
            <li> Love Opi, color is ok looks better on the picture</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this color, it&#x27;s so pretty! It&#x27;s a neutral nude/pink color. I love it because you can wear it everyday or for a special occasion it looks great either way. I used two coats to get the effect coverage.</li>
            <li> Excellent i loved the color</li>
            <li> This polish chips to easily.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, I use OPI nail polish a lot, love this shade, will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Great professional, almost nude color. Perfect for work, and it&#x27;s so natural that even if it chips, it&#x27;s not super obvious and you can add another coat to fix it up.</li>
            <li> I love the color and it lasts longer than most polish. Love you nails are thin and flexible so polish tends to chip in a day or two.</li>
            <li> Not a very flashy color but elegantly subtle.  OPI is long wearing and worth the price.</li>
            <li> What can I say.Opi is Opi like the brand wasn&#x27;t that crazy about this color. Lots lighter then it looks in the pic.</li>
            <li> color is the same as the picture.  very nice and happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The color is very nice, but compared to the Sally Hansen line it looks much cheaper and harder to do your own nails...</li>
            <li> I bought it as part of a gift for my mother on Mother&#x27;s day. It is a tad bit darker than it looks in the photo, but still very pretty and classy looking.</li>
            <li> A neutral color, goes on smoothly, lasts a long time</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I was bummed... Didn&#x27;t seem to match the picture. And it would never be a color I would consider if I was browsing in a store. However put it on and proceeded to be amazed and strutted all over the house staring and appreciating the color and how it works with a light skin tone. Also a great color for shorter nails. Not often can I find a color that works for all 20 nails at the same time and not look like a child or a hooker. Who doesn&#x27;t love OPI?</li>
            <li> This polish is pretty good for the price. It doesn&#x27;t have the thick, gel like quality of the expensive brands like Butter or Dior. However it is about half the price. It definitely takes two coats and a top coat to get good coverage and shine. I do love the color, Dulce de Lece. It&#x27;s a very flattering neutral shade that doesn&#x27;t show chips. I have very fair skin so it looks darker on me than in the photo but I love the color. It&#x27;s not mauve but more of a pink beige shade. Nice for work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an OK color--nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love this color. It it&#x27;s smooth. You can add more than one coat if you&#x27;d like but you don&#x27;t need to. Color is true to the picture.</li>
            <li> Color is beautiful, polish went on smoothly and seems to wear well. I&#x27;m on the 6th day of my manicure, and with just slight touchups, it still looks good!</li>
            <li> This is first time I have ever used OPI fingernail polish and I really like it.  A good solid color with no streaking and so far it is wearing very well.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely beautiful color.  Very natural looking and extremely nice for shorter nails.  Looks very much like the picture.  lots of compliments from the nail techs and everyone else.</li>
