            <li>A very nice smelling, lathery, moisturing soap.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent, and the shea butter content is the best in the biz; however, this bar of soap never got rid of any B.O., I would suggest washing with something else then using this bar to help moisturize--or just find yourself a good lotion.</li>

            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>No complaints, except it is a bit pricey compared to glycerine soaps that lather just as nice.</li>
            <li>Now, I am aware that most people will not care about that, so if you&#x27;re one of them, then by all means buy this soap, for it is otherwise great!</li>
            <li>Lathers great and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light, clean and refreshing and the lather is incredible.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very pleasant and since I have odor allergies, I was grateful to find that it was light and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and leaves skin silky soft.</li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like bar soap in the shower after so many years of shower gel, but I have to say I love this!</li>
            <li>It used to have a very light verbena fragrance, almost lemony, and now it smells just like the cheap hand soap they used to put in dispensers in grade school, kind of industrial-like.</li>
            <li>I also love that the soap does not stain my washcloths.</li>

            <li>I love all of the Out of Africa products I have tried.</li>

            <li>No nasty chemicals, a portion goes to charity</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Soft, silky and feels like it is moisturizing your skin while using, as opposed to drying it out.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it, and it&#x27;s good for the soul, too.</li>
            <li>Neither drying nor moisturizing, it cleans beautifully and doesn&#x27;t create a big residue on the sink or in the shower.</li>
            <li>Very good and calming on dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to purchase this soap because I believe I found a great product that is so much better for my body/skin long term then</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and leaves my skin feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>This bar of soap is lightly scented, does not bother my asthma.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and leaves skin moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>the soaps available at grocery stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too soft, which is good.</li>
            <li>I quite enjoy the Lemon Verbena scent, very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Fells like your washing with a rich cream.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t object to paying a reasonably higher price for a good product but did find that our opinions of this product seemed quite different than the manufacturer&#x27;s claims and most reviews so posting our 2 cents worth :)</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely into lots of rich suds, somewhat more than my other favorite bar soap, Dr Bronners Lavender Castile.</li>
            <li>Have been using this soap for years, and it a great value for the price as it lasts long!</li>
            <li>When I finished showering I felt, CLEAN, MOISTURIZED, and I smelt heavenly.</li>
            <li>me/us clean</li>
            <li>I feel clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Clean well.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a clean rain forest.</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to  many things.</li>
            <li>and it has a light fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li>Smooth and fresh smelling as I can&#x27;t stand chemical smelling perfumes.</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised at how nice my skin feels after a shower, too.</li>
            <li>Excellent for too dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Mild citrus smell,</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much difference on my face, though (I have combination skin and have minor breakouts), but it&#x27;s great for the body.</li>
            <li>This soap smells awesome, and the bars last a long time.  </li>
            <li>It makes more lather now, which I don&#x27;t care about since I am an adult, but what is bothersome is the SMELL!</li>
            <li>Like most natural soaps there is a bit of a drying feeling when I first get out of the shower, but after I dry off my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s being more widely used.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made out of natural ingredients with no nasty stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a nice big bar.</li>
            <li>It used to be more clear, like a glycerin type soap, and now it is opaque.</li>
            <li>The soap I use every day in the shower should leave me smelling fresh, not like paste.</li>
            <li>I have been on a quest for a natural soap to fit the unique needs of my family</li>
            <li>This is excellent large bars of long lasting soap.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, moisturizing, clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin hydrated and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Love this personal cleanser.</li>
            <li>when it is in the soap dish in the shower and water is in the dish this bar tends to stay much more solid</li>
            <li>To make things even better it&#x27;s made in the USA, isn&#x27;t tested on animals, 5 cents of every purchase goes to providing medical care and education for kids in West Africa</li>
            <li>Smells great but does not last very long.</li>
            <li>Very nice to dry skin, especially in winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft and I didn&#x27;t even feel like I had to use lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients: Pure Unrefined Shea butter, Palm Oil, coconut Oil, botanicals/Essential Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Sea Salt and Purified</li>
            <li>My husband uses it and the large size helps keep a grip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d first come across it in some high end products from Provence.</li>
            <li>B001VEHXL8 Out Of Africa Verbena Shea Butter Bar Soap, 3.75-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gentle soap.  </li>
            <li>Was pleased to discover that the pool and fitness center where I have a membership has also started using a verbena scented liquid soap in the showers.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap, it does just what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>It also softens/moisturizes my skin really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this soap</li>
            <li>good soap, lasts a while, but the soap scum is undeniable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/8/16 - I have been using this soap for over a year and loving it, but my last shipment of it was different.</li>
            <li>The shea butter doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like most normal soaps containing high percentage of sodium laurel sulfate.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and the bar lathers very nicely, so it&#x27;ll last you a long time.</li>
            <li>It is a nice thick bar that lasts at least a good month in the shower with being used every day.</li>
            <li>Good lather, not excessive and not to minimal.&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: Seems to last about the same period of time as a comparably sized commercial bar.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer: The &#x27;jury&#x27; is still out.</li>
            <li>This soap is very soft!  </li>
            <li>I barely need to put lotion on any more whereas before my skin always felt dry after a shower.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>clean feel afterward, yet doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.  </li>
            <li>You feel clean, and your skin does not feel hung out to dry like some soaps leave you feeling.  </li>
            <li>Am partial to the verbena fragrance, which is light and not over whelming.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these soaps to shower, and I like them, especially the lovely scent and the fact that they do not seem to dry my skin.</li>
            <li>and I believe we have finally found the right match.</li>
            <li>This soap has a nice subtle scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Alright, well I&#x27;m currently pregnant and something about pregnancy has made my skin insanely dry.</li>
            <li>It is very natural.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin soft!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my legs so soft!  </li>
            <li>Wow....!</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin soft!</li>
            <li>Here are our initial impressions of this product as first time users/buyers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:</li>
            <li>My 50 year old skin still breaks out</li>
            <li>So far the shea butter soap and cream is fine.&lt;br /&gt;Claretha  Philadelphia, pa.</li>
            <li>and after it&#x27;s off, is natural, and affordable.</li>
            <li>The whole family loves the smell and I&#x27;m ordering my second shipment of four bars.</li>
            <li>Also although I&#x27;m not a huge lemon verbena fan, the scent didn&#x27;t bother my super sensitive preggo nose.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this soap would not due this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s due to the 20% shea butter (according to the box most other shea soaps only have about 1-2%...</li>
            <li>Possibly softer but maybe only due to the &#x27;coating&#x27;?&lt;br /&gt;Scent: A light citrus, not overpowering and not unpleasant but not a favorite of ours and not like any rainforest we&#x27;ve been in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has actually helped clear up my daughters face.  </li>
            <li>Natural ingredients is a definite plus!</li>
            <li>They definitely changed the product - it has a different shape and a new logo on it.</li>
            <li>I have been reading over the years how normal soap (even Dove and supposed moisturizer bars) ruin and dry out your skin over time.</li>
            <li>then all the other normal soaps we have had in the past&lt;br /&gt;Negative</li>
            <li>I have not used it enough yet to give an absolute assurance but so far I notice two big positives and one small negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not only been using straight oil, topped with lotion after bathing but have tried several different soaps (some of them very expensive and hand made) with just ok results.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I highly recommend it, and it&#x27;s good for the soul, too.</li>
            <li> Neither drying nor moisturizing, it cleans beautifully and doesn&#x27;t create a big residue on the sink or in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very good and calming on dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to purchase this soap because I believe I found a great product that is so much better for my body/skin long term then</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and leaves my skin feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> This bar of soap is lightly scented, does not bother my asthma.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and leaves skin moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> the soaps available at grocery stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft, which is good.</li>
            <li> I quite enjoy the Lemon Verbena scent, very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Fells like your washing with a rich cream.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t object to paying a reasonably higher price for a good product but did find that our opinions of this product seemed quite different than the manufacturer&#x27;s claims and most reviews so posting our 2 cents worth :)</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely into lots of rich suds, somewhat more than my other favorite bar soap, Dr Bronners Lavender Castile.</li>
            <li> Have been using this soap for years, and it a great value for the price as it lasts long!</li>
            <li> When I finished showering I felt, CLEAN, MOISTURIZED, and I smelt heavenly.</li>
            <li> me/us clean</li>
            <li> I feel clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Clean well.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a clean rain forest.</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to  many things.</li>
            <li> and it has a light fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li> Smooth and fresh smelling as I can&#x27;t stand chemical smelling perfumes.</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised at how nice my skin feels after a shower, too.</li>
            <li> Excellent for too dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Mild citrus smell,</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference on my face, though (I have combination skin and have minor breakouts), but it&#x27;s great for the body.</li>
            <li> This soap smells awesome, and the bars last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It makes more lather now, which I don&#x27;t care about since I am an adult, but what is bothersome is the SMELL!</li>
            <li> Like most natural soaps there is a bit of a drying feeling when I first get out of the shower, but after I dry off my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s being more widely used.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made out of natural ingredients with no nasty stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a nice big bar.</li>
            <li> It used to be more clear, like a glycerin type soap, and now it is opaque.</li>
            <li> The soap I use every day in the shower should leave me smelling fresh, not like paste.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest for a natural soap to fit the unique needs of my family</li>
            <li> This is excellent large bars of long lasting soap.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, moisturizing, clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin hydrated and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Love this personal cleanser.</li>
            <li> when it is in the soap dish in the shower and water is in the dish this bar tends to stay much more solid</li>
            <li> To make things even better it&#x27;s made in the USA, isn&#x27;t tested on animals, 5 cents of every purchase goes to providing medical care and education for kids in West Africa</li>
            <li> Smells great but does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Very nice to dry skin, especially in winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft and I didn&#x27;t even feel like I had to use lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients: Pure Unrefined Shea butter, Palm Oil, coconut Oil, botanicals/Essential Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Sea Salt and Purified</li>
            <li> My husband uses it and the large size helps keep a grip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d first come across it in some high end products from Provence.</li>
            <li> B001VEHXL8 Out Of Africa Verbena Shea Butter Bar Soap, 3.75-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gentle soap.  </li>
            <li> Was pleased to discover that the pool and fitness center where I have a membership has also started using a verbena scented liquid soap in the showers.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, it does just what it says it will.  </li>
            <li> It also softens/moisturizes my skin really well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this soap</li>
            <li> good soap, lasts a while, but the soap scum is undeniable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/8/16 - I have been using this soap for over a year and loving it, but my last shipment of it was different.</li>
            <li> The shea butter doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like most normal soaps containing high percentage of sodium laurel sulfate.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and the bar lathers very nicely, so it&#x27;ll last you a long time.</li>
            <li> It is a nice thick bar that lasts at least a good month in the shower with being used every day.</li>
            <li> Good lather, not excessive and not to minimal.&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: Seems to last about the same period of time as a comparably sized commercial bar.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer: The &#x27;jury&#x27; is still out.</li>
            <li> This soap is very soft!  </li>
            <li> I barely need to put lotion on any more whereas before my skin always felt dry after a shower.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> clean feel afterward, yet doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.  </li>
            <li> You feel clean, and your skin does not feel hung out to dry like some soaps leave you feeling.  </li>
            <li> Am partial to the verbena fragrance, which is light and not over whelming.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these soaps to shower, and I like them, especially the lovely scent and the fact that they do not seem to dry my skin.</li>
            <li> and I believe we have finally found the right match.</li>
            <li> This soap has a nice subtle scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Alright, well I&#x27;m currently pregnant and something about pregnancy has made my skin insanely dry.</li>
            <li> It is very natural.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin soft!  </li>
            <li> It leaves my legs so soft!  </li>
            <li> Wow....!</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin soft!</li>
            <li> Here are our initial impressions of this product as first time users/buyers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:</li>
            <li> My 50 year old skin still breaks out</li>
            <li> So far the shea butter soap and cream is fine.&lt;br /&gt;Claretha  Philadelphia, pa.</li>
            <li> and after it&#x27;s off, is natural, and affordable.</li>
            <li> The whole family loves the smell and I&#x27;m ordering my second shipment of four bars.</li>
            <li> Also although I&#x27;m not a huge lemon verbena fan, the scent didn&#x27;t bother my super sensitive preggo nose.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this soap would not due this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s due to the 20% shea butter (according to the box most other shea soaps only have about 1-2%...</li>
            <li> Possibly softer but maybe only due to the &#x27;coating&#x27;?&lt;br /&gt;Scent: A light citrus, not overpowering and not unpleasant but not a favorite of ours and not like any rainforest we&#x27;ve been in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has actually helped clear up my daughters face.  </li>
            <li> Natural ingredients is a definite plus!</li>
            <li> They definitely changed the product - it has a different shape and a new logo on it.</li>
            <li> I have been reading over the years how normal soap (even Dove and supposed moisturizer bars) ruin and dry out your skin over time.</li>
            <li> then all the other normal soaps we have had in the past&lt;br /&gt;Negative</li>
            <li> I have not used it enough yet to give an absolute assurance but so far I notice two big positives and one small negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not only been using straight oil, topped with lotion after bathing but have tried several different soaps (some of them very expensive and hand made) with just ok results.</li>
            <li> We use white washcloths and some of the other natural soaps leave a stain that does not come out in the wash.</li>
            <li> The bar is pretty hard and feels like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I gave the soap four stars because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> It seems to be lasting a long time, this bar if soap.</li>
            <li> Will use as long as product remains same quality.</li>
            <li> and I think long term.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unscented and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I love this so because it kept my body from feeling dry during the winter cold</li>
            <li> love this stuff, the price isn&#x27;t bad, I think the bar will last a long time</li>
            <li> I wash my hands quite often and they don&#x27;t fell dry.  </li>
            <li> I am 62 and my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Positive: My skin does not feel as dry and it does feel like this soap is a lot nicer on the skin</li>
            <li> I like the Verbena soap as an alternative to African Black soap, but it still comes second to African Black Soap for me.</li>
            <li> but I think you trade off a little bit in that regard versus regular soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesnt wash away as quickly as other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> , that for me it is a let down: Palm Oil.</li>
            <li> I MELT THIS SOAP DOWN TO MAKE LIQUID HAND SOAP</li>
            <li> I like the size of the bar - it doesn&#x27;t break in half after using it for a while.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for a less costly but still as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; bar soap to buy instead of Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li> I use this soap everyday.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see how much a small bottle of organic shower gel costs, and how fast I went through it.</li>
            <li> so I have to be wary of moisturizers,  but this soap works well in dry winter months without over doing it.</li>
            <li> Totally addicted.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked the scent, and the shea butter content is the best in the biz; however, this bar of soap never got rid of any B.O., I would suggest washing with something else then using this bar to help moisturize--or just find yourself a good lotion.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the bar - it doesn&#x27;t break in half after using it for a while.  I like how it feels on my skin too.</li>
            <li> I love it! It smells wonderful...</li>
            <li> Love this personal cleanser. It&#x27;s unlike any &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used before. Neither drying nor moisturizing, it cleans beautifully and doesn&#x27;t create a big residue on the sink or in the shower. One bar lasts forever, as a result. The fragrance is very pleasant and since I have odor allergies, I was grateful to find that it was light and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Mild citrus smell, clean feel afterward, yet doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.  Productive while bathing, but the bars don&#x27;t wash away, last longer.  Have since ordered another batch.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest for a natural soap to fit the unique needs of my family and I believe we have finally found the right match. The scent is a very pleasant lemon zest, but it is not overpowering. Like most natural soaps there is a bit of a drying feeling when I first get out of the shower, but after I dry off my skin feels amazing! I also love that the soap does not stain my washcloths. We use white washcloths and some of the other natural soaps leave a stain that does not come out in the wash. I gave the soap four stars because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like and there is a bit of inconsistency in the smell of each bar. Still, I will definitely be purchasing this soap again.</li>
            <li> I have been using these soaps to shower, and I like them, especially the lovely scent and the fact that they do not seem to dry my skin. My only caveat is related to one of the ingredients, that for me it is a let down: Palm Oil. Now, I am aware that most people will not care about that, so if you&#x27;re one of them, then by all means buy this soap, for it is otherwise great!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001VEHXL8 Out Of Africa Verbena Shea Butter Bar Soap, 3.75-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gentle soap.

I&#x27;d first come across it in some high end products from Provence.Was pleased to discover that the pool and fitness center where I have a membership has also started using a verbena scented liquid soap in the showers.</li>
            <li> Modena Shea butter is excellent. As of now I am not having any problems with it. I am very allergic to  many things. So far the shea butter soap and cream is fine.&lt;br /&gt;Claretha  Philadelphia, pa.</li>

            <li> This bar of soap is lightly scented, does not bother my asthma. It lathers well and leaves skin moisturized and smooth. Natural ingredients is a definite plus!</li>

            <li> Best soap EVER! I have tried just about every soap out there....I ordered this hoping for something that would amaze me because none of the others have. Wow....! It is different from anything I have ever tried. Lovely scent. Fells like your washing with a rich cream. I am 62 and my skin is dry. When I finished showering I felt, CLEAN, MOISTURIZED, and I smelt heavenly. This soap is AWESOME. It&#x27;s a keeper. Never had a soap make me feel so great. Looking forward to shower time again. Cindy</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  It leaves my skin soft and it smells WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> This is great soap and it smells SO good!!</li>
            <li> Very smooth and fresh! Doesnt wash away as quickly as other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Excellent for too dry sensitive skin.  Wonderful fresh lemon smell.  This soap is very soft!  Remove from box to store-as that aids in making the bars&lt;br /&gt;more &#x27;hard-milled&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I love this so because it kept my body from feeling dry during the winter cold and it has a light fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li> I have been reading over the years how normal soap (even Dove and supposed moisturizer bars) ruin and dry out your skin over time. I was hoping that this soap would not due this. I have not used it enough yet to give an absolute assurance but so far I notice two big positives and one small negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive: My skin does not feel as dry and it does feel like this soap is a lot nicer on the skin both short term and I think long term.&lt;br /&gt;Positive: It holds together a lot better which means when it is in the soap dish in the shower and water is in the dish this bar tends to stay much more solid then all the other normal soaps we have had in the past&lt;br /&gt;Negative: It definitely gets me/us clean but I think you trade off a little bit in that regard versus regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this soap because I believe I found a great product that is so much better for my body/skin long term then the soaps available at grocery stores.</li>
            <li> This soap smells awesome, and the bars last a long time.  It also softens/moisturizes my skin really well.  The fragrance of the soap will also make your entire bathroom smell good!  This is a winner, and I plan to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be lasting a long time, this bar if soap. I feel clean and moisturized. What more could you want from a soap?</li>
            <li> Great smell!  I love all of the Out of Africa products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Have been using this soap for years, and it a great value for the price as it lasts long! The color is lighter than it use to be, and the size is a bit smaller than when it 1st came out, but it doesn&#x27;t matter as it&#x27;s still a great soap.  Am partial to the verbena fragrance, which is light and not over whelming.  Lathers great and rinses clean.  The shea butter doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like most normal soaps containing high percentage of sodium laurel sulfate.  Is a great product!</li>
            <li> Clean well.  I like the smell.  Will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> soap produces creamy feeling  when comes in contact with water.  very lovely scent!</li>

            <li> I use this soap everyday. It lathers well and has a nice pleasant scent. My skin feels clean and fresh all day. Great product!</li>
            <li> Smells great but does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Love the way this soap lathers and smells! No complaints, except it is a bit pricey compared to glycerine soaps that lather just as nice.</li>
            <li> always on the lookout for a great deal on natural soaps for my subscribe and save, this one is a winner!</li>
            <li> Alright, well I&#x27;m currently pregnant and something about pregnancy has made my skin insanely dry. I&#x27;ve not only been using straight oil, topped with lotion after bathing but have tried several different soaps (some of them very expensive and hand made) with just ok results. I tried this one today. Amazing. My skin is super soft and I didn&#x27;t even feel like I had to use lotion. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s due to the 20% shea butter (according to the box most other shea soaps only have about 1-2%...which I believe based on where shea falls in the ingredient list on others I&#x27;ve bought.) The bar is pretty hard and feels like it will last a long time. Also although I&#x27;m not a huge lemon verbena fan, the scent didn&#x27;t bother my super sensitive preggo nose. To make things even better it&#x27;s made in the USA, isn&#x27;t tested on animals, 5 cents of every purchase goes to providing medical care and education for kids in West Africa and it&#x27;s made out of natural ingredients with no nasty stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Pure Unrefined Shea butter, Palm Oil, coconut Oil, botanicals/Essential Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Sea Salt and Purified Water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff, the price isn&#x27;t bad, I think the bar will last a long time and it&#x27;s something I can feel really good buying. No nasty chemicals, a portion goes to charity and it&#x27;s made here in the U.S. That&#x27;s my kind of product!</li>
            <li> Smooth and fresh smelling as I can&#x27;t stand chemical smelling perfumes.</li>
            <li> Gentle, moisturizing, clean fresh scent. What more can I say? This is VERY nice soap!</li>
            <li> Yum! Totally addicted. I finally found a soap that feels while it&#x27;s on and after it&#x27;s off, is natural, and affordable. And the scent is delicious! Win win!</li>
            <li> The ingredients have changed and now includes Coconut - an allergy problem for me.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Soft, silky and feels like it is moisturizing your skin while using, as opposed to drying it out.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap. It smells like a clean rain forest. Keeps skin hydrated and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I MELT THIS SOAP DOWN TO MAKE LIQUID HAND SOAP AND IT WORKS WELL. I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS!!</li>
            <li> This has a great lemon scent and does a good job of removing dirt and grime. It&#x27;s also a nice big bar. My husband uses it and the large size helps keep a grip.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this soap - you feel nice and clean after showing.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin soft! It has a nice smell and the bar lathers very nicely, so it&#x27;ll last you a long time. Haven&#x27;t seen much difference on my face, though (I have combination skin and have minor breakouts), but it&#x27;s great for the body.</li>
            <li> one of the best shea butter soaps</li>
            <li> Unscented and lasts a long time.  Great for irritated skin.  My husband uses because of eczema.</li>
            <li> Loved it!! But the price has gone way up, so I probably won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
            <li> Here are our initial impressions of this product as first time users/buyers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: About 1 1/2 to 2x the price of mid-range/higher quality commercial soaps.&lt;br /&gt;Comfort/Size: Nice size and comfortable to hold/use.&lt;br /&gt;Lather: Good lather, not excessive and not to minimal.&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: Seems to last about the same period of time as a comparably sized commercial bar.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer: The &#x27;jury&#x27; is still out. Seems to leave skin with a &#x27;waxy&#x27; &#x27;squeaky&#x27; feel. Possibly softer but maybe only due to the &#x27;coating&#x27;?&lt;br /&gt;Scent: A light citrus, not overpowering and not unpleasant but not a favorite of ours and not like any rainforest we&#x27;ve been in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to get away from commercial soaps and support companies producing organic/biodegradable products. Don&#x27;t object to paying a reasonably higher price for a good product but did find that our opinions of this product seemed quite different than the manufacturer&#x27;s claims and most reviews so posting our 2 cents worth :)</li>
            <li> This soap smells and lathers good!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get rid of household products with unwanted chemicals, especially beauty products. I was shocked to see how much a small bottle of organic shower gel costs, and how fast I went through it. So I picked this bar soap based on clean ingredients, affordability and excellent reviews. I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like bar soap in the shower after so many years of shower gel, but I have to say I love this! It is a nice thick bar that lasts at least a good month in the shower with being used every day. The scent is very light, clean and refreshing and the lather is incredible. I was extremely surprised at how nice my skin feels after a shower, too. I barely need to put lotion on any more whereas before my skin always felt dry after a shower. I have re-ordered this product several times now and the consistency in the product is perfect. I am so glad I found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/8/16 - I have been using this soap for over a year and loving it, but my last shipment of it was different. They definitely changed the product - it has a different shape and a new logo on it. It used to be more clear, like a glycerin type soap, and now it is opaque. It makes more lather now, which I don&#x27;t care about since I am an adult, but what is bothersome is the SMELL! It used to have a very light verbena fragrance, almost lemony, and now it smells just like the cheap hand soap they used to put in dispensers in grade school, kind of industrial-like. This is no longer a product I would care to buy on a regular basis. The soap I use every day in the shower should leave me smelling fresh, not like paste.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a less costly but still as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; bar soap to buy instead of Dr. Bronners. The whole family loves the smell and I&#x27;m ordering my second shipment of four bars.</li>
            <li> This look lasting,fresh fragrance soap is an excellent product.  I use on face and body.  I use this and give this as gifts to introduce others to this shea butter product.  Great price.  Will use as long as product remains same quality.</li>
