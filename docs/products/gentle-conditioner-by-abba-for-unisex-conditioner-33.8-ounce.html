            <li>Also fantastic for children&#x27;s hair tangles!!!  </li>
            <li>Probably good for thicker, coarser hair, but not for me.</li>
            <li>I loved how it smelled and what it did for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used the abba conditioner for about 20 years and loved it.</li>
            <li>I used this as a dual agent and felt good about the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this product for years, always loved it</li>
            <li>I have found that mixing about a tbsp.of the conditioner with 8 ounces of water in a spray bottle is a good way to apply it as a &amp;#34; leave in&amp;#34; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I always keep it on hand, its fabulous!!</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s pretty perfect!</li>
            <li>It was great for curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The smells is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>AFTER READING ALL THESE NICE REVIEWS, I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING WHAT I NEEDED, BUT</li>
            <li>INSTEAD I GOT GOD KNOWS WHAT KIND OF SUBSTANCE.</li>
            <li>THEY JUST USED THE BOTTLE TO PUT THEIR OWN PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>like before when U felt it was good for your Skin &amp; Hair...looks like they went cheaper with chemicals like so many things these days.</li>
            <li>Great as a body lotion as well, but since this is the most important product I use on my hair, I don&#x27;t ever want to \\&quot;waste\\&quot; it as lotion.</li>
            <li>Make combing job very easy.</li>
            <li>Ingredients are nice - no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li>They have changed the great ingredients to a more standard conditioner, without the great earbs from before.</li>
            <li>Ive been using Abba products for over 20 years and still love it.</li>
            <li>Love this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others and always end up with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this leave in conditioner for many years now.  </li>
            <li>It melts away mascara like a dream and soothes the skin with a lovely cooling effect.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and will for many more.</li>
            <li>If you find that this product isn&#x27;t for you, you can always use it as a nice, light body lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 17 years.  </li>
            <li>and then, after using it for some time, I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t look as healthy.</li>
            <li>A beautician recommended this product to me many years ago and I have used it ever since.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have used for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Just ok of a product.  </li>
            <li>I used to LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>But I feel like I got some kind of cheap knock off.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy as well.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>The scent, conditioning and price are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and good smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years on my fine, shoulder length, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>So glad it is available on-line.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it was mostly sealed in a plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>and I love the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to comb.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong smell like dryer sheets</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with medium curl structure; or as the Ladies at [...] would say, Type 3 curls.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and in the past I thought it was one of the best.  </li>
            <li>My whole family have been using  this for years and we love it!</li>
            <li>It is still good for your hair, but not as good as previous formula.</li>
            <li>Great for daily use.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S CHEAP.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a great conditioner but</li>
            <li>It is a light leave on conditioner that will not add weight your hair, your hair will not feel oily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and rinses out well without leaving any residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>Fabulous leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Most days I style my hair with a curling iron so it could look quite fried if I didn&#x27;t use a good conditioner....and ABBA Gentle really delivers.  </li>
            <li>I checked to make sure I had purchased the right product.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>It does not leave your hair look like it is full of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>Super bummed.</li>
            <li>My wife has super curly hair and this is the stuff that tames the mane.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product at least since 1992, and it was one of the first products I found that is perfect for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Works great even as a styling gel if you are going for a softer hold and aren&#x27;t the type to mess with your hair during the day.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and this conditioner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that seems to effectively produce defined curls.</li>
            <li>not heavy, I love this product.</li>
            <li>Great product to tame curly hair</li>
            <li>my main use for it is as a makeup remover!!  </li>
            <li>I first wash my hair and condition it with a wash-out conditioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using Beauty Without Cruelty but while it tames my hair more than this one does, I&#x27;m not sure if it will keep it as healthy yet.</li>
            <li>I have used the product for 3 months and never fails for all hair styles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s also better for your hair/scalp than traditional hair styling products?</li>
            <li>i cannot suggest this conditioner enough. :)</li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant with the old abba, this on the other hand has way too much perfume for me.</li>
            <li>down the frizzies in any kind of weather.</li>
            <li>Hard to find a good leave-in</li>
            <li>I have always liked the Abba Gentle Conditioner, but would have preferred the product in the bottle with the green label as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT ABBA&#x27;S \\&quot;GENTLE CONDITIONER\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>If you accidentally use too much, just running your fingers through your hair will soften it.</li>
            <li>I rinse, but only lightly.</li>
            <li>I really like this Gentle conditioner by abba.</li>
            <li>It is gentle.</li>
            <li>I just received my years allocation of ABBA gentle condiitioner.</li>
            <li>and I always make sure I have a few big bottles at home, to make sure I never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gently moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Nothing feels as good on my curly, thick hair as this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It tamed the frizz and kept it super healthy (my hair is past my waist).</li>
            <li>Not what is used to be, so many chemicals just like any other conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I like the old formula better than the new one which comes in slightly different bottles.</li>
            <li>The saving grace was that after applied and had time to dry, the strong perfume smell dissipated.</li>
            <li>First off, it does not keep my curls together like the old type did</li>
            <li>The conditioner in the bottle I purchased online from Amazon most recently was so different</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend ABBA&#x27;s Color Protect shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Would rather have something with a little more consistency.</li>
            <li>Abba leaves nice, defined curls without feeling sticky and hard.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair soft and the curls are very defined without being too kinky-curly.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that can be very frizzy.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t really like how it smelled but kept using it, hoping that it would have the same results.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, because I live in the South the humidity might have affected the way the glycerin in this conditioner worked.</li>
            <li>It is also very natural.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received was the new formula and not the old one which was advertised.</li>
            <li>I still use the new one because they will not be making the old formula anymore.</li>
            <li>Then, I use Abba Pure Gentle Conditioner on my combed hair, leave it in, and let it dry.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of it, but it&#x27;s not very thick.  </li>
            <li>It does kinda the same thing as the original BUT not mostly natural</li>
            <li>The other reviews are right; if you compare a new bottle to the old one, a new company took over producing this product under the ABBA name, and boy did they scrimp on the plant derived botanicals.</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner is a requirement for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and curly without being crunchy or looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>Soft hair.</li>
            <li>Even when I&#x27;ve already used it in the shower AND apply it as a leave-in, my hair never feels greasy - just soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>So it took me from fried hair to natural, soft and once again curly.  </li>
            <li>I looked for the old one for that reason.</li>
            <li>Big bottle, gentle to the hair and skin&lt;</li>
            <li>I felt obligated to write to the company but we&#x27;ll see how far that goes.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the Gentle Conditioner, not sure I would buy again as it is very watery.  </li>
            <li>Like old lady hairspray.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m jumping off the ship early.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and shiny, as if there were no product in it.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft and my scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair, and this is the only product I have found that maintains my curl, without weighing my hair down, or creating fly away fuzziness.</li>
            <li>But it leaves my fine hair very limp.</li>
            <li>Recently they gave it a new bottle and changed the formula.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very long and straight hair.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I try other products but keep coming back to ABBA Pure Gentle.</li>
            <li>(Ladies with curly hair, you know how important and hard this is to achieve).</li>
            <li>A little mixed w/ Abba Volumizing Gel  makes a sweet curl from a tangled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It totally saved me when I transitioned from brunette to natural (had to bleach my hair 4 times).  </li>
            <li>Far different.</li>
            <li>and this is one of only two leave in conditioners that keeps my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Usually when conditioning my hair daily, I use a spritz that I made with purified water, avocado oil, sweet almond oil, Giovanni direct leave in, and Beauty without cruelty leave in...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly chemicals; several forms of alcohol and half way down extract of cherry bark and aloe just so they can print it on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It works the same, but the smell is heavier perfume and less fresh.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is quite different, the listed ingredients are not the same as the old bottle, and I&#x27;m breaking out in a rash on scalp and neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>It even works on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is curly and thick but very fine, it never weighs her hair down.</li>
            <li>It gets frothy and takes a long time to absorb into looking clear.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this product helps keep my curls together without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair who likes soft curls instead of hard crunchy hair.</li>
            <li>I use it on my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have very dry &amp; sensitive skin and</li>

            <li> Not only is it a great conditioner but</li>
            <li> It is a light leave on conditioner that will not add weight your hair, your hair will not feel oily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and rinses out well without leaving any residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> Fabulous leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Most days I style my hair with a curling iron so it could look quite fried if I didn&#x27;t use a good conditioner....and ABBA Gentle really delivers.  </li>
            <li> I checked to make sure I had purchased the right product.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your hair look like it is full of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> Super bummed.</li>
            <li> My wife has super curly hair and this is the stuff that tames the mane.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product at least since 1992, and it was one of the first products I found that is perfect for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works great even as a styling gel if you are going for a softer hold and aren&#x27;t the type to mess with your hair during the day.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and this conditioner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that seems to effectively produce defined curls.</li>
            <li> not heavy, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product to tame curly hair</li>
            <li> my main use for it is as a makeup remover!!  </li>
            <li> I first wash my hair and condition it with a wash-out conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using Beauty Without Cruelty but while it tames my hair more than this one does, I&#x27;m not sure if it will keep it as healthy yet.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for 3 months and never fails for all hair styles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s also better for your hair/scalp than traditional hair styling products?</li>
            <li> i cannot suggest this conditioner enough. :)</li>
            <li> The smell was pleasant with the old abba, this on the other hand has way too much perfume for me.</li>
            <li> down the frizzies in any kind of weather.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a good leave-in</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Abba Gentle Conditioner, but would have preferred the product in the bottle with the green label as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT ABBA&#x27;S \\&quot;GENTLE CONDITIONER\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If you accidentally use too much, just running your fingers through your hair will soften it.</li>
            <li> I rinse, but only lightly.</li>
            <li> I really like this Gentle conditioner by abba.</li>
            <li> It is gentle.</li>
            <li> I just received my years allocation of ABBA gentle condiitioner.</li>
            <li> and I always make sure I have a few big bottles at home, to make sure I never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gently moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Nothing feels as good on my curly, thick hair as this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It tamed the frizz and kept it super healthy (my hair is past my waist).</li>
            <li> Not what is used to be, so many chemicals just like any other conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I like the old formula better than the new one which comes in slightly different bottles.</li>
            <li> The saving grace was that after applied and had time to dry, the strong perfume smell dissipated.</li>
            <li> First off, it does not keep my curls together like the old type did</li>
            <li> The conditioner in the bottle I purchased online from Amazon most recently was so different</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend ABBA&#x27;s Color Protect shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Would rather have something with a little more consistency.</li>
            <li> Abba leaves nice, defined curls without feeling sticky and hard.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and the curls are very defined without being too kinky-curly.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that can be very frizzy.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t really like how it smelled but kept using it, hoping that it would have the same results.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, because I live in the South the humidity might have affected the way the glycerin in this conditioner worked.</li>
            <li> It is also very natural.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was the new formula and not the old one which was advertised.</li>
            <li> I still use the new one because they will not be making the old formula anymore.</li>
            <li> Then, I use Abba Pure Gentle Conditioner on my combed hair, leave it in, and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of it, but it&#x27;s not very thick.  </li>
            <li> It does kinda the same thing as the original BUT not mostly natural</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right; if you compare a new bottle to the old one, a new company took over producing this product under the ABBA name, and boy did they scrimp on the plant derived botanicals.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is a requirement for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and curly without being crunchy or looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> Soft hair.</li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;ve already used it in the shower AND apply it as a leave-in, my hair never feels greasy - just soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> So it took me from fried hair to natural, soft and once again curly.  </li>
            <li> I looked for the old one for that reason.</li>
            <li> Big bottle, gentle to the hair and skin&lt;</li>
            <li> I felt obligated to write to the company but we&#x27;ll see how far that goes.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the Gentle Conditioner, not sure I would buy again as it is very watery.  </li>
            <li> Like old lady hairspray.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m jumping off the ship early.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and shiny, as if there were no product in it.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft and my scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair, and this is the only product I have found that maintains my curl, without weighing my hair down, or creating fly away fuzziness.</li>
            <li> But it leaves my fine hair very limp.</li>
            <li> Recently they gave it a new bottle and changed the formula.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very long and straight hair.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I try other products but keep coming back to ABBA Pure Gentle.</li>
            <li> (Ladies with curly hair, you know how important and hard this is to achieve).</li>
            <li> A little mixed w/ Abba Volumizing Gel  makes a sweet curl from a tangled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It totally saved me when I transitioned from brunette to natural (had to bleach my hair 4 times).  </li>
            <li> Far different.</li>
            <li> and this is one of only two leave in conditioners that keeps my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Usually when conditioning my hair daily, I use a spritz that I made with purified water, avocado oil, sweet almond oil, Giovanni direct leave in, and Beauty without cruelty leave in...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly chemicals; several forms of alcohol and half way down extract of cherry bark and aloe just so they can print it on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It works the same, but the smell is heavier perfume and less fresh.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is quite different, the listed ingredients are not the same as the old bottle, and I&#x27;m breaking out in a rash on scalp and neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> It even works on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is curly and thick but very fine, it never weighs her hair down.</li>
            <li> It gets frothy and takes a long time to absorb into looking clear.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this product helps keep my curls together without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair who likes soft curls instead of hard crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have very dry &amp; sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> This product works quite well on my hair, which is thick and naturally wavy in some areas, straight in a few areas, and very curly in others.  </li>
            <li> The pro quinoa version here is crunchy in your hair, isn&#x27;t as slickening, has a strong smell (which is a problem because a leave in is usually 1 in a bunch of layered products - can&#x27;t have competing smells) and looks white when you put it on wet dark hair.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner detangles even long curly hair with relative ease without an overbearing perfume-y scent (unlike the shampoo that goes with it).</li>
            <li> The spray can be applied just to the ends and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat or oily looking.  </li>
            <li> I have soft ringlet curls and it never weighs them down.</li>
            <li> Something is definitely missing with this new version</li>
            <li> Had the formula been the &amp;#34;Old&amp;#34; one I would have easily given this 5 stars, but I will rate it at a 3 because its just mediocre at this point.</li>
            <li> No reguard to a LONG time customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but thick and moisterizing.</li>
            <li> The products have changed a bit and packing keeps changing (which is annoying) but still a good product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very sensitive and usually breaks, I do not have that problem with this product.</li>
            <li> (you can rub it into your skin) and relatively inexpensive compared to other products out there.  </li>
            <li> back to the other one I will go</li>
            <li> I hung with all their other changes, but they finally lost me.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product out there for curly, dry, and damaged hair that I can get my hands on.</li>
            <li> Either way, my hair felt brittle, crunchy, dry, breakage was maxed up, and it shed a ton.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it too soft or limp if you are careful about the amount used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the only product that does not weigh down and does not add volume to curly hair.</li>
            <li> Abba is the only conditioner I can use on my hair that won&#x27;t way it down.  </li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly and thick hair I have been trying to find something like this for years</li>
            <li> There was a little loss of the product, but not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> , I find that by wetting the hair daily, then applying this product alone, allows me to go about my day with very little fuss and muss.</li>
            <li> And I have a lot of hair but only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Since I shampoo daily I like to use a small amount of conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> Used the other ABBA leave in condition and tried this one cuz it was cheaper.......it was a mistake.  </li>
            <li> Gave some to other ladies at office and they like it</li>
            <li> So disappointed, I have used nourishing leave-in for years, but this is completely different - check the ingredients, it is just another standard formulation with a tiny amount if botanicals thrown in, versus the old formula.</li>
            <li> Another sad state of corporate dime counters making someting \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; for less cost.</li>
            <li> I have used this as a daily conditioner for years on my curly, thick hair and it works well.</li>
            <li> And that less cost is ot even passed on to the consumer.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very long and thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> THEN I added a little of this product to the concoction in hopes that it will leave my hair even softer, since it has glycerin in it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that I will never switch.</li>
            <li> It takes very little of this conditioner to keep my hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> There is very little fragrance which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li> that works just as well if not better.  </li>
            <li> I was almost out of my last batch and had been unable to find in salons or stores for a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using versions of this for the past 6 or 7 years.  </li>
            <li> Scary for African textured hair, I won&#x27;t use it again...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend for any one with hard to control curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, and they&#x27;ve changed the name twice, the bottle at least twice</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company and complained they told me basically they changed the formula and that is the way it is.</li>
            <li> since is very difficult to find it locally.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It helps tame my crazy curls.  </li>
            <li> Even when I applied a small amount of it by its self to my hair, I still got the same terrible reaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, if I leave the house I look like an insane person with white, frothy hair.  </li>
            <li> A bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Hate this conditioner...for the fact that it dried my hair out horribly and it was perfumey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> (See this linkypoo:[...]</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed with the arrival of the product because the air bag cushions were all to one side and the lid had broke on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Now it smells awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ive been using Abba products for over 20 years and still love it. The products have changed a bit and packing keeps changing (which is annoying) but still a good product. Love this leave in conditioner. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Great for daily use. Formula is different than before which is why I gave it 4 stars. It is still good for your hair, but not as good as previous formula.I use it on my fine thin hair. It doesn&#x27;t make it too soft or limp if you are careful about the amount used.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is a requirement for my naturally curly hair.  It leaves my hair soft and curly without being crunchy or looking greasy.  I&#x27;ve tried many others and always end up with this product.  And I have a lot of hair but only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> AFTER READING ALL THESE NICE REVIEWS, I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING WHAT I NEEDED, BUT FOR CHEAPER. INSTEAD I GOT GOD KNOWS WHAT KIND OF SUBSTANCE. THEY JUST USED THE BOTTLE TO PUT THEIR OWN PRODUCT. IT&#x27;S NOT ABBA&#x27;S \\&quot;GENTLE CONDITIONER\\&quot;. NO WONDER IT&#x27;S CHEAP. I&#x27;M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I have used this leave in conditioner for many years now.  It does a great job of holding curls together without being sticky or crunchy.  I can&#x27;t find it it stores anymore, and the name changed, but I go out of my way to find it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 18 years, and I love it!! I have thick, curly hair, and this is the only product I have found that maintains my curl, without weighing my hair down, or creating fly away fuzziness. I always keep it on hand, its fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Not what is used to be, so many chemicals just like any other conditioner.  Abba please change formula back!!!</li>
            <li> I have very long, very curly hair.  I have a lot of it, but it&#x27;s not very thick.  I first wash my hair and condition it with a wash-out conditioner so it&#x27;s easy to comb.  Then, I use Abba Pure Gentle Conditioner on my combed hair, leave it in, and let it dry.  Abba leaves nice, defined curls without feeling sticky and hard.  If you accidentally use too much, just running your fingers through your hair will soften it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 14 years.  It is not sold in stores in my area so thank goodness for Amazon.  Not only is it a great conditioner but my main use for it is as a makeup remover!!  It melts away mascara like a dream and soothes the skin with a lovely cooling effect.  It does not remove waterproof mascara so keep in mind if that is your preference.  It also does triple duty as a shave lotion.  This is really great for travel...conditioner, makeup remover and shave lotion all in one!</li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly and thick hair I have been trying to find something like this for years I have tried just about every leave in on the market and have never had results like this. I don&#x27;t even have to use moose or gel the conditioner makes my hair soft and the curls are very defined without being too kinky-curly. I highly recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair who likes soft curls instead of hard crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  I have very long and straight hair. It takes very little of this conditioner to keep my hair manageable.  I also use this before going swimming to protect my hair from pool chemicals. I have used this product for many years and will for many more.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. However, something has changed since the last time I purchased it, this must be the &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; others have posted. The product has a different consistency and smell. I use it as a leave in conditioner, and it still works well, just different.</li>
            <li> Yep- I agree with everyone else here. I have been using this product at least since 1992, and it was one of the first products I found that is perfect for my curly hair. I have fine hair with medium curl structure; or as the Ladies at [...] would say, Type 3 curls. (See this linkypoo:[...] If you find that this product isn&#x27;t for you, you can always use it as a nice, light body lotion. However, it&#x27;s pretty perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair products over the years. Nothing feels as good on my curly, thick hair as this leave-in conditioner. It&#x27;s gentle but thick and moisterizing. It even works on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is curly and thick but very fine, it never weighs her hair down. If you&#x27;re looking for a leave-in you can feel, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Ingredients are nice - no nasty chemicals. But it leaves my fine hair very limp. Probably good for thicker, coarser hair, but not for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner detangles even long curly hair with relative ease without an overbearing perfume-y scent (unlike the shampoo that goes with it). Even though this is a leave-in conditioner, I use it in the shower as I would a regular conditioner, massaging it into my scalp so that all hairs get to drink it up. I rinse, but only lightly. Soft hair. No greasiness whatsoever. Even when I&#x27;ve already used it in the shower AND apply it as a leave-in, my hair never feels greasy - just soft. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 17 years.  My Mom who used to be a hairdresser in Rincon, Puerto Rico, used it on her clients and sell it at her beauty salon.  I&#x27;ve moved to Miami, FL 9 years ago, but I managed to find it online since is very difficult to find it locally.  I never let my self run out of it, and I always buy in 32 oz size.  It is a light leave on conditioner that will not add weight your hair, your hair will not feel oily.  I actually use it on my hair and skin, my husband loves it for the skin, and I&#x27;m using it on my toddlers hair too.  This is one of the few products that I will never switch.</li>
            <li> This conditioner can be used as body lotion, I have been using it for ten years. I have very dry &amp; sensitive skin and this stuff works great</li>
            <li> This is not the same product I had been using for years - that one is five stars. I loved how it smelled and what it did for my hair. It tamed the frizz and kept it super healthy (my hair is past my waist). Then they changed the formula (the packaging is different too). At first, I didn&#x27;t really like how it smelled but kept using it, hoping that it would have the same results. First off, it does not keep my curls together like the old type did and then, after using it for some time, I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t look as healthy. Something is definitely missing with this new version and it&#x27;s a shame. I&#x27;m now using Beauty Without Cruelty but while it tames my hair more than this one does, I&#x27;m not sure if it will keep it as healthy yet. Super bummed.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that can be very frizzy. A beautician recommended this product to me many years ago and I have used it ever since. So glad it is available on-line.</li>
            <li> Since I shampoo daily I like to use a small amount of conditioner afterwards. I really like this Gentle conditioner by abba. It&#x27;s light and rinses out well without leaving any residue in my hair. There is very little fragrance which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> The product works as it say on the label. Great for relaxed or curly hair. I have used the product for 3 months and never fails for all hair styles. It is gentle. My hair is very sensitive and usually breaks, I do not have that problem with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner.  I have soft ringlet curls and it never weighs them down.</li>
            <li> 5 star&lt;br /&gt;Keeps down the frizzies in any kind of weather. A little mixed w/ Abba Volumizing Gel  makes a sweet curl from a tangled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend for any one with hard to control curly hair.</li>
            <li> GREAT product, great price!!!  Leave in conditioner or rinse.  Also fantastic for children&#x27;s hair tangles!!!  The smells is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> I have used the abba conditioner for about 20 years and loved it. The smell was pleasant with the old abba, this on the other hand has way too much perfume for me. The saving grace was that after applied and had time to dry, the strong perfume smell dissipated. I was also disappointed with the arrival of the product because the air bag cushions were all to one side and the lid had broke on the bottle. Fortunately it was mostly sealed in a plastic wrap. There was a little loss of the product, but not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 15 years....I have recomended this product over and over...Recently in the last year they switched the formula and its not the same. When I contacted the company and complained they told me basically they changed the formula and that is the way it is. No reguard to a LONG time customer. I still use it because I have not found something to replace it yet that works just as well if not better.  Had the formula been the &amp;#34;Old&amp;#34; one I would have easily given this 5 stars, but I will rate it at a 3 because its just mediocre at this point. I am hoping to find something comprible soon.</li>
            <li> Great product to tame curly hair</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff.  It&#x27;s natural (you can rub it into your skin) and relatively inexpensive compared to other products out there.  My wife has super curly hair and this is the stuff that tames the mane.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have used for over 20 years.  It helps tame my crazy curls.  I was almost out of my last batch and had been unable to find in salons or stores for a while.  I was soooo happy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and in the past I thought it was one of the best.  Recently they gave it a new bottle and changed the formula.  It has a strong smell like dryer sheets and I ca&#x27;t tolerate it...not to mention the people that say, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Fabulous leave-in conditioner.  It totally saved me when I transitioned from brunette to natural (had to bleach my hair 4 times).  So it took me from fried hair to natural, soft and once again curly.  Happy dance here!  I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> My whole family have been using  this for years and we love it! We can&#x27;t go a day without it! This is the lightest weight detangler I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your hair.</li>
            <li> Great on my daughter&#x27;s curls !!!! Love this product. Very gentle and good smell. Make combing job very easy. Family size is great too</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and have used this product for many years. It&#x27;s the only one that seems to effectively produce defined curls. Occasionally I try other products but keep coming back to ABBA Pure Gentle.</li>
            <li> Just ok of a product.  My hair has gotten frizzy with age.  Used the other ABBA leave in condition and tried this one cuz it was cheaper.......it was a mistake.  The product is thicker and sits heavier in my hair.  Gave some to other ladies at office and they like it but they don&#x27;t have frizzy damaged hair so........back to the other one I will go</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised. I have used this as a daily conditioner for years on my curly, thick hair and it works well.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave your hair frizzy, and it is so lite in the hair not heavy, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I just received my years allocation of ABBA gentle condiitioner. They have changed the great ingredients to a more standard conditioner, without the great earbs from before. No anica, no passion flower, no cammomile, no lavender, no roesemary, no....... man, this was the best for reasons of the skin and the hair. I used this as a dual agent and felt good about the ingredients. Take a look at the chemicals now. Far different. Another sad state of corporate dime counters making someting \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; for less cost. And that less cost is ot even passed on to the consumer.&lt;br /&gt;My last allocation.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best hair product I have ever used. I have gotten several friends and family members using it now too. I can&#x27;t imagine a day without it now.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was the new formula and not the old one which was advertised. I like the old formula better than the new one which comes in slightly different bottles. I looked for the old one for that reason. I still use the new one because they will not be making the old formula anymore.</li>
            <li> Pros: Big bottle, gentle to the hair and skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Pricey, Leave In-Conditioner  (I did not know that b/c I don&#x27;t like leave-in since I have acne problems)</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE this product. Couldn&#x27;t live without it. The other reviews are right; if you compare a new bottle to the old one, a new company took over producing this product under the ABBA name, and boy did they scrimp on the plant derived botanicals. It&#x27;s mostly chemicals; several forms of alcohol and half way down extract of cherry bark and aloe just so they can print it on the bottle. I felt obligated to write to the company but we&#x27;ll see how far that goes. If you care about what your body absorbs then maybe think again on this one.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful conditioner And it goes great with the abba moisture shampoo</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for years, always loved it</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair and this is one of only two leave in conditioners that keeps my hair soft and manageable.  I will purchase again when this bottle is near empty.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So disappointed, I have used nourishing leave-in for years, but this is completely different - check the ingredients, it is just another standard formulation with a tiny amount if botanicals thrown in, versus the old formula. Time to look for something else . . . 💫😞</li>
            <li> Ive used this Abba product forever and could not find it anywhere so took a chance on this order. It does kinda the same thing as the original BUT not mostly natural like before when U felt it was good for your Skin &amp; Hair...looks like they went cheaper with chemicals like so many things these days. Bummer of the Summer</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the Gentle Conditioner, not sure I would buy again as it is very watery.  Would rather have something with a little more consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for twenty years+. It was great for curly, fine hair. They changed the ingredients. Now it smells awful! Like old lady hairspray. Makes me nauseous. Ugh. ABBA, change it back, please.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using versions of this for the past 6 or 7 years.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, and they&#x27;ve changed the name twice, the bottle at least twice and this time they changed the ingredients.  The pro quinoa version here is crunchy in your hair, isn&#x27;t as slickening, has a strong smell (which is a problem because a leave in is usually 1 in a bunch of layered products - can&#x27;t have competing smells) and looks white when you put it on wet dark hair.  It gets frothy and takes a long time to absorb into looking clear.  I&#x27;m used to jumping out of the shower, slapping some on, then maybe slapping on something else over it and leaving the house. Now, if I leave the house I look like an insane person with white, frothy hair.  I&#x27;d been putting it off, but I&#x27;ve got to find a different creamy leave in product.  I hung with all their other changes, but they finally lost me. The company seems to have problems all the way around, from distribution to not know how they want to market themselves.  This scares me because I know that it&#x27;s likely it won&#x27;t exist someday, and I&#x27;ll have to find something else.  Now I don&#x27;t have to wait until someday, I&#x27;m jumping off the ship early.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very long and thick curly hair. I have tried every product out there for curly, dry, and damaged hair that I can get my hands on. This is the only product that I will not stray from. I have used this product for 15 years and I always make sure I have a few big bottles at home, to make sure I never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: This will NOT leave your hair crunchy! (Ladies with curly hair, you know how important and hard this is to achieve). It leaves hair soft and shiny, as if there were no product in it. Natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the only product that does not weigh down and does not add volume to curly hair. It gently moisturizes. It does not leave your hair look like it is full of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t say enough good things. It is also very natural. Great as a body lotion as well, but since this is the most important product I use on my hair, I don&#x27;t ever want to \\&quot;waste\\&quot; it as lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 15+ years.  The conditioner in the bottle I purchased online from Amazon most recently was so different I checked to make sure I had purchased the right product.  The name is the same as what I used to buy, and the bottle matches what appears on the pureabba.com web site.  But I feel like I got some kind of cheap knock off.  The conditioner is quite different, the listed ingredients are not the same as the old bottle, and I&#x27;m breaking out in a rash on scalp and neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Works great even as a styling gel if you are going for a softer hold and aren&#x27;t the type to mess with your hair during the day.  I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s also better for your hair/scalp than traditional hair styling products?</li>
            <li> Hate this conditioner...for the fact that it dried my hair out horribly and it was perfumey. Usually when conditioning my hair daily, I use a spritz that I made with purified water, avocado oil, sweet almond oil, Giovanni direct leave in, and Beauty without cruelty leave in...THEN I added a little of this product to the concoction in hopes that it will leave my hair even softer, since it has glycerin in it. Perhaps, because I live in the South the humidity might have affected the way the glycerin in this conditioner worked. Either way, my hair felt brittle, crunchy, dry, breakage was maxed up, and it shed a ton. Scary for African textured hair, I won&#x27;t use it again...unless...they REMOVE THE GLYCERIN FROM THEIR FORMULA and remove all the fragrance. Even when I applied a small amount of it by its self to my hair, I still got the same terrible reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry that I had to write this and I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product works quite well on my hair, which is thick and naturally wavy in some areas, straight in a few areas, and very curly in others.  Always a challenge, I find that by wetting the hair daily, then applying this product alone, allows me to go about my day with very little fuss and muss.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!!  I&#x27;ve used this product for many years on my fine, shoulder length, color treated hair. Most days I style my hair with a curling iron so it could look quite fried if I didn&#x27;t use a good conditioner....and ABBA Gentle really delivers.  I have found that mixing about a tbsp.of the conditioner with 8 ounces of water in a spray bottle is a good way to apply it as a &amp;#34; leave in&amp;#34; conditioner.  (Adjust the ratio as needed for your type of hair.)  The spray can be applied just to the ends and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat or oily looking.  It&#x27;s perfect.  I also highly recommend ABBA&#x27;s Color Protect shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t strip the color and I love the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> these best leave in conditioner i have ever use. I am allergic to sulfa everything. this conditioner does not have any of that. it leaves my hair soft and my scalp moisturized. i cannot suggest this conditioner enough. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 11 years now.  I have very curly hair and this product helps keep my curls together without weighing it down. It keeps my hair healthy as well. Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> Abba is the only conditioner I can use on my hair that won&#x27;t way it down.  I have fine, straight hair and this conditioner is one I have used for years.  It looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> The product is in a different bottle and has a different scent than the one shown. A bit disappointing. It works the same, but the smell is heavier perfume and less fresh. I have always liked the Abba Gentle Conditioner, but would have preferred the product in the bottle with the green label as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The scent, conditioning and price are fantastic!  Hard to find a good leave-in that&#x27;s not grossly overpriced.  This product is a winner in my book!</li>
