            <li>Well, for the price, I wouldn&#x27;t complain :)</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to getting these because I thought they would hold better in my hair with a barrette clip.  </li>
            <li>I will practice more and see if that helps.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Everything was okay except the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is easy to hide under hair but they cling on to hair when trying to take them off.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>how do they sell it for this cheap?</li>
            <li>even the larger one creates a nice bump that is stylish and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The Velcro gets stuck in my long hair really good and is a pain to take out.</li>
            <li>Since it was mailed from China, its not even worth returning it.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and shipped pretty fast considering they came from China.</li>
            <li>These bumps are useful and exactly as they look on the website.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it is suppose to.  </li>

            <li>Thought I&#x27;d like it more, but not really.</li>
            <li>really doubt it to work on the head....</li>
            <li>It does get tangled in the hair easily, so remove carefully</li>
            <li>They have a black sponge with a velcro running through them in the middle on the top and bottom of it.</li>
            <li>Ship faster than estimated, It have a little  bit easy to broken, but very helpful for my hair, I love it</li>
            <li>These are soft bump up clips.</li>
            <li>so ends up looking natural.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have some English directions, too- entire packaging was in Chinese- not very helpful to me!</li>
            <li>I ordered them to bump my hair on both sides when I partition it right in half, but they are 2 different sizes and do not have a clip underneath (against what the title suggests as bump up clip)</li>
            <li>It was a mess to get out got my hair tangled and the volume wasn&#x27;t as high or natural looking.</li>

            <li> I have only tried to put these in my hair a few times, but haven&#x27;t perfected getting them covered</li>
            <li> but it does not fit or look good than making u look odd :(</li>
            <li> These are way smaller than I thought it would be, forget the volumes it can create, you won&#x27;t even know its there once you clip it in, what a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the sense in buying a bump when it&#x27;s toooo small to bump up.....</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this product, unless you want to waste your money!</li>
            <li> too...... small</li>
            <li> (I am not very talented with hair products)</li>
            <li> Absolute crap.  </li>

            <li> Very small... What&#x27;s the sense in buying a bump when it&#x27;s toooo small to bump up.....how ironic</li>
            <li> Ship faster than estimated, It have a little  bit easy to broken, but very helpful for my hair, I love it</li>
            <li> good and easy to use ..!!</li>
            <li> These bumps are useful and exactly as they look on the website.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it is suppose to.  I worry that it can be seen when I use it</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t what I had thought/hoped.  Maybe I used them wrong (I am not very talented with hair products) It was a mess to get out got my hair tangled and the volume wasn&#x27;t as high or natural looking.</li>
            <li> These are soft bump up clips. There is not clip as such just in case you are wondering. They have a black sponge with a velcro running through them in the middle on the top and bottom of it. It is easy to hide under hair but they cling on to hair when trying to take them off. I ordered them to bump my hair on both sides when I partition it right in half, but they are 2 different sizes and do not have a clip underneath (against what the title suggests as bump up clip) so I only used it to poof up my hair in the front. Well, for the price, I wouldn&#x27;t complain :)</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting these because I thought they would hold better in my hair with a barrette clip.  What I received was not what was shown in the pictures- it was two triangular shaped foam pieces with Velcro on both sides in two sizes- no barrette clip.  I have only tried to put these in my hair a few times, but haven&#x27;t perfected getting them covered well- I will practice more and see if that helps.  It does get tangled in the hair easily, so remove carefully so you don&#x27;t damage your hair.  I do like the size of these- even the larger one creates a nice bump that is stylish and not too overpowering.  I would have liked to have some English directions, too- entire packaging was in Chinese- not very helpful to me!</li>
            <li> Absolute crap.  Just go to the art/hobby store and buy some foam instead.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Not too big so ends up looking natural. Easy to put on.</li>
            <li> They do what they are ment to do.  What else can I say about these.  They are cheap and shipped pretty fast considering they came from China.</li>
            <li> I bought this volume clip hoping for a good hair do.. but it does not fit or look good than making u look odd :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. Thought I&#x27;d like it more, but not really. The Velcro gets stuck in my long hair really good and is a pain to take out.</li>
            <li> Work well, good price</li>

            <li> Everything was okay except the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;I really doubt it to work on the head....&lt;br /&gt;Everybody will know if I wear that clip on my head..&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it for the one who looking for the something make volumizing your hair style.</li>
            <li> I bought my wife and I are very pleased with the Vktech 2 Pcs Hair Volume Bump Up Clip Princess Hair Maker Tool Head Insert Tool</li>
            <li> Every girl needs a set!</li>
            <li> not good !!!  too...... small</li>
            <li> As described, it is flex, bend to clip onto your hair on the underside.  Great size for normal to small bump.  Takes a little while to get it, but as expected shipping from so far away ... how do they sell it for this cheap?</li>
