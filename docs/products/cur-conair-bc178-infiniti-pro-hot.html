            <li>While searching Amazon, I found this rotating brush/blow dryer and decided that it will be \\&quot;good enough.\\</li>
            <li>It is also good for touch-up styling between shampoos.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it may depend on the type of hair that you have I think it&#x27;s probably good for the bouncy hair.</li>

            <li>and you&#x27;ll have amazing side swept bangs.</li>
            <li>But it styles your hair nicely.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it storing upright if you want to keep it nice.</li>
            <li>My hair is full and shiny and looks great.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel wonderful - bouncy and soft.</li>
            <li>It is SO easy to use!  </li>
            <li>My hair looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Also, the double-direction spin makes styling the top and bottom of hair a snap.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the rotation.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy, it does not overheat and my hair does not get wrapped around it.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is just barely touching my shoulders, and it give it body at the roots and that it curls my hair under at the ends.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nice and smooth with volume and grace.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product to use especially if your looking to add more volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>I can use this to add body and flip the ends under, flip the ends out, straighten my hair more, or add more of a curl.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what makes this product worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>this product is okay</li>
            <li>I like my blow dryer better</li>
            <li>Probably better for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I received this spinbrush- which was about 4 months ago.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is great for a smooth very relaxed curl/</li>
            <li>Where there are 196 reviews and a lot more detailed facts about it.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>When I took it out of the&lt;br /&gt;box and saw the size of it, I was expecting it to be cumberson; however, it is lightweight and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bulky for travel, but is a fine stay at home tool.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tends to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t hold to the brush well.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST product for my curly hair when I want to straighten it and or add a little body.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is like salon it make my hair huge</li>
            <li>If you have straight hair then it might be great since the roots are already straight</li>
            <li>my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get satisfactory results right out of the box - no practice needed.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT, it does exactly what I was hoping it would do.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush is ok but it flattens the hair a lot</li>
            <li>I love it so much it make my hear smooth,shiny and also roll my hair</li>
            <li>It works at a comfortable temperature and the spinning feature tidies up the hair and is fun to use.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and full of body.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving this.</li>
            <li>The conair brush is good idea but for shorter hair the barrel needs to be smaller and since it is a hairdryer the air flow needs to be stronger and warmer.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out full of body and texture and sooo shiny.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly for straight look.</li>
            <li>It works just as described, my hair is shiny and smooth with just the right amount of curl.</li>
            <li>Good idea for hair to be almost dry.</li>
            <li>Styles well for large waves in hair or smooth shiny look.</li>
            <li>My hair feels smoother and shinier with lots of volume...like that \\&quot;salon fresh feeling!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I think Conair was wise to just keep it simple and do one thing really well instead of trying to meet every need.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while since I have to keep starting over, but the result is nice.</li>
            <li>It also has switches right on the barrel to allow you to instantly switch directions (of the way the brush is spinning) and removing your finger stops the spinning which is great to completely avoid tangling</li>
            <li>For the first time I was able to dry my hair without having to use a curling iron to make it smooth.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like the flat iron does.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves my medium length curly hair quite straight and shiny.  </li>
            <li>First, I semi-dry my hair with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I have wavy to straight shoulder length hair and this brush works wonders on my locks!</li>
            <li>If you want some height, hold close to scalp and  use the higher heat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hot air caused problems to the spin what made it &amp;#34;unuseable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a curling iron</li>
            <li>I finally decided to replaced it but quickly realized that it was no longer readily available.  </li>
            <li>It will be more effective when your hair is almost dry, about 90% dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been good at styling my limp, straight hair until I used this styler.</li>
            <li>I have long thick frizzy hair and it came out perfect!</li>
            <li>The size of handle and brush is too large for me to hold.</li>
            <li>It absolutely blows the RevoStyler away.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know as I am very dependent upon it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I have naturally very curly hair</li>
            <li>For people with straight hair I imagine it will add lots of volume because it picks up the hair at the scalp.</li>
            <li>But I do really like it.</li>
            <li>I have used several rotating stylers and while this design is not perfect, I find it the best one on the market right now.</li>
            <li>Other than having to use two dryers, I love the way my hair looks after using this product.</li>
            <li>It does not make it poker straight, like the flat iron, but straight enough with a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>Has cool, low heat, high heat settings</li>
            <li>When this item was shipped, it came with slightly bent bristles on one side and they bent even more on storage.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>If I use mousse I can have \\&quot;high hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I let it sit for a minute on high heat</li>
            <li>This easy to use styler leaves hair shiny and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is not as strong as a regular blow dryer and will take a long time to dry/style your hair if you use it alone.  </li>
            <li>Dried my hair much more quickly than any other hairbrush drier that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I am pretty basic and this brush does the trick.</li>
            <li>I thought of trying it long back but was worried whether ti would damage my hair more,but after i used it I ,it gives me same shine &amp; volume as if I did it in salon :)</li>
            <li>Otherwise, my semi gray hair which is wiry and my dark hair which is much straighter, fluff out and frizz out giving the head a very full look.</li>
            <li>and it is not at all for people with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Depending upon how fast or slow I go I can have my hair curly or smooth.</li>
            <li>Doesnt blow out enough heat, didnt curl or smooth out my hair the way a normal blow dryer and round brush</li>
            <li>One trick I discovered is using the brush on my long bangs and have it rotate forward and then gently use your hands to put your bangs to the side</li>
            <li>I do have to clean out the brush with my tweezers, removing trapped hair rather regularly.</li>
            <li>It can catch and pull my hair if I am not careful using it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with naturally curly hair especially kinky hair.</li>
            <li>A   warning:  if you have a lot of hair or are usually in a hurry, which I am most of the time, you will need to dry your hair with a regular blow dryer and half-way style it.</li>
            <li>does.i thought since it was pretty pricey,it would actually work for my hair.didnt do anything but waste time.</li>
            <li>I have a short bob, thin hair, and love that I towel dry my  hair, then use this as a dryer and styler.  </li>

            <li> and it is not at all for people with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Depending upon how fast or slow I go I can have my hair curly or smooth.</li>
            <li> Doesnt blow out enough heat, didnt curl or smooth out my hair the way a normal blow dryer and round brush</li>
            <li> One trick I discovered is using the brush on my long bangs and have it rotate forward and then gently use your hands to put your bangs to the side</li>
            <li> I do have to clean out the brush with my tweezers, removing trapped hair rather regularly.</li>
            <li> It can catch and pull my hair if I am not careful using it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with naturally curly hair especially kinky hair.</li>
            <li> A   warning:  if you have a lot of hair or are usually in a hurry, which I am most of the time, you will need to dry your hair with a regular blow dryer and half-way style it.</li>
            <li> does.i thought since it was pretty pricey,it would actually work for my hair.didnt do anything but waste time.</li>
            <li> I have a short bob, thin hair, and love that I towel dry my  hair, then use this as a dryer and styler.  </li>
            <li> My hair is plain straight</li>
            <li> I can finally get rid of my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Plus, I figured the rotating engine wouldn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I use a traditional blow dryer to get it almost dry and then style with this.  </li>
            <li> First time I used the product, it was a little awkward getting used to which way it rotated, but it did a fabulous job on my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only issue i have with it is that it&#x27;s easy to get nearby hairs tangled and twisted when using the rotating function, so be careful  to section off your hair so this does not happen.</li>
            <li> I have only my right hand to use, because of a brain hemorrhage I had 13 years ago that left my left arm and hand useless.  </li>
            <li> -dry my hair with a regular blow dryer until it&#x27;s about 70% dry and finish the job with this rotating styler.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be  easier or faster, and hold the style, ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> brush is wide enough for my hair which is wavy</li>
            <li> a long over -due idea that makes sense and actually works!</li>
            <li> In minutes my hair was dry, shiny and had lots of volume and shine.</li>
            <li> so I still have to blow dry it because it doesn&#x27;t straighten the roots</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to stop, dry a section and then go to another section.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 11yro, but have stolen for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderfully on wet hair, gives curl and body all in one.  </li>
            <li> This spinning hair dryer picks up the hair as I drag it through my scalp</li>
            <li> No more trying to blow my hair dry and use a round brush at the same time.</li>
            <li> You will waste your time if you try to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin straight</li>
            <li> It cut about half the time I used to need to style my hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something faster &amp; that was less work than blowdrying</li>
            <li> I had with a previous version of a spinning dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I say \\&quot;No, just washed and dried it at home\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Try a few time to get a feel for the direction of brush.</li>
            <li> The added blow-dryer feature means that you don&#x27;t need to hold a blow dryer and the rotating brush simultaneously (which would get heavy and cumbersome!).  </li>
            <li> No more messing around with brushes and dryers.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained that it doesn&#x27;t have an interchangeable small barrel for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> I have short/medium length thick hair and this tool has shortened the time it takes me to dry/style</li>
            <li> Not good for shrt hair.</li>
            <li> My styling time has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> Saves my poor tired arms from all the pulling.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be another case of buying something, trying it, and being sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Well, was I wrong!!  </li>

            <li> My hair feels smoother and shinier with lots of volume...like that \\&quot;salon fresh feeling!\\&quot; It cut about half the time I used to need to style my hair. For reference, I have medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, it does exactly what I was hoping it would do. I have people ask me all the time if I just came from the hairdresser and I say \\&quot;No, just washed and dried it at home\\&quot;. Highly recommend this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I absoulutely love this!!  I bought it for my 11yro, but have stolen for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderfully on wet hair, gives curl and body all in one.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> this is the best product that I ever had,it is awesome I love it so much it make my hear smooth,shiny and also roll my hair&lt;br /&gt;it is like salon it make my hair huge&lt;br /&gt;I like it I Recommend to every one</li>
            <li> I received this styling dryer for Christmas, and it is incredible.  I think it is the greatest.  I have always been inept at using a brush and a dryer at the same time and this truly works.  I would recommend it to anyone.  My hair is full and shiny and looks great.  Thank you Conair for developing it.  Marian</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been good at styling my limp, straight hair until I used this styler. I was spin brushing within minutes of taking it out of the box. My hair did not tangle in the brush at all while it was spinning. In minutes my hair was dry, shiny and had lots of volume and shine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in a store, not even knowing how it worked.  I have almost chin length hair that tends to frizz.  First time I used the product, it was a little awkward getting used to which way it rotated, but it did a fabulous job on my hair.  I looked like I had just walked out of my stylist&#x27;s salon.  I loved it so much I wanted another one, but the store had sold out.  I ordered one on-line and now I have one to keep at home and one for travel.  For me, this is a life saver!  I have only my right hand to use, because of a brain hemorrhage I had 13 years ago that left my left arm and hand useless.  Finally, I can have well styled hair done by myself, using just one hand.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves my medium length curly hair quite straight and shiny.  It works at a comfortable temperature and the spinning feature tidies up the hair and is fun to use.  Some reviewers have complained that it doesn&#x27;t have an interchangeable small barrel for shorter hair.  I think Conair was wise to just keep it simple and do one thing really well instead of trying to meet every need.  It&#x27;s too bulky for travel, but is a fine stay at home tool.</li>
            <li> I love it!! It makes my hair shiny and full of body. My hair looks better than ever. It is also very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like the flat iron does.</li>
            <li> I have a short bob, thin hair, and love that I towel dry my  hair, then use this as a dryer and styler.  Couldn&#x27;t be  easier or faster, and hold the style, ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.I thought of trying it long back but was worried whether ti would damage my hair more,but after i used it I ,it gives me same shine &amp; volume as if I did it in salon :)</li>
            <li> I had the Revo Styler for years until it stopped working about 1 year ago.  I finally decided to replaced it but quickly realized that it was no longer readily available.  While searching Amazon, I found this rotating brush/blow dryer and decided that it will be \\&quot;good enough.\\&quot;  Well, was I wrong!!  It absolutely blows the RevoStyler away.  It is SO easy to use!  The added blow-dryer feature means that you don&#x27;t need to hold a blow dryer and the rotating brush simultaneously (which would get heavy and cumbersome!).  Also, the double-direction spin makes styling the top and bottom of hair a snap. I blow-dry my hair with a regular blow dryer until it&#x27;s about 70% dry and finish the job with this rotating styler.  I&#x27;m done in 10-15 minutes with salon looking hair! I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT RESERVATION!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Love the rotation. It takes a bit to learn how to control the roll, but once you do it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> a great product, does what it says. a long over -due idea that makes sense and actually works! ( please note that my hair is medium length at best)</li>
            <li> I purchased the Spin Air brush about six months ago from a local beauty shop. Has it improved the appearance of my hair? Absolutely. I get great comments on my hair since using the Spin Air brush. I do have to clean out the brush with my tweezers, removing trapped hair rather regularly. It can catch and pull my hair if I am not careful using it. However, I use it every time I style my hair. First, I semi-dry my hair with a blow dryer. Then, I apply the Spin Air to sections of my hair and it truly smooths the strands and makes them quite shiny. I like the look a lot. Otherwise, my semi gray hair which is wiry and my dark hair which is much straighter, fluff out and frizz out giving the head a very full look.I have used several rotating stylers and while this design is not perfect, I find it the best one on the market right now. What would I do without it? I don&#x27;t know as I am very dependent upon it and I am not one to fuss or muss with my hair. I am pretty basic and this brush does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have now used this styler for about a week.  It actually does what it advertises.  My hair is fine and tends to be frizzy.  This easy to use styler leaves hair shiny and less frizzy.  My styling time has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> The conair infiniti pro hot air curler is awesome!  My hair looks healthy, it does not overheat and my hair does not get wrapped around it.  I am glad I bought it.  My hair is just barely touching my shoulders, and it give it body at the roots and that it curls my hair under at the ends.  I am glad I bought this an did not overspend on the Revo curler.</li>
            <li> The conair BC178 Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler is amazing. For the first time I was able to dry my hair without having to use a curling iron to make it smooth. It works just as described, my hair is shiny and smooth with just the right amount of curl. I have long thick frizzy hair and it came out perfect! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> When it comes to blowing my hair I have 2 left hands!&lt;br /&gt;This is WONDERFUL !!! I can do my shoulder length hair with ease,no holding&lt;br /&gt;blower and brush eeeeekkkk !!!!&lt;br /&gt;The brush is wide enough for my hair which is wavy and I do have quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my locks almost as great as in the salon and I have saved $$$$.&lt;br /&gt;Love this and when I need to touch  it up,I dampen my hair ..and poof the&lt;br /&gt;brush leaves it awesome&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Conair for this invention !!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of the infiniti pro spin air brushes. One of the brushes came in an opened box and the brush was out of the plastic and looks like it may have been used.</li>
            <li> This same product is under another listing -http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004INUWX0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title&lt;br /&gt;  Where there are 196 reviews and a lot more detailed facts about it.  it is a GREAT tool!</li>
            <li> I bought this Conair Bc178 Ifinitipro spin air for my wife. She loves it.  Especially when she have to style her hair. Thank&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this rotating brush by conair! I have wavy to straight shoulder length hair and this brush works wonders on my locks! It leaves my hair nice and smooth with volume and grace. If your looking for a electric powered brush then I recommend you get this one. One trick I discovered is using the brush on my long bangs and have it rotate forward and then gently use your hands to put your bangs to the side and you&#x27;ll have amazing side swept bangs. Wonderful product to use especially if your looking to add more volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this. It definitely saves a lot of time and is a must buy for those who want salon results at home. No more messing around with brushes and dryers.</li>
            <li> Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler performed just as advertised.  I have short/medium length thick hair and this tool has shortened the time it takes me to dry/style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get satisfactory results right out of the box - no practice needed.  It is also good for touch-up styling between shampoos.  When I took it out of the&lt;br /&gt;box and saw the size of it, I was expecting it to be cumberson; however, it is lightweight and easy to hold.  Don&#x27;t know what I did without it all these years.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is ok but it flattens the hair a lot and it is not at all for people with naturally curly hair. I am african american and I have naturally very curly hair so I still have to blow dry it because it doesn&#x27;t straighten the roots so when I used only this, my hair frizzed since the roots weren&#x27;t straightened. I won&#x27;t buy it again. I was hoping for something faster &amp; that was less work than blowdrying but I guess I have to stick with a blowdryer. If you have straight hair then it might be great since the roots are already straight but I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with naturally curly hair especially kinky hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, you need to be patient. Try a few time to get a feel for the direction of brush. Good idea for hair to be almost dry. Also use a smoother it will give a shine. Not good for shrt hair. If you want some height, hold close to scalp and  use the higher heat.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel wonderful - bouncy and soft. My hair is plain straight and I have an angled bob.  I can use this to add body and flip the ends under, flip the ends out, straighten my hair more, or add more of a curl.  If I use mousse I can have \\&quot;high hair\\&quot;.  No more trying to blow my hair dry and use a round brush at the same time. This does it all for me.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be another case of buying something, trying it, and being sorry I bought it. But for my curly, frizzy hair, this has been a godsend. I can still have my curls, but the frizz is gone. This spinning hair dryer picks up the hair as I drag it through my scalp so I don&#x27;t have to stop, dry a section and then go to another section. Depending upon how fast or slow I go I can have my hair curly or smooth. For people with straight hair I imagine it will add lots of volume because it picks up the hair at the scalp. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is great for a smooth very relaxed curl/wavy hair look. Dried my hair much more quickly than any other hairbrush drier that I&#x27;ve ever used. The only issue i have with it is that it&#x27;s easy to get nearby hairs tangled and twisted when using the rotating function, so be careful  to section off your hair so this does not happen.</li>
            <li> Doesnt blow out enough heat, didnt curl or smooth out my hair the way a normal blow dryer and round brush does.i thought since it was pretty pricey,it would actually work for my hair.didnt do anything but waste time.</li>
            <li> The conair brush is good idea but for shorter hair the barrel needs to be smaller and since it is a hairdryer the air flow needs to be stronger and warmer.  Thirty years ago I used a similar item but it was discontinued.  But I do really like it.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my hair styling tools.  My hair comes out full of body and texture and sooo shiny.  A   warning:  if you have a lot of hair or are usually in a hurry, which I am most of the time, you will need to dry your hair with a regular blow dryer and half-way style it. Once it&#x27;s almost styled, you can switch over to this dryer and quite effortlessly, finish styling your hair using the rotating styler.  That&#x27;s what makes this product worthwhile.  The dryer is not as strong as a regular blow dryer and will take a long time to dry/style your hair if you use it alone.  Other than having to use two dryers, I love the way my hair looks after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have bought this item because of the facility of delivering.&lt;br /&gt;The hot air caused problems to the spin what made it &amp;#34;unuseable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product for my curly hair when I want to straighten it and or add a little body.  I use a traditional blow dryer to get it almost dry and then style with this.  It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a curling iron so before I start using it I let it sit for a minute on high heat so it warms up.  Saves my poor tired arms from all the pulling.  It also has switches right on the barrel to allow you to instantly switch directions (of the way the brush is spinning) and removing your finger stops the spinning which is great to completely avoid tangling I had with a previous version of a spinning dryer.  Love it!  Just love it!</li>
            <li> This item is very good .conair is good brands.my wife said this better than styler.is good blower I like it .</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received this spinbrush- which was about 4 months ago. It is pretty good. But its not a hair dryer. It will be more effective when your hair is almost dry, about 90% dry. You will waste your time if you try to dry your hair. Its only for styling. It spins both ways and with hot/cool air option. The size of handle and brush is too large for me to hold. I would have preferred if it was smaller. But it styles your hair nicely. I use it mostly for straight look. I can finally get rid of my flat iron. It does not make it poker straight, like the flat iron, but straight enough with a healthy shine. When I keep in in my drawer, its bristles bended. When this item was shipped, it came with slightly bent bristles on one side and they bent even more on storage. I would recommend it storing upright if you want to keep it nice.</li>
            <li> this product is okay I like my blow dryer better I find out my hair comes out fuller I have very thin straight .&lt;br /&gt;it may depend on the type of hair that you have I think it&#x27;s probably good for the bouncy hair.</li>
            <li> Styles well for large waves in hair or smooth shiny look. Brush turns in both directions or is stationery.  Has cool, low heat, high heat settings</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t hold to the brush well. It takes a while since I have to keep starting over, but the result is nice. Probably better for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t what I was hoping it would be, so i returned it. I am a regular hot air brush user and usually use a basic one but decided to give this one a try.  I prefer my regular one. This one doesn&#x27;t put enough tension on my hair for straightening. Plus, I figured the rotating engine wouldn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
