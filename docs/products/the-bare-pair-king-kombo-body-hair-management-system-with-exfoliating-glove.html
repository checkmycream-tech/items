            <li>Said it was a great alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, 1st</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]]for trimming up the rest of the forest, this is a great way to get the look (and feel) you want.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for me; I leave it on for up to 20 minutes while reading,and never had any burning problems.</li>
            <li>I had no burning and skin felt great afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The product works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>The company has a great sense of humor (just read the tube it comes in).</li>
            <li>Buy this product and get great results.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions, it&#x27;ll work great for you.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>Didnt work that great for us</li>
            <li>The great thing about this product is that it does the job its intended to do without reducing you to a blubbering pile of quivering jello laying upon the ground in a fetal position.  </li>
            <li>These are great items that accomplish what they state</li>
            <li>Product works like it says it should and have ordered again and great service as well.</li>
            <li>but it works GREAT.</li>
            <li>I immediately experienced a burning sensation that increased in intensity as I proceeded.</li>
            <li>Also worked great on the taint.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>It is very effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome product worked great for me needed the full 15 to be successful!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t blame the product,) were amazing!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair you need to have for this to work on you, but know that your mileage may vary, so buy this product with caution!</li>
            <li>, do not use body wash or any kind of soap after using this!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution, I love this depilatory cream as well as the lotion.</li>
            <li>It was pleasant.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I were very impressed with the results of the product; easy to apply, comfort during use and washes off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product as it&#x27;s easy to use and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>can take a good deal of pain</li>
            <li>This is especially important to me, because I share a bathroom, so it&#x27;s nice to keep my business MY business, and not have others knowing what you&#x27;ve &#x27;just done&#x27; in the bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once the burning subsided the smooth feel was awesome,  however, I am terrified to use it again.</li>
            <li>good to go</li>
            <li>A good razor does just as well.</li>
            <li>and I think I should get a good number of uses out of one tube.</li>
            <li>Makes everything silky smooth and delightful.</li>
            <li>it smells good too.  </li>
            <li>My advice, stay away from this and shave with a good razor.</li>
            <li>I laughed.</li>
            <li>being said I ordered this off a recommendation from a friend who loved it to groom the Bits and some on my back.&lt;br /&gt;Had experience with veet and nair</li>
            <li>Just because you&#x27;re good to go for nine minutes</li>
            <li>minutes in one area, you may not be good to go for nine minutes plus in another -- this was also my experience.</li>
            <li>I recommend having a good book or magazine to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Wash it off and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>Coupled with a good trimmer like the Bodygroomer</li>
            <li>Some tenderness but rub the soothing balm and your good.</li>
            <li>how they can say this has a &#x27;mouth-watering smell&#x27; is beyond me, it smells just like NAIR, and that&#x27;s not at all mouth-watering.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>just felt a tinglingy feeling but did good removed her in 10 min .</li>
            <li>Hopefully will report with good news.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>as good.</li>
            <li>I gave it a fair chance (3 times).</li>
            <li>Works great and it was easy!</li>
            <li>I loved how it felt to be smooth again!!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to see that the product worked just like advertised.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome combination with the calm balm included in the package.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on consecutive days, followed the directions exactly, and still don&#x27;t have perfect smoothness.</li>
            <li>Truth is, the name of the product gave me a chuckle, so I checked it out - and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>(make sure to wash thoroughly immediately after!).</li>
            <li>Much better than going to get waxed!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li>This stuff works magic!</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t get too confident!</li>
            <li>Okay for body hair not recommended for use on balls!</li>
            <li>the lotion it comes with is amazing, it stays on until I shower it off.</li>
            <li>I used this on my shoulders to test it and worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li>The area under my tummy where the happy trail is, was the area that didn&#x27;t get thoroughly smooth.  </li>
            <li>Again, the happy trail area was just...  not as smooth.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend kind of as a joke, and when he opened it he looked at me like I was nuts (no pun intended), but he loves it, and so do I.</li>
            <li>I kind of knew this was not going to work, with \\&quot;Veet\\</li>
            <li>The soothing cream is nice and def.</li>
            <li>thought I would give this a try since so many people had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I had to push the 10 minute mark, but BallsBalm did the job in spectacular fashion.</li>
            <li>I am still loving this product.</li>
            <li>Ran my leg under warm water and smoothed the glove around in circles.</li>
            <li>and i couldn&#x27;t find any until i purchased this product and to be HONEST</li>
            <li>and I would be able to spread it out fairly even.</li>
            <li>The after lotion is also quite nice.</li>
            <li>Unless you are superman, and have some kind of kryptonian superhuman skin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer choking on my own scrote ribbon that got lodged in her teeth</li>
            <li>Also the fact that everything you need comes in the kit is incredibly nice and convenient.</li>
            <li>but that didn&#x27;t prove effective</li>
            <li>Me being me, I liked the idea</li>
            <li>I hope you&#x27;ve liked my review.</li>
            <li>so your neighbors won&#x27;t think you are some kind of pornstar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On healthy skin (like they fairly warn on the packaging)</li>
            <li>but however the smell was nice...</li>
            <li>Anyway, after waiting the allotted time, I took a warm shower.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it  is as effective and the product has to stay on for 10 to 14 minutes.</li>
            <li>Has kind of a minty thing going on that helps to sooth the experience.  </li>
            <li>The after care lotion is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>Do so at your own risk.</li>
            <li>and honestly I was a bit skeptic but</li>
            <li>I really liked reading the directions.</li>
            <li>, then it doesn&#x27;t work that well in the end.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Calm Balm&amp;#34; is awesome, it really does cool and make my skin feel great after i use Nair to remove my hair.</li>
            <li>(that can be easily washed away with a pleasant smelling body soap)</li>
            <li>Very good product thanks!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes a quick shave in between sessions works just great.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure glad it did!  </li>
            <li>it smells better than most!</li>
            <li>kinda nice considering that you have to wear the stuff for 15 minutes or more at a time.  </li>
            <li>but then it makes you nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best thing that $15.99 could buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better experiences with Nair, to be honest.</li>
            <li>The problem is that is that it&#x27;s neither more effective or easier than using a razor.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I never found a product to clean up ball hair than one that works as good as this.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for me, my partner had to cover x2 in order for it to work overall a great set for the price</li>
            <li>I was extremely smooth and felt very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I think I have tried them all and found bare balls to be the best out there.</li>
            <li>This is pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, and the Calm Balm was nice and soothing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You receive exactly what you are looking for, and it&#x27;s a great value as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This may be true, but I&#x27;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and believe some people out there probably have had good results with this product.  </li>
            <li>The good it leaves the jewels nice and smooth never had them that smooth</li>
            <li>Be sure to flush the area liberally and for a good while with cool water.</li>
            <li>Putting on the dipilatory with the stick makes its use nice and easy.  </li>
            <li>then you might be better off sticking to your shaving.</li>
            <li>I will point out though that if you&#x27;re able to afford [[ASIN:B005IGUUBU</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is a lot better than having cuts, and bumps from shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re better off using this in the morning rather than the night before.</li>
            <li>then you will be okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they sell that without the ballsBalm hair remover.</li>
            <li>and they love it.  </li>
            <li>It feels great and really sooths your skin.</li>
            <li>Feel sexy now?</li>
            <li>Just shaving might be easier and get better results...</li>
            <li>That is why you must wait a while to do its magic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this product.</li>
            <li>(mostly) does not bother me(although</li>
            <li>If I wanted to remove all the hair on my body I would need more than 1 of these(more like 5 or 6).</li>
            <li>the nair for men works much better.</li>
            <li>My balls have never felt better.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I was especially pleased with the area at the joint of the leg and body, but this area was also burning the most, left some salve on without rubbing it in, it cooled that off too.</li>
            <li>Nair (womens stuff) seems to work much better</li>
            <li>and I am 90% pleased.</li>
            <li>The hair removal cream was thicker than most and seemed made for a guy.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work as well or better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>If you choose to buy this product, for the love of your balls, please do a test patch before slathering it all over.</li>
            <li>just make sure</li>
            <li>Well, it works for sure, but it sometimes leaves patches of stubble in some places and removes everything in another spot...</li>
            <li>Is it better than shaving?</li>
            <li>Just be sure to apply generously and spread around even after that until coat while you wait.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over two weeks now and it is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Thanks Balls Balm for a great product.</li>
            <li>Works as described,but make sure to count application time with wait time or you might regret it.</li>
            <li>I figured if it was safe for the balls, it should be safe for the nipples.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it works better on some types of skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Groin is mostly 8-10 minutes I would say.</li>
            <li>I think this is the most genius part of the system.</li>
            <li>and I am sure he is going to love it.</li>
            <li>Should be interesting. :)</li>
            <li>do have to leave the product on more towards the maximum time recommended.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this kit was the glove that i now use when i use a different hair removal cream, the second best was the &amp;#34;Calm Balm&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Okay I am not going to lie</li>
            <li>I shave just like most guys, but it&#x27;s like being tortured.</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>however make sure you keep an eye on the time.</li>
            <li>and that was better since I kept it on for 16 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of just shaving or getting waxed for a better result.</li>
            <li>My roommates got a good laugh at me gettin \\&quot;Ball</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done, I feel FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice way to stay smooth.</li>
            <li>its ok though kinda guessed that would happen.</li>
            <li>going to order more.</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>Great product finally a real product for us guys.</li>
            <li>I bought this to keep my koojons nice and smooth and to get away from a razor.</li>
            <li>It immediately felt better and after rinsing thoroughly I liberally applied the calming gel.  </li>
            <li>Leaves you smooth!</li>
            <li>it can also lead to many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Great product and works REALLY well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn, and works better than anything I&#x27;ve bought otc.</li>
            <li>All was well, until I started \\&quot;groping\\&quot; myself, as the directions humorously call for, with the provided cotton glove.  </li>
            <li>I applied to my chest and ended up leaving it on for 17 minutes to be sure it took the hair off.</li>
            <li>much, MUCH better than shaving.  </li>
            <li>does tingle but your on your precious jewels that have alot of sensitivity</li>
            <li>This was really kind to my &amp;#34;parts&amp;#34; and worked comfortably well.</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>Further the sticks and glove are brilliant!</li>
            <li>The calming balm aided a bit in that department, but was mostly ineffective after a couple of hours or so.  </li>
            <li>What was most ineffective was the hair removal cream itself which appeared to not remove anything at all.  </li>
            <li>I am taking the time to write this review because of how unconditionally satisfied I am with ballsBalm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell like your girlfriend&#x27;s scented lotion, but why should it?</li>
            <li>And as soon as I can get the word out, dozens more where that came from.</li>
            <li>but damn it can really light you on fire!  </li>
            <li>The glove is awesome, In light of loosing money purchasing this product, I did get a great laugh smacking my friend in the head with this glove the very next day after using it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow the instructions that come with it</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t wait to step up to the plate and commit to better pubic management.</li>
            <li>I need to be able to find it again...</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>a better note</li>
            <li>But once I scrubbed the area, it was silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Perhaps you&#x27;ll have better results than I, for if you&#x27;re still reading, you&#x27;ll notice I did not use the soothing gel part of the kit, as I didn&#x27;t see any need.</li>
            <li>In fact, the Calm Balm feels so good that I use it routinely after showering.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you do try after 7-8 minutes and see if it&#x27;s already done the job.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>We was hoping for the same awesome results.  </li>
            <li>Ok I got this item in hopes it would work</li>
            <li>AND it says you can should be able to use it about every two to three weeks.</li>
            <li>It has a chemically odor, noticeable but not nasty.  </li>
            <li>Well, this is interesting stuff.</li>
            <li>More of a notification that you&#x27;ve put something on your balls</li>
            <li>I have tried many hair management products which were all unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for about 5 minutes more than they say.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my huevos nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>sure you use a washcloth or the &#x27;exfoliating glove&#x27; included, as the hair will nit just rinse away</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re adventurous use a finger to schmear</li>
            <li>I am fair-skinned and more on the light-haired end of the spectrum.  </li>
            <li>When I got out I was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>however overall I was impressed.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>\\&quot;OK</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the instructions</li>
            <li>Gets my balls and shaft nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>The glove should be made more of a loofa material, instead it&#x27;s more like cotton</li>
            <li>I have a lot more hair on my chest and it seemed the cream had a tougher time here.</li>
            <li>even on a gorilla like me :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely the best package for male hair removal out there.</li>
            <li>so make sure to remove within the time limit specified.  </li>
            <li>(Kinda cute)</li>
            <li>I have been using Nair for years, with positive, un remarkable results.  </li>
            <li>It was kind burning but a couple of applications of the soothing skin salve was refreshing, and got me cool again.</li>
            <li>so I was trying to find a solution that will allow me to get rid of hair easily as well as something that will leave my skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>With that said, it did the job fairly well the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, a pretty good product</li>
            <li>That stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and pain free!  </li>
            <li>The application sticks make sure you apply the correct amount of remover cream and the included glove helps you remove the hair easily in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No amount of exfoliating, soaking in warm water, lotions, steaming, or fresh blades of any number have been able to fix this.</li>
            <li>nothing too strong, also the glove isn&#x27;t super effective</li>
            <li>You may need to do a couple of applications for best results but that&#x27;s easy to do and is better than any other way.</li>
            <li>You skin looks a lot better and does feel smooth afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To keep things short and sweet; is it perfect?</li>
            <li>The hair comes off way better with light, vigorous, rubbing (but remove the cream thoroughly before doing so, otherwise you&#x27;ll just rub it into the skin and end up with a burn)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it to give my husband a more smooth feeling than shaving and rue the day I did :</li>
            <li>The Calm Balm was a nice touch and seemed to help.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;calm balm\\&quot; feels wonderful after using the \\&quot;bare balm.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The MOST important thing to remember is NOT to keep the cream on longer that 10-12 mins tops.</li>
            <li>They loved it so much that I</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant but the good reviews cleared my fears and I purchased.</li>
            <li>Then, if all was good to go with the test area, I recommend that you can move towards the whole region, doing it just like you did for the test.</li>
            <li>No need to worry about accident nicking her special areas when using this stuff!</li>
            <li>I finally have a good product to get rid of all my unwanted hairs, in all my unwanted places!</li>
            <li>Why use the the other stuff after perfect?)</li>
            <li>but wiped away easily and did the job.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you apply a good amount of the product or it wont remove the hair completely.</li>
            <li>Cleans up easily and the outcome was smoother than my razor.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure this would clean up all the hair I can&#x27;t get to</li>
            <li>so I figured this would be easy .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its also easy to use(even</li>
            <li>The glove makes it easy to remove in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper, more effective, and easier, as I&#x27;ve found out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better results once I use it a couple more times and figure out the best way to use it, but the bottom-line is - it works, and it is very easy to use, and it is very fast compared to shaving.</li>
            <li>So I ran a second attempt to get the happy trail area smooth and more hairless.  </li>
            <li>Then tried on ma balls and general groin area and it worked great as well.  </li>
            <li>So, this is my first time using this kind of product.</li>
            <li>but it kind of blew me away when I first smelled it.   </li>
            <li>this product is awesome, the combined removal and balm works really well with no after affects just bought some more as a back up!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool and refreshing and makes your junk smell good!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amending my original review and going to say it really just good for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I squeezed the tube full blast on my nuts and spread it with the stick , waited exactly 12 minutes instead of 11 , got into shower with cotton glove , and BAM !!!</li>
            <li>The Calm Balm is still a nice product, not a bad moisturizing cream at all.    </li>
            <li>When you first apply, use more than you think you need, and bit more than that.</li>
            <li>That felt fine, but</li>
            <li>I spot tested it and everything seemed fine.</li>
            <li>but the day after I feel fine.</li>
            <li>or so should do fine)</li>
            <li>(The stuff worked fine.</li>
            <li>Hair was removed just fine.</li>
            <li>The stuff works just fine.</li>
            <li>I had slightly more irritation, but it went away quickly.</li>
            <li>and I feel nothing down there except the awesome feeling of smooth balls.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s good, but Veet is better than this on any day, clean more deep and smoth.</li>
            <li>Works great on longer hair, less effective on shorter (trimmed) hair.</li>
            <li>that just changed right now, With this product I could EASILY remove my hair and it works like magic with me,</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful compared to other products, and it also works great so long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin areas with fine hair.</li>
            <li>you will need to order a huge amount of the stuff...</li>
            <li>If you enjoy having skin on your junk, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This does make you smooth when used correctly, and assuming you don&#x27;t miss any spots.</li>
            <li>it took me 3x 15 minute applications to get smooth.</li>
            <li>balls have never been this smooth before.</li>
            <li>no burns, just smooth skin.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed, and I like smooth legs, so I was still going to do</li>
            <li>My skin has been levels of smooth</li>
            <li>and I have a light stubble now, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably do it again tomorrow, but I expect the repetition to be about what I&#x27;d do shaving to keep my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>Great shortly after application to touch.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth look anywhere on your body this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I am now hair free and smooth.</li>
            <li>The glove is important.</li>
            <li>I visited the Dr. today and he confirmed an allergic reaction to the stuff.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t las tong, and I feel soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>You want the area to be free from body oils, but not scrubbed clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a much milder and equally effective product.</li>
            <li>as smooth as a babies</li>
            <li>I could say I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom here, but you would have to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li>Everything stayed smooth for about five days before I started feeling prickly, but it was five days of heaven.</li>
            <li>The rest, like the um.. sack was smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li>Unless you enjoy your balls being on fire without relief for weeks, then I would suggest not using this product.</li>
            <li>My ballz are so smooth</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with it&#x27;s effectiveness, any irritation and it does get the area I treat smooth.</li>
            <li>It removes light hair well and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>Lather up as the directions on the tube indicate and be prepared for an oh so smooth experience</li>
            <li>This is an incredibly effective and reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li>You will want to use it about 2-3 times a week if you want to be really smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>my balls finally be smooth?</li>
            <li>The woman really enjoy this on guys.</li>
            <li>to use, easy clean up.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m smooth as can be.</li>
            <li>There is no pain and it leaves your scrotum and shaft hairless and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Finally a product men can use and it delivers great results.</li>
            <li>balls as smooth as the day i was born</li>
            <li>It actually comes with two applicator sticks that work great, as well as the advertised contents.</li>
            <li>Even those light touches hurt like hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was only able to get really good results after about 25 minutes, but it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, the reason I&#x27;m writing this review is because I know that when I was looking into trying this Balls Balm product for the first time, I wanted to find a thorough review of both the pros and cons of the product, something that explained in fairly good detail what I could expect before taking the risk for myself.</li>
            <li>I needed something that would be effective yet sensitive and this delivered!!!</li>
            <li>make sure you get the cream on the skin, right at the root of your hair.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t get it all unless you&#x27;re very careful about applying it, it does an incredible job at removing what it covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would recommend Balls if you want that &#x27;clean and smooth&#x27; feeling...</li>
            <li>if you have light amounts of body hair, and just want a clean look, maybe this will work for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright white and easy to pick out when you miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test Spot:&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Though it had a mild burn sensation, but as it promised in removing hair easily, so far, so good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is more gimicky and probably meant as a funny gift.</li>
            <li>No bad reaction, no pain just smooth balls.   </li>
            <li>so your significant others don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in package.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try 9 minutes the first time just to be safe.</li>
            <li>Was excited to get this so that I could use it on \\&quot;the boys\\&quot; instead of shaving all of the time.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it does exactly what you guys say it does</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t use it on any genitalia, I&#x27;ve only used it on my rear end, but thus far after two applications it&#x27;s worked great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product as long as you FOLLOW the directions.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this product was ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was very fast, the product is 100% effective and pretty well-priced.</li>
            <li>Also my girlfriend loves the Mr Clean feel</li>
            <li>My balls stay super clean and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>(Remember to clean it thoroughly).  </li>
            <li>hair off where the cream is applied, but it just isn&#x27;t effective enough to be considered hugely better than shaving or trimming.</li>
            <li>and it all came away clean.  </li>
            <li>A dry rag could then be used to remove any of the hair that was still on your stick and balls, lol.  </li>
            <li>It keepa things clean all day and the guys at the gym are never the wiser.</li>
            <li>have never been this smooth, this quickly WITHOUT having some sort of burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product did clean it up</li>
            <li>but when you do it again it should come out really clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell to strong and the hair came right off.</li>
            <li>&quot; I had to use a special \\&quot;scraper\\&quot; to remove the hair(I</li>
            <li>, \\&quot;specially formulated and</li>
            <li>It will pull right out!</li>
            <li>but right now it&#x27;s all mine!</li>
            <li>With some personal fine tuning  I believe this will turn into a once a while product used sparingly too keep yourself nice and smooth where it counts.  </li>
            <li>Imagine bright red sunburn with bubbly skin, as though you&#x27;ve gotten sun poisoning.</li>
            <li>, I suggest you start in that range before doing the full time as that&#x27;s how I started.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really cool.</li>
            <li>Using as directed it removed most hair readily.</li>
            <li>Much gentler than Nair, works better, and no &amp;#34;chemical smell&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my legs because I thought it would be the best place to start with since the hair is not too thick</li>
            <li>The  lotion was okay, but very runny.</li>
            <li>and I waited a FULL 20 MINUTES.  </li>
            <li>plan to contact the manufacturer for a full refund.</li>
            <li>plan to contact the manufacturer for a full refund.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty good at reading and following directions</li>
            <li>I love this product I really recommend this for the hairy guys out there</li>
            <li>True, it has a smell, but by no means did I find it obnoxious at all.</li>
            <li>Of course you&#x27;ll get a better result with shaving but that takes way to much time and effort.</li>
            <li>it doesnt smell so good though so extra body wash was needed afterwards</li>
            <li>this story was inspired by true events...</li>
            <li>I wanted to get the full effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad and you do eventually get used to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several times and it varies couple time perfect couple times not so perfect minus the slight Oder it works</li>
            <li>If you live in city where waxing services of this type are available keep going there as waxing provides a much better result.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the soothing solution feels great after the other solution.&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li>I experienced a mild burn and extremely minimial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Obviously the calm balm is very good to have, it provides asoothing feeling and make the skin very soft.</li>
            <li>The quick breakdown:    </li>
            <li>quick update</li>
            <li>Just quick hair removal.</li>
            <li>According to the reviews there are some lucky folks out there that this doesn&#x27;t phase them...</li>
            <li>Once I felt the burn start, I minimized the damage by just rinsing the stuff off as quickly as I could with just water, and then used the glove ever so gingerly.  </li>
            <li>Oh, by the way, my wife loves the results on me as well and is always excited to give me some attention after using the product, that&#x27;s the reason we are using it right?</li>
            <li>But The stuff is good enough to be a general lotion/moisturizer in its own right..</li>
            <li>Some history - for about the past 5 years I have searched for the ideal solution to my hair problem.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my chest and back of my neck after a haircut as well (never shaved there before but was recommended by the guy who told me of the product) and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>the package is smooth and no ill side effects.  </li>
            <li>So, as one who has waxed &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;, as well as my back and chest area, I think this is a reasonable - and more cost effective - option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nair for men didnt make my balls swell... nor did it give me rashes, but when i used it on my less sensative spots it worked great.</li>
            <li>And if you figure you&#x27;ll pass the 10 minutes playing video games or watching TV, don&#x27;t it&#x27;s way too easy to lose track of the 10 minutes fast.  </li>
            <li>Balls balm is an extremely fast and easy product for body hair removal.</li>
            <li>I was worried about putting stuff on my sensitive parts, so I trimmed own the hair to about 1/8\\&quot; first.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks BallsBalm !!</li>
            <li>It was softer, smaller, and more sparse!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today and really didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be anywhere near as good as it is.</li>
            <li>Stuff did not burn (did get a little warm, but very comfortable).  </li>
            <li>I have used many time of hair removal items in the past, this is the most effective and gentle product i have yet to use.  </li>
            <li>If you do decide to go this route, make sure you load up on the calming lotion, ice, and loose fitting boxers.</li>
            <li>, luckily nothing burned the only thing I felt was a warm sensation that actually felt nice, I then washed off the cream with the glove it did take some time to get rid of the hairs.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.. and as an added bonus, it smells a little like play-doh.</li>
            <li>This works great and in little time.</li>
            <li>The little applicator sticks that are included are great for evening out the solution on your body as well.  </li>
            <li>If you know its safe on your skin and actually will work on your hair fine...</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I was so excited that I did not test any part of my body, I went right to my manly area</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff that I have ever found its amazing, it does not have a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Calm Balm\\&quot; seems to do its job well, and I did not have any adverse effects from it.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for the Calm Balm.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;calm balm&#x27; didn&#x27;t calm squat.</li>
            <li>and it does get messy sometimes but its a GREAT product.</li>
            <li>I just wish that Amazon sold just the Balls without the Calm.  </li>
            <li>I never use the calm.</li>
            <li>&quot; so i go for the calm balm.</li>
            <li>i make a run for the calm balm.</li>
            <li>Still, if it allowed me to avoid putting a razor to the boys I thought it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if the bottles came in a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Somewhat disappointingly, no one noticed, not even once, and I had not stopped wearing shorts and skirts.</li>
            <li>Success.</li>
            <li>It does work for sure, but if you have sensitive skin beware.</li>
            <li>I don’t want to knock the product because it for sure removes hair, but beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Surprising hair does not cling on as baldly has I expected on the glove so washing should not be an issue.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have yet to find a pain free way to do this, until now!</li>
            <li>The lotion is fun and slippery and does have a cooling effect.</li>
            <li>This product works great and the people saying it burns is only because their skin is to sensitive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll take 2 times to get everything, but completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Balls Balm for being so gentle.. :)</li>
            <li>I would advise all to steer clear of this and, like me, stick to a good old fashioned razor.  </li>
            <li>Next I jump in the shower with the water running slightly warm, I put the glove on and began a wiping/brushing motion.</li>
            <li>The sample patch i put on the fun bag didn&#x27;t even burn at all.</li>
            <li>Used this product once and it worked okay, although I didn&#x27;t get to close to the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Does what it says well worth the bang for the buck, and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is it worth it?</li>
            <li>Burning and God help you if you managed to accidentally get some on a more sensitive area because there was nothing else on this earth that could.</li>
            <li>this is a great product worked very well only took about 6 minutes and wiped right off, and the cooling balm worked very well also</li>
            <li>I also applied the Calm Balm right after drying off my beans and frank.</li>
            <li>I can not blame this company for my sensitivity to this particular product, so take that with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;The part that really upset me the most about this stuff</li>
            <li>I hopped in the shower and scrubbed it off with the handy-dandy glove, and laughed some more at how ridiculously convenient the process was.</li>
            <li>Just because it worked fine over that region, it does not mean you can just go nuts with the stuff.</li>
            <li>Okay to be honest it works really well down there.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>im on fire, use the Salve right after the shower, and dont soap up the area after the Pawing.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, the reviews were right</li>
            <li>The hair came right off.</li>
            <li>The hair comes off, but right after im out of the shower the burning starts.</li>
            <li>Then right after I did it on another area</li>
            <li>just right for the bear pair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to go nuts with the stuff right out of the chute.</li>
            <li>plus (it takes time to shower the stuff off, right?)</li>
            <li>shower with soap right away.</li>
            <li>Right between the cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Bare Balm and used it last night works great.</li>
            <li>And it got the whole area pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li>Got this mainly after reading the detailed reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Ok, no this did cause me to shave a bit, but overall, it was a joy because it took way less time.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it does smell kind of funny when you are applying it but</li>
            <li>O and the smell it pretty nice actually.</li>
            <li>It was not an all over reaction (hence patch testing wouldn&#x27;t give you a true irritant reading) but just in certain spots, no rhyme nor reason.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it off the best I could and set back to work down under.</li>
            <li>If you want smooth skin down there, this is a nice solution.</li>
            <li>I will say the calm balm is pretty good, it makes your skin super silky soft and totally counteracts any irritation.</li>
            <li>Easy and simple instructions to get you smooth in all the right spots.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it, I was actually excited to use it, based on what the product promised (removes hair easily with no shaving required, dulls out the thickness of future hair growth and most importantly, safe for your privates).</li>
            <li>I did a small test spot it worked great with no irritation.</li>
            <li>so I was able to bare my pair and recover.</li>
            <li>, I would not have experienced the usual \\&quot;razor</li>
            <li>The calm balm also does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>How will my balls react to their new glory of a smooth life?\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get this delivered and the instructions disclose that even it works right the first time that it could not work (burn you)</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, this did not irritate me in the least bit I am happy to report!</li>
            <li>Skip the sticks and get gloves to make life easy and application complete.</li>
            <li>I love how this product removes hair without a harsh odor, but don&#x27;t leave it on more than the recommended time.  </li>
            <li>Balls will have you smooth but not quite as smooth and groomed as your local hottie esthetician can provide.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t expect your skin to be smooth, it will probably feel like stubble the first time and be really smooth the second time you use it.</li>
            <li>Far more superior to Men&#x27;s Nair and past hair removal system I have used.</li>
            <li>If at any time you start to feel anything beyond a slight warm or cool sensation (ex.</li>
            <li>at any time you start to feel anything beyond a slight warm or cool sensation (ex.</li>
            <li>For my first experimental area run, I chose a spot that could easily be seen with a mirror.</li>
            <li>I received my order in a couple of days, very fast.</li>
            <li>I have also sent questions to the company and had very fast reply.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use very much of the cream with each application.  </li>
            <li>You have everything you need for a very reasonable price including a moisturizer/calming lotion.</li>
            <li>The hair on my legs is much thinner and paler than other hair on my body, so I hoped it would come off fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely clean, pain free, simple and done in 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Much more gentle than other products, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>If you do it in the morning you will find you can make it until the next day before needing to do it again, in most cases.</li>
            <li>I got it because it was the first time I saw something like this for guys, so</li>
            <li>Afterwards, you can apply the Calm Balm which really helps soothes the area.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly, testing the product on two areas.  </li>
            <li>more then i care to go get the same result/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; - result was only slightly better.</li>
            <li>im sure i applyed enough.</li>
            <li>I used this yesterday for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>, I put the cream on, didn&#x27;t think it was working, but left it on for about 12 minutes, then rubbed it with the glove, and saw hairs coming off, so I rubbed some more and jumped in the shower</li>
            <li>Nair Extra Strength seems to be a stronger and better product then this one.    </li>
            <li>First off let me say that this is the first hair removal product I have used</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Like most of these products you keep using it and your hair comes back slower and finer each time.  </li>
            <li>Just take your time and test first, do not exceed recommended time.</li>
            <li>have continued using this product for about 2 months now, just emptied the first tube, so about 8 to 10</li>
            <li>Make sure the application is even and don&#x27;t rush as if it will burn your skin off if you leave it on an extra minute.</li>
            <li>First, Some Background:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a chick</li>
            <li>and I have had no ill effects.</li>
            <li>So you may be interested in this product to be hairless below the belt.</li>
            <li>The dieections say to leave on for ten or so minutes, but after just three it had removed the hair and my top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, but be willing to deal with it for a few hours.</li>
            <li>so first I used it</li>
            <li>and I got it for 3 times and once from amazon and willing to get it soon when I finish the one I have .</li>
            <li>Followed instructions exactly, did not remove any hair at all.</li>
            <li>Just be aware incase you are getting this shipped somewhere like work or something.</li>
            <li>You will have to determine where to place it after the first time using it though.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>This was the first hair removal product I&#x27;ve ever used, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>03/31/2014&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 days since the first application</li>
            <li>prefer using Carson&#x27;s Magic Razorless facial cream.  </li>
            <li>If you use as directed and DO NOT have it applied longer than the time limits for regular and sensitive areas it leaves you with smooth, sexy skin.</li>
            <li>Works really well and lasts throughout the week!</li>
            <li>/&gt;My first attempt achieved NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>I jumped in the shower again, and rinsed off, and AT FIRST, it seemed like the hair was still there.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell like many similar</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than nair for men repackaged and charging you double for some popsicle sticks and an exfoliating</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it worked at all.</li>
            <li>I first used this product a week ago</li>
            <li>To angry wives/girlfriends, this would be PERFECT if your man has been cheating on you and you seek revenge.</li>
            <li>HOT DAMN</li>
            <li>First time use, using a stop watch to keep track of the time..</li>
            <li>My first attempt</li>
            <li>First run.  </li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, at a reasonable cost and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions the first time.  </li>
            <li>The first question we have to ask is does it work?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just go back to a razor for the most part, with the exception that there are a couple places where I can&#x27;t use a razor with hurting myself, and I&#x27;ll keep this product around because even if it leaves stubble</li>
            <li>I once tried a feminine depilatory cream and fried my sack resulting in my walking like a sumo wrestler for a week just to keep my legs from touching big Jim and the twins.</li>
            <li>I applied some cream, waited exactly 12 minutes</li>
            <li>No, you need to determine what conditions you need for what areas, first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been successful with the pubic region, I let things go for a day or so, so as to compare my results vs a razor (which I did do once or twice in the past.)</li>
            <li>reason I tried this stuff in the first place was because my girlfriend found it on the web and wanted to use it.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try it, first.  </li>
            <li>The product is all about patience, first.</li>
            <li>Thanks Balls Balm!</li>
            <li>not sure I&#x27;d like anyone putting their face in my crotch and having to explain the smell, of course - if they don&#x27;t ask, and just do their job, guess it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem :-p</li>
            <li>First of all I could not leave it on for the 13 minutes</li>
            <li>I know its says to test drive first then go all out</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend!!</li>
            <li>Overall, satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>Used as directed, the product works well to get rid of 80-90% on the first application.</li>
            <li>Also, I have been told that it leaves a funny taste even after you have washed a while, so take that into consideration.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product three times exactly as the directions</li>
            <li>Most definitely will buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li>i follow the instructs, leave it on the exact amount of time, hop in the shower and start \\&quot;groping\\&quot; myself.</li>
            <li>first warning flag pops up...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and have had mixed results.</li>
            <li>Follow the detections (which are pretty funny) and DO use the &amp;#34;calm balm&amp;#34; NOT just any lotion.</li>
            <li>At first, it worked well for my chest and belly</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The reviews on this product all seem pretty correct.</li>
            <li>oh btw I&#x27;m pretty tolerant to pain.</li>
            <li>So i tried this for my first time and it went well,</li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first to use this, because I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few hair removal products, but nothing was as good as Ball Balm.</li>
            <li>That sure beats needing to shave with a razor practically every day in order to stay smooth down there.</li>
            <li>but if you really want to do things right, don&#x27;t take shortcuts like I tried.  </li>
            <li>Super easy, gentle and leaves everything like a naked mole rat!</li>
            <li>other than that my privet parts felt so amazing.</li>
            <li>If you are very dark haired and very hairy, your results may not be as good as were mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>exactly using a stop watch, then immediately rinsing and using the supplied glove, I can report that my junk is smooth and bare.</li>
            <li>It looks like he has 1st degree burns, bright red patches and some hair appears to be gone but not all, finally scabbing over after 2 days of weeping skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves his skin soft and clean of those undesirable hairs.</li>
            <li>In my opinion - a good hair management product would remove hair for about 1 month before it would begin to grow back, it would be reasonably priced, relatively easy to use, would work on all hair types without irritation(or cuts), and would require less than 20 minutes of your time.  </li>
            <li>The formula is definitely gentle enough and the Balm is a must get item glad they were listed together.</li>
            <li>Sure this product works but it really irritated my skin and is still irritated to this day after I bought and used this product back in August.</li>
            <li>make sure you have some hand lotion or something to cool down after use.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that this stuff does work pretty good if you leave it on long enough.  </li>
            <li>Tried it on my package and it left it clean!</li>
            <li>In fact, even on some of the positive reviews, people indicated it was like</li>
            <li>I get the sense that this product is nothing but a gimmick and that all of the positive reviews out there are from people who are involved with or work for the company trying to boost it&#x27;s reputation.  </li>
            <li>I really like the results I got on my first try...</li>
            <li>The glove dries pretty fast (to stuff away).  </li>
            <li>Well, the name pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>are whisking across your bare smooth ball sack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just have a talk with your balls first and let them know how much attention they will get soon.</li>
            <li>This was my first real experience using a chemical hair remover, and all I can say to the people reading this is read the instructions.</li>
            <li>But I left it on there too long, and it gave me a pretty good burn.</li>
            <li>The lotion one was fine and covered the smell the first one left.  </li>
            <li>It left the scent or better put the smell of the cream where I used it for over a day, which I didn&#x27;t particularly like.</li>
            <li>No pain, not even warm, just a little tickle at first.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for those who have the patience to learn more about their personal sensitivities.</li>
            <li>There is a little odor, but it was mild and dare I say pleasant, especially compared with any depilatory cream I&#x27;ve ever smelled before.</li>
            <li>But then I read some other reviews that said they had tried it more than once and gotten better results a second time.  </li>
            <li>This stuff got rid of several areas of unwanted body hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like some of the hairs wouldn&#x27;t necessarily come out on their own--but it was really easy to pull them out.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I still cant figure out how it is strong enough to burn the skin but not remove hair.</li>
            <li>A lot of hair removal gels and creams remove hair to skin level, so that is not really effective (or pleasant, as it leaves you with almost immediate stubble).  </li>
            <li>Use the calm balm right after you get the bare off your skin!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get every single hair, even when you leave it on for the maximum recommended time (which I always do), but it does get most, and there&#x27;s almost no stubble.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to remove large quantities of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>Instead, I got a large bulk of pair hair removed, but not all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should be too smart to fall for.</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend anyone to buy this product and I will be telling my friends.</li>
            <li>If you do too large of an area by the time you finish applying your 10-12 mins are up from where you started...</li>
            <li>The gloves that come with are exfoliating gloves and they will remove the hair easily and evenly while also lightly exfoliating your skin to remove dead cells and lessen the chances of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Irritation, in fact, might be too harsh a word as it was more a tingling discomfort that quickly subsided.</li>
            <li>you only want something for your balls, this stuff should do fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Balls Balm is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li>A little warm on the sack after a while</li>
            <li>how I&#x27;m going to list the positives and negatives of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive- easy instructions, got all the parts u need for it (no additional purchase), easy to use, not many parts to the purchase&lt;</li>
            <li>overall it did the job very well and will leave your body smooth</li>
            <li>Air dry your balls, for maximum effect as you will immediately tell the difference with that fresh clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I find this a great product to have, but at current price and the requirement to use it daily can break the bank if you have a low income.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I could have been more careful in my application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Stuff works really really well.</li>
            <li>The Calm Blam is epic as an all body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After the second application at a later time the product worked great, nothing left.</li>
            <li>Using a wet sponge more hair came off than with the towel.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li>and i have tried Nair and lets just say i would much rather have the ingrown hairs from shaving.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast as well.</li>
            <li>That really saved the day.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely and got a red burn!</li>
            <li>Shower after use, no soap at all (really prevents all irritation problems that customers report)</li>
            <li>give you a cotton glove that you&#x27;re supposed to wear in the shower to gently rub the hair off.</li>
            <li>Time to try the whole leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li>The whole time, I never felt anything.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the product actually works.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>However, Nair for men smells very foul.</li>
            <li>This product removed the hair without a whole lot of effort.  </li>
            <li>The glove is also very helpful when i use Nair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well now you know too much about me.  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY STARTED REMOVING the hair</li>
            <li>I really like the product and it works well.</li>
            <li>Worked really well on balls, not so much anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for women or pubic hair not on the balls.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>The glove is key to maximum removal, but tread lightly</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>These guys really know how to make a product</li>
            <li>I say thanks for your product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It works as advertised but it really burns if you don&#x27;t get the timing right~!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting ready to see a doctor.</li>
            <li>much easier than shaving.</li>
            <li>Picked it up to inspect it a bit and the hairs were very gummy and stringy.</li>
            <li>so my body hair is a light curly mix of coarse hair, but never grows longer than an inch (just to give you an idea).</li>
            <li>I thought this product wasn&#x27;t going to work very well.  </li>
            <li>This combo is an absolute must for me.</li>
            <li>If I used too much, it burned my skin (and still did not remove all the hair).</li>
            <li>Really well.  </li>
            <li>The whole kit works like a charm.</li>
            <li>So I am pretty sure I&#x27;ve been confused with Bigfoot, I am a very hairy fella and trimming was becoming a hassle</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll close by saying that I did experience one area where I absolutely cannot use the product.</li>
            <li>package was very discreet and didn&#x27;t say balls balm or anything</li>
            <li>it says you could -it burnt to much.</li>
            <li>This product gave me the scrotum of a porn star, and my wife absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend, gets the job done!</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t see the real benefits vs the risks.</li>
            <li>it needs a gentle rub.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Big chubby guy here who loves to keep himself smooth and</li>
            <li>however thanks to this product</li>
            <li>The included glove really helped with wiping the stuff off in the shower.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>A lighter version would work so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I will be staying with the Nair, very ineffective</li>
            <li>Within the very time limit, it already started to burn (although still tolerable).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this over waxing!</li>
            <li>As before, even the gentle touch of my fingers</li>
            <li>it works really well...</li>
            <li>From chest &amp; back to the most sensitive if areas</li>
            <li>I bought it to see if it worked better than double shaving with old fashioned Gillette (three blade) shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Drawbacks:  Not as effective as waxing - as you&#x27;ll still have stubble in just a few days.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough that you should preform a spot test first and wait a FULL 24 HOURS.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: it works better than stuff like Nair and it actually was not harsh on my skin at all (as they claim).</li>
            <li>this shit is the kind of stuff where if you rubbed it on an iguana hed turn into</li>
            <li>From my own personal experience, and that of many others I have seen on this and various other sites for reviews on this product, it just does not work well at all for course body hair, so do NOT purchase it for that.  </li>
            <li>The hair remover smells better and is much gentler than other products.</li>
            <li>Some of the main problems that I have with this is that it takes too much time for it to work and doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>, the smell is better than other brands.  </li>
            <li>This worked for me better than other products.</li>
            <li>Following this initial what I&#x27;d consider successful test, I just had to go further, and that&#x27;s when I learned, as I&#x27;ve been saying, that patience, experiment, is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the directions very carefully</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve left my chest and legs untouched because I&#x27;m not going to entirely deny my Nordic/Viking hairy awesomeness, but I don&#x27;t doubt that a similarly patient approach to those areas would leave me as smooth as a very smooth thing.</li>
            <li>It DID REMOVE THE FIRST LAYER OF SKIN in more than a few areas.</li>
            <li>I plan on trying again later and waiting a full 20 min as the product is so gentile on skin that I felt absolutely 0 discomfort.    </li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and this product works well pretty much everywhere on my body, until I try to &amp;#34;bare my pair.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>so I tested it on my upper thigh for 10mins and it wiped clean off with no irritation.</li>
            <li>one beef i have is that they didn&#x27;t include a few more of those exfoliating gloves, i would have gladly paid a buck or two more if they put in a few extra gloves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving is no fun, using this makes the whole process faster and easer and with better</li>
            <li>Im not a wookie but it has become a pain shaving down there practically every day in order to keep your fun parts smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have light scarring on my abdomen, not a particularly sensitive area, which appears to be permanent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never shave again as long as this stuff is available.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s got a completely inoffensive smell which is</li>
            <li>key is to remember that for truly manly-type hairy guys you&#x27;re probably gonna have to go two or three rounds with this stuff before you see the full effect.  </li>
            <li>It is not going to make you go completely bald the first time.</li>
            <li>I left this on for the full 15 minutes and the hair just came off.</li>
            <li>Performs exactly as advertised, delivering results beyond what a razor could ever do to sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just order a couple each time to give me enough for full coverage.</li>
            <li>hair doesn&#x27;t come back for about 2-3 weeks, most everything else I&#x27;ve used last&#x27;s a week.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well on the boy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to the new product coming out the first of the year because of the new smell.</li>
            <li>Well, having been successful with my first experiments, and having a clue of how much time was needed (for the prior region that is,) I proceeded to move further down.</li>
            <li>it was ok as soon as I applied it to down there</li>
            <li>here I sit, at my PC, writing this review of Balls Balm, and I&#x27;m sporting my new pair of shiny, polished nads!  </li>
            <li>other pubic hair is easy and gentle.  </li>
            <li>Tried again on day 2, left it on for 10 minutes, and used the glove to wipe off and more unwanted hair is coming off but significant chaffing a few hours</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still true - after 4 applications, I&#x27;ve gotten nowhere with the Bare Balm as far as removing pubic hair.  </li>
            <li>I need to use it carefully or find something that removes the hair more completely.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product did not bother me(no lasting cucumber smell), but I did not find it to be better when compared to similar store bought</li>
            <li>The third time I left it on for 15-17 minutes, applying a much more generous amount than ever.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using these kinds of products unless there is a decent amount of hair growth.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had vacation the next week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it pretty much everywhere :O</li>
            <li>I did read the instructions carefully and allowed the balm to remain for 12 minutes prior to &amp;#34;Groping&amp;#34; in a luke warm shower.</li>
            <li>such that there is a light white color covering the area -- you don&#x27;t really need much of the stuff at all, not even when you&#x27;re ready to go for it.</li>
            <li>You must be willing to test the various areas, first.</li>
            <li>I tried it the day I received it, and it seemed to work decent.</li>
            <li>Also, trimming the hairs down first is a huge help.</li>
            <li>mitt does chafe a good bit, so go easy with the scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;the smell is unpleasant, but bearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty much at this point I realized that I wasn&#x27;t going to get a better result than this, and, noticing that the Balm had brought my hair length down enough to do a decent shave, shaved in the shower immediately after scrubbing the product off with a washcloth.      </li>
            <li>Not to mention this product is highly overpriced</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations and this just didn&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li>the price (the pain and somewhat embarrassing trip to the dr.) is way too high.</li>
            <li>but it requires some accurate timing to make sure you leave it on long enough but not too long.</li>
            <li>The balm, highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>but, if you have a high pain threshold &amp; don&#x27;t want to shave, I have an alternative suggestion.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be much more painful &amp; would likely be more effective than Bare Balm in hair removal.</li>
            <li>I wish the labeling was a little more discreet.  </li>
            <li>but i recommend a little more</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait 24 hours anticipating the excitement my wife would feel when she saw her favorite main course without a side of pubic hair (short or long)!</li>
            <li>If you pay attention and use some common sense you&#x27;ll get amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only PLUS is the \\&quot;Calm balm\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>well,it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the hear,but is very close to it.the skin shines,just folllow the instruction and you&#x27;ll se the results</li>
            <li>I had absolutely no irritation or bumpiness which is fantastic and unheard of for me when shaving.</li>
            <li>whole point of this product was (is) to remove hair from sensitive areas, says so on the tube.</li>
            <li>You can go for this pack only for this calm balm.</li>
            <li>I leaped back into the shower and rinsed the Calm Balm from my balls and now I sit...</li>
            <li>No irritating smell, haven&#x27;t had any burns (i would say I have a medium sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>So the stuff is good for people with normal to thin hair, but if you have thick/course hair, or alot of hair..</li>
            <li>The cream helps, but within an hour you&#x27;re running for more or crying for your mother.  </li>
            <li>The whole &#x27;area&#x27; gets red and inflamed and it feels like I took a hot iron to my skin.</li>
            <li>I saw one of the Q &amp; As saying that you will probably get 6 uses out of one tube but maybe a few more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how you can get so few uses unless you&#x27;re using it on most of your body each time or something.</li>
            <li>At first I waited 10 minutes after applying in the removing lotion and barely anything came out.</li>
            <li>also tried it on my chest and the test patch was a success, but when I tried a larger area, it didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li>even on my sack it did a good job with no more iritation than shaving and seem to last longer</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Calm Balm&amp;#34; was almost like squirting lemon juice into a fresh, open wound.</li>
            <li>But if you do it twice or three times over a few days then you&#x27;ll be pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>The glove is a nice addition but it loses the roughness of the material it&#x27;s made from.  </li>
            <li>itll probably feel better in a few minutes.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Most of the hair was removed, but there were still quite a few that were not.</li>
            <li>in normal packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The test removed some hair &amp; had no negative side effects</li>
            <li>Still not a perfect fix, but not a bad on, still deciding whether to buy, again, the mitt comes in handy.</li>
            <li>so I found that gooping them up using my hand nice and thick did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m not very tough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Go out and walk around the house naked slapping your fresh new balls around.</li>
            <li>I am pale with many moles and freckles.</li>
            <li>followed directions and removed all hair easily , applied lotion balm  several times and next day no irritation at all</li>
            <li>To be more clear, you will feel a slight bit of irritation while the product is on your skin.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive to try it since there are some pretty negative reviews and the positive reviews sound like they&#x27;e written by narcissists.....</li>
            <li>Well, guess what, you can have an area right next to the area you tested that will get irritated.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, in the middle of summer.</li>
            <li>I tried getting right up next to it and sniffing</li>
            <li>The only thing the product was right about was that it does not burn.</li>
            <li>And then next time increase it, and so on, until you find the right amount of time for you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad it came in a plain cardboard box, and didn&#x27;t have \\&quot;BALLS\\&quot; splashed all over it.</li>
            <li>Im not going to make a bunch of obvious jokes and just get right to</li>
            <li>/&gt;It turns out that you do, in fact, need to trim it down, other wise it will not give you your desired results.</li>
            <li>Glove tended to make me a bit more raw then a normal wash cloth.</li>
            <li>This time it worked fine, but only after I waited ONE HOUR and scrubed with a back scrub brush.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and it burned after following the steps but the next day it was fine.</li>
            <li>It should also be noted that the hairy area had been trimmed maybe two weeks prior, so I started out with my hair already under pretty decent control.    </li>
            <li>Accusations have been levied that the positive reviews for the Bare Pair were written by employees of the company who produced this product.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;m been smooth for years and change-up between shaving &amp; other hair removal products.</li>
            <li>I left the Bare Balm on for 9 minutes and hopped into the shower because I wanted to make sure to rinse prior to the recommended time of 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I had to rub for a while to get some of the parts of the hairs off, because the long hairs tended to break before the whole thing would come off, but I rubbed very gently for about two minutes</li>
            <li>New nickname is Mr. Bigglesworth.</li>
            <li>They need to be prepared for their new life of fame with attention galore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff on my back, arms and nether regions, with complete success in all areas (</li>
            <li>I had to do my private area twice to get it smooth, but it does actually work.  </li>
            <li>Left more stubble than I expected.</li>
            <li>The after balm is fantastic and my only wish is that the bottle was the same size as the remover.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic, whether you&#x27;re male OR female.</li>
            <li>This had been a request (subtle) of hers for quite some time and, as she is very thorough regarding keeping my favorite main course out of the bush</li>
            <li>but any way...application is somewhat messy but take your time peel, rub, and smooth, shiny (ok not shiny) but less fuzzy balls.  </li>
            <li>It efficiently remove the hair while being gentle on your most delicate skin, what else can a man wish?</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to use, so I put it on fairly thick using the applicator.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys an active life- both in the bedroom and outside:)</li>
            <li>It is left pretty smooth and lasts longer than the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I found out that part of my skin in that area is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have always been very sensitive to hair removal below the waist.</li>
            <li>No pain or discomfort and my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;a close shave\\&quot; and that they have to use it very frequently, which goes against the company&#x27;s claims.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a chemical after all, but it&#x27;s very far from reminding you</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell of the first one you use, but it goes away.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I left it on for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>When I applied it to my chest my skin broke out from becoming irritated and damaged my skin for a few days.</li>
            <li>I was initial skeptical at how good the reviews were and figured it was probably too good to be true, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>I have to say, after a couple of uses, that this stuff actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li>and it only happened on the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>For the first day I actually put Polysporin (or you could use Neosporin) all over the burned areas to help the healing, and that worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently, it takes off skin as much as it does hair.  </li>
            <li>People usually only write reviews for three reasons: They are really dissatisfied with the product, they are really happy with the product, or they are bored.</li>
            <li>The first application worked well, the second burned my skin after waiting 24 hours.</li>
            <li>It makes your balls red hot and feel like it going to fall off, I through the rest of it away</li>
            <li>extra moisturizers around because your skin will dry very quickly</li>
            <li>And the tube is huge - will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth I am it did take half a 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Smooth less fuzzy balls just the way I like mine...</li>
            <li>Using it can be challenging but overall the product works pretty well at removing 85-90% of my coarse, black, hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used topical hair removal products in the past that haven&#x27;t been as effective as they claim.</li>
            <li>As a very hairy guy, it&#x27;s hard to remove hair in select areas with a cream, but I was able to bare my balls without getting thigh or butt hair removed-</li>
            <li>I re-applied another layer of \\&quot;Bare Balm\\&quot; cream and then after waiting for more than 15 minutes and using the \\&quot;scraper\\&quot; I had used with \\&quot;Veet\\&quot; a significant amount of hair actually came off, although not entirely(the roots of the hair were still left in the skin - like with other similar products).</li>
            <li>I thought after reading (only the positive) reviews for this product it would do what it says.</li>
            <li>It felt like every pore in the skin of my very scrotum was pierced (inch deep) by yellow hot sowing needles.</li>
            <li>Instead, it more or less dissolved the hair above the roots, leaving a ragged, inconsistent look over the area where the product was applied.      </li>
            <li>Exfoliated the other areas and the hairs pretty much just sloughed off.</li>
            <li>This feels like a warm tingling/stinging sensation which I can only describe as being similar to dipping your balls in to water that is slightly hotter than comfort level.</li>
            <li>guess I just expected too much and as per usual things are usually too good to be true</li>
            <li>I originally thought I would have to use half a bottle of the stuff</li>
            <li>The hand glove is the most versatile tool for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>, it was well worth the very limited irritation.</li>
            <li>&quot; Once again, we&#x27;re in debate, for as I see it, the razor bumps are just how I react when my pores aren&#x27;t 100% clear.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough and the burning lasted two days.  </li>
            <li>In my first session I left it for 10 minutes and it did a pretty mediocre job, so I reapplied it and waited for 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Do not waste any time or money on this product.</li>
            <li>&quot; I have realized my skin does not agree with this product (I have always had somewhat sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>The product still works well; I just wish my skin was not so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Overall the stuff works really well</li>
            <li>you will need to order 2-3 times as much to get the same results...</li>
            <li>I do not have excessively coarse or unusual hair where the product was used.  </li>
            <li>The ocean air softly caresses my balls as I write this review from my ipad.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, shaving gives me bumps</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a professional hair removal product.</li>
            <li>I tried this yesterday and it didn&#x27;t remove the hair on my sensitive parts.  </li>
            <li>this item removed all the hair completely painlessly in the &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; I used it for.</li>
            <li>did one leg at a time, trying a much thinner application on the second leg, and both at 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>applied it on the balls with gloves and left it for 12 mins, removed it in a gentle message fashion using my fingers, as specified and all the hair came off effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Just shaving the old fashioned way easier.</li>
            <li>The tube has lasted three months so far, and still going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that it might just be my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I did not expect too much from it because I have enough hair that could grow-up within 3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My suggestion would be if you have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>The instructions said 10-12 minutes, but the first time I used it, it kinda burned and I could tell that 10-12 minutes was too long.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I guess I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you leave it on too long, you may find some red bumps on your skin, but those will go away pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Glad I don&#x27;t have to spend extra time shaving as it gets tiresome, but this product gets you smooth in under 15mins.</li>
            <li>I applied and let it sit for 10 minutes (the amount of time recommended for sensitive areas) and went into the shower to rub it off.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way to apply it fast enough with the tounge depressor sticks included as suggested in the directions.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I would not be suprised if there wasn&#x27;t a pending class action lawsuit against the company that created this junk.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get completely baby butt bald though.  </li>
            <li>I am a licensed professional and try every product on the market to see what does and does not work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently my balls are sensitive and burned-</li>
            <li>All you have to do is follow the directions and in under 17 minutes your balls will be baby soft.</li>
            <li>With that being said, spacing out the applications at least a week our more will prevent you from feeling pain.</li>
            <li>From there I removed the glove and proceeded to rinse as much of the balm off me as possible.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, don&#x27;t expect you won&#x27;t discover you have over sensitive areas as well.</li>
            <li>Unless of course your skin is sensitive then probably should steer clear.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to be self conscious about showing off those parts.</li>
            <li>Man they felt soft.  </li>
            <li>I think my skin is just too sensitive for this product.  </li>
            <li>Even something natural would help it.</li>
            <li>This hair removal system does work but it is not for sensitive skin as it will cause redness and leave a burning feeling.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Ok, I have a few mixed opinions about Balls</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth a try if you want to try something different.</li>
            <li>So I said, \\&quot;Heck with it\\&quot; and ran back upstairs, 20 minutes after my first application, and dropped my drawers and grabbed the bare balm again.  </li>
            <li>After applying a thick layer and waiting more than 10 minutes I tried wiping it off with a towel or \\&quot;washcloth\\&quot; or whatever you want to call it.</li>
            <li>Maybe that would be shortened if I applied it more thickly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there may be some irritation but the included after-lotion does a good job of taming that.  </li>
            <li>Lastly on this point, I&#x27;d also recommend hitting the area with an electric mustache shaver, such that the hair is down to around an eighth of an inch, as it makes things easier for you in determining if the product will or will not be suitable for you in that area.</li>
            <li>I then blotted the area dry with a towel and applied the Calm Balm with my bare hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that rinsing the area with lukewarm water with your hands, then blow drying with cool air (dry), prior to application helps a lot.</li>
            <li>Also, one note, be careful with the intensity of scrubbing to remove the hair, it should just slide right off.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have that heavy chemical smell like other depilatory creams and it comes with this AMAZING lotion for after use.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, your skin may be a bit sensitive, but the Calm Balm included soothes extremely well.</li>
            <li>I found use every other week and by the month end you will likely be hair free in all your regions where applied.</li>
            <li>just a tiny bit of a burn on my left nut , which went away next day, been razor shaving my unit for 30 yrs , hating it every time , now this cool product comes out , could not be happier , thanx wife  :</li>
            <li>No mess, although I used a wash cloth instead of the glove.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, even if your skin isn&#x27;t \\&quot;normally\\&quot; sensitive, to rinse off at a max of 5min (or something much less than called for in the directions) as a first test.  </li>
            <li>Most of them usually worked but left my skin irritated.  </li>
            <li>I was so red and sore that I had to stay covered up my entire vacation for which I applied this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>Rather, it should be very obvious that you&#x27;d used the product in that particular spot.</li>
            <li>a day or so following and just didn&#x27;t scratch except when in the shower and with burning hot water flooding the area (which acts to open the pores.)</li>
            <li>so I decided to skip the skin test (because I&#x27;m impatient and who honestly does that anyway) with the game plan of quickly hopping into the shower if it started to burn.</li>
            <li>At this point in my experimentation I now felt comfortable with the idea of traveling down further and leaving the store, but I&#x27;d run out of time and decided to wait a week or so.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok not better not worse than any other hair remover</li>
            <li>was that it was (is) so thick it is hard to spread and to get a good layer anywhere requires a large quantity of the cream</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a hairy guy and want to finally take off the fur coat, I highly recommend these ballsBALM products.</li>
            <li>, I am unsure if it exfoliated my hands or what it did, but my hands were super smooth and felt weird for like a week after...</li>
            <li>After following all instructions very clearly testing product elsewhere on the body I applied to sensitive areas</li>
            <li>To be fair, it may work better for it&#x27;s title area, but I still have to give it one star, because it makes bold claims to remove body hair for extended periods of time over your entire body (which it failed miserably on for me and many others).  </li>
            <li>But it burns if you you put too much or leave it on too long.</li>
            <li>I suppose that&#x27;s a small price to pay for smooth balls.</li>
            <li>I was very close to call 911, since the burning lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li>My only sensitivity was, well, I had a new feeling without hair, there, where there&#x27;d always been hair, before.</li>
            <li>This product does NOT burn as a couple of other products out there very much do so do not be worried about that.</li>
            <li>A few hours later and everything is smooth</li>
            <li>Continuing, so all you do for that first run is dab some on and gently smear the small chosen area (1 sq inch</li>
            <li>The product is thick, easy to spread, and stays on well.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells like a combination of a dirty baby&#x27;s diaper and gasoline...not pleasant.</li>
            <li>The consistency is like toothpaste, thick and stays where you put it but easy to spread.</li>
            <li>rather heavy chemical smell, not as mild as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that will have you wanting to don nothingness in the very near future.</li>
            <li>nothing major</li>
            <li>If you are looking for bare, then this is your product!</li>
            <li>The first time you try this product, and unless you&#x27;ve tried other hair removal products as well, you&#x27;ll again notice that burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>Also, Balls is pretty messy if you live in a college dorm like I do.</li>
            <li>I like to keep things clean and neat down there, but not bare all the way....</li>
            <li>Used on a few spots on my back and it worked great except I left it on a lil too long and had some burning in a few spots.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my hips first - shaving on one side and using Bare Balls on the other.  </li>
            <li>if i hadn&#x27;t paid 4 dollars more for this kit than I did for 3 bottles of a different product.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, after i get over all the other stuff; the price, the &amp;#34;Pain&amp;#34; from the stuff, the fact it didn&#x27;t work that well; what really gets me is how hard the stuff was to use for the results, I refer to this stuff as &amp;#34;Ice skating uphill&amp;#34;; you may get there</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other way to explain why some people seem to \\&quot;love it for their boyfriend,\\&quot; but everyone else gets poor to no results at all.</li>
            <li>Left the product on for about seven minutes and an area about 1\\&quot; x 1/2\\&quot; became red, raw, and bled slightly (obviously dissolving more than just the hair).</li>
            <li>and I think it is worth a trip to their web site for additional tips, but otherwise in 12-15 min you are bald down there!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product, but after reading the reviews, and a friend of mine trying it out, and saying it was amazing</li>
            <li>Kinda sucks to have &#x27;smooth balls&#x27;, but have them drenched in antibiotic ointment and pain cream, then wrapped in a mile of sterile gauze.</li>
            <li>Took shower, dried myself and applied calm balm immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally a hairy guy.</li>
            <li>so I proceeded with the general application.</li>
            <li>I use it front and back to clear it all up.</li>
            <li>The Bare Pair &#x27;Threesome&#x27; King Kombo]]</li>
            <li>The Bare Pair delivers.  </li>
            <li>I resorted to my bare hand</li>
            <li>and I could barely smell anything.</li>
            <li>Never use your bare hands, it will smell like the products for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that my skin is too sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>I think basically this stuff is the same old depilatory cream that does this to me -</li>
            <li>Anyways, this whole process took a long time, longer than I had expected since you have to wait for at least 15 minutes, wipe it, then go shower, once done you realize that not all the hair is removed so you have to apply more lotion and repeat.     </li>
            <li>It left some stubble but that could be because I took it off to early.</li>
            <li>and I did as the name says, did bare my b@llls.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I had already trimmed my scrotum and applied a generous portion of Bare Balm to it.  </li>
            <li>I tried Bare Balm on my chest, and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li>But now after that I have a bare pair</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it got all the coarse hair from my nether regions.</li>
            <li>I used the Bare Pair on my boys about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>The Bare Pair management is as completes as it gets.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely use cooler water, the boys are sensitive after while in the shower, but once I applied the white tube...</li>
            <li>And only take about 10 minutes to complete the hair removely.</li>
            <li>I gave up using the glove &amp; rinsed away the remaining Bare Balm with lukewarm water &amp; my hand.</li>
            <li>By now the skin was so sore that I could barely stand to let the water touch it</li>
            <li>but I realized that I had to remove all of the Bare Balm</li>
            <li>yeah, before I forget, the Bare Balm did not even remove all of the hair.</li>
            <li>I got me some bare ballz.</li>
            <li>What I was left with for several days were red and burning balls that are slowly getting back to normal after shedding a layer or more of skin.  </li>
            <li>Used it for the first time last night, expected to be disappointed by it,  but it actually works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I admit, the pasting on part is kind of weird.  </li>
            <li>I seriously think its just like nair but not as strong.  </li>
            <li>I have a light amount of body hair, but its really thick and course.</li>
            <li>Work ok but not great.</li>
            <li>A little more came this time, but the result was odd.  </li>
            <li>I tried it first in my chest, and even when I&#x27;m not a hairy guy I decided to trim it down with scissors.</li>
            <li>A flat stick will do a much better job of evenly covering the entire surface, and will do it in a thinner layer (thick is not necessary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>No pain, a slight burning feeling, but not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>i had a slight burning first time i used it but</li>
            <li>I have used many other hair removal products in the past.  </li>
            <li>I used the product exactly as directed...using the sticks, waiting ten minutes, and then using the exfoliating glove, which itself caused extreme discomfort while &amp;#34;lightly buffing&amp;#34; the skin (imagine taking 100 grit sandpaper to a sunburn).</li>
            <li>It did irritate the skin ever so mildly but no more than a razor did.  </li>
            <li>At first I was wary of using a removal cream, due to a bad reaction to another brand years ago, but after giving it a try I am more than happy with The Bare Pair.</li>
            <li>This works very well on my stomach and other areas.</li>
            <li>When using the glove, I usually wipe several times in one direction, in the shower to remove the cream from the area, and then lightly and vigorously back and forth when the cream has been sufficiently rinsed from the area.</li>
            <li>Just be careful the first time not to leave it on too long, because it will burn the hell out of you.  </li>
            <li>and recently a &amp;#34;Professional Hair Removal&amp;#34; product that was quite expensive but not to effective.</li>
            <li>a big guy using a razor can be a bit challenging and irritating,</li>
            <li>If you do not live in a big city like myself where its no problem to find a place specializing in man-grooming of the most delicate of areas then this product is for you.</li>
            <li>As for ingrown hairs, I have not noticed a single new one.</li>
            <li>Burns a little at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to get every little hair on the first application so don&#x27;t expect it too.</li>
            <li>a razor is still needed to clean up any small patch&#x27;s left over but no big deal</li>
            <li>Tried it first day with a skeptical feeling , just one nut to be exact , it was ok , but I was afraid to apply too much , so it did remove a few hairs, and I quickly rinsed as it says to do ,</li>
            <li>The lotion it came with was very nice, sort of thin, not my usual stuff, but I (for no good reason) thought there might be something special in it for post-chemical use, so I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, as it says in the directions, do Not use any soap or anything else &#x27;down there&#x27; except the calm balm, which you should use the moment you get out of the shower and dry off.</li>
            <li>Each time however left me generally scared for the two berries hanging below.  </li>
            <li>Definitely use it after the hair removal process with the \\&quot;bare Balm\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I am providing 4 star only because of the bare balm.</li>
            <li>Obviously if you have sensitive skin, try a small sample first.  </li>
            <li>3 days later I can barely walk without it hurting still</li>
            <li>In a second session two weeks after the first (and with a lot less hair) I left it for 20 minutes and the story repeated.  </li>
            <li>If your hair grows back slowly then you might be okay with using this every other day.</li>
            <li>Although using on areas with considerably less sensitivity the product really words wonders.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re also going to want to invest in something like the [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]] in order to keep maintenance to a reasonable minumum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Customer service did finally get back to me - apparently there was a breakdown of sorts delivering the message through the Amazon system.  </li>
            <li>Also, there has been absolutely no irritation whatsoever regardless of where I used it, and that&#x27;s coming from someone with very very sensitive</li>
            <li>Not long enough and hair was still there.  </li>
            <li>however, I think I&#x27;ll be able to get at least half a dozen uses out of one bottle.</li>
            <li>For me I never got a clear and easy result and at the end had to just shave because it just looked weird that some places had</li>
            <li>Even if you generally don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or have used other similar products before.</li>
            <li>so it gets the stuff done, I also recommend doing this two days straight because if you have think hair you WILL get a little patchy</li>
            <li>if you have thick body hair, dont expect much!!</li>
            <li>So I read the bad and good reviews and still went ahead with the purchase.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I think the best solution is to shave (with a razor/shaver) in the pubic area</li>

            <li> So this didn&#x27;t work all that great for me...</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gag gift for friends birthday, he said it worked great.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great, 1st</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]]for trimming up the rest of the forest, this is a great way to get the look (and feel) you want.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for me; I leave it on for up to 20 minutes while reading,and never had any burning problems.</li>
            <li> I had no burning and skin felt great afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The product works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>

            <li> Worked great.</li>
            <li> Didnt work that great for us</li>
            <li> The great thing about this product is that it does the job its intended to do without reducing you to a blubbering pile of quivering jello laying upon the ground in a fetal position.  </li>
            <li> These are great items that accomplish what they state</li>
            <li> Product works like it says it should and have ordered again and great service as well.</li>
            <li> but it works GREAT.</li>
            <li> I immediately experienced a burning sensation that increased in intensity as I proceeded.</li>
            <li> Also worked great on the taint.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> It is very effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product worked great for me needed the full 15 to be successful!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame the product,) were amazing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair you need to have for this to work on you, but know that your mileage may vary, so buy this product with caution!</li>
            <li> , do not use body wash or any kind of soap after using this!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution, I love this depilatory cream as well as the lotion.</li>
            <li> It was pleasant.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I were very impressed with the results of the product; easy to apply, comfort during use and washes off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product as it&#x27;s easy to use and wonderful.  </li>
            <li> can take a good deal of pain</li>
            <li> This is especially important to me, because I share a bathroom, so it&#x27;s nice to keep my business MY business, and not have others knowing what you&#x27;ve &#x27;just done&#x27; in the bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once the burning subsided the smooth feel was awesome,  however, I am terrified to use it again.</li>
            <li> good to go</li>
            <li> A good razor does just as well.</li>
            <li> and I think I should get a good number of uses out of one tube.</li>
            <li> Makes everything silky smooth and delightful.</li>
            <li> it smells good too.  </li>
            <li> My advice, stay away from this and shave with a good razor.</li>
            <li> I laughed.</li>
            <li> being said I ordered this off a recommendation from a friend who loved it to groom the Bits and some on my back.&lt;br /&gt;Had experience with veet and nair</li>
            <li> Just because you&#x27;re good to go for nine minutes</li>
            <li> minutes in one area, you may not be good to go for nine minutes plus in another -- this was also my experience.</li>
            <li> I recommend having a good book or magazine to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Wash it off and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Coupled with a good trimmer like the Bodygroomer</li>
            <li> Some tenderness but rub the soothing balm and your good.</li>
            <li> how they can say this has a &#x27;mouth-watering smell&#x27; is beyond me, it smells just like NAIR, and that&#x27;s not at all mouth-watering.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> just felt a tinglingy feeling but did good removed her in 10 min .</li>
            <li> Hopefully will report with good news.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> as good.</li>
            <li> I gave it a fair chance (3 times).</li>
            <li> Works great and it was easy!</li>
            <li> I loved how it felt to be smooth again!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see that the product worked just like advertised.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome combination with the calm balm included in the package.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on consecutive days, followed the directions exactly, and still don&#x27;t have perfect smoothness.</li>
            <li> Truth is, the name of the product gave me a chuckle, so I checked it out - and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> (make sure to wash thoroughly immediately after!).</li>
            <li> Much better than going to get waxed!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> This stuff works magic!</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t get too confident!</li>
            <li> Okay for body hair not recommended for use on balls!</li>
            <li> the lotion it comes with is amazing, it stays on until I shower it off.</li>
            <li> I used this on my shoulders to test it and worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li> The area under my tummy where the happy trail is, was the area that didn&#x27;t get thoroughly smooth.  </li>
            <li> Again, the happy trail area was just...  not as smooth.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend kind of as a joke, and when he opened it he looked at me like I was nuts (no pun intended), but he loves it, and so do I.</li>
            <li> I kind of knew this was not going to work, with \\&quot;Veet\\</li>
            <li> The soothing cream is nice and def.</li>
            <li> thought I would give this a try since so many people had good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I had to push the 10 minute mark, but BallsBalm did the job in spectacular fashion.</li>
            <li> I am still loving this product.</li>
            <li> Ran my leg under warm water and smoothed the glove around in circles.</li>
            <li> and i couldn&#x27;t find any until i purchased this product and to be HONEST</li>
            <li> and I would be able to spread it out fairly even.</li>
            <li> The after lotion is also quite nice.</li>
            <li> Unless you are superman, and have some kind of kryptonian superhuman skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer choking on my own scrote ribbon that got lodged in her teeth</li>
            <li> Also the fact that everything you need comes in the kit is incredibly nice and convenient.</li>
            <li> but that didn&#x27;t prove effective</li>
            <li> Me being me, I liked the idea</li>
            <li> I hope you&#x27;ve liked my review.</li>
            <li> so your neighbors won&#x27;t think you are some kind of pornstar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On healthy skin (like they fairly warn on the packaging)</li>
            <li> but however the smell was nice...</li>
            <li> Anyway, after waiting the allotted time, I took a warm shower.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it  is as effective and the product has to stay on for 10 to 14 minutes.</li>
            <li> Has kind of a minty thing going on that helps to sooth the experience.  </li>
            <li> The after care lotion is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> Do so at your own risk.</li>
            <li> and honestly I was a bit skeptic but</li>
            <li> I really liked reading the directions.</li>
            <li> , then it doesn&#x27;t work that well in the end.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Calm Balm&amp;#34; is awesome, it really does cool and make my skin feel great after i use Nair to remove my hair.</li>
            <li> (that can be easily washed away with a pleasant smelling body soap)</li>
            <li> Very good product thanks!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes a quick shave in between sessions works just great.  </li>
            <li> It has a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad it did!  </li>
            <li> it smells better than most!</li>
            <li> kinda nice considering that you have to wear the stuff for 15 minutes or more at a time.  </li>
            <li> but then it makes you nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best thing that $15.99 could buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better experiences with Nair, to be honest.</li>
            <li> The problem is that is that it&#x27;s neither more effective or easier than using a razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I never found a product to clean up ball hair than one that works as good as this.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for me, my partner had to cover x2 in order for it to work overall a great set for the price</li>
            <li> I was extremely smooth and felt very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I think I have tried them all and found bare balls to be the best out there.</li>
            <li> This is pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, and the Calm Balm was nice and soothing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You receive exactly what you are looking for, and it&#x27;s a great value as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This may be true, but I&#x27;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and believe some people out there probably have had good results with this product.  </li>
            <li> The good it leaves the jewels nice and smooth never had them that smooth</li>
            <li> Be sure to flush the area liberally and for a good while with cool water.</li>
            <li> Putting on the dipilatory with the stick makes its use nice and easy.  </li>
            <li> then you might be better off sticking to your shaving.</li>
            <li> I will point out though that if you&#x27;re able to afford [[ASIN:B005IGUUBU</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is a lot better than having cuts, and bumps from shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re better off using this in the morning rather than the night before.</li>
            <li> then you will be okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they sell that without the ballsBalm hair remover.</li>
            <li> and they love it.  </li>
            <li> It feels great and really sooths your skin.</li>
            <li> Feel sexy now?</li>
            <li> Just shaving might be easier and get better results...</li>
            <li> That is why you must wait a while to do its magic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this product.</li>
            <li> (mostly) does not bother me(although</li>
            <li> If I wanted to remove all the hair on my body I would need more than 1 of these(more like 5 or 6).</li>
            <li> the nair for men works much better.</li>
            <li> My balls have never felt better.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I was especially pleased with the area at the joint of the leg and body, but this area was also burning the most, left some salve on without rubbing it in, it cooled that off too.</li>
            <li> Nair (womens stuff) seems to work much better</li>
            <li> and I am 90% pleased.</li>
            <li> The hair removal cream was thicker than most and seemed made for a guy.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work as well or better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> If you choose to buy this product, for the love of your balls, please do a test patch before slathering it all over.</li>
            <li> just make sure</li>
            <li> Well, it works for sure, but it sometimes leaves patches of stubble in some places and removes everything in another spot...</li>
            <li> Is it better than shaving?</li>
            <li> Just be sure to apply generously and spread around even after that until coat while you wait.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over two weeks now and it is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Thanks Balls Balm for a great product.</li>
            <li> Works as described,but make sure to count application time with wait time or you might regret it.</li>
            <li> I figured if it was safe for the balls, it should be safe for the nipples.  </li>
            <li> I am sure it works better on some types of skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Groin is mostly 8-10 minutes I would say.</li>
            <li> I think this is the most genius part of the system.</li>
            <li> and I am sure he is going to love it.</li>
            <li> Should be interesting. :)</li>
            <li> do have to leave the product on more towards the maximum time recommended.  </li>
            <li> The best thing about this kit was the glove that i now use when i use a different hair removal cream, the second best was the &amp;#34;Calm Balm&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Okay I am not going to lie</li>
            <li> I shave just like most guys, but it&#x27;s like being tortured.</li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> however make sure you keep an eye on the time.</li>
            <li> and that was better since I kept it on for 16 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of just shaving or getting waxed for a better result.</li>
            <li> My roommates got a good laugh at me gettin \\&quot;Ball</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done, I feel FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice way to stay smooth.</li>
            <li> its ok though kinda guessed that would happen.</li>
            <li> going to order more.</li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> Great product finally a real product for us guys.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my koojons nice and smooth and to get away from a razor.</li>
            <li> It immediately felt better and after rinsing thoroughly I liberally applied the calming gel.  </li>
            <li> Leaves you smooth!</li>
            <li> it can also lead to many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Great product and works REALLY well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn, and works better than anything I&#x27;ve bought otc.</li>
            <li> All was well, until I started \\&quot;groping\\&quot; myself, as the directions humorously call for, with the provided cotton glove.  </li>
            <li> I applied to my chest and ended up leaving it on for 17 minutes to be sure it took the hair off.</li>
            <li> much, MUCH better than shaving.  </li>
            <li> does tingle but your on your precious jewels that have alot of sensitivity</li>
            <li> This was really kind to my &amp;#34;parts&amp;#34; and worked comfortably well.</li>
            <li> Love the product</li>
            <li> Further the sticks and glove are brilliant!</li>
            <li> The calming balm aided a bit in that department, but was mostly ineffective after a couple of hours or so.  </li>
            <li> What was most ineffective was the hair removal cream itself which appeared to not remove anything at all.  </li>
            <li> I am taking the time to write this review because of how unconditionally satisfied I am with ballsBalm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell like your girlfriend&#x27;s scented lotion, but why should it?</li>
            <li> And as soon as I can get the word out, dozens more where that came from.</li>
            <li> but damn it can really light you on fire!  </li>
            <li> The glove is awesome, In light of loosing money purchasing this product, I did get a great laugh smacking my friend in the head with this glove the very next day after using it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow the instructions that come with it</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t wait to step up to the plate and commit to better pubic management.</li>
            <li> I need to be able to find it again...</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> a better note</li>
            <li> But once I scrubbed the area, it was silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Perhaps you&#x27;ll have better results than I, for if you&#x27;re still reading, you&#x27;ll notice I did not use the soothing gel part of the kit, as I didn&#x27;t see any need.</li>
            <li> In fact, the Calm Balm feels so good that I use it routinely after showering.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you do try after 7-8 minutes and see if it&#x27;s already done the job.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> We was hoping for the same awesome results.  </li>
            <li> Ok I got this item in hopes it would work</li>
            <li> AND it says you can should be able to use it about every two to three weeks.</li>
            <li> It has a chemically odor, noticeable but not nasty.  </li>
            <li> Well, this is interesting stuff.</li>
            <li> More of a notification that you&#x27;ve put something on your balls</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair management products which were all unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for about 5 minutes more than they say.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my huevos nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> sure you use a washcloth or the &#x27;exfoliating glove&#x27; included, as the hair will nit just rinse away</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re adventurous use a finger to schmear</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and more on the light-haired end of the spectrum.  </li>
            <li> When I got out I was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> however overall I was impressed.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> \\&quot;OK</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the instructions</li>
            <li> Gets my balls and shaft nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> The glove should be made more of a loofa material, instead it&#x27;s more like cotton</li>
            <li> I have a lot more hair on my chest and it seemed the cream had a tougher time here.</li>
            <li> even on a gorilla like me :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely the best package for male hair removal out there.</li>
            <li> so make sure to remove within the time limit specified.  </li>
            <li> (Kinda cute)</li>
            <li> I have been using Nair for years, with positive, un remarkable results.  </li>
            <li> It was kind burning but a couple of applications of the soothing skin salve was refreshing, and got me cool again.</li>
            <li> so I was trying to find a solution that will allow me to get rid of hair easily as well as something that will leave my skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> With that said, it did the job fairly well the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, a pretty good product</li>
            <li> That stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and pain free!  </li>
            <li> The application sticks make sure you apply the correct amount of remover cream and the included glove helps you remove the hair easily in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No amount of exfoliating, soaking in warm water, lotions, steaming, or fresh blades of any number have been able to fix this.</li>
            <li> nothing too strong, also the glove isn&#x27;t super effective</li>
            <li> You may need to do a couple of applications for best results but that&#x27;s easy to do and is better than any other way.</li>
            <li> You skin looks a lot better and does feel smooth afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To keep things short and sweet; is it perfect?</li>
            <li> The hair comes off way better with light, vigorous, rubbing (but remove the cream thoroughly before doing so, otherwise you&#x27;ll just rub it into the skin and end up with a burn)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it to give my husband a more smooth feeling than shaving and rue the day I did :</li>
            <li> The Calm Balm was a nice touch and seemed to help.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;calm balm\\&quot; feels wonderful after using the \\&quot;bare balm.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The MOST important thing to remember is NOT to keep the cream on longer that 10-12 mins tops.</li>
            <li> They loved it so much that I</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant but the good reviews cleared my fears and I purchased.</li>
            <li> Then, if all was good to go with the test area, I recommend that you can move towards the whole region, doing it just like you did for the test.</li>
            <li> No need to worry about accident nicking her special areas when using this stuff!</li>
            <li> I finally have a good product to get rid of all my unwanted hairs, in all my unwanted places!</li>
            <li> Why use the the other stuff after perfect?)</li>
            <li> but wiped away easily and did the job.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you apply a good amount of the product or it wont remove the hair completely.</li>
            <li> Cleans up easily and the outcome was smoother than my razor.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure this would clean up all the hair I can&#x27;t get to</li>
            <li> so I figured this would be easy .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its also easy to use(even</li>
            <li> The glove makes it easy to remove in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper, more effective, and easier, as I&#x27;ve found out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better results once I use it a couple more times and figure out the best way to use it, but the bottom-line is - it works, and it is very easy to use, and it is very fast compared to shaving.</li>
            <li> So I ran a second attempt to get the happy trail area smooth and more hairless.  </li>
            <li> Then tried on ma balls and general groin area and it worked great as well.  </li>
            <li> So, this is my first time using this kind of product.</li>
            <li> but it kind of blew me away when I first smelled it.   </li>
            <li> this product is awesome, the combined removal and balm works really well with no after affects just bought some more as a back up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool and refreshing and makes your junk smell good!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amending my original review and going to say it really just good for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I squeezed the tube full blast on my nuts and spread it with the stick , waited exactly 12 minutes instead of 11 , got into shower with cotton glove , and BAM !!!</li>
            <li> The Calm Balm is still a nice product, not a bad moisturizing cream at all.    </li>
            <li> When you first apply, use more than you think you need, and bit more than that.</li>
            <li> That felt fine, but</li>
            <li> I spot tested it and everything seemed fine.</li>
            <li> but the day after I feel fine.</li>
            <li> or so should do fine)</li>
            <li> (The stuff worked fine.</li>
            <li> Hair was removed just fine.</li>
            <li> The stuff works just fine.</li>
            <li> I had slightly more irritation, but it went away quickly.</li>
            <li> and I feel nothing down there except the awesome feeling of smooth balls.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s good, but Veet is better than this on any day, clean more deep and smoth.</li>
            <li> Works great on longer hair, less effective on shorter (trimmed) hair.</li>
            <li> that just changed right now, With this product I could EASILY remove my hair and it works like magic with me,</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful compared to other products, and it also works great so long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin areas with fine hair.</li>
            <li> you will need to order a huge amount of the stuff...</li>
            <li> If you enjoy having skin on your junk, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This does make you smooth when used correctly, and assuming you don&#x27;t miss any spots.</li>
            <li> it took me 3x 15 minute applications to get smooth.</li>
            <li> balls have never been this smooth before.</li>
            <li> no burns, just smooth skin.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed, and I like smooth legs, so I was still going to do</li>
            <li> My skin has been levels of smooth</li>
            <li> and I have a light stubble now, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably do it again tomorrow, but I expect the repetition to be about what I&#x27;d do shaving to keep my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> Great shortly after application to touch.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth look anywhere on your body this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I am now hair free and smooth.</li>
            <li> The glove is important.</li>
            <li> I visited the Dr. today and he confirmed an allergic reaction to the stuff.</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t las tong, and I feel soooo smooth.</li>
            <li> You want the area to be free from body oils, but not scrubbed clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a much milder and equally effective product.</li>
            <li> as smooth as a babies</li>
            <li> I could say I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom here, but you would have to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Everything stayed smooth for about five days before I started feeling prickly, but it was five days of heaven.</li>
            <li> The rest, like the um.. sack was smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy your balls being on fire without relief for weeks, then I would suggest not using this product.</li>
            <li> My ballz are so smooth</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with it&#x27;s effectiveness, any irritation and it does get the area I treat smooth.</li>
            <li> It removes light hair well and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Lather up as the directions on the tube indicate and be prepared for an oh so smooth experience</li>
            <li> This is an incredibly effective and reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li> You will want to use it about 2-3 times a week if you want to be really smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> my balls finally be smooth?</li>
            <li> The woman really enjoy this on guys.</li>
            <li> to use, easy clean up.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m smooth as can be.</li>
            <li> There is no pain and it leaves your scrotum and shaft hairless and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Finally a product men can use and it delivers great results.</li>
            <li> balls as smooth as the day i was born</li>
            <li> It actually comes with two applicator sticks that work great, as well as the advertised contents.</li>
            <li> Even those light touches hurt like hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was only able to get really good results after about 25 minutes, but it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, the reason I&#x27;m writing this review is because I know that when I was looking into trying this Balls Balm product for the first time, I wanted to find a thorough review of both the pros and cons of the product, something that explained in fairly good detail what I could expect before taking the risk for myself.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would be effective yet sensitive and this delivered!!!</li>
            <li> make sure you get the cream on the skin, right at the root of your hair.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t get it all unless you&#x27;re very careful about applying it, it does an incredible job at removing what it covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend Balls if you want that &#x27;clean and smooth&#x27; feeling...</li>
            <li> if you have light amounts of body hair, and just want a clean look, maybe this will work for you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright white and easy to pick out when you miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test Spot:&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Though it had a mild burn sensation, but as it promised in removing hair easily, so far, so good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is more gimicky and probably meant as a funny gift.</li>
            <li> No bad reaction, no pain just smooth balls.   </li>
            <li> so your significant others don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try 9 minutes the first time just to be safe.</li>
            <li> Was excited to get this so that I could use it on \\&quot;the boys\\&quot; instead of shaving all of the time.  </li>
            <li> I love this product it does exactly what you guys say it does</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t use it on any genitalia, I&#x27;ve only used it on my rear end, but thus far after two applications it&#x27;s worked great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product as long as you FOLLOW the directions.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product was ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was very fast, the product is 100% effective and pretty well-priced.</li>
            <li> Also my girlfriend loves the Mr Clean feel</li>
            <li> My balls stay super clean and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> (Remember to clean it thoroughly).  </li>
            <li> hair off where the cream is applied, but it just isn&#x27;t effective enough to be considered hugely better than shaving or trimming.</li>
            <li> and it all came away clean.  </li>
            <li> A dry rag could then be used to remove any of the hair that was still on your stick and balls, lol.  </li>
            <li> It keepa things clean all day and the guys at the gym are never the wiser.</li>
            <li> have never been this smooth, this quickly WITHOUT having some sort of burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product did clean it up</li>
            <li> but when you do it again it should come out really clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell to strong and the hair came right off.</li>
            <li> &quot; I had to use a special \\&quot;scraper\\&quot; to remove the hair(I</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;specially formulated and</li>
            <li> It will pull right out!</li>
            <li> but right now it&#x27;s all mine!</li>
            <li> With some personal fine tuning  I believe this will turn into a once a while product used sparingly too keep yourself nice and smooth where it counts.  </li>
            <li> Imagine bright red sunburn with bubbly skin, as though you&#x27;ve gotten sun poisoning.</li>
            <li> , I suggest you start in that range before doing the full time as that&#x27;s how I started.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really cool.</li>
            <li> Using as directed it removed most hair readily.</li>
            <li> Much gentler than Nair, works better, and no &amp;#34;chemical smell&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs because I thought it would be the best place to start with since the hair is not too thick</li>
            <li> The  lotion was okay, but very runny.</li>
            <li> and I waited a FULL 20 MINUTES.  </li>
            <li> plan to contact the manufacturer for a full refund.</li>
            <li> plan to contact the manufacturer for a full refund.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty good at reading and following directions</li>
            <li> I love this product I really recommend this for the hairy guys out there</li>
            <li> True, it has a smell, but by no means did I find it obnoxious at all.</li>
            <li> Of course you&#x27;ll get a better result with shaving but that takes way to much time and effort.</li>
            <li> it doesnt smell so good though so extra body wash was needed afterwards</li>
            <li> this story was inspired by true events...</li>
            <li> I wanted to get the full effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad and you do eventually get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several times and it varies couple time perfect couple times not so perfect minus the slight Oder it works</li>
            <li> If you live in city where waxing services of this type are available keep going there as waxing provides a much better result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the soothing solution feels great after the other solution.&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li> I experienced a mild burn and extremely minimial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Obviously the calm balm is very good to have, it provides asoothing feeling and make the skin very soft.</li>
            <li> The quick breakdown:    </li>
            <li> quick update</li>
            <li> Just quick hair removal.</li>
            <li> According to the reviews there are some lucky folks out there that this doesn&#x27;t phase them...</li>
            <li> Once I felt the burn start, I minimized the damage by just rinsing the stuff off as quickly as I could with just water, and then used the glove ever so gingerly.  </li>
            <li> Oh, by the way, my wife loves the results on me as well and is always excited to give me some attention after using the product, that&#x27;s the reason we are using it right?</li>
            <li> But The stuff is good enough to be a general lotion/moisturizer in its own right..</li>
            <li> Some history - for about the past 5 years I have searched for the ideal solution to my hair problem.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my chest and back of my neck after a haircut as well (never shaved there before but was recommended by the guy who told me of the product) and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> the package is smooth and no ill side effects.  </li>
            <li> So, as one who has waxed &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;, as well as my back and chest area, I think this is a reasonable - and more cost effective - option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nair for men didnt make my balls swell... nor did it give me rashes, but when i used it on my less sensative spots it worked great.</li>
            <li> And if you figure you&#x27;ll pass the 10 minutes playing video games or watching TV, don&#x27;t it&#x27;s way too easy to lose track of the 10 minutes fast.  </li>
            <li> Balls balm is an extremely fast and easy product for body hair removal.</li>
            <li> I was worried about putting stuff on my sensitive parts, so I trimmed own the hair to about 1/8\\&quot; first.</li>
            <li> Easy and fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks BallsBalm !!</li>
            <li> It was softer, smaller, and more sparse!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today and really didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be anywhere near as good as it is.</li>
            <li> Stuff did not burn (did get a little warm, but very comfortable).  </li>
            <li> I have used many time of hair removal items in the past, this is the most effective and gentle product i have yet to use.  </li>
            <li> If you do decide to go this route, make sure you load up on the calming lotion, ice, and loose fitting boxers.</li>
            <li> , luckily nothing burned the only thing I felt was a warm sensation that actually felt nice, I then washed off the cream with the glove it did take some time to get rid of the hairs.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.. and as an added bonus, it smells a little like play-doh.</li>
            <li> This works great and in little time.</li>
            <li> The little applicator sticks that are included are great for evening out the solution on your body as well.  </li>
            <li> If you know its safe on your skin and actually will work on your hair fine...</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I was so excited that I did not test any part of my body, I went right to my manly area</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff that I have ever found its amazing, it does not have a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Calm Balm\\&quot; seems to do its job well, and I did not have any adverse effects from it.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for the Calm Balm.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;calm balm&#x27; didn&#x27;t calm squat.</li>
            <li> and it does get messy sometimes but its a GREAT product.</li>
            <li> I just wish that Amazon sold just the Balls without the Calm.  </li>
            <li> I never use the calm.</li>
            <li> &quot; so i go for the calm balm.</li>
            <li> i make a run for the calm balm.</li>
            <li> Still, if it allowed me to avoid putting a razor to the boys I thought it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if the bottles came in a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointingly, no one noticed, not even once, and I had not stopped wearing shorts and skirts.</li>
            <li> Success.</li>
            <li> It does work for sure, but if you have sensitive skin beware.</li>
            <li> I don’t want to knock the product because it for sure removes hair, but beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Surprising hair does not cling on as baldly has I expected on the glove so washing should not be an issue.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have yet to find a pain free way to do this, until now!</li>
            <li> The lotion is fun and slippery and does have a cooling effect.</li>
            <li> This product works great and the people saying it burns is only because their skin is to sensitive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll take 2 times to get everything, but completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Balls Balm for being so gentle.. :)</li>
            <li> I would advise all to steer clear of this and, like me, stick to a good old fashioned razor.  </li>
            <li> Next I jump in the shower with the water running slightly warm, I put the glove on and began a wiping/brushing motion.</li>
            <li> The sample patch i put on the fun bag didn&#x27;t even burn at all.</li>
            <li> Used this product once and it worked okay, although I didn&#x27;t get to close to the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Does what it says well worth the bang for the buck, and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is it worth it?</li>
            <li> Burning and God help you if you managed to accidentally get some on a more sensitive area because there was nothing else on this earth that could.</li>
            <li> this is a great product worked very well only took about 6 minutes and wiped right off, and the cooling balm worked very well also</li>
            <li> I also applied the Calm Balm right after drying off my beans and frank.</li>
            <li> I can not blame this company for my sensitivity to this particular product, so take that with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;The part that really upset me the most about this stuff</li>
            <li> I hopped in the shower and scrubbed it off with the handy-dandy glove, and laughed some more at how ridiculously convenient the process was.</li>
            <li> Just because it worked fine over that region, it does not mean you can just go nuts with the stuff.</li>
            <li> Okay to be honest it works really well down there.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> im on fire, use the Salve right after the shower, and dont soap up the area after the Pawing.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, the reviews were right</li>
            <li> The hair came right off.</li>
            <li> The hair comes off, but right after im out of the shower the burning starts.</li>
            <li> Then right after I did it on another area</li>
            <li> just right for the bear pair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to go nuts with the stuff right out of the chute.</li>
            <li> plus (it takes time to shower the stuff off, right?)</li>
            <li> shower with soap right away.</li>
            <li> Right between the cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Bare Balm and used it last night works great.</li>
            <li> And it got the whole area pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li> Got this mainly after reading the detailed reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Ok, no this did cause me to shave a bit, but overall, it was a joy because it took way less time.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it does smell kind of funny when you are applying it but</li>
            <li> O and the smell it pretty nice actually.</li>
            <li> It was not an all over reaction (hence patch testing wouldn&#x27;t give you a true irritant reading) but just in certain spots, no rhyme nor reason.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it off the best I could and set back to work down under.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth skin down there, this is a nice solution.</li>
            <li> I will say the calm balm is pretty good, it makes your skin super silky soft and totally counteracts any irritation.</li>
            <li> Easy and simple instructions to get you smooth in all the right spots.</li>
            <li> When I first bought it, I was actually excited to use it, based on what the product promised (removes hair easily with no shaving required, dulls out the thickness of future hair growth and most importantly, safe for your privates).</li>
            <li> I did a small test spot it worked great with no irritation.</li>
            <li> so I was able to bare my pair and recover.</li>
            <li> , I would not have experienced the usual \\&quot;razor</li>
            <li> The calm balm also does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> How will my balls react to their new glory of a smooth life?\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get this delivered and the instructions disclose that even it works right the first time that it could not work (burn you)</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, this did not irritate me in the least bit I am happy to report!</li>
            <li> Skip the sticks and get gloves to make life easy and application complete.</li>
            <li> I love how this product removes hair without a harsh odor, but don&#x27;t leave it on more than the recommended time.  </li>
            <li> Balls will have you smooth but not quite as smooth and groomed as your local hottie esthetician can provide.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t expect your skin to be smooth, it will probably feel like stubble the first time and be really smooth the second time you use it.</li>
            <li> Far more superior to Men&#x27;s Nair and past hair removal system I have used.</li>
            <li> If at any time you start to feel anything beyond a slight warm or cool sensation (ex.</li>
            <li> at any time you start to feel anything beyond a slight warm or cool sensation (ex.</li>
            <li> For my first experimental area run, I chose a spot that could easily be seen with a mirror.</li>
            <li> I received my order in a couple of days, very fast.</li>
            <li> I have also sent questions to the company and had very fast reply.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use very much of the cream with each application.  </li>
            <li> You have everything you need for a very reasonable price including a moisturizer/calming lotion.</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs is much thinner and paler than other hair on my body, so I hoped it would come off fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely clean, pain free, simple and done in 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Much more gentle than other products, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> If you do it in the morning you will find you can make it until the next day before needing to do it again, in most cases.</li>
            <li> I got it because it was the first time I saw something like this for guys, so</li>
            <li> Afterwards, you can apply the Calm Balm which really helps soothes the area.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly, testing the product on two areas.  </li>
            <li> more then i care to go get the same result/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; - result was only slightly better.</li>
            <li> im sure i applyed enough.</li>
            <li> I used this yesterday for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> , I put the cream on, didn&#x27;t think it was working, but left it on for about 12 minutes, then rubbed it with the glove, and saw hairs coming off, so I rubbed some more and jumped in the shower</li>
            <li> Nair Extra Strength seems to be a stronger and better product then this one.    </li>
            <li> First off let me say that this is the first hair removal product I have used</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Like most of these products you keep using it and your hair comes back slower and finer each time.  </li>
            <li> Just take your time and test first, do not exceed recommended time.</li>
            <li> have continued using this product for about 2 months now, just emptied the first tube, so about 8 to 10</li>
            <li> Make sure the application is even and don&#x27;t rush as if it will burn your skin off if you leave it on an extra minute.</li>
            <li> First, Some Background:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a chick</li>
            <li> and I have had no ill effects.</li>
            <li> So you may be interested in this product to be hairless below the belt.</li>
            <li> The dieections say to leave on for ten or so minutes, but after just three it had removed the hair and my top layer of skin.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but be willing to deal with it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> so first I used it</li>
            <li> and I got it for 3 times and once from amazon and willing to get it soon when I finish the one I have .</li>
            <li> Followed instructions exactly, did not remove any hair at all.</li>
            <li> Just be aware incase you are getting this shipped somewhere like work or something.</li>
            <li> You will have to determine where to place it after the first time using it though.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> This was the first hair removal product I&#x27;ve ever used, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> 03/31/2014&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 days since the first application</li>
            <li> prefer using Carson&#x27;s Magic Razorless facial cream.  </li>
            <li> If you use as directed and DO NOT have it applied longer than the time limits for regular and sensitive areas it leaves you with smooth, sexy skin.</li>
            <li> Works really well and lasts throughout the week!</li>
            <li> /&gt;My first attempt achieved NOTHING.  </li>
            <li> I jumped in the shower again, and rinsed off, and AT FIRST, it seemed like the hair was still there.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell like many similar</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than nair for men repackaged and charging you double for some popsicle sticks and an exfoliating</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it worked at all.</li>
            <li> I first used this product a week ago</li>
            <li> To angry wives/girlfriends, this would be PERFECT if your man has been cheating on you and you seek revenge.</li>
            <li> HOT DAMN</li>
            <li> First time use, using a stop watch to keep track of the time..</li>
            <li> My first attempt</li>
            <li> First run.  </li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, at a reasonable cost and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions the first time.  </li>
            <li> The first question we have to ask is does it work?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just go back to a razor for the most part, with the exception that there are a couple places where I can&#x27;t use a razor with hurting myself, and I&#x27;ll keep this product around because even if it leaves stubble</li>
            <li> I once tried a feminine depilatory cream and fried my sack resulting in my walking like a sumo wrestler for a week just to keep my legs from touching big Jim and the twins.</li>
            <li> I applied some cream, waited exactly 12 minutes</li>
            <li> No, you need to determine what conditions you need for what areas, first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been successful with the pubic region, I let things go for a day or so, so as to compare my results vs a razor (which I did do once or twice in the past.)</li>
            <li> reason I tried this stuff in the first place was because my girlfriend found it on the web and wanted to use it.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try it, first.  </li>
            <li> The product is all about patience, first.</li>
            <li> Thanks Balls Balm!</li>
            <li> not sure I&#x27;d like anyone putting their face in my crotch and having to explain the smell, of course - if they don&#x27;t ask, and just do their job, guess it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem :-p</li>
            <li> First of all I could not leave it on for the 13 minutes</li>
            <li> I know its says to test drive first then go all out</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend!!</li>
            <li> Overall, satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> Used as directed, the product works well to get rid of 80-90% on the first application.</li>
            <li> Also, I have been told that it leaves a funny taste even after you have washed a while, so take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product three times exactly as the directions</li>
            <li> Most definitely will buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li> i follow the instructs, leave it on the exact amount of time, hop in the shower and start \\&quot;groping\\&quot; myself.</li>
            <li> first warning flag pops up...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and have had mixed results.</li>
            <li> Follow the detections (which are pretty funny) and DO use the &amp;#34;calm balm&amp;#34; NOT just any lotion.</li>
            <li> At first, it worked well for my chest and belly</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The reviews on this product all seem pretty correct.</li>
            <li> oh btw I&#x27;m pretty tolerant to pain.</li>
            <li> So i tried this for my first time and it went well,</li>
            <li> I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first to use this, because I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few hair removal products, but nothing was as good as Ball Balm.</li>
            <li> That sure beats needing to shave with a razor practically every day in order to stay smooth down there.</li>
            <li> but if you really want to do things right, don&#x27;t take shortcuts like I tried.  </li>
            <li> Super easy, gentle and leaves everything like a naked mole rat!</li>
            <li> other than that my privet parts felt so amazing.</li>
            <li> If you are very dark haired and very hairy, your results may not be as good as were mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> exactly using a stop watch, then immediately rinsing and using the supplied glove, I can report that my junk is smooth and bare.</li>
            <li> It looks like he has 1st degree burns, bright red patches and some hair appears to be gone but not all, finally scabbing over after 2 days of weeping skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves his skin soft and clean of those undesirable hairs.</li>
            <li> In my opinion - a good hair management product would remove hair for about 1 month before it would begin to grow back, it would be reasonably priced, relatively easy to use, would work on all hair types without irritation(or cuts), and would require less than 20 minutes of your time.  </li>
            <li> The formula is definitely gentle enough and the Balm is a must get item glad they were listed together.</li>
            <li> Sure this product works but it really irritated my skin and is still irritated to this day after I bought and used this product back in August.</li>
            <li> make sure you have some hand lotion or something to cool down after use.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that this stuff does work pretty good if you leave it on long enough.  </li>
            <li> Tried it on my package and it left it clean!</li>
            <li> In fact, even on some of the positive reviews, people indicated it was like</li>
            <li> I get the sense that this product is nothing but a gimmick and that all of the positive reviews out there are from people who are involved with or work for the company trying to boost it&#x27;s reputation.  </li>
            <li> I really like the results I got on my first try...</li>
            <li> The glove dries pretty fast (to stuff away).  </li>
            <li> Well, the name pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> are whisking across your bare smooth ball sack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just have a talk with your balls first and let them know how much attention they will get soon.</li>
            <li> This was my first real experience using a chemical hair remover, and all I can say to the people reading this is read the instructions.</li>
            <li> But I left it on there too long, and it gave me a pretty good burn.</li>
            <li> The lotion one was fine and covered the smell the first one left.  </li>
            <li> It left the scent or better put the smell of the cream where I used it for over a day, which I didn&#x27;t particularly like.</li>
            <li> No pain, not even warm, just a little tickle at first.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for those who have the patience to learn more about their personal sensitivities.</li>
            <li> There is a little odor, but it was mild and dare I say pleasant, especially compared with any depilatory cream I&#x27;ve ever smelled before.</li>
            <li> But then I read some other reviews that said they had tried it more than once and gotten better results a second time.  </li>
            <li> This stuff got rid of several areas of unwanted body hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like some of the hairs wouldn&#x27;t necessarily come out on their own--but it was really easy to pull them out.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I still cant figure out how it is strong enough to burn the skin but not remove hair.</li>
            <li> A lot of hair removal gels and creams remove hair to skin level, so that is not really effective (or pleasant, as it leaves you with almost immediate stubble).  </li>
            <li> Use the calm balm right after you get the bare off your skin!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get every single hair, even when you leave it on for the maximum recommended time (which I always do), but it does get most, and there&#x27;s almost no stubble.</li>
            <li> There are three ways to remove large quantities of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Instead, I got a large bulk of pair hair removed, but not all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should be too smart to fall for.</li>
            <li> I certainly recommend anyone to buy this product and I will be telling my friends.</li>
            <li> If you do too large of an area by the time you finish applying your 10-12 mins are up from where you started...</li>
            <li> The gloves that come with are exfoliating gloves and they will remove the hair easily and evenly while also lightly exfoliating your skin to remove dead cells and lessen the chances of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Irritation, in fact, might be too harsh a word as it was more a tingling discomfort that quickly subsided.</li>
            <li> you only want something for your balls, this stuff should do fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, Balls Balm is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> A little warm on the sack after a while</li>
            <li> how I&#x27;m going to list the positives and negatives of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive- easy instructions, got all the parts u need for it (no additional purchase), easy to use, not many parts to the purchase&lt;</li>
            <li> overall it did the job very well and will leave your body smooth</li>
            <li> Air dry your balls, for maximum effect as you will immediately tell the difference with that fresh clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I find this a great product to have, but at current price and the requirement to use it daily can break the bank if you have a low income.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I could have been more careful in my application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Stuff works really really well.</li>
            <li> The Calm Blam is epic as an all body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After the second application at a later time the product worked great, nothing left.</li>
            <li> Using a wet sponge more hair came off than with the towel.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li> and i have tried Nair and lets just say i would much rather have the ingrown hairs from shaving.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast as well.</li>
            <li> That really saved the day.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely and got a red burn!</li>
            <li> Shower after use, no soap at all (really prevents all irritation problems that customers report)</li>
            <li> give you a cotton glove that you&#x27;re supposed to wear in the shower to gently rub the hair off.</li>
            <li> Time to try the whole leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li> The whole time, I never felt anything.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the product actually works.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> However, Nair for men smells very foul.</li>
            <li> This product removed the hair without a whole lot of effort.  </li>
            <li> The glove is also very helpful when i use Nair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well now you know too much about me.  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY STARTED REMOVING the hair</li>
            <li> I really like the product and it works well.</li>
            <li> Worked really well on balls, not so much anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for women or pubic hair not on the balls.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> The glove is key to maximum removal, but tread lightly</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> These guys really know how to make a product</li>
            <li> I say thanks for your product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but it really burns if you don&#x27;t get the timing right~!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting ready to see a doctor.</li>
            <li> much easier than shaving.</li>
            <li> Picked it up to inspect it a bit and the hairs were very gummy and stringy.</li>
            <li> so my body hair is a light curly mix of coarse hair, but never grows longer than an inch (just to give you an idea).</li>
            <li> I thought this product wasn&#x27;t going to work very well.  </li>
            <li> This combo is an absolute must for me.</li>
            <li> If I used too much, it burned my skin (and still did not remove all the hair).</li>
            <li> Really well.  </li>
            <li> The whole kit works like a charm.</li>
            <li> So I am pretty sure I&#x27;ve been confused with Bigfoot, I am a very hairy fella and trimming was becoming a hassle</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll close by saying that I did experience one area where I absolutely cannot use the product.</li>
            <li> package was very discreet and didn&#x27;t say balls balm or anything</li>
            <li> it says you could -it burnt to much.</li>
            <li> This product gave me the scrotum of a porn star, and my wife absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend, gets the job done!</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t see the real benefits vs the risks.</li>
            <li> it needs a gentle rub.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Big chubby guy here who loves to keep himself smooth and</li>
            <li> however thanks to this product</li>
            <li> The included glove really helped with wiping the stuff off in the shower.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> A lighter version would work so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I will be staying with the Nair, very ineffective</li>
            <li> Within the very time limit, it already started to burn (although still tolerable).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this over waxing!</li>
            <li> As before, even the gentle touch of my fingers</li>
            <li> it works really well...</li>
            <li> From chest &amp; back to the most sensitive if areas</li>
            <li> I bought it to see if it worked better than double shaving with old fashioned Gillette (three blade) shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Drawbacks:  Not as effective as waxing - as you&#x27;ll still have stubble in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough that you should preform a spot test first and wait a FULL 24 HOURS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: it works better than stuff like Nair and it actually was not harsh on my skin at all (as they claim).</li>
            <li> this shit is the kind of stuff where if you rubbed it on an iguana hed turn into</li>
            <li> From my own personal experience, and that of many others I have seen on this and various other sites for reviews on this product, it just does not work well at all for course body hair, so do NOT purchase it for that.  </li>
            <li> The hair remover smells better and is much gentler than other products.</li>
            <li> Some of the main problems that I have with this is that it takes too much time for it to work and doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> , the smell is better than other brands.  </li>
            <li> This worked for me better than other products.</li>
            <li> Following this initial what I&#x27;d consider successful test, I just had to go further, and that&#x27;s when I learned, as I&#x27;ve been saying, that patience, experiment, is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the directions very carefully</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left my chest and legs untouched because I&#x27;m not going to entirely deny my Nordic/Viking hairy awesomeness, but I don&#x27;t doubt that a similarly patient approach to those areas would leave me as smooth as a very smooth thing.</li>
            <li> It DID REMOVE THE FIRST LAYER OF SKIN in more than a few areas.</li>
            <li> I plan on trying again later and waiting a full 20 min as the product is so gentile on skin that I felt absolutely 0 discomfort.    </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and this product works well pretty much everywhere on my body, until I try to &amp;#34;bare my pair.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> so I tested it on my upper thigh for 10mins and it wiped clean off with no irritation.</li>
            <li> one beef i have is that they didn&#x27;t include a few more of those exfoliating gloves, i would have gladly paid a buck or two more if they put in a few extra gloves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving is no fun, using this makes the whole process faster and easer and with better</li>
            <li> Im not a wookie but it has become a pain shaving down there practically every day in order to keep your fun parts smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have light scarring on my abdomen, not a particularly sensitive area, which appears to be permanent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never shave again as long as this stuff is available.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s got a completely inoffensive smell which is</li>
            <li> key is to remember that for truly manly-type hairy guys you&#x27;re probably gonna have to go two or three rounds with this stuff before you see the full effect.  </li>
            <li> It is not going to make you go completely bald the first time.</li>
            <li> I left this on for the full 15 minutes and the hair just came off.</li>
            <li> Performs exactly as advertised, delivering results beyond what a razor could ever do to sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just order a couple each time to give me enough for full coverage.</li>
            <li> hair doesn&#x27;t come back for about 2-3 weeks, most everything else I&#x27;ve used last&#x27;s a week.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well on the boy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to the new product coming out the first of the year because of the new smell.</li>
            <li> Well, having been successful with my first experiments, and having a clue of how much time was needed (for the prior region that is,) I proceeded to move further down.</li>
            <li> it was ok as soon as I applied it to down there</li>
            <li> here I sit, at my PC, writing this review of Balls Balm, and I&#x27;m sporting my new pair of shiny, polished nads!  </li>
            <li> other pubic hair is easy and gentle.  </li>
            <li> Tried again on day 2, left it on for 10 minutes, and used the glove to wipe off and more unwanted hair is coming off but significant chaffing a few hours</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still true - after 4 applications, I&#x27;ve gotten nowhere with the Bare Balm as far as removing pubic hair.  </li>
            <li> I need to use it carefully or find something that removes the hair more completely.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product did not bother me(no lasting cucumber smell), but I did not find it to be better when compared to similar store bought</li>
            <li> The third time I left it on for 15-17 minutes, applying a much more generous amount than ever.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using these kinds of products unless there is a decent amount of hair growth.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had vacation the next week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it pretty much everywhere :O</li>
            <li> I did read the instructions carefully and allowed the balm to remain for 12 minutes prior to &amp;#34;Groping&amp;#34; in a luke warm shower.</li>
            <li> such that there is a light white color covering the area -- you don&#x27;t really need much of the stuff at all, not even when you&#x27;re ready to go for it.</li>
            <li> You must be willing to test the various areas, first.</li>
            <li> I tried it the day I received it, and it seemed to work decent.</li>
            <li> Also, trimming the hairs down first is a huge help.</li>
            <li> mitt does chafe a good bit, so go easy with the scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;the smell is unpleasant, but bearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty much at this point I realized that I wasn&#x27;t going to get a better result than this, and, noticing that the Balm had brought my hair length down enough to do a decent shave, shaved in the shower immediately after scrubbing the product off with a washcloth.      </li>
            <li> Not to mention this product is highly overpriced</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations and this just didn&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li> the price (the pain and somewhat embarrassing trip to the dr.) is way too high.</li>
            <li> but it requires some accurate timing to make sure you leave it on long enough but not too long.</li>
            <li> The balm, highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> but, if you have a high pain threshold &amp; don&#x27;t want to shave, I have an alternative suggestion.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be much more painful &amp; would likely be more effective than Bare Balm in hair removal.</li>
            <li> I wish the labeling was a little more discreet.  </li>
            <li> but i recommend a little more</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait 24 hours anticipating the excitement my wife would feel when she saw her favorite main course without a side of pubic hair (short or long)!</li>
            <li> If you pay attention and use some common sense you&#x27;ll get amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only PLUS is the \\&quot;Calm balm\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> well,it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the hear,but is very close to it.the skin shines,just folllow the instruction and you&#x27;ll se the results</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no irritation or bumpiness which is fantastic and unheard of for me when shaving.</li>
            <li> whole point of this product was (is) to remove hair from sensitive areas, says so on the tube.</li>
            <li> You can go for this pack only for this calm balm.</li>
            <li> I leaped back into the shower and rinsed the Calm Balm from my balls and now I sit...</li>
            <li> No irritating smell, haven&#x27;t had any burns (i would say I have a medium sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> So the stuff is good for people with normal to thin hair, but if you have thick/course hair, or alot of hair..</li>
            <li> The cream helps, but within an hour you&#x27;re running for more or crying for your mother.  </li>
            <li> The whole &#x27;area&#x27; gets red and inflamed and it feels like I took a hot iron to my skin.</li>
            <li> I saw one of the Q &amp; As saying that you will probably get 6 uses out of one tube but maybe a few more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how you can get so few uses unless you&#x27;re using it on most of your body each time or something.</li>
            <li> At first I waited 10 minutes after applying in the removing lotion and barely anything came out.</li>
            <li> also tried it on my chest and the test patch was a success, but when I tried a larger area, it didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li> even on my sack it did a good job with no more iritation than shaving and seem to last longer</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Calm Balm&amp;#34; was almost like squirting lemon juice into a fresh, open wound.</li>
            <li> But if you do it twice or three times over a few days then you&#x27;ll be pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> The glove is a nice addition but it loses the roughness of the material it&#x27;s made from.  </li>
            <li> itll probably feel better in a few minutes.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Most of the hair was removed, but there were still quite a few that were not.</li>
            <li> in normal packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The test removed some hair &amp; had no negative side effects</li>
            <li> Still not a perfect fix, but not a bad on, still deciding whether to buy, again, the mitt comes in handy.</li>
            <li> so I found that gooping them up using my hand nice and thick did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m not very tough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Go out and walk around the house naked slapping your fresh new balls around.</li>
            <li> I am pale with many moles and freckles.</li>
            <li> followed directions and removed all hair easily , applied lotion balm  several times and next day no irritation at all</li>
            <li> To be more clear, you will feel a slight bit of irritation while the product is on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive to try it since there are some pretty negative reviews and the positive reviews sound like they&#x27;e written by narcissists.....</li>
            <li> Well, guess what, you can have an area right next to the area you tested that will get irritated.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, in the middle of summer.</li>
            <li> I tried getting right up next to it and sniffing</li>
            <li> The only thing the product was right about was that it does not burn.</li>
            <li> And then next time increase it, and so on, until you find the right amount of time for you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it came in a plain cardboard box, and didn&#x27;t have \\&quot;BALLS\\&quot; splashed all over it.</li>
            <li> Im not going to make a bunch of obvious jokes and just get right to</li>
            <li> /&gt;It turns out that you do, in fact, need to trim it down, other wise it will not give you your desired results.</li>
            <li> Glove tended to make me a bit more raw then a normal wash cloth.</li>
            <li> This time it worked fine, but only after I waited ONE HOUR and scrubed with a back scrub brush.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and it burned after following the steps but the next day it was fine.</li>
            <li> It should also be noted that the hairy area had been trimmed maybe two weeks prior, so I started out with my hair already under pretty decent control.    </li>
            <li> Accusations have been levied that the positive reviews for the Bare Pair were written by employees of the company who produced this product.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m been smooth for years and change-up between shaving &amp; other hair removal products.</li>
            <li> I left the Bare Balm on for 9 minutes and hopped into the shower because I wanted to make sure to rinse prior to the recommended time of 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I had to rub for a while to get some of the parts of the hairs off, because the long hairs tended to break before the whole thing would come off, but I rubbed very gently for about two minutes</li>
            <li> New nickname is Mr. Bigglesworth.</li>
            <li> They need to be prepared for their new life of fame with attention galore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff on my back, arms and nether regions, with complete success in all areas (</li>
            <li> I had to do my private area twice to get it smooth, but it does actually work.  </li>
            <li> Left more stubble than I expected.</li>
            <li> The after balm is fantastic and my only wish is that the bottle was the same size as the remover.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic, whether you&#x27;re male OR female.</li>
            <li> This had been a request (subtle) of hers for quite some time and, as she is very thorough regarding keeping my favorite main course out of the bush</li>
            <li> but any way...application is somewhat messy but take your time peel, rub, and smooth, shiny (ok not shiny) but less fuzzy balls.  </li>
            <li> It efficiently remove the hair while being gentle on your most delicate skin, what else can a man wish?</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to use, so I put it on fairly thick using the applicator.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys an active life- both in the bedroom and outside:)</li>
            <li> It is left pretty smooth and lasts longer than the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I found out that part of my skin in that area is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have always been very sensitive to hair removal below the waist.</li>
            <li> No pain or discomfort and my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;a close shave\\&quot; and that they have to use it very frequently, which goes against the company&#x27;s claims.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a chemical after all, but it&#x27;s very far from reminding you</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell of the first one you use, but it goes away.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I left it on for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> When I applied it to my chest my skin broke out from becoming irritated and damaged my skin for a few days.</li>
            <li> I was initial skeptical at how good the reviews were and figured it was probably too good to be true, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I have to say, after a couple of uses, that this stuff actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li> and it only happened on the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> For the first day I actually put Polysporin (or you could use Neosporin) all over the burned areas to help the healing, and that worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently, it takes off skin as much as it does hair.  </li>
            <li> People usually only write reviews for three reasons: They are really dissatisfied with the product, they are really happy with the product, or they are bored.</li>
            <li> The first application worked well, the second burned my skin after waiting 24 hours.</li>
            <li> It makes your balls red hot and feel like it going to fall off, I through the rest of it away</li>
            <li> extra moisturizers around because your skin will dry very quickly</li>
            <li> And the tube is huge - will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth I am it did take half a 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Smooth less fuzzy balls just the way I like mine...</li>
            <li> Using it can be challenging but overall the product works pretty well at removing 85-90% of my coarse, black, hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used topical hair removal products in the past that haven&#x27;t been as effective as they claim.</li>
            <li> As a very hairy guy, it&#x27;s hard to remove hair in select areas with a cream, but I was able to bare my balls without getting thigh or butt hair removed-</li>
            <li> I re-applied another layer of \\&quot;Bare Balm\\&quot; cream and then after waiting for more than 15 minutes and using the \\&quot;scraper\\&quot; I had used with \\&quot;Veet\\&quot; a significant amount of hair actually came off, although not entirely(the roots of the hair were still left in the skin - like with other similar products).</li>
            <li> I thought after reading (only the positive) reviews for this product it would do what it says.</li>
            <li> It felt like every pore in the skin of my very scrotum was pierced (inch deep) by yellow hot sowing needles.</li>
            <li> Instead, it more or less dissolved the hair above the roots, leaving a ragged, inconsistent look over the area where the product was applied.      </li>
            <li> Exfoliated the other areas and the hairs pretty much just sloughed off.</li>
            <li> This feels like a warm tingling/stinging sensation which I can only describe as being similar to dipping your balls in to water that is slightly hotter than comfort level.</li>
            <li> guess I just expected too much and as per usual things are usually too good to be true</li>
            <li> I originally thought I would have to use half a bottle of the stuff</li>
            <li> The hand glove is the most versatile tool for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> , it was well worth the very limited irritation.</li>
            <li> &quot; Once again, we&#x27;re in debate, for as I see it, the razor bumps are just how I react when my pores aren&#x27;t 100% clear.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough and the burning lasted two days.  </li>
            <li> In my first session I left it for 10 minutes and it did a pretty mediocre job, so I reapplied it and waited for 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li> Do not waste any time or money on this product.</li>
            <li> &quot; I have realized my skin does not agree with this product (I have always had somewhat sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> The product still works well; I just wish my skin was not so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Overall the stuff works really well</li>
            <li> you will need to order 2-3 times as much to get the same results...</li>
            <li> I do not have excessively coarse or unusual hair where the product was used.  </li>
            <li> The ocean air softly caresses my balls as I write this review from my ipad.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, shaving gives me bumps</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a professional hair removal product.</li>
            <li> I tried this yesterday and it didn&#x27;t remove the hair on my sensitive parts.  </li>
            <li> this item removed all the hair completely painlessly in the &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; I used it for.</li>
            <li> did one leg at a time, trying a much thinner application on the second leg, and both at 12 minutes.</li>
            <li> applied it on the balls with gloves and left it for 12 mins, removed it in a gentle message fashion using my fingers, as specified and all the hair came off effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Just shaving the old fashioned way easier.</li>
            <li> The tube has lasted three months so far, and still going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that it might just be my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I did not expect too much from it because I have enough hair that could grow-up within 3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My suggestion would be if you have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> The instructions said 10-12 minutes, but the first time I used it, it kinda burned and I could tell that 10-12 minutes was too long.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I guess I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on too long, you may find some red bumps on your skin, but those will go away pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Glad I don&#x27;t have to spend extra time shaving as it gets tiresome, but this product gets you smooth in under 15mins.</li>
            <li> I applied and let it sit for 10 minutes (the amount of time recommended for sensitive areas) and went into the shower to rub it off.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to apply it fast enough with the tounge depressor sticks included as suggested in the directions.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I would not be suprised if there wasn&#x27;t a pending class action lawsuit against the company that created this junk.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get completely baby butt bald though.  </li>
            <li> I am a licensed professional and try every product on the market to see what does and does not work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently my balls are sensitive and burned-</li>
            <li> All you have to do is follow the directions and in under 17 minutes your balls will be baby soft.</li>
            <li> With that being said, spacing out the applications at least a week our more will prevent you from feeling pain.</li>
            <li> From there I removed the glove and proceeded to rinse as much of the balm off me as possible.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, don&#x27;t expect you won&#x27;t discover you have over sensitive areas as well.</li>
            <li> Unless of course your skin is sensitive then probably should steer clear.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to be self conscious about showing off those parts.</li>
            <li> Man they felt soft.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin is just too sensitive for this product.  </li>
            <li> Even something natural would help it.</li>
            <li> This hair removal system does work but it is not for sensitive skin as it will cause redness and leave a burning feeling.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have a few mixed opinions about Balls</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth a try if you want to try something different.</li>
            <li> So I said, \\&quot;Heck with it\\&quot; and ran back upstairs, 20 minutes after my first application, and dropped my drawers and grabbed the bare balm again.  </li>
            <li> After applying a thick layer and waiting more than 10 minutes I tried wiping it off with a towel or \\&quot;washcloth\\&quot; or whatever you want to call it.</li>
            <li> Maybe that would be shortened if I applied it more thickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there may be some irritation but the included after-lotion does a good job of taming that.  </li>
            <li> Lastly on this point, I&#x27;d also recommend hitting the area with an electric mustache shaver, such that the hair is down to around an eighth of an inch, as it makes things easier for you in determining if the product will or will not be suitable for you in that area.</li>
            <li> I then blotted the area dry with a towel and applied the Calm Balm with my bare hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that rinsing the area with lukewarm water with your hands, then blow drying with cool air (dry), prior to application helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Also, one note, be careful with the intensity of scrubbing to remove the hair, it should just slide right off.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have that heavy chemical smell like other depilatory creams and it comes with this AMAZING lotion for after use.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, your skin may be a bit sensitive, but the Calm Balm included soothes extremely well.</li>
            <li> I found use every other week and by the month end you will likely be hair free in all your regions where applied.</li>
            <li> just a tiny bit of a burn on my left nut , which went away next day, been razor shaving my unit for 30 yrs , hating it every time , now this cool product comes out , could not be happier , thanx wife  :</li>
            <li> No mess, although I used a wash cloth instead of the glove.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, even if your skin isn&#x27;t \\&quot;normally\\&quot; sensitive, to rinse off at a max of 5min (or something much less than called for in the directions) as a first test.  </li>
            <li> Most of them usually worked but left my skin irritated.  </li>
            <li> I was so red and sore that I had to stay covered up my entire vacation for which I applied this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> Rather, it should be very obvious that you&#x27;d used the product in that particular spot.</li>
            <li> a day or so following and just didn&#x27;t scratch except when in the shower and with burning hot water flooding the area (which acts to open the pores.)</li>
            <li> so I decided to skip the skin test (because I&#x27;m impatient and who honestly does that anyway) with the game plan of quickly hopping into the shower if it started to burn.</li>
            <li> At this point in my experimentation I now felt comfortable with the idea of traveling down further and leaving the store, but I&#x27;d run out of time and decided to wait a week or so.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok not better not worse than any other hair remover</li>
            <li> was that it was (is) so thick it is hard to spread and to get a good layer anywhere requires a large quantity of the cream</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a hairy guy and want to finally take off the fur coat, I highly recommend these ballsBALM products.</li>
            <li> , I am unsure if it exfoliated my hands or what it did, but my hands were super smooth and felt weird for like a week after...</li>
            <li> After following all instructions very clearly testing product elsewhere on the body I applied to sensitive areas</li>
            <li> To be fair, it may work better for it&#x27;s title area, but I still have to give it one star, because it makes bold claims to remove body hair for extended periods of time over your entire body (which it failed miserably on for me and many others).  </li>
            <li> But it burns if you you put too much or leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s a small price to pay for smooth balls.</li>
            <li> I was very close to call 911, since the burning lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> My only sensitivity was, well, I had a new feeling without hair, there, where there&#x27;d always been hair, before.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT burn as a couple of other products out there very much do so do not be worried about that.</li>
            <li> A few hours later and everything is smooth</li>
            <li> Continuing, so all you do for that first run is dab some on and gently smear the small chosen area (1 sq inch</li>
            <li> The product is thick, easy to spread, and stays on well.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells like a combination of a dirty baby&#x27;s diaper and gasoline...not pleasant.</li>
            <li> The consistency is like toothpaste, thick and stays where you put it but easy to spread.</li>
            <li> rather heavy chemical smell, not as mild as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that will have you wanting to don nothingness in the very near future.</li>
            <li> nothing major</li>
            <li> If you are looking for bare, then this is your product!</li>
            <li> The first time you try this product, and unless you&#x27;ve tried other hair removal products as well, you&#x27;ll again notice that burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> Also, Balls is pretty messy if you live in a college dorm like I do.</li>
            <li> I like to keep things clean and neat down there, but not bare all the way....</li>
            <li> Used on a few spots on my back and it worked great except I left it on a lil too long and had some burning in a few spots.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my hips first - shaving on one side and using Bare Balls on the other.  </li>
            <li> if i hadn&#x27;t paid 4 dollars more for this kit than I did for 3 bottles of a different product.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, after i get over all the other stuff; the price, the &amp;#34;Pain&amp;#34; from the stuff, the fact it didn&#x27;t work that well; what really gets me is how hard the stuff was to use for the results, I refer to this stuff as &amp;#34;Ice skating uphill&amp;#34;; you may get there</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other way to explain why some people seem to \\&quot;love it for their boyfriend,\\&quot; but everyone else gets poor to no results at all.</li>
            <li> Left the product on for about seven minutes and an area about 1\\&quot; x 1/2\\&quot; became red, raw, and bled slightly (obviously dissolving more than just the hair).</li>
            <li> and I think it is worth a trip to their web site for additional tips, but otherwise in 12-15 min you are bald down there!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but after reading the reviews, and a friend of mine trying it out, and saying it was amazing</li>
            <li> Kinda sucks to have &#x27;smooth balls&#x27;, but have them drenched in antibiotic ointment and pain cream, then wrapped in a mile of sterile gauze.</li>
            <li> Took shower, dried myself and applied calm balm immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally a hairy guy.</li>
            <li> so I proceeded with the general application.</li>
            <li> I use it front and back to clear it all up.</li>
            <li> The Bare Pair &#x27;Threesome&#x27; King Kombo]]</li>
            <li> The Bare Pair delivers.  </li>
            <li> I resorted to my bare hand</li>
            <li> and I could barely smell anything.</li>
            <li> Never use your bare hands, it will smell like the products for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that my skin is too sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> I think basically this stuff is the same old depilatory cream that does this to me -</li>
            <li> Anyways, this whole process took a long time, longer than I had expected since you have to wait for at least 15 minutes, wipe it, then go shower, once done you realize that not all the hair is removed so you have to apply more lotion and repeat.     </li>
            <li> It left some stubble but that could be because I took it off to early.</li>
            <li> and I did as the name says, did bare my b@llls.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I had already trimmed my scrotum and applied a generous portion of Bare Balm to it.  </li>
            <li> I tried Bare Balm on my chest, and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> But now after that I have a bare pair</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it got all the coarse hair from my nether regions.</li>
            <li> I used the Bare Pair on my boys about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> The Bare Pair management is as completes as it gets.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely use cooler water, the boys are sensitive after while in the shower, but once I applied the white tube...</li>
            <li> And only take about 10 minutes to complete the hair removely.</li>
            <li> I gave up using the glove &amp; rinsed away the remaining Bare Balm with lukewarm water &amp; my hand.</li>
            <li> By now the skin was so sore that I could barely stand to let the water touch it</li>
            <li> but I realized that I had to remove all of the Bare Balm</li>
            <li> yeah, before I forget, the Bare Balm did not even remove all of the hair.</li>
            <li> I got me some bare ballz.</li>
            <li> What I was left with for several days were red and burning balls that are slowly getting back to normal after shedding a layer or more of skin.  </li>
            <li> Used it for the first time last night, expected to be disappointed by it,  but it actually works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I admit, the pasting on part is kind of weird.  </li>
            <li> I seriously think its just like nair but not as strong.  </li>
            <li> I have a light amount of body hair, but its really thick and course.</li>
            <li> Work ok but not great.</li>
            <li> A little more came this time, but the result was odd.  </li>
            <li> I tried it first in my chest, and even when I&#x27;m not a hairy guy I decided to trim it down with scissors.</li>
            <li> A flat stick will do a much better job of evenly covering the entire surface, and will do it in a thinner layer (thick is not necessary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> No pain, a slight burning feeling, but not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> i had a slight burning first time i used it but</li>
            <li> I have used many other hair removal products in the past.  </li>
            <li> I used the product exactly as directed...using the sticks, waiting ten minutes, and then using the exfoliating glove, which itself caused extreme discomfort while &amp;#34;lightly buffing&amp;#34; the skin (imagine taking 100 grit sandpaper to a sunburn).</li>
            <li> It did irritate the skin ever so mildly but no more than a razor did.  </li>
            <li> At first I was wary of using a removal cream, due to a bad reaction to another brand years ago, but after giving it a try I am more than happy with The Bare Pair.</li>
            <li> This works very well on my stomach and other areas.</li>
            <li> When using the glove, I usually wipe several times in one direction, in the shower to remove the cream from the area, and then lightly and vigorously back and forth when the cream has been sufficiently rinsed from the area.</li>
            <li> Just be careful the first time not to leave it on too long, because it will burn the hell out of you.  </li>
            <li> and recently a &amp;#34;Professional Hair Removal&amp;#34; product that was quite expensive but not to effective.</li>
            <li> a big guy using a razor can be a bit challenging and irritating,</li>
            <li> If you do not live in a big city like myself where its no problem to find a place specializing in man-grooming of the most delicate of areas then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> As for ingrown hairs, I have not noticed a single new one.</li>
            <li> Burns a little at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to get every little hair on the first application so don&#x27;t expect it too.</li>
            <li> a razor is still needed to clean up any small patch&#x27;s left over but no big deal</li>
            <li> Tried it first day with a skeptical feeling , just one nut to be exact , it was ok , but I was afraid to apply too much , so it did remove a few hairs, and I quickly rinsed as it says to do ,</li>
            <li> The lotion it came with was very nice, sort of thin, not my usual stuff, but I (for no good reason) thought there might be something special in it for post-chemical use, so I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, as it says in the directions, do Not use any soap or anything else &#x27;down there&#x27; except the calm balm, which you should use the moment you get out of the shower and dry off.</li>
            <li> Each time however left me generally scared for the two berries hanging below.  </li>
            <li> Definitely use it after the hair removal process with the \\&quot;bare Balm\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am providing 4 star only because of the bare balm.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you have sensitive skin, try a small sample first.  </li>
            <li> 3 days later I can barely walk without it hurting still</li>
            <li> In a second session two weeks after the first (and with a lot less hair) I left it for 20 minutes and the story repeated.  </li>
            <li> If your hair grows back slowly then you might be okay with using this every other day.</li>
            <li> Although using on areas with considerably less sensitivity the product really words wonders.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re also going to want to invest in something like the [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]] in order to keep maintenance to a reasonable minumum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Customer service did finally get back to me - apparently there was a breakdown of sorts delivering the message through the Amazon system.  </li>
            <li> Also, there has been absolutely no irritation whatsoever regardless of where I used it, and that&#x27;s coming from someone with very very sensitive</li>
            <li> Not long enough and hair was still there.  </li>
            <li> however, I think I&#x27;ll be able to get at least half a dozen uses out of one bottle.</li>
            <li> For me I never got a clear and easy result and at the end had to just shave because it just looked weird that some places had</li>
            <li> Even if you generally don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or have used other similar products before.</li>
            <li> so it gets the stuff done, I also recommend doing this two days straight because if you have think hair you WILL get a little patchy</li>
            <li> if you have thick body hair, dont expect much!!</li>
            <li> So I read the bad and good reviews and still went ahead with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Unlikeshaving, you&#x27;re guaranteed to get right next to the skin every time and don&#x27;t have to worry about dull blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally shave down there</li>
            <li> I totally researched and thoughtfully selected this product, and was super disappointed.</li>
            <li> but in the span of a few minutes i went from that gorilla in the ridiculous product picture to the confident looking young male on the bed in the other picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any product that you can use in the sensitive areas that didn&#x27;t cause a rash or other irritation until now.  </li>
            <li> it works great, a little messy (not that bad), takes a little time (not that long), and is a little harsh, but very effective.  </li>
            <li> I also found that if you are getting stubble left over or bleached hairs, you are not keeping it on long enough.</li>
            <li> least I&#x27;m all smooth down there now.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you have eczema... will cause some major irritation.</li>
            <li> I also tried using an old electric shaver which I no longer used on my face, I had to use the trimmer on it to cut down the hair to shaving size, not an easy task with my long thick dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reading some of these negative reviews is a little surprising, although I should expect that not everyone can have common sense.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself in any sensitive spots.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well Bare removes the hair without irritation, or effecting the texture of my skin, like other topical hair removal cremes.</li>
            <li> Use a flat stick, like the popsicle sticks or a plastic butter knife or something.</li>
            <li> Shaving the stomach and chest is easier in my opinion and last just as long as this stuff does.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> give you wooden sticks to apply the cream, but I found that it&#x27;s easier to just use latex gloves as long as you&#x27;re not rubbing it into your skin like moisturizer, just coat the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken this long for the hair to grow enough.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t leave it on long enough</li>
            <li> Or if next time I just need to not leave it on so long.  </li>
            <li> no matter how long left on.</li>
            <li> Left it on too long once and with the rather vigorous scrubbing my forest needs</li>
            <li> If you purchase this, get the package with two tubes of hair removal cream, because you have to spread it on pretty thick.</li>
            <li> wow that was a lot easier than dragging a razor down there.</li>
            <li> &quot; I might use it again on a less sensitive area of my body.</li>
            <li> I typically have sensitive skin and had no issues.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;d rinsed off the stuff while doing the grope thing, and after all traces of the stuff were gone, I still had a few hairs but could easily just pick them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These commenters who wipe off with toilet paper or whatever....</li>
            <li> Gave it 2 tries on the same day, added 5 min to the wait time on the 2nd try.  </li>
            <li> but I would suggest that you do try a patch to see how long is long enough.</li>
            <li> A week later, like a moron, I decided that testing it on my under carriage would be a good idea.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of positive and negative reviews on the product before trying it which made apprehensive.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try the Bare Pair on any other body area,</li>
            <li> At first the smell was sort of bad, however I quickly got used to it.</li>
            <li> Small patches of hair in certain areas brushed off immediately, while other spots stayed in tact.</li>
            <li> But for the record I have super thick hair down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried several other methods  for removing unwanted hair and this is definitely the easiest and fastest way to do it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time you use this will be a little messy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t advise using Balls Balm after showering because soap and any kind of agitation to the area will make for a bad experience.</li>
            <li> This is way better than trying to shave and cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> The product failed to provide a smooth groomed surface as promised.  </li>
            <li> Then I ran into my bedroom and made my skeptical girlfriend indulge in the world of smooth balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the deal, test the cream on a section of leg or something just to make sure you don&#x27;t have some crazy reaction to it.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I would definitely test a small area (which it tells you do anyway) before using it.</li>
            <li> I now have third degree burns to my sensitive region and have been in discomfort for the past four days.</li>
            <li> The product got all the hair off, but some hairs are still about 1/16\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li> Some areas were completely unaffected.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no burning or irritation (to the point where I was starting to doubt if it was working)</li>
            <li> skin is dead sensitive.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried this, followed the instructions and left it on 10 minutes, then hopped in the shower with the glove thingie and carefully buffed off the hair.</li>
            <li> I do have two minor complaints though.</li>
            <li> I knew the risk of getting burned if you leave it on too long, but at 10min I didn&#x27;t feel anything.  </li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;m partially to blame because I didn&#x27;t do the recommended test spot 24 hours prior to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are not kidding on how long before you wash the applied area</li>
            <li> If you leave it on too long you end up with stubble and chemical burns.  </li>
            <li> Too long</li>
            <li> (And yes, smearing some unknown product on your private parts is indeed taking a risk.)</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m no dermatologist understand) such that, unlike the normal reaction, you can literally pull out the hair leaving bare skin behind.</li>
            <li> working construction all day and not really a fan of excess body hair especially the areas</li>
            <li> following the directions minus a minute resulted in quite a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very hairy, but I do has coarse hair.</li>
            <li> If I has known this was around a long time ago</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the thickest hair, so I&#x27;m not surprised if it doesn&#x27;t work well for others on here.  </li>
            <li> Well, after much mental debating, I finally decided to give this product a go.</li>
            <li> as long as you follow the instructions, everything should go fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly can not believe that this product is still for sale, after reading all the terrible reviews, (should have read those first).</li>
            <li> laid it on thick from the bottom of my belly button straight on through to my crack, and waited about 14 minutes.</li>
            <li> Finally I found Jalepeno juice and muriatic acid that I mixed together and rinsed over my now slightly deformed member.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a mixed male of Indian and Black ethnicity</li>
            <li> Report back how long it lasts versus other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I no longer have to spend $60 to get waxed when Bare Balm does all the work for me for one-quarter the cost and half the time.</li>
            <li> And, the worse it didn&#x27;t fully accomplish what it advertises to do and there certainly will not be a second</li>
            <li> , Not only was my junk cooking like mashmellows in a camp fire, but hair had melted and in other areas there were chemical burns and some bleeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Pay attention to the other reviews that mention it because it&#x27;s not the same out all.</li>
            <li> One has hair like mine and the other has that Itailan coarse hair.</li>
            <li> That stuff at least removed most the hair leaving on a few small spots that needed re-treatment.  </li>
            <li> I chose a small area in the upper pubic region, above the private parts and below the belt line.</li>
            <li> Using the blam afterward deals with any possible pain, and the blam spreads easily so only a little is needed.  </li>
            <li> For those people having problems, I suggest trimming first, then putting it on thick and waiting 20 minutes, then rinse and REPEAT!  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, and it all came off (and then some!</li>
            <li> Any other less sensitive areas would be 4-5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use the cooling cream and apply it generously to your balls and let them recover and dry off.</li>
            <li> To make the story short, I ended up shaving with my razor because, in addition, the areas where it worked where not smooth, instead they felt like on the third day after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I first trimmed the hair very short with a trimmer and then applied this \\&quot;down south\\&quot; and waited even a little past the maximum time listed on the bottle.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long and it doesn&#x27;t get as far down the hair as I would like.</li>
            <li> I think I may have left it on too long because one spot became red and raw.</li>
            <li> I have average hair type not very coarse.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it works well on my coarse, dark, hair</li>
            <li> If you go all gung ho and just start smearing it all over yourself after, maybe, a small test, then don&#x27;t be surprised when you find yourself wishing you hadn&#x27;t done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, regrowth was softer(than shave stubble, not normal).</li>
            <li> The smell was not overwhelming, it did not burn AT ALL (using in the intended sensitive area), and it took away 99% of the hairs in the area I used it.</li>
            <li> First time i used it worked worse than shaving lots of stubble.</li>
            <li> Regardless, the bare skin lasts for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Again, I followed the instructions carefully, as to when to put the cream, how long the cream stays in the area and how to remove it.</li>
            <li> On top of the pain and discomfort of raw balls, he had to explain to his SGT why he was unable to participate in pool PT.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you have very coarse hair down there</li>
            <li> I will probably reapply to the same area in several days to see if it will get rid of the short hairs that it left behind.</li>
            <li> I used it a third time over a week later, still followed the directions, and got a serious 2nd Degree Burn on my nuts!</li>
            <li> There was a slight warming sensation when I put it on, which alarmed me, but it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll change it to 5 stars if it doesn&#x27;t burn me next time when I leave it on for much less</li>
            <li> Only after using nearly half a tube of Neosporin did the pain begin to subside.</li>
            <li> Yep, I did not heed the warnings left by previous reviewers and tried this stuff out.  </li>
            <li> My only warning is DO NOT put this stuff on any skin that is even SLIGHTLY chaffed or irritated/raw.</li>
            <li> I slowly removed the cream and suddenly, the heat started to get worse, in which I applied the special after shave balm it provide.</li>
            <li> (this is NOT recommended please don&#x27;t be stupid, and test somewhere safe!)</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this would work that well, but I was sick of shaving all the time and was willing to try it out.  </li>
            <li> Even when you follow the instructions (wash the area, apply a thick layer, wait less than 15 minutes, \\&quot;jump in a lukewarm shower\\&quot;, remove gently with a washcloth)</li>
            <li> TIMING is everything and a few seconds can mean the difference between a clean, smooth, scrotum and a painful burn.</li>
            <li> To my dismay, I noticed that it didn&#x27;t appear to remove a SINGLE HAIR!  </li>
            <li> I dont think it was the way I used it because I followed every single instruction!</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin especially under arms, behind my knees and in the nether region.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually root out the hair but simply dissolves it, so you are left with ordinary stubble (which grows back) and it can hardly be compared to a close shave.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous after some of the reviews, but I&#x27;ve concluded those are either cases of incompatible skin types or folks not following directions.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the T, but it simply did not work, even a little.  </li>
            <li> However, like any other hair removal product, don&#x27;t leave it on too long!  </li>
            <li> There was a little burn as I left it on a bit longer than the directions say too.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately a little drop happened to get just on the tip of my male organ.</li>
            <li> Left a little bit of stubble</li>
            <li> a little over a week max before hair started coming back in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT attempt to tough it out for ten minutes when your sack is clearly screaming for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worked very well, minimal iratation, very thick</li>
            <li> but it will take time, be painful, and there is a better way.</li>
            <li> - it really feels like a bad sun burn and is broken out over most of it</li>
            <li> I jumped out of the shower and immediately applied the Calm Balm which may have made it worse!  </li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and left the product on for 15 minutes, at least 80% of the hair was removed.</li>
            <li> I followed the product instructions, including testing on a small area before general application.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work as expected.  </li>
            <li> :  I just wanted to follow up how careful you should be if you choose to use this product.  </li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with burning, ingrown-hair bumps that make me feel even more disgusting than my natural,</li>
            <li> There is really no substitute for shaving, although we keep hoping for one.</li>
            <li> I was looking to but my usual hair removal product (Nair for Men) when I came across the Bare Pair from ballsBALM.</li>
            <li> , I was amazed, there were only a few hairs remaining.</li>
            <li> I got absolutely no results with the recommended time of 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, follow the directions.</li>
            <li> No burning, not much stench.</li>
            <li> or you can rough things up a bit.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of shaving all the time I really suggest you try this out, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> If you do this though, be careful.</li>
            <li> (after six to seven minutes) if the hairs don&#x27;t come off after a few tugs, make your way to the shower anyway and continue to tug test every couple of seconds in different areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you do need to be careful.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and carefully got to work.  </li>
            <li> After about 7 minutes starting to feel a burning and stinging sensation on the sack area and where I was missing some skin.</li>
            <li> And still if you gonna buy it use it really carefully.</li>
            <li> The glove feels like rough sandpaper and feels like it pulls the hair out of the follicle.</li>
            <li> In the areas where the hair was removed there was obvious stubble left behind, both visibly and physically.</li>
            <li> Just have to be careful after application.  </li>
            <li> Worked as expected without an sort of burning or discomfort.</li>
            <li> Minimal irritation if you use the lotion provided.  </li>
            <li> I found that leaving the product on for at least 10 minutes was necessary for the coarser hair, and then combining that with a light shave in the shower, the skin comes out smooth without the irriation and nasty bumps that shaving would give alone.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve incurred only a few ingrown</li>
            <li> No bumps and slow growth- especially after several uses....</li>
            <li> After following the directions to the letter, and I mean using the &#x27;nutshell&#x27; method, using the sticks, applying as directed, waiting only 10 mins.</li>
            <li> I used it once, exactly as directed, and very quickly realized it was a terrible mistake.  </li>
            <li> But here&#x27;s the worst part, not only did the hair grew thicker and darker as ever, there were areas that originally didn&#x27;t have that much hair until it was touched by the cream (I kid you not).</li>
            <li> , I had hair over half inch long.</li>
            <li> If it begins to burn after a few minutes, then wash it off within the next minute or so, but don&#x27;t scrub!, as it&#x27;s either been on too long, or, worse, your skin is too sensitive for it in your chosen area.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff not really expecting it to work that well, but I wanted to try something other then</li>
            <li> As this is Amazon, a public place, I&#x27;ll censor things a little and say I didn&#x27;t go all the way down and leave the store.</li>
            <li> He was left with raw flesh and a heck of a lot of pain.  </li>
            <li> I needed to reduce the time to around six minutes or so (and then add the shower time,) not ten!, and 2) watch the groping, because you can and will produce raw spots if you&#x27;re too vigorous with the cloth.</li>
            <li> After an initial test, I took this thing and removed all the hair down there, and I mean ALL of it, front, back, under, side, etc.  </li>
            <li> So the stuff does work, just not if you&#x27;ve got heavy, coarse hair down there.    </li>
            <li> The product has a very distinct smell that isn&#x27;t necessarily bad but will give you a headache if you&#x27;re at it for a long time because of all the chemicals.      </li>
            <li> Even a whole hour after using it, while having a fan blowing cold air on me from outside, it STILL feels like one of the worst sunburns I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Very little hair actually came off.</li>
            <li> I always shaved before (just did not like the sharp stubble afterwards and sometimes nicking myself).</li>
            <li> The other creams I used burned a ton, but this one doesn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommend if you have normal or thin hair.</li>
            <li> I believe hair below the neck no longer serves a purpose, other than to become sweaty, smelly, and itchy).   </li>
            <li> The other two.  </li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this only works for small areas</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m too lazy to send back in</li>
            <li> So... without reading the comments and tips from other users, I learned that this product does in fact work.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with any other product before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved for years and years, I&#x27;ve used other defoliants.</li>
            <li> in fact I just did the other day</li>
            <li> One other recommendation is to not scrub the hairs off with the glove.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using any other creams besides this.</li>
            <li> I was left with small amounts of stubble everywhere</li>
            <li> However, the results weren&#x27;t any better than shaving with a razor so slightly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Have yet to try the back door but not sure how i feel about that.</li>
            <li> It works, and my balls were not on fire afterwards, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Just like other hair removal products.....</li>
            <li> Working up the courage to use it on the boys and other groin area.  </li>
            <li> Any other area, stick to shaving, pay some one to wax it, or buy yourself an epilator.</li>
            <li> I even use the moisturizer after shaving my face because it doesn&#x27;t remain all sticky like some other lotions/moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Hair grew back within days (which is usual for me) no biggie.</li>
            <li> The other products that i&#x27;ve tried, well, I think the government could use them as a replacement for waterboarding.  </li>
            <li> Major failure in that respect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times and other than a weird smell that the product leaves behind</li>
            <li> This stuff wasn&#x27;t bad, but it took a few more applications to get the job done than I felt should have.</li>
            <li> There were some hairs left behind that required a second thinner application to remove (my hair is thicker, so I feel like that may have contributed to that fact)</li>
            <li> So, I did round two a few days later.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The chemicals work by breaking down the hair, so when you rub it off, you&#x27;re essentially doing no better than shaving and not getting at the root of the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products (Nair for Men) with no success.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the hair grew back so quickly.</li>
            <li> but so far it was a failure and a waste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I have very tough hair, I suspect all the positive reviews were planted here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the same category as all the other negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> It did sting a little, but not much.  </li>
            <li> But then again pubs are rather tough, and the scrot skin is rather sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to use this on my scrotum as it&#x27;s nearly impossible to shave there.</li>
            <li> This may be obvious to you dermatologists out there, but for those of us who have to learn the hard way - I will tell you that immediately after washing with soap it felt like I had tea bagged a toaster.  </li>
            <li> While it does remove hair with very little irritation, product does not completely remove all hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> No real chemical smell, it&#x27;s faint, but it smells more of fake coconut and vanilla a bit.</li>
            <li> Try putting the least amount possible in the beginning and ramp up.</li>
            <li> After several attempts I ended up removing small uneven patches of hair.  </li>
            <li> results, having gone lower, once I got past that initial missing skin/raw issue (in spots -- and it was MY fault --</li>
            <li> Keep your balls away from salt, lemon, alcohol for at least an hour until your pores close back</li>
            <li> Includes enough to apply at least 10 or 15 times.</li>
            <li> I think I just can&#x27;t get the stuff on thick enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily destroy the root, as I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> Its a rather thick cream, similar, frankly, to Colgate toothpaste.</li>
            <li> guess if you have thin soft hair down there this product may work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Much easier and less scary than shaving.  </li>
            <li> It does remove hair, and for me at least the was only a slight stinging, nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> I only had a slight burning sensation, the least of any product I has used.  </li>
            <li> After using this product again \\&quot;down there\\</li>
            <li> \\&quot;down there.\\</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I coated my hair with the product all the way down to the roots, it didn&#x27;t come out at the roots.  </li>
            <li> If you are wondering how the porn stars stay so hairless down there, this is probably it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like hair down there, so</li>
            <li> No trimming or anything I started with the bush area and then down on the sack.</li>
            <li> I got this product to have &#x27;my down stairs&#x27; hairless because of my tattoo.</li>
            <li> I should add, it wasn&#x27;t due to the balm, but the suggested moisturizing lotion!</li>
            <li> Leave the shower, dry off, and then compare the small area you chose against the nearby untouched region.</li>
            <li> BUT, I did not successfully get a bare pair.</li>
            <li> before)&lt;br /&gt;I did receive very small chemical burn on my inner thighs, however with the ballsBALM</li>
            <li> Has a slight smell, but nothing too offensive.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on for size  given some of the previous comments.&lt;br /&gt;First:  </li>
            <li> I started to feel some heat and slight discomfort at 11 minutes of application.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be less risky than shaving given the description</li>
            <li> a slight chemical burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise between that, and the previously mentioned terrorist torture techniques, I truly see NO market for this product.</li>
            <li> This product did not bend my hair much less remove it.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight order for about an 1 hour or so.</li>
            <li> I was just about to write a scathing review about how I had fallen victim to the clever marketing and</li>
            <li> My previous review was pretty scathing, so I&#x27;m going to revise it a bit here.    </li>
            <li> I was afraid that I would have to first debraid and remove my corn rows, but not true.</li>
            <li> Which then peaks a funny yet some what awkward conversation about removing ball hair.  </li>
            <li> How can you mess that</li>
            <li> True, I did survive it, and it wasn&#x27;t awfully painful, but I did find 1)</li>
            <li> Then if you miss a few days you have prickly razor stubble down there and ladies wont like that.  </li>
            <li> Not a single hair remained behind, no strays at all.</li>
            <li> The product is mild--so mild it is ineffective--and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> First, this stuff smells terrible, its very chemically.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just leave it on for a few minutes less</li>
            <li> I ended up with slight chemical burns which took a few days of Neosporin to bring under control.</li>
            <li> All in all within 6&#x27;hours i cried like a little baby 3 separate times.</li>
            <li> Not a fun thing to deal with!</li>
            <li> This stuff will burn your balls until you cry like a little girl.  </li>
            <li> I gave a little trim to begin with then applied and followed the directions.</li>
            <li> A little pre-trimming with the beard trimmer helps.</li>
            <li> There was little relief from the burning sensation</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, either; in fact, that worried me a little bit during application.</li>
            <li> I assumed it should burn a little if it was working.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be a porn star since I was little</li>
            <li> It only got about half the hair and burned like hell behind my balls.  </li>
            <li> I think on the next application I will thin it a little with sdme distilled water to make it a little creamier,</li>
            <li> The hair did remove but it took a little scrubbing with the glove which turned into a sand paper feeling after a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I am as bald down there as I could ever have imagined without pain and suffering!</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks and does not seem to remove much hair.</li>
            <li> It smells like a mixture of dead animals and feces.  </li>
            <li> The product does work, but I found it left some behind</li>
            <li> There were still bits that didn&#x27;t fully come off, but with round two</li>
            <li> I think the product is way to harsh.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t do it please don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
            <li> but I read a few people had their girlfriends use it, so</li>
            <li> I break out if you look at me harshly.</li>
            <li> still using this stuff, but I have a few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and it works every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it lasts longer than anything else.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Now after a few months and not grooming, I decided to try it again.</li>
            <li> After about six to seven minutes from application of Balls Balm, pull (tug) at a few hairs.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t finish the process without crying like a girl.</li>
            <li> Save your money and just use a razor wasted 30 minutes with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believe in reviewing all products I buy</li>
            <li> but now I have some missing flesh and</li>
            <li> Also I was playing the same game with Veet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great and you do have to leave it on for longer than the suggested time for the hair to actually come off.  </li>
            <li> It stings for a few hours after I use it</li>
            <li> However, this time I was impatient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and that seems to be the result.</li>
            <li> after closer inspection my ballsack is all \\&quot;skin-flakey\\&quot; and shit.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I honestly think who ever created this garbage did it as a sick, twisted, sadistic joke.</li>
            <li> Despite my glowing previous review, I now say Stay the Hell Away From This Stuff!</li>
            <li> Then I took a closer looked and in some areas my skin is raw and even missing.</li>
            <li> If I used too little, it removed very little hair.  </li>
            <li> It was even left on for less time than was recommended and while id DID NOT remove ALL the hair (but kinda melted parts of it in a weird way...)</li>
            <li> As in, burned so badly that you need to use first aid cream on it</li>
            <li> Usually depilatories smell awful, very strong and chemically, but this had almost nothing.</li>
            <li> If I tried shaving or other hair removal products I would break out and get serious ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> guess i wouldn&#x27;t be so mad (at myself mainly)</li>
            <li> Thinking perhaps it was just a bad day, I tried again last month and had to apply aloe for the next three days.</li>
            <li> I am not sure exactly what happened, but it is painful.</li>
            <li> but I feel like the hair grows in slower and less thick.</li>
            <li> ill adimt, im half monkey, but thats why i looked to find this type of product.  </li>
            <li> Very little, if any, hair came out.  </li>
            <li> I am not), and left it on for about 10 minutes, the results were passable but not perfect.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with the result using the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The 1st thing I noticed - the small size of the tubes.</li>
            <li> I did not, this did not work for me as advertised and was a complete disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say than what has been said by those persons not being paid to write reviews.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly sure what the glove is for, but</li>
            <li> WARNING When you do a small test spot as recommended and wait twenty four hours to check for irritation, DO NOT reapply to that area for 5 to 6 days.</li>
            <li> Make small adjustments to find what time works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 02/25/14</li>
            <li> , I tried a small area on my ankle that I outlined in eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> If you are planing on using this product test on a small area before usage.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews ,but I decided to write one because of the burning pain this product caused me.</li>
            <li> I usually keep it on for about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Junk and slick marketing.  </li>
            <li> not sure how you get there without trying</li>
            <li> The reviews had me skeptical, but there were enough positives to make the leap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was circumcised before</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep my heads off them I would send a pic to display how slick how aerodynamic they feel....</li>
            <li> Rather, you want to do just a small patch, just to get a feel for the stuff and how it works for you.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t go past there.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say enough bad things about this product and my brief and unpleasant venture with it!</li>
            <li> Rinsing in the shower really just made it burn even worse, even with seemingly FREEZING cold water.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i rubbed too hard getting the hair off or</li>
            <li> /&gt;First application, I read the negative reviews about burns, so I applied a small amount to the &amp;#34;area.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I thought the use of this product would be less painful than wax, but though the initial removal of hair was painless the pain and irritation of the chemical burns afterwards lasted for weeks!</li>
            <li> If you consider that to get the foretold results I ended up rubbing it hard with the washcloth, I don&#x27;t want to imagine what would happen when applied to \\&quot;my pair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I find unlike old time dipilatories, it does not have a bad odor.  </li>
            <li> READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FIRST!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t work on the area that is implied by its name; at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say for now.</li>
            <li> It has not irritated my skin in the least</li>
            <li> If I could have given it a negative score I would have.</li>
            <li> But it was too late, I got burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have somewhat delicate skin</li>
            <li> It was terribly painful with bleeding and ended up having to go to ER!!it was the worst thing ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a few weeks and have had poor results.  </li>
            <li> It was thick</li>
            <li> If you have thick or curly hair</li>
            <li> maybe my hair is just to thick...</li>
            <li> I put it on as thick as my hair</li>
            <li> If you have tired it you are missing out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick hair</li>
            <li> cream is too thick.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if I accidentally got some in other nearby areas, that hair did come off.</li>
            <li> I mean my eyes watering...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you hate having to shave all the time.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT a good product to use unless you want to be out of commission for at least a week.</li>
            <li> No better or worse than Nare&#x27;</li>
            <li> Any review that states otherwise is clearly written by a terrorist or angered girlfriend/wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you aren&#x27;t one of those people, seriously, watch out.  </li>
            <li> It was not a perfect result, and I did not even bother trying it on my back(I did not want to spend another half hour in the bathroom).</li>
            <li> I caused some SERIOUS discomfort.</li>
            <li> Swollen red with bloody patches of raw skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Frosting your boys with the balm and a popsicle stick seems a little silly, but it&#x27;s way safer than taking a razor blade to them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only bad thing is that the reaction between the hair and the product smells a little weird.</li>
            <li> But...I only used it twice because it smells sooooooooooooooooooo bad.  </li>
            <li> so bad my skin is red and irritated like you wouldn&#x27;t believe wish I could give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> and my skin was in such bad shape</li>
            <li> will say it&#x27;s a bit messy; the sticks they give you to rub this stuff on are useless.</li>
            <li> if you leave it on for to long could be bad.</li>
            <li> Duh!  </li>
            <li> So all the reviews on here of people who are like \\&quot;tried it, barely worked, 1 star\\&quot; are idiots.  </li>
            <li> This is tough with the tube design.</li>
            <li> So the instructions say to let your balls air out and get a weee bit chilly so they \\&quot;go tight against your dong\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> i have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend this product if you are tired of shaving your stuff.</li>
            <li> and the stubble was really irritating.</li>
            <li> but I did not think this was any worse than nair.</li>
            <li> I tried to use the sticks to apply the stuff, this was...emotional to say the least, eventually i gave up and just used my hands to spread it...and that did some weird stuff to my hands</li>
            <li> next day I said to hell with it , ( I hate hair on my balls )</li>
            <li> I bought this because I got tired of shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> But alas, I couldn&#x27;t find any issues with the stuff.</li>
            <li> but in one spot in particular.&lt;br /&gt;It says to use a thin layer</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff on my chest and abs because I was tired of shaving.</li>
            <li> the pain now is worse than before.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical cuz of the negative reviews</li>
            <li> To me Nair smells much worse.</li>
            <li> its says apply the stuff in a thin manner</li>
            <li> Any contact whatsoever, whether with fabric or other skin, is still painful today.</li>
            <li> NEVER AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;Waxing would probably be less painful.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it smells HORRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> I have seen a few bad reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> Near for men is awful and can&#x27;t compare it to this.</li>
            <li> Worst part is, I don&#x27;t even have slightly sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I burn r them very badly in which the calming cream did not calm but make things very very very much worse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will not continue using it</li>
            <li> products(which are not perfect either).</li>
            <li> I generally shy away from chemicals, including anything with scents, for this reason.</li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> still useless.</li>
            <li> I kept putting on the relief cream but made it worse!</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m truly skeptical save your money buy a Braun.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this working as well as a razor or trimmer</li>
            <li> It also seems to be a cheesy company run out of somebody&#x27;s basement, based on the Ziploc bag packaging, photocopied instructions, and weird 1960s children&#x27;s glove.  </li>
            <li> If you have course body hair, this stuff is not going to help you, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> The applied it and waited 15 minutes jumped into the shower and the hair melted of it was weird looking all that balck hair.</li>
            <li> I was so incredibly wrong.</li>
            <li> back is the worst though</li>
            <li> Anyways, if your tired of cutting your junk with trimmers i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The application was difficult.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical thinking that some of these 5 start reviews were &amp;#34;planted&amp;#34;, but i went ahead and tried the product.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well, very irritating</li>
            <li> /&gt;In closing, this product is AWFUL, and I want to jump into the nearest frozen lake I can find, in hopes of dying of hypothermia &amp; drowning, because that would be less uncomfortable than these tubes of terrorist cream.</li>
            <li> Just followed directions except used TP to remove hair before getting into shower, was afraid it would clog drain</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my legs waxed, but frankly, it&#x27;s too damn inconvenient.</li>
            <li> dangerous product.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Call me crazy</li>
            <li> but like all chemicals it can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> and it was mildly uncomfortable, any longer disastrous.</li>
            <li> - One Unhappy Wife</li>
            <li> I am afraid they will never recover.</li>
            <li> I might be crazy</li>
            <li> I can get all my hair downstairs without having to worry about cutting myself (which has happened</li>
            <li> If you have never tried using stuff on your package do not be afraid with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously that bad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nair in the past and that stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> The burn was so bad That i tried cooling with water and an icecube.</li>
            <li> Any of these kinds of creams have a bad smell</li>
            <li> Tried it twice both times it gave me bad chemical burns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by no means a bad product, just doesn&#x27;t work for me 100%, I suppose.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad or suspicious.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price too isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I made that mistake and ended up with a bad &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product after having bad experiences with women&#x27;s hair removal creams.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> However the smell was so bad</li>
            <li> It will burn your skin like a really bad case of razor burn.</li>
            <li> but nothing but time will make the bad spot go away</li>
            <li> but also I didn&#x27;t want to see her having a bad experience.</li>
            <li> thats a bad sign.\\</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on for longer than 10 minutes though are it will chemical burn which is painful.</li>
            <li> It was too painful to rub to product off</li>
            <li> so I chose not to shave the ugly for awhile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by no means painful at all.  </li>
            <li> i get to my balls and feel the painful sensation tearing off a band aid.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s how painful it was).</li>
            <li> I tried \\&quot;Nair for Men\\&quot; - disappointed and irritated.</li>
            <li> but im fairly disappointed that the removal cream doesn&#x27;t work as I thought it would.    </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;I tried a shorter time, but still got burned. :(  </li>
            <li> Yup, disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hoping there won&#x27;t be any scarring :(</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> worthless.</li>
            <li> This is crap.</li>
            <li> If you routinely \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; (I hate that word), you want to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who is giving 5 stars to this product, but all I can say is that scammers and sleazy money grabbers will do anything to sell their crap, even shamelessly impersonate as a customer.</li>
            <li> Bad choice!  </li>
            <li> husband had an extremely bad reaction to this product!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad!</li>
            <li> He had a very bad allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> horrible.........</li>
            <li> This product gave my husband a horrible chemical burn.</li>
            <li> shaving or using scissors, which can be especially dangerous for &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; zones as the makers of the product call them.</li>
            <li> Horrible, Horrible, Horrible....followed all the instructions and it appears it was going to work.</li>
            <li> Horrible product caused severe chemical burn took 10 days to heal</li>
            <li> I then used it as it said and got a horrible rash.  </li>
            <li> This product damaged my balls so bad!!</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible, Horrible product!</li>
            <li> Just the worst experience you could have trying to remove hair from your sack.</li>
            <li> It burns the skin and smells awful.</li>
            <li> This product takes the hair away, but if used in accordance with the instructions, the after lotion prevents those nasty hair removal rashes.  </li>
            <li> so my chest/stomach/downstairs/butt are disgustingly hairy; this product makes it</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re like me you will get horrible hideous razor burn on the areas you try to shave.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you can expect some nasty burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider:  How hairy ARE you?  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FIRST!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured that I would give this a whirl as I like to be well groomed for my woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to a T and 10 min later, Not only was my junk cooking like mashmellows in a camp fire, but hair had melted and in other areas there were chemical burns and some bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can take a good deal of pain but if you really want to do things right, don&#x27;t take shortcuts like I tried.  If you do decide to go this route, make sure you load up on the calming lotion, ice, and loose fitting boxers.</li>
            <li> not somthing i would use over and over it is a must when following directions but the product does work as it says!</li>
            <li> Balls. That&#x27;s what this product is to be used for...right? NO! It was even left on for less time than was recommended and while id DID NOT remove ALL the hair (but kinda melted parts of it in a weird way...) It DID REMOVE THE FIRST LAYER OF SKIN in more than a few areas. If you enjoy having skin on your junk, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> ballsBalm is a solid product when it comes to removing hair anywhere on your body, besides your face. This product would actually work for woman too for their legs, etc. This does make you smooth when used correctly, and assuming you don&#x27;t miss any spots. The bottle says to leave on for 10 minutes but I found 7-8 minutes works best for me, I suggest you start in that range before doing the full time as that&#x27;s how I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product needs to be used daily if you don&#x27;t like having stubble. This can become costly, if $15 is a lot to you for something like this then you might be better off sticking to your shaving. I will point out though that if you&#x27;re able to afford [[ASIN:B005IGUUBU The Bare Pair &#x27;Threesome&#x27; King Kombo]] you should consider buying if you believe you can keep up with daily use of this product. In my opinion this is a lot better than having cuts, and bumps from shaving. You skin looks a lot better and does feel smooth afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off using this in the morning rather than the night before. If you do it in the morning you will find you can make it until the next day before needing to do it again, in most cases. If your hair grows back slowly then you might be okay with using this every other day. But for you \\&quot;rapid growers\\&quot; you will need to mow the lawn daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to get a burn using this daily, if you find the time that works for you and stick to it then you will be okay. You will however want your balls to be the last thing to do. I find that the timing is shorter on them, about 5-6 minutes rather than 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the lotion it comes with is amazing, it stays on until I shower it off. I&#x27;m glad they sell that without the ballsBalm hair remover. I suggest you try it out rather than skipping over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I find this a great product to have, but at current price and the requirement to use it daily can break the bank if you have a low income. For this I give it 4/5 stars.s.</li>
            <li> Works well, have ditched the Popsicle sticks and the glove though. Glove tended to make me a bit more raw then a normal wash cloth. Your results may vary.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hips first - shaving on one side and using Bare Balls on the other.  It did the job with no reaction, but after a week the hair had grown back equally on both sides.  Still, if it allowed me to avoid putting a razor to the boys I thought it would be worth it.  Bad choice!  It only got about half the hair and burned like hell behind my balls.  I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough and the burning lasted two days.  NEVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous after some of the reviews, but I&#x27;ve concluded those are either cases of incompatible skin types or folks not following directions.  For reference, I am a caucasian male (might affect skin type).  I admit, the pasting on part is kind of weird.  And if you figure you&#x27;ll pass the 10 minutes playing video games or watching TV, don&#x27;t it&#x27;s way too easy to lose track of the 10 minutes fast.  There is a heat sensation to the applied paste, but about what you&#x27;d expect from a product that chemically melts away your body hair.  Also, one note, be careful with the intensity of scrubbing to remove the hair, it should just slide right off.  After an initial test, I took this thing and removed all the hair down there, and I mean ALL of it, front, back, under, side, etc.  Feels great!</li>
            <li> Used to use nair for men, now I&#x27;ve definitely switched.  The nair was always hit or miss, sometimes no issues, sometimes My happy place would be on fire after.  This product is a bit weaker, but definitely safer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend kind of as a joke, and when he opened it he looked at me like I was nuts (no pun intended), but he loves it, and so do I. I got it because it was the first time I saw something like this for guys, so that&#x27;s really cool. This stuff works great. You can&#x27;t beat the price too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I referred my guy friends to it and they love it.  They loved it so much that I (I&#x27;m a chick) want to give it a shot.  I didn&#x27;t get specific details from them but they did say they use it routinely for those \\&quot;fun\\&quot; times.      APPROVED HAIR REMOVAL PRODUCT FOR MEN!!!</li>
            <li> Even when you follow the instructions (wash the area, apply a thick layer, wait less than 15 minutes, \\&quot;jump in a lukewarm shower\\&quot;, remove gently with a washcloth) it doesn&#x27;t work as expected.  I tried it first in my chest, and even when I&#x27;m not a hairy guy I decided to trim it down with scissors. In my first session I left it for 10 minutes and it did a pretty mediocre job, so I reapplied it and waited for 15 minutes more. To make the story short, I ended up shaving with my razor because, in addition, the areas where it worked where not smooth, instead they felt like on the third day after shaving.  In a second session two weeks after the first (and with a lot less hair) I left it for 20 minutes and the story repeated.  If you consider that to get the foretold results I ended up rubbing it hard with the washcloth, I don&#x27;t want to imagine what would happen when applied to \\&quot;my pair\\&quot;.  Some months after, I decided to finish the product applying it to my glutes. This time it worked fine, but only after I waited ONE HOUR and scrubed with a back scrub brush.  The only PLUS is the \\&quot;Calm balm\\&quot;. It feels great and really sooths your skin.</li>
            <li> Do not waste any time or money on this product. Does not work at all. Hair is not removed. Anywhere.</li>
            <li> So, this is my first time using this kind of product. I always shaved before (just did not like the sharp stubble afterwards and sometimes nicking myself). The product got all the hair off, but some hairs are still about 1/16\\&quot; long. I think I may have left it on too long because one spot became red and raw. If you have sensitive skin I would definitely test a small area (which it tells you do anyway) before using it. I will probably reapply to the same area in several days to see if it will get rid of the short hairs that it left behind. The product is thick, easy to spread, and stays on well. Just spread it on with the provided wooden stick, wait several minutes, jump in the shower (do not use soap on the area), and wipe it off! Afterwards, you can apply the Calm Balm which really helps soothes the area. It would be nice if the bottles came in a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2012-03-22 After using this product again \\&quot;down there\\&quot; I have realized my skin does not agree with this product (I have always had somewhat sensitive skin). Left the product on for about seven minutes and an area about 1\\&quot; x 1/2\\&quot; became red, raw, and bled slightly (obviously dissolving more than just the hair). Unfortunately I will not continue using it \\&quot;down there.\\&quot; I might use it again on a less sensitive area of my body. I am keeping my four star review on it. The product still works well; I just wish my skin was not so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I really like the results I got on my first try...Just followed directions except used TP to remove hair before getting into shower, was afraid it would clog drain and it probably would, I had a lot of hair. Had no stink, no sting, no rash great stuff.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that this stuff does work pretty good if you leave it on long enough.  But...I only used it twice because it smells sooooooooooooooooooo bad.  It smells like a mixture of dead animals and feces.  I almost vomited just leaving it on.  If you can handle the smell, go ahead, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly, testing the product on two areas.  Well, guess what, you can have an area right next to the area you tested that will get irritated.  Actually, irritated is the wrong word, burned is more correct.  As in, burned so badly that you need to use first aid cream on it and it takes 10 days to heal the open skin.  Feel sexy now? There may be some people for whom this product works flawlessly.  But if you aren&#x27;t one of those people, seriously, watch out.  I don&#x27;t know how I could have been more careful in my application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (7/7/12):  I just wanted to follow up how careful you should be if you choose to use this product.  I have light scarring on my abdomen, not a particularly sensitive area, which appears to be permanent.</li>
            <li> While it does remove hair with very little irritation, product does not completely remove all hair. I&#x27;ve used it on consecutive days, followed the directions exactly, and still don&#x27;t have perfect smoothness. If you purchase this, get the package with two tubes of hair removal cream, because you have to spread it on pretty thick. Just shaving might be easier and get better results...</li>
            <li> Works great and it was easy!</li>
            <li> Hair management has always been an issue for me, and until this product, I didn&#x27;t have a solid solution. I&#x27;ve used trimmers, shavers, creams, scissors... And now ballsBALM. The other creams I used burned a ton, but this one doesn&#x27;t burn at all. It is easy to use, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself in any sensitive spots.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I seriously think its just like nair but not as strong.  That is why you must wait a while to do its magic.</li>
            <li> Works great on longer hair, less effective on shorter (trimmed) hair. No irritation. No foul smells..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this product. Good for sensitive skin areas with fine hair. The quick breakdown:    The hair remover smells better and is much gentler than other products. Using as directed it removed most hair readily. The only problem is that if you have very coarse hair on \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas the directions say not to exceed 16 min. This didn&#x27;t quite do the trick; it simply left the hair brittle, matted, damaged, and blonde.  I plan on trying again later and waiting a full 20 min as the product is so gentile on skin that I felt absolutely 0 discomfort.    Update: I retried the product and I&#x27;m not a big fan. It left a lot of medium coarse hair as stubble. I&#x27;m amending my original review and going to say it really just good for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have a few mixed opinions about Balls Balm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Stuff works really really well. The Calm Blam is epic as an all body moisturizer. Definitely use it after the hair removal process with the \\&quot;bare Balm\\&quot;. But The stuff is good enough to be a general lotion/moisturizer in its own right.. If they sold it individually, i would definitely buy it as a stand alone.  Overall the stuff works really well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;WARNING TO MEN WITH LOTS OF HAIR OR THICK/COURSE HAIR!!! You have to repeat the process 3 times to get all the hair removed. I have a light amount of body hair, but its really thick and course. it took me 3x 15 minute applications to get smooth. So the stuff is good for people with normal to thin hair, but if you have thick/course hair, or alot of hair.. you will need to order a huge amount of the stuff... So thats why i took away a star. The stuff works but I need to treat my skin more then i care to go get the same result/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend if you have normal or thin hair. But if you have thick/course hair or alot of hair.. be cautious.. you will need to order 2-3 times as much to get the same results...</li>
            <li> I received my order in a couple of days, very fast. Yes I would recommend this product if you are tired of shaving your stuff. I have also sent questions to the company and had very fast reply. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell of the first one you use, but it goes away. I&#x27;m looking forward to the new product coming out the first of the year because of the new smell. Thanks BallsBalm !!</li>
            <li> My previous review was pretty scathing, so I&#x27;m going to revise it a bit here.    1) It&#x27;s still true - after 4 applications, I&#x27;ve gotten nowhere with the Bare Balm as far as removing pubic hair.  Interestingly enough, I accidentally removed some of my leg hair with the product in the process of working on the package.  So the stuff does work, just not if you&#x27;ve got heavy, coarse hair down there.    2) Customer service did finally get back to me - apparently there was a breakdown of sorts delivering the message through the Amazon system.  We&#x27;re resolving the issue now, and their folks are quite personable once you get to talk to them a bit.    3) The Calm Balm is still a nice product, not a bad moisturizing cream at all.    Short version:  Don&#x27;t buy this if you have very coarse hair down there - it won&#x27;t work, period.</li>
            <li> After following all instructions very clearly testing product elsewhere on the body I applied to sensitive areas specifically the scrotum I burn r them very badly in which the calming cream did not calm but make things very very very much worse. The burn was so bad That i tried cooling with water and an icecube. All in all within 6&#x27;hours i cried like a little baby 3 separate times. Although using on areas with considerably less sensitivity the product really words wonders.</li>
            <li> The product does work, but I found it left some behind and the stubble was really irritating. I need to use it carefully or find something that removes the hair more completely.</li>
            <li> well,it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the hear,but is very close to it.the skin shines,just folllow the instruction and you&#x27;ll se the results</li>
            <li> Product worked well for me. I have coarse hair and left the product on for 15 minutes, at least 80% of the hair was removed. After the second application at a later time the product worked great, nothing left. I typically have sensitive skin and had no issues. Any of these kinds of creams have a bad smell but I did not think this was any worse than nair. The included lotion works well and I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> In my opinion - a good hair management product would remove hair for about 1 month before it would begin to grow back, it would be reasonably priced, relatively easy to use, would work on all hair types without irritation(or cuts), and would require less than 20 minutes of your time.  This product did not meet any of the above criteria(unfortunately) - for me.  Some history - for about the past 5 years I have searched for the ideal solution to my hair problem. I tried \\&quot;Nair for Men\\&quot; - disappointed and irritated. I tried regular \\&quot;Nair\\&quot; - result was only slightly better. Later I tried \\&quot;Veet\\&quot; for women(which I am not), and left it on for about 10 minutes, the results were passable but not perfect. And the results did not last, 1 week later and the hair was growing back. I also tried using an old electric shaver which I no longer used on my face, I had to use the trimmer on it to cut down the hair to shaving size, not an easy task with my long thick dark brown hair. I was not satisfied with the result using the electric shaver. It should be noted that I was using these products for the \\&quot;lower\\&quot; region where they should not be used, but I have no need for hairless legs or chest, hair here (mostly) does not bother me(although I believe hair below the neck no longer serves a purpose, other than to become sweaty, smelly, and itchy).   So I decided to try \\&quot;ballsBALM\\&quot;. The 1st thing I noticed - the small size of the tubes. If I wanted to remove all the hair on my body I would need more than 1 of these(more like 5 or 6). Although all I wanted/needed was to remove the hair around the \\&quot;groin\\&quot; and lower back.  After applying a thick layer and waiting more than 10 minutes I tried wiping it off with a towel or \\&quot;washcloth\\&quot; or whatever you want to call it. Very little hair actually came off. In the back of my mind I kind of knew this was not going to work, with \\&quot;Veet\\&quot; I had to use a special \\&quot;scraper\\&quot; to remove the hair(I tried it on my 2nd try). Using a wet sponge more hair came off than with the towel. I re-applied another layer of \\&quot;Bare Balm\\&quot; cream and then after waiting for more than 15 minutes and using the \\&quot;scraper\\&quot; I had used with \\&quot;Veet\\&quot; a significant amount of hair actually came off, although not entirely(the roots of the hair were still left in the skin - like with other similar products). It was not a perfect result, and I did not even bother trying it on my back(I did not want to spend another half hour in the bathroom). To get to this point I believe I used about 40-50% of the tube. In 2 weeks I was back to square 1.  The smell of the product did not bother me(no lasting cucumber smell), but I did not find it to be better when compared to similar store bought products(which are not perfect either).</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! You just spread it and shed it! Also my girlfriend loves the Mr Clean feel....melts in her mouth not in her hands!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a few weeks and have had poor results.  With each use, I&#x27;ve applied a generous amount on the areas I wanted to see hair removal.  The first time I used it, I left it on for 10 minutes.  Very little, if any, hair came out.  It should also be noted that the hairy area had been trimmed maybe two weeks prior, so I started out with my hair already under pretty decent control.    The second time I left it on for 12-14 minutes.  A little more came this time, but the result was odd.  Despite the fact that I coated my hair with the product all the way down to the roots, it didn&#x27;t come out at the roots.  Instead, it more or less dissolved the hair above the roots, leaving a ragged, inconsistent look over the area where the product was applied.      The third time I left it on for 15-17 minutes, applying a much more generous amount than ever.  Once again, the hair dissolved in patches, never all the way to the root.  Some areas were completely unaffected.  Pretty much at this point I realized that I wasn&#x27;t going to get a better result than this, and, noticing that the Balm had brought my hair length down enough to do a decent shave, shaved in the shower immediately after scrubbing the product off with a washcloth.      Accusations have been levied that the positive reviews for the Bare Pair were written by employees of the company who produced this product.  This may be true, but I&#x27;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and believe some people out there probably have had good results with this product.  I did not, this did not work for me as advertised and was a complete disappointment.  I do not have excessively coarse or unusual hair where the product was used.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair you need to have for this to work on you, but know that your mileage may vary, so buy this product with caution!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work at all. First time i used it worked worse than shaving lots of stubble. i followed the instructions. Second time didnt remove any hair and i left it on for 15 mins. im sure i applyed enough. the nair for men works much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product worked great for me needed the full 15 to be successful! The formula is definitely gentle enough and the Balm is a must get item glad they were listed together.</li>
            <li> This does not remove one bit of hair. How can this product claim it does and still be for sale!</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Absolutely no burning or irritation (to the point where I was starting to doubt if it was working)....but wiped away easily and did the job.  Fairly odorless as well!  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I used this yesterday for the first time.  It is very effective.  I&#x27;ve tried other products (Nair for Men) with no success.  This stuff got rid of several areas of unwanted body hair very quickly.  The \\&quot;Calm Balm\\&quot; seems to do its job well, and I did not have any adverse effects from it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a member of the Perennially Hairy Club.  I have coarse hair all over which, while indicative of my inherently virile nature, is a bit of a put off for women who&#x27;ve been weened on celebrity lady-boys.  I&#x27;ve searched (in vain) for a product that does what it advertises, and does it without making me want to scrape my skin off.  The Bare Pair delivers.  First, it&#x27;s got a completely inoffensive smell which is kinda nice considering that you have to wear the stuff for 15 minutes or more at a time.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with burning, ingrown-hair bumps that make me feel even more disgusting than my natural, gorrilla-like state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to remember that for truly manly-type hairy guys you&#x27;re probably gonna have to go two or three rounds with this stuff before you see the full effect.  You&#x27;re also going to want to invest in something like the [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]] in order to keep maintenance to a reasonable minumum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff on my back, arms and nether regions, with complete success in all areas (though again I caution that two or three applications were required to achieve the desired effect).  I&#x27;ve left my chest and legs untouched because I&#x27;m not going to entirely deny my Nordic/Viking hairy awesomeness, but I don&#x27;t doubt that a similarly patient approach to those areas would leave me as smooth as a very smooth thing.</li>
            <li> I bought the Bare Balm and used it last night works great. I feel soft and smooth. Buy the Grope soap with this for the best results. Near for men is awful and can&#x27;t compare it to this. Don&#x27;t Pay attention to the other reviews that mention it because it&#x27;s not the same out all.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say than what has been said by those persons not being paid to write reviews.  The product is mild--so mild it is ineffective--and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  But still, it is ineffective.  I followed the instructions to the T, but it simply did not work, even a little.  There is really no substitute for shaving, although we keep hoping for one.</li>
            <li> My balls have never felt better. The ocean air softly caresses my balls as I write this review from my ipad. Thank You ballsBALM</li>
            <li> Super easy, gentle and leaves everything like a naked mole rat! New nickname is Mr. Bigglesworth.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! I was looking to but my usual hair removal product (Nair for Men) when I came across the Bare Pair from ballsBALM. Truth is, the name of the product gave me a chuckle, so I checked it out - and boy am I glad I did! Great product! Much gentler than Nair, works better, and no &amp;#34;chemical smell&amp;#34;.  From chest &amp; back to the most sensitive if areas this is the hair remover you want, gents!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something so I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave, because I always seem to nick myself, even with an electric razor, I put the cream on, didn&#x27;t think it was working, but left it on for about 12 minutes, then rubbed it with the glove, and saw hairs coming off, so I rubbed some more and jumped in the shower, I was amazed, there were only a few hairs remaining. It was kind burning but a couple of applications of the soothing skin salve was refreshing, and got me cool again.I was especially pleased with the area at the joint of the leg and body, but this area was also burning the most, left some salve on without rubbing it in, it cooled that off too.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, shaving gives me bumps and i have tried Nair and lets just say i would much rather have the ingrown hairs from shaving. after reading the reviews I decided to give this a shot. I am impressed no issues whatsoever. Shipping was extremely fast as well. I would recommend 100% and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks and does not seem to remove much hair. Nair (womens stuff) seems to work much better and you can pick it up at Target. This stuff is more gimicky and probably meant as a funny gift.</li>
            <li> My balls are so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At fist I was skeptical about this product, but after reading the reviews, and a friend of mine trying it out, and saying it was amazing, I decided I&#x27;d try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My balls have never been this smooth before. I&#x27;ll never shave again as long as this stuff is available.</li>
            <li> Remove product doesn&#x27;t work as well. Lotion however is great!    I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because of the lotion but im fairly disappointed that the removal cream doesn&#x27;t work as I thought it would.    It removes hair but not all of them.     Nair Extra Strength seems to be a stronger and better product then this one.    Not to mention this product is highly overpriced i paiy 5 dollars for Nair 10 oz</li>
            <li> It just wouldn&#x27;t work for me without burning me. Tried it twice both times it gave me bad chemical burns.</li>
            <li> Ballbalm  is great.  And I sent back.  The other two.  Last week.  Will I get a e-mail from the company on when I will get the money back</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does.  Just be careful the first time not to leave it on too long, because it will burn the hell out of you.  Not a fun thing to deal with!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t work on the area that is implied by its name; at least not for me. I have fairly sensitive skin and this product works well pretty much everywhere on my body, until I try to &amp;#34;bare my pair.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried it a couple times now and every time it&#x27;s ended in pain. It takes about a week to recover. But that may just be my skin. This works very well on my stomach and other areas. It&#x27;s by no means a bad product, just doesn&#x27;t work for me 100%, I suppose.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that this is the first hair removal product I have used and I am 90% pleased. Which is why I gave the Balls 4 stars. The only thing that is holding the product back from 5 stars is the rotten egg smell. Now I was expecting this because I read the reviews and I know it&#x27;s a chemically based product but it kind of blew me away when I first smelled it.   Also, Balls is pretty messy if you live in a college dorm like I do. You have to cover up with a towel which gets covered in the chemical which then smells obviously like rotten eggs. Then causing your roommates say, \\&quot;What the F*** is that smell.\\&quot; Which then peaks a funny yet some what awkward conversation about removing ball hair.  With that said, it did the job fairly well the first time. There were still bits that didn&#x27;t fully come off, but with round two I was extremely smooth and felt very satisfied. No bad reaction, no pain just smooth balls.   I&#x27;ll definitely be using this product in the future again and again.</li>
            <li> The hair removal cream was thicker than most and seemed made for a guy.  The Calming Balm is great.  I wish I had bought two of them.</li>
            <li> I found out that part of my skin in that area is very sensitive. I think the product is way to harsh. But otherwise I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> This seems to work as well or better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  However, like any other hair removal product, don&#x27;t leave it on too long!  Your boys will regret it!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a professional hair removal product. I tested it on a spot on my chest as the directions said. No reaction to it but also no hair removal either. Next i used it  on the rest of my chest, back, and groin. I experienced a mild burn and extremely minimial hair removal.  I have had ten times the sucess with products bought off the shelf in a drugstore than this.  I still cant figure out how it is strong enough to burn the skin but not remove hair. Very disappointed in this product. Stay away and save your money.</li>
            <li> I have used many other hair removal products in the past.  Most of them usually worked but left my skin irritated.  With Balls, there is no irritation from the product.  It is left pretty smooth and lasts longer than the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is better than other brands.  So it does not seem as pugent as others.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend Balls if you want that &#x27;clean and smooth&#x27; feeling...no matter where. Ha!&lt;br /&gt;In fact Amazon discreetly sends it in an Amazon Box as well...so your significant others don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in package.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tricky I think it depends on how hairy you are I&#x27;ve used several times and it varies couple time perfect couple times not so perfect minus the slight Oder it works</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;m going to say is this stuff works.  I had to do my private area twice to get it smooth, but it does actually work.  There was a little burn as I left it on a bit longer than the directions say too.  It says 7 I went 10 on the second time around.  Thank goodness for the Calm Balm.  That really saved the day.  If you are wondering how the porn stars stay so hairless down there, this is probably it.  This is way better than trying to shave and cutting yourself.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> If you want to skin your balls, use this product. My husband left it on for the recommended amount of time, no longer, and he actually wiped away skin while washing it off in the shower. The skin on both sides of his scrotum was burned off. He was left with raw flesh and a heck of a lot of pain.  I had to apply Silver Solution day and night for him and cover with non-stick pads until everything was healed.  On top of the pain and discomfort of raw balls, he had to explain to his SGT why he was unable to participate in pool PT.  If you choose to buy this product, for the love of your balls, please do a test patch before slathering it all over.</li>
            <li> I tried this yesterday and it didn&#x27;t remove the hair on my sensitive parts.  I followed their instructions but it is back to shaving, I guess.  It didn&#x27;t cause any irritation as advertised, but the reason for trying it is absent.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff! my nuts are now hairless but... swoosh, yikes im on fire, use the Salve right after the shower, and dont soap up the area after the Pawing.</li>
            <li> Husband is a big fan - his tip is to not reapply to avoid burning sensation.  Duh!  ;)</li>
            <li> Stuff works great just make sure ever spot has it on and don&#x27;t leave it in longer than recommended.  It will burn your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Burns a little at first but then it makes you nice and smooth! Make sure you apply a good amount of the product or it wont remove the hair completely. The soothing cream is nice and def. helps with the soothing!</li>
            <li> Great product!! I finally have a good product to get rid of all my unwanted hairs, in all my unwanted places!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he wanted to take care of some unwanted hair on his upper arms. It did nothing for him. He trimmed then put the balm on twice. The hair was still there. And it irritated his skin. I don&#x27;t know if this only works for small areas but it did not work for us. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done it for you, please don&#x27;t.  I beg you.  This is why razors were invented.  This stuff will burn your balls until you cry like a little girl.  The cream helps, but within an hour you&#x27;re running for more or crying for your mother.  Shave that junk, don&#x27;t bother with this.  Move along, nothing to be seen here.</li>
            <li> My balls stay super clean and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> followed directions and removed all hair easily , applied lotion balm  several times and next day no irritation at all</li>
            <li> Very good product, it does what it says it will do. Very happy with it. The only drawback is the way you have to apply the cream with a stick.</li>
            <li> BURN BABY BURN! I totally researched and thoughtfully selected this product, and was super disappointed. It burns! I followed the directions precisely and got a red burn! Thinking perhaps it was just a bad day, I tried again last month and had to apply aloe for the next three days. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of positive and negative reviews on the product before trying it which made apprehensive. After following the directions to the letter, and I mean using the &#x27;nutshell&#x27; method, using the sticks, applying as directed, waiting only 10 mins. exactly using a stop watch, then immediately rinsing and using the supplied glove, I can report that my junk is smooth and bare. Again, as it says in the directions, do Not use any soap or anything else &#x27;down there&#x27; except the calm balm, which you should use the moment you get out of the shower and dry off. The only &#x27;off label&#x27; thing I did was to use a pair of vinyl gloves to hold the stick and my junk so that I didn&#x27;t get the cream all over my hands. Last, I read earlier reviews which stated this stuff had a smell. There is a little odor, but it was mild and dare I say pleasant, especially compared with any depilatory cream I&#x27;ve ever smelled before. This is especially important to me, because I share a bathroom, so it&#x27;s nice to keep my business MY business, and not have others knowing what you&#x27;ve &#x27;just done&#x27; in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Chemical Burn! Despite my glowing previous review, I now say Stay the Hell Away From This Stuff! I had used this product 2 times when I wrote the above review. I used it a third time over a week later, still followed the directions, and got a serious 2nd Degree Burn on my nuts! The pain is indescribable, but let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s like being hit in the balls with a baseball bat while they&#x27;re roasting in a fire!!! I will NEVER, EVER put anything like this on my balls again. Kinda sucks to have &#x27;smooth balls&#x27;, but have them drenched in antibiotic ointment and pain cream, then wrapped in a mile of sterile gauze. Doctor&#x27;s Expenses? Embarrassment? Excruciating Pain? Yes, you too can &#x27;have it all&#x27; with Balls Balm..!</li>
            <li> Well, it works for sure, but it sometimes leaves patches of stubble in some places and removes everything in another spot... It also can potentially burn your skin even if you only leave it on for the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; amount of time it recommends. It&#x27;s definitely better than shaving though, which leaves my skin with angry red dots everywhere.</li>
            <li> There are three ways to remove large quantities of unwanted hair. Rip it, shave it, or burn it. I have tried all three and come to the conclusion that I just have to embrace the fact that I am hairy. I thought the use of this product would be less painful than wax, but though the initial removal of hair was painless the pain and irritation of the chemical burns afterwards lasted for weeks! I was so red and sore that I had to stay covered up my entire vacation for which I applied this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> To keep things short and sweet; is it perfect? No. Is it better than shaving? Hell yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it&#x27;s a bit messy; the sticks they give you to rub this stuff on are useless. I resorted to my bare hand (make sure to wash thoroughly immediately after!). Also, it smells like a combination of a dirty baby&#x27;s diaper and gasoline...not pleasant. Compared to Nair though, it&#x27;s like a bouquet of roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laid it on thick from the bottom of my belly button straight on through to my crack, and waited about 14 minutes. I checked after 10 by pinching a clump of hair, and it was still somewhat intact, so I waited another 4. One pointer, start with the back and work your way to the front--much easier this way. I also found that if you are getting stubble left over or bleached hairs, you are not keeping it on long enough. I have extremely sensitive skin, this did not irritate me in the least bit I am happy to report!</li>
            <li> Rockstar product! Just be sure to apply generously and spread around even after that until coat while you wait. Btw I never got a stick with my order...either way I&#x27;d say screw and use a latex glove it&#x27;s easier to apply</li>
            <li> It works stings a bit and can require 2 treatments</li>
            <li> Im not a wookie but it has become a pain shaving down there practically every day in order to keep your fun parts smooth.  Then if you miss a few days you have prickly razor stubble down there and ladies wont like that.  Tried it on day one and put it on for 8 minutes, used the glove to wipe off and some hair came off, no pain or chaffing.  Tried again on day 2, left it on for 10 minutes, and used the glove to wipe off and more unwanted hair is coming off but significant chaffing a few hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion this product does work but use it sparingly and know your limits.  It is not going to make you go completely bald the first time. So all the reviews on here of people who are like \\&quot;tried it, barely worked, 1 star\\&quot; are idiots.  Like most of these products you keep using it and your hair comes back slower and finer each time.  With some personal fine tuning  I believe this will turn into a once a while product used sparingly too keep yourself nice and smooth where it counts.  That sure beats needing to shave with a razor practically every day in order to stay smooth down there.</li>
            <li> wow that was a lot easier than dragging a razor down there. no burns, just smooth skin. The balm is awesome as well. very happy</li>
            <li> Great product all around.  I&#x27;ve been shaving for a while, thought I would give this a try since so many people had good reviews.  Let me tell you, the reviews were right and I&#x27;m throwing the razor away.  Stuff did not burn (did get a little warm, but very comfortable).  Worked great with a non-offensive odor.  I had to push the 10 minute mark, but BallsBalm did the job in spectacular fashion.</li>
            <li> This stuff will remove your man hair but oh my god the pain. I read some of the reviews that had the same comments about how this stuff gets the job done but I took them with a grain of salt and used the stuff for a shorter time period. This stuff burns like fire,  I felt like my nuts and grundle were on fire for days.  Once the burning subsided the smooth feel was awesome,  however, I am terrified to use it again.</li>
            <li> Not exactly sure what the glove is for, but this item removed all the hair completely painlessly in the &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; I used it for. I would recommend this item for any guy that likes the hairless look.</li>
            <li> Works great. No pain. Has a slight smell, but nothing too offensive. Much better than going to get waxed! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got absolutely no results with the recommended time of 7 minutes.  It suggests if you do not see results after that time then you can leave it on up to 10 minutes, but never longer!  I was only able to get really good results after about 25 minutes, but it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please do pay attention to the warning about NOT using soap after this!  This may be obvious to you dermatologists out there, but for those of us who have to learn the hard way - I will tell you that immediately after washing with soap it felt like I had tea bagged a toaster.  The warning is not a joke, do not use soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis</li>
            <li> I have always been very sensitive to hair removal below the waist. The best thing I could do was just keep things trimmed. If I tried shaving or other hair removal products I would break out and get serious ingrown hairs. I have been using this product for over two weeks now and it is outstanding. I did a small test spot it worked great with no irritation. HOWEVER...WARNING When you do a small test spot as recommended and wait twenty four hours to check for irritation, DO NOT reapply to that area for 5 to 6 days. I did without thinking while I was applying to the surrounding area, got burned in the test spot. I have used three times now and find each time I am smoother and it takes longer for the hair to come back. Just take your time and test first, do not exceed recommended time. Make small adjustments to find what time works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 02/25/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have continued using this product for about 2 months now, just emptied the first tube, so about 8 to 10 uses from one tube. I am still loving this product. I use it once a week, I have noticed it is taking longer for the hair to come back, and it seems to be growing back finer. Thanks Balls Balm for a great product.</li>
            <li> horrible......... don&#x27;t do it please don&#x27;t waste ur money i&#x27;m too lazy to send back in but no...just use something else...</li>
            <li> I think I just can&#x27;t get the stuff on thick enough. That&#x27;s probably my issue with the product, but I like to use it in conjunction with a razor for the smoothest results. I&#x27;ve left this stuff on for 15 min (the max that my instructions say) and I still have hair left. I will say the calm balm is pretty good, it makes your skin super silky soft and totally counteracts any irritation.</li>
            <li> When you first apply, use more than you think you need, and bit more than that. Make sure the application is even and don&#x27;t rush as if it will burn your skin off if you leave it on an extra minute. Also, don&#x27;t expect your skin to be smooth, it will probably feel like stubble the first time and be really smooth the second time you use it. Shower after use, no soap at all (really prevents all irritation problems that customers report)</li>
            <li> First, Some Background:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a chick and I can&#x27;t shave my legs without being covered in tiny ingrown hairs, also known as razor burn. No amount of exfoliating, soaking in warm water, lotions, steaming, or fresh blades of any number have been able to fix this. I&#x27;ve tried everything and I&#x27;m giving up on razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my legs waxed, but frankly, it&#x27;s too damn inconvenient. I&#x27;ve tried nair in the past and that stuff is awful. So I researched a bit on amazon and came up with this. It&#x27;s \\&quot;for\\&quot; dudes&#x27; junk but I read a few people had their girlfriends use it, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Skin Type:&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dead sensitive. I break out if you look at me harshly. I generally shy away from chemicals, including anything with scents, for this reason. I am pale with many moles and freckles. The hair on my legs is much thinner and paler than other hair on my body, so I hoped it would come off fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the skin on my legs seems to have problems with shaving. My arm pits and my arms (which I shave regularly) never have ingrown hairs, and I&#x27;ve continued to shave those as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation:&lt;br /&gt;The aforementioned ingrown hairs were an issue, so I didn&#x27;t shave for a month. That&#x27;s right, in the middle of summer. Somewhat disappointingly, no one noticed, not even once, and I had not stopped wearing shorts and skirts. However, I noticed, and I like smooth legs, so I was still going to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a bath hoping that might soften up the hairs, but didn&#x27;t use any soap as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cream:&lt;br /&gt;The smell was non-existant. I tried getting right up next to it and sniffing and I could barely smell anything. Usually depilatories smell awful, very strong and chemically, but this had almost nothing. The consistency is like toothpaste, thick and stays where you put it but easy to spread. It&#x27;s bright white and easy to pick out when you miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test Spot:&lt;br /&gt;In the steamy bathroom, I tried a small area on my ankle that I outlined in eyeliner. I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to use, so I put it on fairly thick using the applicator. I felt nothing, so I pulled out a book, set a timer for 12 minutes, and waited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test Result:&lt;br /&gt;They give you a cotton glove that you&#x27;re supposed to wear in the shower to gently rub the hair off. At the end of 12 minutes, I ran my ankle under lukewarm water and rubbed in circular motions, and voila, no hair. Success. Time to try the whole leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Trial Run:&lt;br /&gt;I did one leg at a time, trying a much thinner application on the second leg, and both at 12 minutes. The whole time, I never felt anything. Ran my leg under warm water and smoothed the glove around in circles. The hair came right off. No pain or discomfort and my skin felt very soft. Not a single hair remained behind, no strays at all. I had to rub for a while to get some of the parts of the hairs off, because the long hairs tended to break before the whole thing would come off, but I rubbed very gently for about two minutes and it was all done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also give you some lotion to apply afterwards, so I used that. The lotion it came with was very nice, sort of thin, not my usual stuff, but I (for no good reason) thought there might be something special in it for post-chemical use, so I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was 3 days ago and I have had no ill effects. As for ingrown hairs, I have not noticed a single new one. I had absolutely no irritation or bumpiness which is fantastic and unheard of for me when shaving. My skin has been levels of smooth I can never remember feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemicals work by breaking down the hair, so when you rub it off, you&#x27;re essentially doing no better than shaving and not getting at the root of the hair. Like I said, it was 3 days ago and I have a light stubble now, so I&#x27;ll probably do it again tomorrow, but I expect the repetition to be about what I&#x27;d do shaving to keep my legs smooth. Unlikeshaving, you&#x27;re guaranteed to get right next to the skin every time and don&#x27;t have to worry about dull blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Never shaving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;A quick update (it&#x27;s May 2014 now) - still using this stuff, but I have a few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Do not spread on with your hands. Use a flat stick, like the popsicle sticks or a plastic butter knife or something. Your hands do not spread evenly. A flat stick will do a much better job of evenly covering the entire surface, and will do it in a thinner layer (thick is not necessary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Use the cotton glove under running lukewarm water to remove the hair. What&#x27;s that, that&#x27;s whats the instructions say? Well yeah, and they know what they&#x27;re talking about. These commenters who wipe off with toilet paper or whatever.... what are you doing? Stop it. The gloves that come with are exfoliating gloves and they will remove the hair easily and evenly while also lightly exfoliating your skin to remove dead cells and lessen the chances of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Works as described,but make sure to count application time with wait time or you might regret it. Still not a perfect fix, but not a bad on, still deciding whether to buy, again, the mitt comes in handy. (Remember to clean it thoroughly).  The smell isn&#x27;t bad or suspicious. Great shortly after application to touch.</li>
            <li> So... without reading the comments and tips from other users, I learned that this product does in fact work. BUT, I did not successfully get a bare pair. Instead, I got a large bulk of pair hair removed, but not all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that you do, in fact, need to trim it down, other wise it will not give you your desired results.</li>
            <li> good seller!!! DONT USE ON YOUR BALLS</li>
            <li> The results I got from this product were basically the same as shaving.  Including the bumps.  It did remove the hair, stomach, chest, and some pubes.  However, the next day, I was already seeing stubble.  I followed the included directions and even went to their web site and read and followed the suggestions I found there.  I had high expectations and this just didn&#x27;t deliver.  I still have bumps on my stomach so perhaps I had a reaction to it.  Shaving the stomach and chest is easier in my opinion and last just as long as this stuff does.&lt;br /&gt;One warning, keep this stuff away from your nipples.  I figured if it was safe for the balls, it should be safe for the nipples.  WRONG.  Mine burned for days after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I got it for my boyfriend. He had a very bad allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> No different than NAIR</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I gave a little trim to begin with then applied and followed the directions. It was a month before I had to use it again.</li>
            <li> This product gave my husband a horrible chemical burn. He did everything as described in the directions but still left chemical burn that required him to seek medical attention</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I am sure it works better on some types of skin and hair. I tried to use it for hair in my nethers, and it didn&#x27;t get the hair off where I wanted it to. Unfortunately, if I accidentally got some in other nearby areas, that hair did come off. I gave up.</li>
            <li> Got this mainly after reading the detailed reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The balm works as specified.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it on the balls with gloves and left it for 12 mins, removed it in a gentle message fashion using my fingers, as specified and all the hair came off effortlessly. Took shower, dried myself and applied calm balm immediately. Nothing negative to say for now.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of finding a way to remove hair without any irritation. The reviews on this convinced me to give it a try. It does work for sure, but if you have sensitive skin beware. I used this on my shoulders to test it and worked amazingly well. When I applied it to my chest my skin broke out from becoming irritated and damaged my skin for a few days. I don’t want to knock the product because it for sure removes hair, but beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So you may be interested in this product to be hairless below the belt. Fortunately the product actually works.&lt;br /&gt;The creators actually put alot of thought into this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wooden sticks are used to spread the cream on the hairy area. I found it easier to use latex gloves, but you do not want to rub the cream in your skin. You want to coat the hair at the root. Never use your bare hands, it will smell like the products for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on where you put the cream and your sensitivity will determine on the time the cream stays on. Groin is mostly 8-10 minutes I would say. Any other less sensitive areas would be 4-5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the time is up you will use your glove to remove the hair. I think this is the most genius part of the system. The hand glove is the most versatile tool for hard to reach areas. It is always easiest to perform the task in the shower. When you are done, just rinse and wash with soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Nair for men has the same results. However, Nair for men smells very foul. This product does have a lighter odor to it.I would recommend cleaning the glove with detergent after each use. Surprising hair does not cling on as baldly has I expected on the glove so washing should not be an issue. I think this is a must buy. If you are on a budget, then nair is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the same category as all the other negative reviews.  Followed the directions, no issue with the test spot, 10 minutes and rinsed.  That is when the problems began.  This product caused burns and bleeding. I don&#x27;t see how they can continue to sell this product.  STAY AWAY - it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought it to see if it worked better than double shaving with old fashioned Gillette (three blade) shave. Result, sort of. Be careful, follow the directions. I am not sure I will purchase again. Just shaving the old fashioned way easier.</li>
            <li> But it burns if you you put too much or leave it on too long. So read instructions and don&#x27;t go all freaky with it.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome, the combined removal and balm works really well with no after affects just bought some more as a back up! good to go</li>
            <li> This will be a Christmas present and I am sure he is going to love it. Catchy name too. Should be interesting. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried several other methods  for removing unwanted hair and this is definitely the easiest and fastest way to do it. The only issue I have is that my skin is too sensitive to it. The dieections say to leave on for ten or so minutes, but after just three it had removed the hair and my top layer of skin. If you are planing on using this product test on a small area before usage. Otherwise it was the best but I guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few hair removal products, but nothing was as good as Ball Balm. I was initial skeptical at how good the reviews were and figured it was probably too good to be true, but I was wrong. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and it works every time. The smell is wonderful compared to other products, and it also works great so long as you follow the directions. If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth look anywhere on your body this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I used this product to remove the hair from my scrotum and shaft and around my anus.  I prefer to trim the rest of the pubic region.  This product removed the hair without a whole lot of effort.  I don&#x27;t even have to use very much of the cream with each application.  The tube has lasted three months so far, and still going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to leave the product on more towards the maximum time recommended.  Maybe that would be shortened if I applied it more thickly.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried this, followed the instructions and left it on 10 minutes, then hopped in the shower with the glove thingie and carefully buffed off the hair. The hair comes off, but right after im out of the shower the burning starts. The whole &#x27;area&#x27; gets red and inflamed and it feels like I took a hot iron to my skin. The &#x27;calm balm&#x27; didn&#x27;t calm squat. I think basically this stuff is the same old depilatory cream that does this to me - but they try to pass it off as something different, \\&quot;specially formulated and tested\\&quot; and all that jazz I should be too smart to fall for. Guess I&#x27;ll go try waxing...</li>
            <li> The best thing about this kit was the glove that i now use when i use a different hair removal cream, the second best was the &amp;#34;Calm Balm&amp;#34;. I tried to use the sticks to apply the stuff, this was...emotional to say the least, eventually i gave up and just used my hands to spread it...and that did some weird stuff to my hands, I am unsure if it exfoliated my hands or what it did, but my hands were super smooth and felt weird for like a week after...so don&#x27;t do that!&lt;br /&gt;The whole point of this product was (is) to remove hair from sensitive areas, says so on the tube. This stuff was some of the most uncomfortable stuff i have ever used, and did not work that well. I can not blame this company for my sensitivity to this particular product, so take that with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;The part that really upset me the most about this stuff was that it was (is) so thick it is hard to spread and to get a good layer anywhere requires a large quantity of the cream, then it doesn&#x27;t work that well in the end.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Calm Balm&amp;#34; is awesome, it really does cool and make my skin feel great after i use Nair to remove my hair. The glove is also very helpful when i use Nair.&lt;br /&gt;I guess i wouldn&#x27;t be so mad (at myself mainly) if i hadn&#x27;t paid 4 dollars more for this kit than I did for 3 bottles of a different product.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, after i get over all the other stuff; the price, the &amp;#34;Pain&amp;#34; from the stuff, the fact it didn&#x27;t work that well; what really gets me is how hard the stuff was to use for the results, I refer to this stuff as &amp;#34;Ice skating uphill&amp;#34;; you may get there but it will take time, be painful, and there is a better way.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews ,but I decided to write one because of the burning pain this product caused me. This product  gave me undesirable results even though I followed all instructions. I don&#x27;t recommend it. DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
            <li> it works great, a little messy (not that bad), takes a little time (not that long), and is a little harsh, but very effective.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it lasts longer than anything else.  The glove dries pretty fast (to stuff away).  Good stuff, but be willing to deal with it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Okay I am not going to lie, I did not think this would work, but for $15.99 I said why not and ordered it. This is by far the best thing that $15.99 could buy. I don&#x27;t like hair down there, so I shave just like most guys, but it&#x27;s like being tortured. I have sensitive skin and have yet to find a pain free way to do this, until now! I followed the instructions 100% and in about 20mins (13 for waiting per instructions and the rest of the time washing the hair away) I am now hair free and smooth. No pain, a slight burning feeling, but not uncomfortable. I will have to say that the smoothing cream how ever did burn a lot! I think that it might just be my sensitive skin. I have average hair type not very coarse. I have heard that it don&#x27;t work on some hair types. My two friends are going to try it next. One has hair like mine and the other has that Itailan coarse hair. I will post an update after they try it. Give it a try whats $15.99 to try  something! !!!!!THIS STUF WORKS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product on for size  given some of the previous comments.&lt;br /&gt;First:  There was a bit of tingling upon the application of this product&lt;br /&gt;Second:  I left the product on for the recommended time period;  burned like hell while coming off&lt;br /&gt;Third:  The exfoliating cream for the post removal of the air even BURNED; possibly some type of chemical reaction!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the Razors next time!</li>
            <li> It works ok. Left more stubble than I expected. A good razor does just as well. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff not really expecting it to work that well, but I wanted to try something other then shaving or using scissors, which can be especially dangerous for &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; zones as the makers of the product call them. I have to say, after a couple of uses, that this stuff actually works pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t get every single hair, even when you leave it on for the maximum recommended time (which I always do), but it does get most, and there&#x27;s almost no stubble. Also, there has been absolutely no irritation whatsoever regardless of where I used it, and that&#x27;s coming from someone with very very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price too isn&#x27;t bad and I think I should get a good number of uses out of one tube. I saw one of the Q &amp; As saying that you will probably get 6 uses out of one tube but maybe a few more. I don&#x27;t see how you can get so few uses unless you&#x27;re using it on most of your body each time or something. Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth a try if you want to try something different.</li>
            <li> Well now you know too much about me.  This product works great. No burning, not much stench. Just quick hair removal.</li>
            <li> Horrible, Horrible, Horrible....followed all the instructions and it appears it was going to work. I now have third degree burns to my sensitive region and have been in discomfort for the past four days. Set my balls on fire and they haven&#x27;t stop burning since application. And, the worse it didn&#x27;t fully accomplish what it advertises to do and there certainly will not be a second application.&lt;br /&gt;This product should come with a skeleton and cross bones warning. It should also recommend what to use to put out the fire. I had to go shopping for a product that would sensitize the chemical burn created by this product. Keep away; dangerous product.&lt;br /&gt;If you like PAIN; go ahead make your day.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive to try it since there are some pretty negative reviews and the positive reviews sound like they&#x27;e written by narcissists.....plus the product name is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;It actually worked well. I started to feel some heat and slight discomfort at 11 minutes of application. Try 9 minutes the first time just to be safe.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy but i got this product and tried it on my privet parts. The product works well however make sure you keep an eye on the time. if you leave it on for to long could be bad. make sure you have some hand lotion or something to cool down after use. other than that my privet parts felt so amazing.</li>
            <li> Actually i have been trying lot of hair removals to help me out easy-remove my hair especially chest-hair and i couldn&#x27;t find any until i purchased this product and to be HONEST I did not expect too much from it because I have enough hair that could grow-up within 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;But that just changed right now, With this product I could EASILY remove my hair and it works like magic with me, Regardless you like its smell or not, you&#x27;re going to take a shower after using it so it did not bother me so first I used it i was WHAT !!! IT REALLY STARTED REMOVING the hair and I got it for 3 times and once from amazon and willing to get it soon when I finish the one I have .</li>
            <li> Gotta be an easier way..........</li>
            <li> Horrible product caused severe chemical burn took 10 days to heal</li>
            <li> All men should have this</li>
            <li> Product just does not work.Went step by step on directions with no results.Tried three times then threw remaining in the trash.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions exactly, did not remove any hair at all. I don&#x27;t believe I have very tough hair, I suspect all the positive reviews were planted here. There&#x27;s no other way to explain why some people seem to \\&quot;love it for their boyfriend,\\&quot; but everyone else gets poor to no results at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple of weeks ago and wanted to try it as soon as I received it. For me, it did not work as well as others have noted.     Some of the main problems that I have with this is that it takes too much time for it to work and doesn&#x27;t work very well. I tried it on my legs because I thought it would be the best place to start with since the hair is not too thick and I would be able to spread it out fairly even. At first I waited 10 minutes after applying in the removing lotion and barely anything came out. I wiped it with a towel and then went to the shower and tried to take out the hair with no luck. Then right after I did it on another area and that was better since I kept it on for 16 minutes. Still not all the hair came out. Anyways, this whole process took a long time, longer than I had expected since you have to wait for at least 15 minutes, wipe it, then go shower, once done you realize that not all the hair is removed so you have to apply more lotion and repeat.     The product has a very distinct smell that isn&#x27;t necessarily bad but will give you a headache if you&#x27;re at it for a long time because of all the chemicals.      For me I never got a clear and easy result and at the end had to just shave because it just looked weird that some places had hair and others didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend. I&#x27;m thinking of just shaving or getting waxed for a better result.</li>
            <li> I really like the product and it works well. I do have two minor complaints though. First, this stuff smells terrible, its very chemically. Second, this does not come in the standard Amazon box. It comes in a package that says Balls Balm on the front. Just be aware incase you are getting this shipped somewhere like work or something. My roommates got a good laugh at me gettin \\&quot;Ball Cream\\&quot; as they put it.</li>
            <li> I never found a product to clean up ball hair than one that works as good as this.  I usually keep it on for about 15 minutes.  Any longer and I burn the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily destroy the root, as I would have expected.  But then again pubs are rather tough, and the scrot skin is rather sensitive.  Regardless, the bare skin lasts for a few weeks.  Then stubble starts to appear again.  Sometimes a quick shave in between sessions works just great.  When I&#x27;m done, I feel FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> Junk and slick marketing.  You get this delivered and the instructions disclose that even it works right the first time that it could not work (burn you) the next time.  way to risky for &amp;#34;my boys&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff wasn&#x27;t bad, but it took a few more applications to get the job done than I felt should have. I&#x27;ve had better experiences with Nair, to be honest.</li>
            <li> Worked really well on balls, not so much anywhere else. The glove is important. It seemed like some of the hairs wouldn&#x27;t necessarily come out on their own--but it was really easy to pull them out. Doesn&#x27;t really work for women or pubic hair not on the balls.</li>
            <li> Well, the name pretty much says it all. You will have to determine where to place it after the first time using it though.</li>
            <li> This product may have its place. If you know its safe on your skin and actually will work on your hair fine...not sure how you get there without trying and i would recommend not trying. it may work for some but like all chemicals it can be dangerous. I had a bad reaction to it. It seemed to work to remove hair, skin, cause pain. It caused massive irritation, chemical burns in some areas. I followed the directions exactly. It&#x27;s going to take a while to heal. I visited the Dr. today and he confirmed an allergic reaction to the stuff. Testing the spot did not reveal this as it was splotches and not everywhere. My suggestion would be if you have sensitive skin at all you don&#x27;t even risk this product. I thought it would be less risky than shaving given the description but it&#x27;s not and the price (the pain and somewhat embarrassing trip to the dr.) is way too high.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. It really works. Leaves his skin soft and clean of those undesirable hairs. He recommends it.</li>
            <li> removes hair well but it requires some accurate timing to make sure you leave it on long enough but not too long. i had a slight burning first time i used it but nothing major and it only happened on the first time i used it. my partner uses it too and he has no problems. it&#x27;s a nice way to stay smooth.</li>
            <li> This is glorified Nair for men.  It has a very strong chemical smell. Also, I did like the product said and tried it on a test area with no problems. I then used it as it said and got a horrible rash.  I have never had a problem with any other product before.  The  lotion was okay, but very runny.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this on my scrotum as it&#x27;s nearly impossible to shave there. I think the best solution is to shave (with a razor/shaver) in the pubic area sans the scrotum and use this balm on the scrotum, perineum, etc. It doesn&#x27;t actually root out the hair but simply dissolves it, so you are left with ordinary stubble (which grows back) and it can hardly be compared to a close shave. However, it works as promised!</li>
            <li> i have VERY thick hair and it didn&#x27;t do what i wanted it to, ended up hurting my self but not the hair lol. its ok though kinda guessed that would happen.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, if you follow the directions. The results lasts for days.</li>
            <li> This stuffs legit. The reviews had me skeptical, but there were enough positives to make the leap. No real chemical smell, it&#x27;s faint, but it smells more of fake coconut and vanilla a bit. It was pleasant. The directions say max 15 mins so stick to it. I went 16 and it was mildly uncomfortable, any longer disastrous. The glove is key to maximum removal, but tread lightly or you can rough things up a bit. Be sure to flush the area liberally and for a good while with cool water. The after balm is fantastic and my only wish is that the bottle was the same size as the remover. Skip the sticks and get gloves to make life easy and application complete. Makes everything silky smooth and delightful. Can&#x27;t wait for their personal lubricant to hit the market.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it burned after following the steps but the next day it was fine. It left some stubble but that could be because I took it off to early.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this would work that well, but I was sick of shaving all the time and was willing to try it out.  I have not been disappointed.  If you&#x27;re tired of shaving all the time I really suggest you try this out, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This was the first hair removal product I&#x27;ve ever used, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Works on your balls, your anal area, taint, shaft, crotch.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on the arms or legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They give you wooden sticks to apply the cream, but I found that it&#x27;s easier to just use latex gloves as long as you&#x27;re not rubbing it into your skin like moisturizer, just coat the skin.  The instructions said 10-12 minutes, but the first time I used it, it kinda burned and I could tell that 10-12 minutes was too long.  No bleeding or anything, just felt like a rugburn.  The lotion they give to put on afterwards helps a lot - slather it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use leave it on for 7-8 minutes and it&#x27;s PERFECT.  Everybody&#x27;s skin is different - just experiment with it.  And the tube is huge - will last a long time.  Try putting the least amount possible in the beginning and ramp up. I use it every 2-3 weeks.  Much easier and less scary than shaving.  Using a shaver for your groin is ok, but razors to the balls/anal area is too scary for me.</li>
            <li> This worked great for removing the hair from my balls. There was a slight warming sensation when I put it on, which alarmed me, but it didn&#x27;t last. It didn&#x27;t work so well on the pubic hair not on my balls though. Maybe I need to try again with a thicker application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my chest and the test patch was a success, but when I tried a larger area, it didn&#x27;t work so well. Again, maybe I just need to apply it thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that the reaction between the hair and the product smells a little weird. The product itself smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up squeezing it out onto my hand and rubbing it on. How they expect you to apply it with a Popsicle stick is beyond me. If you do this though, be careful. It started to eat at my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical. I&#x27;ve shaved for years and years, I&#x27;ve used other defoliants. I ordered this product and tried it today. This stuff is great. The only \\&quot;sting\\&quot; i had was when I applied the after-balm. That didn&#x27;t las tong, and I feel soooo smooth. It&#x27;s great. Granted, I&#x27;m been smooth for years and change-up between shaving &amp; other hair removal products. It has not irritated my skin in the least and I did as the name says, did bare my b@llls.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order more. I really like this. Report back how long it lasts versus other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 03/31/2014&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 days since the first application, I noticed hair growing back; however, this hair was very different. It was softer, smaller, and more sparse! Ok, no this did cause me to shave a bit, but overall, it was a joy because it took way less time. Now after a few months and not grooming, I decided to try it again. I don&#x27;t like using these kinds of products unless there is a decent amount of hair growth. It&#x27;s taken this long for the hair to grow enough. Could be just me or the product, I&#x27;m unsure, but similar products never made my pubic hair softer and different like this did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just did a second trial with this product. I had slightly more irritation, but it went away quickly. Irritation, in fact, might be too harsh a word as it was more a tingling discomfort that quickly subsided. I should add, it wasn&#x27;t due to the balm, but the suggested moisturizing lotion! The lotion is fun and slippery and does have a cooling effect. Anyway, with shaving occasionally since the last time, this stuff worked wonders. I still love it.</li>
            <li> This product works great and the people saying it burns is only because their skin is to sensitive Or they are allergic</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. The only thing the product was right about was that it does not burn. still useless.</li>
            <li> Great product finally a real product for us guys. You may need to do a couple of applications for best results but that&#x27;s easy to do and is better than any other way. These guys really know how to make a product just right for the bear pair. I say thanks for your product.</li>
            <li> Work ok but not great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my koojons nice and smooth and to get away from a razor. It does remove hair but it will also scorch the rooster eggs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Balls Balm a couple times now and here are some tips that some may find helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Balls Balm is a pretty decent product. Using it can be challenging but overall the product works pretty well at removing 85-90% of my coarse, black, hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;ve learned that rinsing the area with lukewarm water with your hands, then blow drying with cool air (dry), prior to application helps a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t advise using Balls Balm after showering because soap and any kind of agitation to the area will make for a bad experience. You want the area to be free from body oils, but not scrubbed clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Understand that the each time you use Balls Balm the wait-time will vary. For me it can range between 7-10 minutes. TIMING is everything and a few seconds can mean the difference between a clean, smooth, scrotum and a painful burn. But don&#x27;t freak out. If you pay attention and use some common sense you&#x27;ll get amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. After about six to seven minutes from application of Balls Balm, pull (tug) at a few hairs. If they break off with relative ease after tugging on them, hit the shower ASAP and rinse and rub using the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even (after six to seven minutes) if the hairs don&#x27;t come off after a few tugs, make your way to the shower anyway and continue to tug test every couple of seconds in different areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. If at any time you start to feel anything beyond a slight warm or cool sensation (ex. any type of burning or prickling sensation). Rinse IMMEDIATELY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me repeat that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If at any time you start to feel anything beyond a slight warm or cool sensation (ex. any type of burning or prickling sensation). Rinse IMMEDIATELY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT attempt to tough it out for ten minutes when your sack is clearly screaming for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may not get the results you want this time, but that&#x27;s nothing compared to a burn from ignoring these simple warning signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. When using the glove, I usually wipe several times in one direction, in the shower to remove the cream from the area, and then lightly and vigorously back and forth when the cream has been sufficiently rinsed from the area. The hair comes off way better with light, vigorous, rubbing (but remove the cream thoroughly before doing so, otherwise you&#x27;ll just rub it into the skin and end up with a burn)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope some of you find these tips helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, a pretty good product but you do need to be careful. Like I said, it works well on my coarse, dark, hair but I know others have had issues. The after lotion is also quite nice.</li>
            <li> rather heavy chemical smell, not as mild as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer using Carson&#x27;s Magic Razorless facial cream.  It is a much milder and equally effective product.</li>
            <li> Unless you are superman, and have some kind of kryptonian superhuman skin... OMFG it burns. I followed the directions to the T. Did a test spot and everything. That felt fine, but wow. NEVER AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;Waxing would probably be less painful. According to the reviews there are some lucky folks out there that this doesn&#x27;t phase them... I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s possible. I gave it three stars because it did what it was supposed to do, but docked it 2 stars for the pain it caused me.</li>
            <li> Tried it. I guess I&#x27;m not very tough. I couldn&#x27;t finish the process without crying like a girl. I mean my eyes watering... It BURNED. LOL. I guess I do have sensitive skin. (Note to self)</li>
            <li> I tried this a couple of years ago and had great expectations!  I read the instructions and carefully got to work.  Unfortunately a little drop happened to get just on the tip of my male organ. I rinsed it off the best I could and set back to work down under. About 10 minutes later it felt like an eternal fire was piercing through the tip. I hastily jumped in the shower and and soaped and washed while tears were stinging my face.  That didn&#x27;t work seem to work. Finally I found Jalepeno juice and muriatic acid that I mixed together and rinsed over my now slightly deformed member. It immediately felt better and after rinsing thoroughly I liberally applied the calming gel.  Luckily I had vacation the next week so I was able to bare my pair and recover. I&#x27;m not sure if I was circumcised before but I was afterwards!</li>
            <li> Stay away I used this item once and my skin was on fire for two days I kept putting on the relief cream but made it worse!</li>
            <li> Tried it first day with a skeptical feeling , just one nut to be exact , it was ok , but I was afraid to apply too much , so it did remove a few hairs, and I quickly rinsed as it says to do , next day I said to hell with it , ( I hate hair on my balls ) I squeezed the tube full blast on my nuts and spread it with the stick , waited exactly 12 minutes instead of 11 , got into shower with cotton glove , and BAM !!! bald and shiny &amp; happy as hell . just a tiny bit of a burn on my left nut , which went away next day, been razor shaving my unit for 30 yrs , hating it every time , now this cool product comes out , could not be happier , thanx wife  :o)&lt;br /&gt;p.s do not throw away the 2 plastic/foam wrappers , they are to hold your unit up in the air while you wait 12 minutes so you do not burn the underside of mr johnson</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Works very good! Highly recommended! Leaves you smooth! Very good product thanks!  There is no pain or discomfort this stuff just works! You have to try it!</li>
            <li> I used a tube of this as directed, and even exceeded the recommended exposure time, on several areas of my body and this product simply did not remove any hair.</li>
            <li> Just got this today. This made everything come off. It&#x27;ll take 2 times to get everything, but completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep extra moisturizers around because your skin will dry very quickly and you can&#x27;t leave it irritated or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never shaving again.</li>
            <li> this product removes all the hair that it covers, but it doesnt seem to last any longer than shaving. it can also lead to many ingrown hairs. overall it did the job very well and will leave your body smooth</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but it really burns if you don&#x27;t get the timing right~!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend reducing the time you apply it for by 1~2 minutes and re-applying it a day later until you drop all the hair.</li>
            <li> My buddy claims it works well!!</li>
            <li> Sure this product works but it really irritated my skin and is still irritated to this day after I bought and used this product back in August. I followed the instructions and used everything included. They also gave a refund out of nowhere and I&#x27;m getting ready to see a doctor. This may work on some of guys but use with caution if you buy this product or be brave and use razor instead! The best way in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product for me. If you use as directed and DO NOT have it applied longer than the time limits for regular and sensitive areas it leaves you with smooth, sexy skin. I normally shave down there but after using this produce I will never use a razor or clippers again. I have used it on my chest and back of my neck after a haircut as well (never shaved there before but was recommended by the guy who told me of the product) and am very satisfied with the results. For me I use it every three to four weeks but everyone will have different result and want different times that they think it&#x27;s time to get rid of the stubbles. Oh, by the way, my wife loves the results on me as well and is always excited to give me some attention after using the product, that&#x27;s the reason we are using it right?</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long and it doesn&#x27;t get as far down the hair as I would like. If you leave it on too long, you may find some red bumps on your skin, but those will go away pretty fast. Use the calm balm right after you get the bare off your skin!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awesome! No need to worry about accident nicking her special areas when using this stuff! Works really well and lasts throughout the week! Their could not be an easier way to aid in hair removal. I have tried in every area below the waist and it works great. Far more superior to Men&#x27;s Nair and past hair removal system I have used. if you are hesitant about this product DONT BE! Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> Before I had girlfriends that wouldn&#x27;t even touch the area. Now after applying this cream and balm... the ladies come to it like honey on a stick!...PUN INTENDED!</li>
            <li> Did nothing will never buy this product again. Save your money and just use a razor wasted 30 minutes with this stuff. If I could have given it a negative score I would have.</li>
            <li> Some discomfort! I would not gamble and leave it on longer than recommended. A little pre-trimming with the beard trimmer helps.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, but heed the warnings: DO NOT WASH WITH SOAP AFTERWARD.</li>
            <li> Burn burn burn it hurt so bad my skin is red and irritated like you wouldn&#x27;t believe wish I could give it 5 stars so everyone could read this I&#x27;m hurtn and have to go to the doctor how do I get my money back. I&#x27;m a firm believe in reviewing all products I buy but now I&#x27;m truly skeptical save your money buy a Braun. Burn burn burn.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see that the product worked just like advertised. Does a great job of painlessly removing hair from anywhere! I would definitely buy this again (in fact I just did the other day and I&#x27;m waiting for my next shipment to arrive!).</li>
            <li> Great product and works REALLY well. Be sure to follow the directions very carefully</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic, whether you&#x27;re male OR female. Doesn&#x27;t burn, and works better than anything I&#x27;ve bought otc.</li>
            <li> I was just about to write a scathing review about how I had fallen victim to the clever marketing and the fake reviews posted here, when I decided to try one more application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first attempt achieved NOTHING.  I had already trimmed my scrotum and applied a generous portion of Bare Balm to it.  I waited 15 minutes, the maximum it said to wait, and jumped in the shower and rinsed off the family jewels.  To my dismay, I noticed that it didn&#x27;t appear to remove a SINGLE HAIR!  However, it did seem to bleach the hair, as it was decided lighter colored.  I was so upset.  I got dressed, came downstairs and hopped on Amazon to write this review.  But then I read some other reviews that said they had tried it more than once and gotten better results a second time.  So I said, \\&quot;Heck with it\\&quot; and ran back upstairs, 20 minutes after my first application, and dropped my drawers and grabbed the bare balm again.  This time I gooped it on like schmear on a bagel.  It was thick and I waited a FULL 20 MINUTES.  I jumped in the shower again, and rinsed off, and AT FIRST, it seemed like the hair was still there.  Then I grabbed my washcloth and started rubbing it across my sack, and each spot I hit with the wash cloth, the hair rubbed off my sack!  So I&#x27;m sitting there and rubbing and buffing my sack with my washcloth and the hair is coming OUT!  It was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I sit, at my PC, writing this review of Balls Balm, and I&#x27;m sporting my new pair of shiny, polished nads!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!  For those people having problems, I suggest trimming first, then putting it on thick and waiting 20 minutes, then rinse and REPEAT!  Use a washcloth to remove the stubborn hair when you rinse.  It will pull right out!</li>
            <li> Gave it 2 tries on the same day, added 5 min to the wait time on the 2nd try.  Did not remove the hair for me.  May work for some but didn&#x27;t for me.   Guess I&#x27;ll continue my search for a product that will work.</li>
            <li> ill adimt, im half monkey, but thats why i looked to find this type of product.  i used it on my back, my chest and my arms, and well...  anyway, it didnt seem to work.  if you have light amounts of body hair, and just want a clean look, maybe this will work for you.  if you have thick body hair, dont expect much!!</li>
            <li> Balls balm is an extremely fast and easy product for body hair removal. I&#x27;ve used it pretty much everywhere :O and it removes hair with no problem at all. Follow the instructions included and you&#x27;ll never have any problems. Afterwards, your skin may be a bit sensitive, but the Calm Balm included soothes extremely well. This is a great product.. and as an added bonus, it smells a little like play-doh.</li>
            <li> great product.  go for it.  much easier than shaving. easier to reach everywhere.  Hair came off.  I was skeptical about this working as well as a razor or trimmer but it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Does not cause any problems if directions are followed---EZ removal of hair if directions are followed without risk of cuts</li>
            <li> I knew the risk of getting burned if you leave it on too long, but at 10min I didn&#x27;t feel anything.  So I gave it a couple extra minutes, and then took my time getting in the shower.  All was well, until I started \\&quot;groping\\&quot; myself, as the directions humorously call for, with the provided cotton glove.  Then came the burn!  Yeeooww!  Once I felt the burn start, I minimized the damage by just rinsing the stuff off as quickly as I could with just water, and then used the glove ever so gingerly.  But it was too late, I got burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I highly recommend, even if your skin isn&#x27;t \\&quot;normally\\&quot; sensitive, to rinse off at a max of 5min (or something much less than called for in the directions) as a first test.  And then next time increase it, and so on, until you find the right amount of time for you.  Patience is a virtue here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it did work for me.  I have pretty thick hair, and it all came off (and then some! ouch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the CalmBalm works too.  Ahhh... I&#x27;m sure glad it did!  For the first day I actually put Polysporin (or you could use Neosporin) all over the burned areas to help the healing, and that worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it smells good too.  It doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell like many similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll change it to 5 stars if it doesn&#x27;t burn me next time when I leave it on for much less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;I tried a shorter time, but still got burned. :(  Apparently, it takes off skin as much as it does hair.  I reluctantly had to change my rating to \\&quot;don&#x27;t like it\\&quot;.  Even when I leave it on for just a matter of seconds and rinse it off, it basically chemically etches my skin.  And even that makes my skin get flaky and break out.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Trying to save you some time reading through all the reviews.  From my own personal experience, and that of many others I have seen on this and various other sites for reviews on this product, it just does not work well at all for course body hair, so do NOT purchase it for that.  To be fair, it may work better for it&#x27;s title area, but I still have to give it one star, because it makes bold claims to remove body hair for extended periods of time over your entire body (which it failed miserably on for me and many others).  In fact, even on some of the positive reviews, people indicated it was like \\&quot;a close shave\\&quot; and that they have to use it very frequently, which goes against the company&#x27;s claims.  A lot of hair removal gels and creams remove hair to skin level, so that is not really effective (or pleasant, as it leaves you with almost immediate stubble).  It also seems to be a cheesy company run out of somebody&#x27;s basement, based on the Ziploc bag packaging, photocopied instructions, and weird 1960s children&#x27;s glove.  If you have course body hair, this stuff is not going to help you, unfortunately.  So, buy it for your balls, but not for your body if you have course hair.  Major failure in that respect.</li>
            <li> I love how this product removes hair without a harsh odor, but don&#x27;t leave it on more than the recommended time.  I made that mistake and ended up with a bad &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;.  One other recommendation is to not scrub the hairs off with the glove.  This tended to irritate the skin.  Hair that regrows is thinner and easier to remove with repeated uses.</li>
            <li> This gets the hair out of the places i need to. Don&#x27;t leave it on for longer than 10 minutes though are it will chemical burn which is painful.</li>
            <li> This product damaged my balls so bad!! I could not even walk.....! I dont think it was the way I used it because I followed every single instruction! So, maybe it was my skin type!! but Dang...! I wont use it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So I read the bad and good reviews and still went ahead with the purchase. Yup, disappointed. This is nothing more than nair for men repackaged and charging you double for some popsicle sticks and an exfoliating glove.&lt;br /&gt;The contents are package in a ziplock bag, so that should tell you something right?&lt;br /&gt;The product itself, I applied to my chest and ended up leaving it on for 17 minutes to be sure it took the hair off. Nope, it took some hair off but it basically looked like a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow. I think it would take 2-3 uses back to back to get the hair off. Do what others have said and stick with a razor!</li>
            <li> After opening package and reading everything about it - plus looking at protective gloves you need to wear - I tossed this item and purchased a Norelco Bodygroom.  I do not regret the decision at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally a hairy guy. I tried Bare Balm on my chest, and it worked wonders. I no longer have to spend $60 to get waxed when Bare Balm does all the work for me for one-quarter the cost and half the time. If you&#x27;re a hairy guy and want to finally take off the fur coat, I highly recommend these ballsBALM products.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were very impressed with the results of the product; easy to apply, comfort during use and washes off in the shower.  No bumps and slow growth- especially after several uses....much, MUCH better than shaving.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys an active life- both in the bedroom and outside:)</li>
            <li> as smooth as a babies bottom works great does tingle but your on your precious jewels that have alot of sensitivity however there is no issues using this product no burning or irritation</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after having bad experiences with women&#x27;s hair removal creams. I needed something that would be effective yet sensitive and this delivered!!! I won&#x27;t be using any other creams besides this. No irritation and no ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> The applied it and waited 15 minutes jumped into the shower and the hair melted of it was weird looking all that balck hair. But now after that I have a bare pair</li>
            <li> I read the instructions before attempting. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have sensitive skin. No trimming or anything I started with the bush area and then down on the sack. Used the Popsicle/tongue depressor(s) that came with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sat in the bathroom for about 12 minutes. Then checked to see if the stuff was working. At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it worked at all. Then I used the tongue depressor on its side like a knife and the bush literally fell off. Didn&#x27;t hurt or anything. Picked it up to inspect it a bit and the hairs were very gummy and stringy. Gross looking but it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put on the gloves and dampened them. Exfoliated the other areas and the hairs pretty much just sloughed off. Then I took a closer looked and in some areas my skin is raw and even missing. &amp;#62;_&amp;#62;&amp;#34; After about 7 minutes starting to feel a burning and stinging sensation on the sack area and where I was missing some skin. 。・°°・(＞_＜)・°°・。&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grabbed the calming balm and dipped my junk in the stuff. Had to do that a few times cause it really stung. A few hours later and everything is smooth but now I have some missing flesh and a slight chemical burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really not that bad. I&#x27;ll just leave it on for a few minutes less and maybe so it in sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how someone of you guys left that stuff on for 20+ minutes or did a second application. Must have balls of steel or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I&#x27;m all smooth down there now. ヾ(＠⌒ー⌒＠)ノ</li>
            <li> Just used the item and had to write a review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a mixed male of Indian and Black ethnicity so my body hair is a light curly mix of coarse hair, but never grows longer than an inch (just to give you an idea). I have somewhat delicate skin so I tested it on my upper thigh for 10mins and it wiped clean off with no irritation. I then applied to my genitals and around the anal area...with fingers crossed I waited 12mins and I was amazed. Cleans up easily and the outcome was smoother than my razor. I could say I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom here, but you would have to try it for yourself. Glad I don&#x27;t have to spend extra time shaving as it gets tiresome, but this product gets you smooth in under 15mins. Recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have used another product that sounds like &amp;#34;bare&amp;#34; which you can buy in a grocery store...peeled my skin off for days afterward. This was really kind to my &amp;#34;parts&amp;#34; and worked comfortably well. As a very hairy guy, it&#x27;s hard to remove hair in select areas with a cream, but I was able to bare my balls without getting thigh or butt hair removed- I will use it again</li>
            <li> Much more gentle than other products, easy to use.  I did the &amp;#34;24 hour&amp;#34; and had no burn - so I used it for what it was intended for.  Love the product</li>
            <li> Okay to be honest it works really well down there. However you have to leave it on for upwards of about twenty minutes, also my hair is now staring to grow back the next day. I think I&#x27;m going to try a wax instead.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a chemical burn in my manly regions. I suppose I&#x27;m partially to blame because I didn&#x27;t do the recommended test spot 24 hours prior to use. I&#x27;ve used Nair products before and had no issues or reactions or anything so I decided to skip the skin test (because I&#x27;m impatient and who honestly does that anyway) with the game plan of quickly hopping into the shower if it started to burn. I applied and let it sit for 10 minutes (the amount of time recommended for sensitive areas) and went into the shower to rub it off. I had no pain until I began &amp;#34;gently buffing the hair away&amp;#34;. It was too painful to rub to product off so I rinsed off and called it quits. If you&#x27;ve ever nicked your man parts with a trimmer or razor, imagine that feeling you get only imagine it on your entire region all at once. Ouch. It was horrible. Also, there&#x27;s still plenty of hair present and I&#x27;m not that hairy of a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I gave it 2 stars because the &amp;#34;Calm Balm&amp;#34; was actually quite soothing and took ... *some* of the pain away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I used it with no problems on my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, do the recommended skin test if you&#x27;re going to buy this product. Even if you generally don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or have used other similar products before.</li>
            <li> I reseived it, used it. Now I&#x27;m healing burns on both my legs and arms. Not for sensitive skin. And still if you gonna buy it use it really carefully.</li>
            <li> I thought this product wasn&#x27;t going to work very well.  I was wrong!  Use it as directed.  I left it on longer and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  Leave it on for the recommended amount of time and it works without discomfort.  I have the smoothest balls around!</li>
            <li> The good it leaves the jewels nice and smooth never had them that smooth since I was a child, product actually works well&lt;br /&gt;The bad it may cause some irritation in some areas follow INSTRUCTIONS properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not kidding on how long before you wash the applied area</li>
            <li> If you have thick or curly hair this product is not for you.  After several attempts I ended up removing small uneven patches of hair.  The product failed to provide a smooth groomed surface as promised.  I eventually ended up resorting to electric trimmers.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend and he said it works great. It doesn&#x27;t smell to strong and the hair came right off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this product, it doesn&#x27;t work. I thought for sure this would clean up all the hair I can&#x27;t get to but it doesn&#x27;t work. worthless. Wish I could get my money back. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> worked very well, minimal iratation, very thick I think on the next application I will thin it a little with sdme distilled water to make it a little creamier, even on my sack it did a good job with no more iritation than shaving and seem to last longer</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and have since reordered a larger supply. BALLS Balm loves men who need smoothness without irritation, itchy, bumpy, remains. The lotion helps to maintain your sleekness. Further the sticks and glove are brilliant! I won&#x27;t use anything else. Thanks Balls Balm for being so gentle.. :)</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin. I was amazed at how well Bare removes the hair without irritation, or effecting the texture of my skin, like other topical hair removal cremes. This combo is an absolute must for me. Finally, a product that works!</li>
            <li> Horrible, Horrible product! This stuff draws blood! Feels like an acid burn afterwards! Doesn&#x27;t work on your bag! Still leaves hair. The glove feels like rough sandpaper and feels like it pulls the hair out of the follicle. The lotion burns for a bit after you apply it as well. Just the worst experience you could have trying to remove hair from your sack. There&#x27;s no way to apply it fast enough with the tounge depressor sticks included as suggested in the directions. Can&#x27;t really say enough bad things about this product and my brief and unpleasant venture with it! Does not remove stubble hair at all! My advice, stay away from this and shave with a good razor. I honestly think who ever created this garbage did it as a sick, twisted, sadistic joke. Furthermore, I would not be suprised if there wasn&#x27;t a pending class action lawsuit against the company that created this junk. It&#x27;s seriously that bad!</li>
            <li> So this didn&#x27;t work all that great for me...i did a couple applications as the directions indicated,&lt;br /&gt;but maybe my hair is just to thick...either way didn&#x27;t work for me...i dont have time to keep&lt;br /&gt;trying and applying application after application.</li>
            <li> I get the sense that this product is nothing but a gimmick and that all of the positive reviews out there are from people who are involved with or work for the company trying to boost it&#x27;s reputation.  I used it once, exactly as directed, and very quickly realized it was a terrible mistake.  There was little relief from the burning sensation I felt for about 3 days.  The calming balm aided a bit in that department, but was mostly ineffective after a couple of hours or so.  What was most ineffective was the hair removal cream itself which appeared to not remove anything at all.  What I was left with for several days were red and burning balls that are slowly getting back to normal after shedding a layer or more of skin.  I would advise all to steer clear of this and, like me, stick to a good old fashioned razor.  It&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper, more effective, and easier, as I&#x27;ve found out.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I got tired of shaving with a razor. I figured it would go one of two ways: for $15 I wouldn&#x27;t be upset if it didn&#x27;t work, and for $15 I would be ecstatic if it did work. People usually only write reviews for three reasons: They are really dissatisfied with the product, they are really happy with the product, or they are bored. I am taking the time to write this review because of how unconditionally satisfied I am with ballsBalm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading some of these negative reviews is a little surprising, although I should expect that not everyone can have common sense. This stuff doesn&#x27;t stink. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell like your girlfriend&#x27;s scented lotion, but why should it? It doesn&#x27;t burn, either; in fact, that worried me a little bit during application. I assumed it should burn a little if it was working. But alas, I couldn&#x27;t find any issues with the stuff. Read the instructions. There are only three steps. How can you mess that up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I followed the instructions. I put it on, waited 10 minutes, then used a finger to test-wipe an area to see if the hair would come off. It did. I laughed. I hopped in the shower and scrubbed it off with the handy-dandy glove, and laughed some more at how ridiculously convenient the process was. Then I ran into my bedroom and made my skeptical girlfriend indulge in the world of smooth balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast, the product is 100% effective and pretty well-priced. You guys have made a customer for life. And as soon as I can get the word out, dozens more where that came from. Thank you.</li>
            <li> No better or worse than Nare&#x27;</li>
            <li> I first used this product a week ago and I&#x27;m really satisfied with the results! Although everyone&#x27;s skin may react differently, I had no problems whatsoever, and I left the product on for the maximum amount of time recommended. Everything stayed smooth for about five days before I started feeling prickly, but it was five days of heaven. Frosting your boys with the balm and a popsicle stick seems a little silly, but it&#x27;s way safer than taking a razor blade to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use this will be a little messy. Give yourself extra time to spend wiping the hair off in the shower, and use a screen or strainer over the drain so it doesn&#x27;t get clogged! You may need to wipe out your shower afterward.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me.  If I used too little, it removed very little hair.  If I used too much, it burned my skin (and still did not remove all the hair).</li>
            <li> This stuff could be used as a torture device in interrogations...after using it on my chest, stomach, shoulders, and groin, it feels as though I have been laying in the summer sun ALL day. Imagine bright red sunburn with bubbly skin, as though you&#x27;ve gotten sun poisoning. I spot tested it and everything seemed fine. I was so incredibly wrong. Rinsing in the shower really just made it burn even worse, even with seemingly FREEZING cold water. The &amp;#34;Calm Balm&amp;#34; was almost like squirting lemon juice into a fresh, open wound. Even a whole hour after using it, while having a fan blowing cold air on me from outside, it STILL feels like one of the worst sunburns I&#x27;ve ever experienced. Worst part is, I don&#x27;t even have slightly sensitive skin... Only after using nearly half a tube of Neosporin did the pain begin to subside. However I now look like a giant, shiny, &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; red lobster. And I want to scream like a lobster does in a pot of boiling water. I now know their pain. I used the product exactly as directed...using the sticks, waiting ten minutes, and then using the exfoliating glove, which itself caused extreme discomfort while &amp;#34;lightly buffing&amp;#34; the skin (imagine taking 100 grit sandpaper to a sunburn). In fact I think the exfoliating glove is what started all of the pain. I figured &amp;#34;Hell, I&#x27;m a manly man, BUFF THROUGH THE PAIN!!!&amp;#34; But holy balls it was like trying to use a hairdryer to put out a forest fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, this product is AWFUL, and I want to jump into the nearest frozen lake I can find, in hopes of dying of hypothermia &amp; drowning, because that would be less uncomfortable than these tubes of terrorist cream. To angry wives/girlfriends, this would be PERFECT if your man has been cheating on you and you seek revenge. Otherwise between that, and the previously mentioned terrorist torture techniques, I truly see NO market for this product. Any review that states otherwise is clearly written by a terrorist or angered girlfriend/wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to contact the manufacturer for a full refund. This is crap.friend/wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to contact the manufacturer for a full refund. This is crap.</li>
            <li> This product was awesome! Easy and simple instructions to get you smooth in all the right spots. Highly recommend if you hate having to shave all the time.</li>
            <li> I was worried about putting stuff on my sensitive parts, so I trimmed own the hair to about 1/8\\&quot; first. I left this on for the full 15 minutes and the hair just came off. This worked for me better than other products. I can&#x27;t believe how smooth I am it did take half a 4 oz. bottle.  I put it on as thick as my hair I was removing.  No pain, not even warm, just a little tickle at first.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t leave it on long enough you end up with stubble.  If you leave it on too long you end up with stubble and chemical burns.  The chemical burns take a few days to heal enough for re-treatment but by then the hair has gotten so much longer you are just going in circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you have thin soft hair down there this product may work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me no matter what I did I always had coarse stubble left over.  I remember the last time I had used a hair removal cream it was Veet.  That stuff at least removed most the hair leaving on a few small spots that needed re-treatment.  However the smell was so bad I just can&#x27; use that product.  Also I was playing the same game with Veet.  Too long and my skin was in such bad shape I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  Not long enough and hair was still there.  In the middle I&#x27;d get splotchy results.</li>
            <li> Works great but damn it can really light you on fire!  Tried the test spot like the instructions says and did not notice any issues with it 24 hours later.  So decided to continue with the product. HOT DAMN IT BURNS!! that is all</li>
            <li> First time use, using a stop watch to keep track of the time.. I covered my balls and all around my penile area generously with the cream and left it on for fifteen minutes. Next I jump in the shower with the water running slightly warm, I put the glove on and began a wiping/brushing motion. Small patches of hair in certain areas brushed off immediately, while other spots stayed in tact. In the areas where the hair was removed there was obvious stubble left behind, both visibly and physically. It left the scent or better put the smell of the cream where I used it for over a day, which I didn&#x27;t particularly like. The glove is awesome, In light of loosing money purchasing this product, I did get a great laugh smacking my friend in the head with this glove the very next day after using it. Dude!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, do not use body wash or any kind of soap after using this! It will burn your skin like a really bad case of razor burn.</li>
            <li> It does seem to make it easier to.. scrape (with the glove) hair off where the cream is applied, but it just isn&#x27;t effective enough to be considered hugely better than shaving or trimming.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well, very irritating</li>
            <li> I thought after reading (only the positive) reviews for this product it would do what it says. If you value your package guys, think twice! I bought it to give my husband a more smooth feeling than shaving and rue the day I did :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband had an extremely bad reaction to this product! It was not an all over reaction (hence patch testing wouldn&#x27;t give you a true irritant reading) but just in certain spots, no rhyme nor reason. It looks like he has 1st degree burns, bright red patches and some hair appears to be gone but not all, finally scabbing over after 2 days of weeping skin. Hoping there won&#x27;t be any scarring :( Definitely NOT a good product to use unless you want to be out of commission for at least a week. - One Unhappy Wife</li>
            <li> I am providing 4 star only because of the bare balm. Although it&#x27;s good, but Veet is better than this on any day, clean more deep and smoth. Obviously the calm balm is very good to have, it provides asoothing feeling and make the skin very soft. You can go for this pack only for this calm balm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great and you do have to leave it on for longer than the suggested time for the hair to actually come off.  But it eventually comes off.</li>
            <li> It was terribly painful with bleeding and ended up having to go to ER!!it was the worst thing ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Really well.  I was surprised that it got all the coarse hair from my nether regions. And inner thighs.  It doesn&#x27;t get completely baby butt bald though.  My first attempt, I had hair over half inch long. The area under my tummy where the happy trail is, was the area that didn&#x27;t get thoroughly smooth.  The rest, like the um.. sack was smooth and hairless. First run.  I was impressed.  So I ran a second attempt to get the happy trail area smooth and more hairless.  It only got marginally smoother.  And I burned my inner thigh a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to use.  Just cake on, hang out for 15 minutes.  And hop in the shower. Put the glove on and just wipe away.  The effects last about 2 weeks or so.  Then I did it again.  once.  And it got the whole area pretty smooth.  Again, the happy trail area was just...  not as smooth.  But for the record I have super thick hair down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product. The whole kit works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy your balls being on fire without relief for weeks, then I would suggest not using this product. It is like dipping you balls into lava. I am afraid they will never recover.</li>
            <li> My ballz are so smooth I can&#x27;t keep my heads off them I would send a pic to display how slick how aerodynamic they feel.... This is the best product ever when I kiss my girl I&#x27;m no longer choking on my own scrote ribbon that got lodged in her teeth&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This works great and in little time. Just have to be careful after application.  It stings for a few hours after I use it but the day after I feel fine.</li>
            <li> I like it! Why? Well, because it works. I have never had a problem with it&#x27;s effectiveness, any irritation and it does get the area I treat smooth. But in my quest for that perfect, no hassle solution I have tried a variety of hair removal products/techniques; shaving, creams, waxing (OUCH!) and recently a &amp;#34;Professional Hair Removal&amp;#34; product that was quite expensive but not to effective. So, I have completed my quest and from here on ballsBALM will remain my hair removal product. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, at a reasonable cost and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gag gift for friends birthday, he said it worked great. Said it was a great alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li> Works just like it&#x27;s advertised. I&#x27;ve used this product many times and other than a weird smell that the product leaves behind (that can be easily washed away with a pleasant smelling body soap) it&#x27;s perfect. I would reccommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It removes light hair well and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad! I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the name alone and said product works. Lather up as the directions on the tube indicate and be prepared for an oh so smooth experience that will have you wanting to don nothingness in the very near future. This product does NOT burn as a couple of other products out there very much do so do not be worried about that. Balls will have you smooth but not quite as smooth and groomed as your local hottie esthetician can provide. If you do not live in a big city like myself where its no problem to find a place specializing in man-grooming of the most delicate of areas then this product is for you. If you live in city where waxing services of this type are available keep going there as waxing provides a much better result.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. It burns the skin and smells awful. Still didn&#x27;t even work well for the hassle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Works exactly as it should. Also the fact that everything you need comes in the kit is incredibly nice and convenient. You have everything you need for a very reasonable price including a moisturizer/calming lotion. This is an incredibly effective and reasonably priced product. Just make sure you follow the instructions that come with it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> Nope, it did nothing for my body hair. I am a licensed professional and try every product on the market to see what does and does not work. This product did not bend my hair much less remove it.  I followed the directions the first time.  The second time I made some alterations with the thickness of the product; nothing I did made a difference...back to the razor</li>
            <li> The first question we have to ask is does it work? The answer is not so simple. It does remove hair, and for me at least the was only a slight stinging, nothing unbearable. The problem is that is that it&#x27;s neither more effective or easier than using a razor. I was left with small amounts of stubble everywhere I used it. I&#x27;ll probably just go back to a razor for the most part, with the exception that there are a couple places where I can&#x27;t use a razor with hurting myself, and I&#x27;ll keep this product around because even if it leaves stubble it works for those one or two difficult/sensitive places.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I have been using clippers and attempting shaving downstairs for years. I once tried a feminine depilatory cream and fried my sack resulting in my walking like a sumo wrestler for a week just to keep my legs from touching big Jim and the twins. I do have very sensitive skin especially under arms, behind my knees and in the nether region. I was very hesitant but the good reviews cleared my fears and I purchased. I did try a sample spot, as recommended, and when it successfully removed the hair with NO after effect, I was stoked! I didn&#x27;t wait the  24 hours they recommend. I waited about 5 minutes. I couldn&#x27;t wait 24 hours anticipating the excitement my wife would feel when she saw her favorite main course without a side of pubic hair (short or long)! This had been a request (subtle) of hers for quite some time and, as she is very thorough regarding keeping my favorite main course out of the bush, I couldn&#x27;t wait to step up to the plate and commit to better pubic management. I am as bald down there as I could ever have imagined without pain and suffering! Thank you Balls Balm. I did read the instructions carefully and allowed the balm to remain for 12 minutes prior to &amp;#34;Groping&amp;#34; in a luke warm shower. I also applied the Calm Balm right after drying off my beans and frank. I originally thought I would have to use half a bottle of the stuff however, I think I&#x27;ll be able to get at least half a dozen uses out of one bottle. Happy days ahead for me my friends!!</li>
            <li> This does the job!  I need to be able to find it again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the hoariest guy out there but also not a 12yr old-I&#x27;m a cyclist who shaves his legs in the summer&lt;br /&gt;That being said I ordered this off a recommendation from a friend who loved it to groom the Bits and some on my back.&lt;br /&gt;Had experience with veet and nair that I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good at reading and following directions so I figured this would be easy .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a two person job&lt;br /&gt;Apparently my balls are sensitive and burned- I only had it on 10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;My back is the worst though - it really feels like a bad sun burn and is broken out over most of it but in one spot in particular.&lt;br /&gt;It says to use a thin layer but that didn&#x27;t prove effective enough- you should lay it on a lil thicker if you don&#x27;t want patches removed&lt;br /&gt;The calming balm works ok but nothing but time will make the bad spot go away&lt;br /&gt;As an update my enamored friend is not so enamored himself anymore-based on his on experience&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s gone back to a razor&lt;br /&gt;I guess I just expected too much and as per usual things are usually too good to be true&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day it&#x27;s a chemical that burns off hair&lt;br /&gt;On a better note it smells better than most!</li>
            <li> So I am pretty sure I&#x27;ve been confused with Bigfoot, I am a very hairy fella and trimming was becoming a hassle so I was trying to find a solution that will allow me to get rid of hair easily as well as something that will leave my skin feeling nice and smooth. This is the perfect solution, I love this depilatory cream as well as the lotion. The first time I used this, I was so excited that I did not test any part of my body, I went right to my manly area (this is NOT recommended please don&#x27;t be stupid, and test somewhere safe!) I applied some cream, waited exactly 12 minutes, luckily nothing burned the only thing I felt was a warm sensation that actually felt nice, I then washed off the cream with the glove it did take some time to get rid of the hairs. But once I scrubbed the area, it was silky smooth! I loved how it felt to be smooth again!! I then used the lotion and it helped the area feel refreshed. I love this product I really recommend this for the hairy guys out there, you can use this anywhere you want! You will want to use it about 2-3 times a week if you want to be really smooth. The only downside is that it does smell kind of funny when you are applying it but nothing too strong, also the glove isn&#x27;t super effective I recommend buying an exfoliating scrubbing tool to get all the hairs and it does get messy sometimes but its a GREAT product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works magic! I used it for the first time today and really didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be anywhere near as good as it is. All you have to do is follow the directions and in under 17 minutes your balls will be baby soft.</li>
            <li> This product takes the hair away, but if used in accordance with the instructions, the after lotion prevents those nasty hair removal rashes.  Do us all a favor and keep the shrubs low before you wear those skimpy trunks to the beach!</li>
            <li> This product is A-MAZ-ING.  Performs exactly as advertised, delivering results beyond what a razor could ever do to sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, specifically the groinal man-region.  Completely clean, pain free, simple and done in 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This product works! With that being said, spacing out the applications at least a week our more will prevent you from feeling pain. The first application worked well, the second burned my skin after waiting 24 hours. I found use every other week and by the month end you will likely be hair free in all your regions where applied.</li>
            <li> Yep, I did not heed the warnings left by previous reviewers and tried this stuff out.  Initially on my stomach to test.  It did irritate the skin ever so mildly but no more than a razor did.  The Calm Balm was a nice touch and seemed to help.  However, the results weren&#x27;t any better than shaving with a razor so slightly disappointed.  A week later, like a moron, I decided that testing it on my under carriage would be a good idea.  Like the title says I&#x27;m on my laptop writing this review in front of a fan blowing my junk because it&#x27;s the only relief at the moment.  I left the Bare Balm on for 9 minutes and hopped into the shower because I wanted to make sure to rinse prior to the recommended time of 10 minutes.  The hair did remove but it took a little scrubbing with the glove which turned into a sand paper feeling after a few seconds.  From there I removed the glove and proceeded to rinse as much of the balm off me as possible.  I jumped out of the shower and immediately applied the Calm Balm which may have made it worse!  So for about 5 minutes my balls were ON FIRE!  I leaped back into the shower and rinsed the Calm Balm from my balls and now I sit...in front of a fan....&lt;br /&gt;I was warned by those before me to not use this product.  Please heed my warning also.  I CANNOT recommend  anyone use this product!</li>
            <li> First, the reason I&#x27;m writing this review is because I know that when I was looking into trying this Balls Balm product for the first time, I wanted to find a thorough review of both the pros and cons of the product, something that explained in fairly good detail what I could expect before taking the risk for myself. (And yes, smearing some unknown product on your private parts is indeed taking a risk.) So here goes nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patience is key. You don&#x27;t want to go nuts with the stuff right out of the chute. Rather, you want to do just a small patch, just to get a feel for the stuff and how it works for you. Its a rather thick cream, similar, frankly, to Colgate toothpaste. It exits the hole in the bottle like one might write a name with icing on a cake. True, it has a smell, but by no means did I find it obnoxious at all. It&#x27;s a chemical after all, but it&#x27;s very far from reminding you it&#x27;s a chemical by its smell. (However, no, I didn&#x27;t stick it up my nose either!) Continuing, so all you do for that first run is dab some on and gently smear the small chosen area (1 sq inch or so should do fine) such that there is a light white color covering the area -- you don&#x27;t really need much of the stuff at all, not even when you&#x27;re ready to go for it. Lastly on this point, I&#x27;d also recommend hitting the area with an electric mustache shaver, such that the hair is down to around an eighth of an inch, as it makes things easier for you in determining if the product will or will not be suitable for you in that area. Then, finally, start out with, say, nine minutes on. Just let it sit there. If it begins to burn after a few minutes, then wash it off within the next minute or so, but don&#x27;t scrub!, as it&#x27;s either been on too long, or, worse, your skin is too sensitive for it in your chosen area. If you have no burn within nine minutes, then hop in the shower and (the term they use) grope off the hair. The way the product seemed to work for me (my girlfriend and I are in debate over this part) is it might open the hairs&#x27; pores (I&#x27;m no dermatologist understand) such that, unlike the normal reaction, you can literally pull out the hair leaving bare skin behind. Seriously, I&#x27;d rinsed off the stuff while doing the grope thing, and after all traces of the stuff were gone, I still had a few hairs but could easily just pick them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the moment of truth. Leave the shower, dry off, and then compare the small area you chose against the nearby untouched region. You should have no issues with burning at all (this was MY experience!) Rather, it should be very obvious that you&#x27;d used the product in that particular spot. Remember how I started this: patience is the key to this stuff. You must be willing to test the various areas, first. Just because you&#x27;re good to go for nine minutes plus (it takes time to shower the stuff off, right?) minutes in one area, you may not be good to go for nine minutes plus in another -- this was also my experience. For my first experimental area run, I chose a spot that could easily be seen with a mirror. I chose a small area in the upper pubic region, above the private parts and below the belt line. Then, if all was good to go with the test area, I recommend that you can move towards the whole region, doing it just like you did for the test. Just repeat your test but using a larger area this time. But don&#x27;t get too confident! Just because it worked fine over that region, it does not mean you can just go nuts with the stuff. No, you need to determine what conditions you need for what areas, first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been successful with the pubic region, I let things go for a day or so, so as to compare my results vs a razor (which I did do once or twice in the past.) Perhaps you&#x27;ll have better results than I, for if you&#x27;re still reading, you&#x27;ll notice I did not use the soothing gel part of the kit, as I didn&#x27;t see any need. (The stuff worked fine. Why use the the other stuff after perfect?) My girlfriendsays had I used the gel, I would not have experienced the usual \\&quot;razor bumps.\\&quot; Once again, we&#x27;re in debate, for as I see it, the razor bumps are just how I react when my pores aren&#x27;t 100% clear. Anyway, so I just dealt with the bumps and the itch a day or so following and just didn&#x27;t scratch except when in the shower and with burning hot water flooding the area (which acts to open the pores.) Following this initial what I&#x27;d consider successful test, I just had to go further, and that&#x27;s when I learned, as I&#x27;ve been saying, that patience, experiment, is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I tried this stuff in the first place was because my girlfriend found it on the web and wanted to use it. Me being me, I liked the idea but also I didn&#x27;t want to see her having a bad experience. So I decided to try it, first.  Well, having been successful with my first experiments, and having a clue of how much time was needed (for the prior region that is,) I proceeded to move further down. As this is Amazon, a public place, I&#x27;ll censor things a little and say I didn&#x27;t go all the way down and leave the store. Rather, I just stayed in the produce section. However, this time I was impatient. I figured even if something did happen that I could survive it. True, I did survive it, and it wasn&#x27;t awfully painful, but I did find 1) I needed to reduce the time to around six minutes or so (and then add the shower time,) not ten!, and 2) watch the groping, because you can and will produce raw spots if you&#x27;re too vigorous with the cloth. (Oh yeah, I forgot. I used a washcloth throughout -- the product was meant for my girlfriend, recall? She hates Nair and shaving went looking elsewhere for a solution. I couldn&#x27;t use up her product. That&#x27;d be wrong.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results, having gone lower, once I got past that initial missing skin/raw issue (in spots -- and it was MY fault -- I can&#x27;t blame the product,) were amazing! The hair just pulled out a day or so prior (I had to heal from my mistake, understand) and was gone! My only sensitivity was, well, I had a new feeling without hair, there, where there&#x27;d always been hair, before. At this point in my experimentation I now felt comfortable with the idea of traveling down further and leaving the store, but I&#x27;d run out of time and decided to wait a week or so. Now here it is weeks following my initial test, I&#x27;ve not redone anything in the pubic region (just have used mustache trimmer for touch up,) but I have indeed exited the store. Having learned my lesson with experiment two, I now find that around six minutes is all I need prior to jumping in the shower. If you are looking for bare, then this is your product! But I can&#x27;t stress enough the need for patience and experiment throughout the process. If you go all gung ho and just start smearing it all over yourself after, maybe, a small test, then don&#x27;t be surprised when you find yourself wishing you hadn&#x27;t done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product. I highly recommend it for those who have the patience to learn more about their personal sensitivities. And I&#x27;ll close by saying that I did experience one area where I absolutely cannot use the product. Therefore, don&#x27;t expect you won&#x27;t discover you have over sensitive areas as well. The product is all about patience, first. I hope you&#x27;ve liked my review.</li>
            <li> I used the product according to the directions and not a hair was moved.  The lotion one was fine and covered the smell the first one left.  The smell was no stronger then any others I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ll give it another try in a couple days but so far it was a failure and a waste.</li>
            <li> So my buddies and I were out drinking one night and came across a convo involving shaving your balls, which then caused us to search products on Amazon. Before we knew it, two of us had ordered up some balls balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eagerly awaited the product wondering for days ..... \\&quot;Will my balls finally be smooth? Will I have to stop worrying about being a nervous wreck as I take shaving cream and a razor to my balls? How will my balls react to their new glory of a smooth life?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package was very discreet and didn&#x27;t say balls balm or anything so your neighbors won&#x27;t think you are some kind of pornstar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside, you will find a giant bottle of balls balm, some balls cooling cream, a popsicle stick, and a knitted glove called \\&quot;The Bearpaw\\&quot;. So here&#x27;s the deal, test the cream on a section of leg or something just to make sure you don&#x27;t have some crazy reaction to it. You wouldn&#x27;t want your balls to swell up and look like fireants decided to invade your crotch. Once all systems are go, just generously cake the stuff onto your balls. make sure you get the cream on the skin, right at the root of your hair. Let it sit for the recommended time.... I think 15 minutes or so. I recommend having a good book or magazine to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it is time, just get in the shower and wash it off, using the bear paw to massage it out. (This was the weirdest part to me and I only used the bear paw once.) Wash it off and you are good to go. Air dry your balls, for maximum effect as you will immediately tell the difference with that fresh clean are whisking across your bare smooth ball sack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t shower with soap right away. Use the cooling cream and apply it generously to your balls and let them recover and dry off. Keep your balls away from salt, lemon, alcohol for at least an hour until your pores close back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go out and walk around the house naked slapping your fresh new balls around. Just have a talk with your balls first and let them know how much attention they will get soon. They need to be prepared for their new life of fame with attention galore.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, 1st I showered ,2nd I applied, 3rd was the Groping of the nuts. Next thing I know they are as Bald as Walnuts! Wonderful and my girl loves the feel!! Thanks Balls Balm!</li>
            <li> If you routinely \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; (I hate that word), you want to try this product.  I like to keep things clean and neat down there, but not bare all the way....I used the Bare Pair on my boys about a month ago.  It was simple to use, and following the directions, it worked well.  Took all off my boys.  And I haven&#x27;t had to use it since.  Coupled with a good trimmer like the Bodygroomer [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]]for trimming up the rest of the forest, this is a great way to get the look (and feel) you want.  It did sting a little, but not much.  Obviously if you have sensitive skin, try a small sample first.  The \\&quot;calm balm\\&quot; feels wonderful after using the \\&quot;bare balm.\\&quot;  In fact, the Calm Balm feels so good that I use it routinely after showering.  I didn&#x27;t try the Bare Pair on any other body area, as I don&#x27;t need/want to.  I wish the labeling was a little more discreet.  Having a tube of lotion that screams BALLS isn&#x27;t always something you want on display in your shower or medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> I think I have tried them all and found bare balls to be the best out there. No burning or irritation. If you have tired it you are missing out.</li>
            <li> It did the job as described. It took the hair off of my gorilla-like back and shoulders. But I left it on there too long, and it gave me a pretty good burn. The salve helps, but it&#x27;s going to be tender for a while. This was my first real experience using a chemical hair remover, and all I can say to the people reading this is read the instructions. Make sure you do try after 7-8 minutes and see if it&#x27;s already done the job. I did about 11-12 and it wasn&#x27;t the smartest move I&#x27;ve done this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it came in a plain cardboard box, and didn&#x27;t have \\&quot;BALLS\\&quot; splashed all over it. At least it would have given the mail carrier a smile.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected without an sort of burning or discomfort. I love this stuff. Follow the directions and I think it is worth a trip to their web site for additional tips, but otherwise in 12-15 min you are bald down there! Easy and fast.</li>
            <li> this is a great product worked very well only took about 6 minutes and wiped right off, and the cooling balm worked very well also, I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Smooth less fuzzy balls just the way I like mine...working construction all day and not really a fan of excess body hair especially the areas I just don&#x27;t understand way evolution went there but any way...application is somewhat messy but take your time peel, rub, and smooth, shiny (ok not shiny) but less fuzzy balls.  Some tenderness but rub the soothing balm and your good.</li>
            <li> A lot of people said that it burnt their skin and such but I&#x27;ve had no such problems yet. I wanted to test the strength of this product so I chose not to shave the ugly for awhile. I&#x27;ve always had thick hair but it was no match for the cream. Left it on for about 13 min on the area above the ol tube snake and it did what it was supposed to. Left a little bit of stubble but i plan on putting another coat on tomorrow. The sample patch i put on the fun bag didn&#x27;t even burn at all. Have yet to try the back door but not sure how i feel about that. Anyways, if your tired of cutting your junk with trimmers i would recommend this product.Unless of course your skin is sensitive then probably should steer clear.</li>
            <li> Used on a few spots on my back and it worked great except I left it on a lil too long and had some burning in a few spots.  The burn went away after 2 days tho so no big deal.  Then tried on ma balls and general groin area and it worked great as well.  Left it on between 7 and 10 minutes and it all came away clean.  30 minutes later my balls were on fire.  Not sure if i rubbed too hard getting the hair off or what.  Or if next time I just need to not leave it on so long.  Maybe try 5 to 7 minutes instead.  Once I do that i&#x27;ll amend my review accordingly.</li>
            <li> We were trying to find an alternative to having my boyfriend shave his b@lls.  I have been using Nair for years, with positive, un remarkable results.  We was hoping for the same awesome results.  Only what happened, is legitimate 1st degree burns, on the b@lls. I honestly can not believe that this product is still for sale, after reading all the terrible reviews, (should have read those first). We were tricked my the packaging. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Was excited to get this so that I could use it on \\&quot;the boys\\&quot; instead of shaving all of the time.  I&#x27;m not going to deny that this doesn&#x27;t work, because it does, HOWEVER...how they can say this has a &#x27;mouth-watering smell&#x27; is beyond me, it smells just like NAIR, and that&#x27;s not at all mouth-watering. And the smell does NOT go away, it&#x27;s been a solid 8 hrs since I used this, and I can still smell it on me, and using the \\&quot;CalmBalm\\&quot; on your nuts...just leaves them feeling greasy and doesn&#x27;t mask the smell of the product.  I&#x27;ll continue using it and see if I can find a solution to the smeel - but I would NOT recommend using it on a day when you plan on going out clubbing or whatever the same night, especially if you plan on...or try to hook up...not sure I&#x27;d like anyone putting their face in my crotch and having to explain the smell, of course - if they don&#x27;t ask, and just do their job, guess it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem :-p</li>
            <li> Ok I got this item in hopes it would work AND it says you can should be able to use it about every two to three weeks. First of all I could not leave it on for the 13 minutes it says you could -it burnt to much. It DOES take the hair away but I would suggest that you do try a patch to see how long is long enough. I was disappointed that the hair grew back so quickly. That is why I gave it three stars. You are burning your hair off with chemicals to begin with who would want to do that every week?? I do not recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I swim every day and can&#x27;t stand having body hair.  I tried everything till I found balls balm... Never looking back.  Works perfectly, and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> This is pretty great stuff. I have super sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t manage to burn me at all with a 20 min application. It&#x27;s not going to get every little hair on the first application so don&#x27;t expect it too. But if you do it twice or three times over a few days then you&#x27;ll be pretty smooth. I&#x27;m part ape so my chest/stomach/downstairs/butt are disgustingly hairy; this product makes it so I don&#x27;t have to be self conscious about showing off those parts. Of course you&#x27;ll get a better result with shaving but that takes way to much time and effort. And if you&#x27;re like me you will get horrible hideous razor burn on the areas you try to shave. This leaves no redness or razor burn. I might be crazy but I feel like the hair grows in slower and less thick. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and that seems to be the result. O and the smell it pretty nice actually. I&#x27;ve tried Nair and Veet as well but those smell like a burning plastic chemical death. Best chemical hair removal I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be a porn star since I was little but it did not pan out.  So I still can keep it like it would be.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Did it&#x27;s job just felt a tinglingy feeling but did good removed her in 10 min . Will buy again .</li>
            <li> Worked great for me; I leave it on for up to 20 minutes while reading,and never had any burning problems. It has a chemically odor, noticeable but not nasty.  I just wish that Amazon sold just the Balls without the Calm.  I never use the calm.</li>
            <li> Well, this is interesting stuff. It works, and my balls were not on fire afterwards, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried. My only warning is DO NOT put this stuff on any skin that is even SLIGHTLY chaffed or irritated/raw. You will suffer. On healthy skin (like they fairly warn on the packaging) it was no problem.</li>
            <li> following the directions minus a minute resulted in quite a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The so called soothing cooling balm just increased the pain.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok not better not worse than any other hair remover but however the smell was nice...so if you like the price buy it.</li>
            <li> I know its says to test drive first then go all out but still i feel i shouldnt of had to. Nair for men didnt make my balls swell... nor did it give me rashes, but when i used it on my less sensative spots it worked great. FYI if you feel the warmth of it when applying to your genitals take off imediatly....</li>
            <li> I have used many time of hair removal items in the past, this is the most effective and gentle product i have yet to use.  This is an awesome combination with the calm balm included in the package.  I highly reccomend!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. It worked just as advertised, removing all the hair in minutes. Didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, and the Calm Balm was nice and soothing!</li>
            <li> Overall, satisfied customer.  Used as directed, the product works well to get rid of 80-90% on the first application. I had no burning and skin felt great afterwards.  The application was difficult.  I think a nozzle like a calking gun would help a bunch.  The directions require you to get in between the hair follicles and spread.  This is tough with the tube design.</li>
            <li> At first I was wary of using a removal cream, due to a bad reaction to another brand years ago, but after giving it a try I am more than happy with The Bare Pair.</li>
            <li> First, I would have given this five stars, but for the small size. The product works great. I was afraid that I would have to first debraid and remove my corn rows, but not true. Just let it soak some and everything comes off. So why four stars? Just not enough product to cover both balls. I just order a couple each time to give me enough for full coverage. Also, I have been told that it leaves a funny taste even after you have washed a while, so take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my second solution of Balls hair removal product for men.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3-4 months now.  Before using Balls I was shaving my man region.  Each time however left me generally scared for the two berries hanging below.  After hearing about this from a friend, I decided to give it a try.  I left the applicant on for 10-12min each time(recommended 7minutes) because my hair is a bit course and stubborn.  I&#x27;d then get in the shower and the water would wash off the majority of the hair.  A dry rag could then be used to remove any of the hair that was still on your stick and balls, lol.  The glove is a nice addition but it loses the roughness of the material it&#x27;s made from.  But hey..when it does you still have a glove.  The cooling balm is helpful whether or not you use the actual hair removal product.  It&#x27;s cool and refreshing and makes your junk smell good!!&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, if you leave the product on for too long(depends on the person) you will get that burning sensation.  It&#x27;s not bad and you do eventually get used to it.  The cooling balm also helps out greatly! The first time you try this product, and unless you&#x27;ve tried other hair removal products as well, you&#x27;ll again notice that burning sensation.  It&#x27;s by no means painful at all.  More of a notification that you&#x27;ve put something on your balls/pubic region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product as it&#x27;s easy to use and wonderful.  The little applicator sticks that are included are great for evening out the solution on your body as well.  +5 starts!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair management products which were all unsatisfactory. The Bare Pair management is as completes as it gets. No irritating smell, haven&#x27;t had any burns (i would say I have a medium sensitive skin). Its also easy to use(even though I dont use the glove sometimes). The calm balm also does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does the trick with hair removal. The company has a great sense of humor (just read the tube it comes in). I leave it on for about 5 minutes more than they say. There is no irritation afterwards. There is a slight order for about an 1 hour or so. Use this once a week to keep things groomed. The woman really enjoy this on guys. Buy this product and get great results.</li>
            <li> This product gave me the scrotum of a porn star, and my wife absolutely loves it.  Highly recommend, gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Just like other hair removal products.....it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this product it does exactly what you guys say it does and it leaves my huevos nice and smooth. I will definitely be buying more of this product I just wish it came in a larger bottle. I certainly recommend anyone to buy this product and I will be telling my friends. Even my wife is asking if she can use this product for her lady parts. Hmmmmm I&#x27;ll think about it but right now it&#x27;s all mine!</li>
            <li> Used this product once and it worked okay, although I didn&#x27;t get to close to the sensitive areas. Working up the courage to use it on the boys and other groin area.  Hopefully will report with good news.</li>
            <li> this product worked affectively&lt;br /&gt;i would suggest this. it doesnt smell so good though so extra body wash was needed afterwards</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so take it for what it is. Had no issues with it burning my skin did an acceptable job at removing hair a razor is still needed to clean up any small patch&#x27;s left over but no big deal</li>
            <li> Well, the product works. It does, indeed, remove hair. But I don&#x27;t see the real benefits vs the risks. I&#x27;ve used the product three times exactly as the directions say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First application, I read the negative reviews about burns, so I applied a small amount to the &amp;#34;area.&amp;#34; Nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, applied a larger amount, still no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third application, there were... Results... I applied a generous amount, waited the recommended time for &amp;#34;sensitive skin,&amp;#34; and all was going well. Hair was disappearing. But, Jesus, the balls are experiencing a chemical burn that was nothing short of hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works, but I won&#x27;t apply anywhere below the pubic area. Too risky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very hairy, but I do has coarse hair. I tried this stuff on my chest and abs because I was tired of shaving. This stuff says it works on anything south of your neck, but after twenty minutes, it didn&#x27;t even dent the stubble. Instead it irritated my skin, I look like I slept in a pile of fire ants. I followed the instructions, this stuff simply doesn&#x27;t work on coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only want something for your balls, this stuff should do fine. Any other area, stick to shaving, pay some one to wax it, or buy yourself an epilator.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it would burn, but it does not. Works well, takes about 10 minutes. Includes enough to apply at least 10 or 15 times.</li>
            <li> So the instructions say to let your balls air out and get a weee bit chilly so they \\&quot;go tight against your dong\\&quot;... Well mine always hang low so I found that gooping them up using my hand nice and thick did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use a washcloth or the &#x27;exfoliating glove&#x27; included, as the hair will nit just rinse away it needs a gentle rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use cooler water, the boys are sensitive after while in the shower, but once I applied the white tube... Man they felt soft.  I went to sleep and woke up with zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re adventurous use a finger to schmear just a streak from your taint up into the crack...  Right between the cheeks.  It keepa things clean all day and the guys at the gym are never the wiser.</li>
            <li> So, as one who has waxed &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;, as well as my back and chest area, I think this is a reasonable - and more cost effective - option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks:  Not as effective as waxing - as you&#x27;ll still have stubble in just a few days.  Also, do NOT exceed the recommended times for treatment.  Otherwise, you can expect some nasty burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider:  How hairy ARE you?  I am fair-skinned and more on the light-haired end of the spectrum.  If you are very dark haired and very hairy, your results may not be as good as were mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, easy clean up.  Read &amp; follow the directions!!!</li>
            <li> I think my skin is just too sensitive for this product.  I ended up with slight chemical burns which took a few days of Neosporin to bring under control.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff that I have ever found its amazing, it does not have a bad smell to it. And only take about 10 minutes to complete the hair removely. I give it 5 stars. Wish I would have found it earlier.</li>
            <li> It worked great for me, my partner had to cover x2 in order for it to work overall a great set for the price</li>
            <li> Big chubby guy here who loves to keep himself smooth and manscaped.&lt;br /&gt;As a big guy using a razor can be a bit challenging and irritating, however thanks to this product I can get all my hair downstairs without having to worry about cutting myself (which has happened before)&lt;br /&gt;I did receive very small chemical burn on my inner thighs, however with the ballsBALM it cleared it up and numbed the stinging sensation. Does what it says well worth the bang for the buck, and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions to a T, however after 10 minutes I used the glove to remove the hair and I had a chemical burn all over my boys! Its not the lotion that removes the hair it the glove! Its the same sensation as being waxed as it just pulls the hair out! I would never recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. If I has known this was around a long time ago I would have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions, it&#x27;ll work great for you. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t use it on any genitalia, I&#x27;ve only used it on my rear end, but thus far after two applications it&#x27;s worked great and I&#x27;m smooth as can be. I can&#x27;t stress enough that you should preform a spot test first and wait a FULL 24 HOURS. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll regret. Be patient. It&#x27;s a great product as long as you FOLLOW the directions. Also, trimming the hairs down first is a huge help. Most definitely will buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li> As you can probably tell by the title. This stuff just works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been this smooth, this quickly WITHOUT having some sort of burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue what they put in this stuff and the moisturizer that comes with it but in the span of a few minutes i went from that gorilla in the ridiculous product picture to the confident looking young male on the bed in the other picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All hyperbole aside though, i can&#x27;t help but recommend this product to any hairy guy out there. This product is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one beef i have is that they didn&#x27;t include a few more of those exfoliating gloves, i would have gladly paid a buck or two more if they put in a few extra gloves.</li>
            <li> I have used topical hair removal products in the past that haven&#x27;t been as effective as they claim. And with the mixed reviews for this (with some people saying it works while others say it doesn&#x27;t) I decided to give it a shot. I first trimmed the hair very short with a trimmer and then applied this \\&quot;down south\\&quot; and waited even a little past the maximum time listed on the bottle. I felt no irritation whatsoever. At first the smell was sort of bad, however I quickly got used to it. It smells sort of like that smell in a hair salon. Anyway, after waiting the allotted time, I took a warm shower. The included glove really helped with wiping the stuff off in the shower. When I got out I was nice and smooth. There were some hairs left behind that required a second thinner application to remove (my hair is thicker, so I feel like that may have contributed to that fact) however overall I was impressed. I then applied the included moisturizer. That stuff is pretty good. I even use the moisturizer after shaving my face because it doesn&#x27;t remain all sticky like some other lotions/moisturizers. If they sold that alone, then I&#x27;d buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it works better than stuff like Nair and it actually was not harsh on my skin at all (as they claim). I probably could&#x27;ve left the stuff on for an hour and still not felt any irritation.</li>
            <li> Putting on the dipilatory with the stick makes its use nice and easy.  I find unlike old time dipilatories, it does not have a bad odor.  Using it on your scrotum and shaft as well as other pubic hair is easy and gentle.  There is no pain and it leaves your scrotum and shaft hairless and smooth.  The glove makes it easy to remove in the shower.  Using the blam afterward deals with any possible pain, and the blam spreads easily so only a little is needed.  If you want smooth skin down there, this is a nice solution.</li>
            <li> It makes your balls red hot and feel like it going to fall off, I through the rest of it away</li>
            <li> I have seen a few bad reviews for this product. My prediction is that those reviews were written by people who have never tried depilatories before and were expecting a lotion that you just put on and take off and you won&#x27;t feel anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the amount of hair that this product took off my skin, it was well worth the very limited irritation. To be more clear, you will feel a slight bit of irritation while the product is on your skin. This feels like a warm tingling/stinging sensation which I can only describe as being similar to dipping your balls in to water that is slightly hotter than comfort level. After putting on the after balm though the irritation went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review about 12 hours after I applied the product and I feel nothing down there except the awesome feeling of smooth balls. Great product. I may be a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> Worked great. No itchin or rash. Took all the hair off with one application. No mess, although I used a wash cloth instead of the glove.</li>
            <li> So I order ballsbalm months back. I tried it the day I received it, and it seemed to work decent. Hair grew back within days (which is usual for me) no biggie. Well I attempted it again tonight. Left it on for 9 mins. Not even the max time. I hopped in the shower to rinse off and the washcloth took off the hair... AND my skin! I have a severe chemical burn from it. I am not sure exactly what happened, but it is painful.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical thinking that some of these 5 start reviews were &amp;#34;planted&amp;#34;, but i went ahead and tried the product.  I don&#x27;t have the thickest hair, so I&#x27;m not surprised if it doesn&#x27;t work well for others on here.  Minimal irritation if you use the lotion provided.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> this story was inspired by true events...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i follow the instructs, leave it on the exact amount of time, hop in the shower and start \\&quot;groping\\&quot; myself. first warning flag pops up... pain in my \\&quot;bat wing\\&quot;. i figure... \\&quot;ok directions said grope the hair off not rub it off. look at the glove... second warning flag... red spot(tiny amount of blood. i figure... \\&quot;ok this isnt a regular groping session... stop being so rough.\\&quot; now im just trying to get the stuff off my boys. washed and dryed off and noticed ofew hairs remaining. pulled them and they disintegrated in my hand. i figure... \\&quot;ok thats a bad sign.\\&quot; so i go for the calm balm. lather up and it kinda burns. i figure... \\&quot;ok itll probably feel better in a few minutes.\\&quot; which it does. i forget about it for a while and watch some naruto. i decide to shove my hand in my pants and cup my balls. i get to my balls and feel the painful sensation tearing off a band aid. my balls had begun to swallow up and fuze with my underwear like the blob. i figure... \\&quot;OK I OFFICIALLY MADE A MISTAKE!!!\\&quot; the pain now is worse than before. i make a run for the calm balm. after closer inspection my ballsack is all \\&quot;skin-flakey\\&quot; and shit. i figure... \\&quot;ok this shit is the kind of stuff where if you rubbed it on an iguana hed turn into godzilla.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does the product get rid of the hair? yes. is it worth it? hell no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: i dibs the nickname \\&quot;the blob\\&quot; for my ballsack.</li>
            <li> Finally a product men can use and it delivers great results. It efficiently remove the hair while being gentle on your most delicate skin, what else can a man wish?</li>
            <li> Balls Balm is the best hair removal product on the market period!  It is easy to use and pain free!  And the price you cant beat!</li>
            <li> Didnt work that great for us</li>
            <li> Product does not work as stated by manufacture.  Was a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well. Make sure you follow the instructions and you&#x27;ll be hairless in about 20 minutes. While it doesn&#x27;t get it all unless you&#x27;re very careful about applying it, it does an incredible job at removing what it covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it smells HORRIBLE!! Like why is there no fragrance? Even something natural would help it. I suppose that&#x27;s a small price to pay for smooth balls.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product was ok I tested it like you are directed it was ok as soon as I applied it to down there we had a problem it burnt me up good 3 days later I can barely walk without it hurting still I would not tell anyone touse this product ever</li>
            <li> The great thing about this product is that it does the job its intended to do without reducing you to a blubbering pile of quivering jello laying upon the ground in a fetal position.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there may be some irritation but the included after-lotion does a good job of taming that.  I found that leaving the product on for at least 10 minutes was necessary for the coarser hair, and then combining that with a light shave in the shower, the skin comes out smooth without the irriation and nasty bumps that shaving would give alone.  The other products that i&#x27;ve tried, well, I think the government could use them as a replacement for waterboarding.  Burning and God help you if you managed to accidentally get some on a more sensitive area because there was nothing else on this earth that could.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cursed with back hair. I&#x27;ve tried many products and have had mixed results. Barebalm is probably the best one I have used but it&#x27;s not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave a rash and I&#x27;ve incurred only a few ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The hair doesn&#x27;t come back for about 2-3 weeks, most everything else I&#x27;ve used last&#x27;s a week.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well on the boy parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is too thick. It has almost like a sand consistency. A lighter version would work so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair. Granted, it will remove about 80% with one application but a second application is usually necessary to get the rest.</li>
            <li> Follow the detections (which are pretty funny) and DO use the &amp;#34;calm balm&amp;#34; NOT just any lotion. That said this stuff work and works well. No fuss and 3day&#x27;s minimum -to- a little over a week max before hair started coming back in. Also, regrowth was softer(than shave stubble, not normal).</li>
            <li> I will be staying with the Nair, very ineffective no matter how long left on. Used the contents in 2 different applications and still did not work as described</li>
            <li> When I first bought it, I was actually excited to use it, based on what the product promised (removes hair easily with no shaving required, dulls out the thickness of future hair growth and most importantly, safe for your privates). At first, it worked well for my chest and belly and I followed every step in the instructions on the back. Though it had a mild burn sensation, but as it promised in removing hair easily, so far, so good. But when I came to my privates, it was a different story. Again, I followed the instructions carefully, as to when to put the cream, how long the cream stays in the area and how to remove it. Within the very time limit, it already started to burn (although still tolerable). I slowly removed the cream and suddenly, the heat started to get worse, in which I applied the special after shave balm it provide. But somehow, it made the burning sensation exacerbate to the point of agony and fear. It felt like every pore in the skin of my very scrotum was pierced (inch deep) by yellow hot sowing needles. I was very close to call 911, since the burning lasted for a long time. Swollen red with bloody patches of raw skin. I went to the doctor to see if it didn&#x27;t affected my fertility (that&#x27;s how painful it was). But here&#x27;s the worst part, not only did the hair grew thicker and darker as ever, there were areas that originally didn&#x27;t have that much hair until it was touched by the cream (I kid you not). I don&#x27;t know who is giving 5 stars to this product, but all I can say is that scammers and sleazy money grabbers will do anything to sell their crap, even shamelessly impersonate as a customer.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Just be careful if you have eczema... will cause some major irritation.</li>
            <li> Works to perfection. If you have never tried using stuff on your package do not be afraid with this product. I use it front and back to clear it all up. Perfected</li>
            <li> Gets my balls and shaft nice and smooth. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The reviews on this product all seem pretty correct. This hair removal system does work but it is not for sensitive skin as it will cause redness and leave a burning feeling. Proceed with caution but know that that it will remove hair.</li>
            <li> So I came across this while searching for a Nair bikini line product and I have to say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. This product doesn&#x27;t have that heavy chemical smell like other depilatory creams and it comes with this AMAZING lotion for after use. There are only two downers about this product. The glove should be made more of a loofa material, instead it&#x27;s more like cotton and I don&#x27;t think it  is as effective and the product has to stay on for 10 to 14 minutes.</li>
            <li> These are a legit product, Guys you should buy these instead of trying to use a razor.</li>
            <li> Well, after much mental debating, I finally decided to give this product a go. I&#x27;ll just cut to the chase - I used it on my balls and my chest. I wanted to get the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balls:&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it worked flawlessly. Hair was removed just fine. No irritation, although, I was scared s***ess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chest:&lt;br /&gt;Not as good. I have a lot more hair on my chest and it seemed the cream had a tougher time here. Most of the hair was removed, but there were still quite a few that were not. So, I did round two a few days later. Same result. I ended up having to shave off the remaining hairs.</li>
            <li> These are great items that accomplish what they state they will do!&lt;br /&gt;You receive exactly what you are looking for, and it&#x27;s a great value as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Ship1990@aol.vom</li>
            <li> Product works like it says it should and have ordered again and great service as well. And will continue ordering unless product quits selling.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time last night, expected to be disappointed by it,  but it actually works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I started off with the smaller bottle just to see how I like it. I was skeptical cuz of the negative reviews but it works GREAT. No pain or nothing. Smell isn&#x27;t bad either. To me Nair smells much worse. This will be the product I will be using for now on!</li>
            <li> I got this product to have &#x27;my down stairs&#x27; hairless because of my tattoo. The product did clean it up but i had some problems. how I&#x27;m going to list the positives and negatives of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive- easy instructions, got all the parts u need for it (no additional purchase), easy to use, not many parts to the purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives- it gave me a burning sensation on my balls, it made me bleed a bit, my hair grew back as if i shaved and it didnt get rid of ALL just 90% of it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so in the end make ur decision based on this. oh btw I&#x27;m pretty tolerant to pain.</li>
            <li> Okay for body hair not recommended for use on balls!</li>
            <li> OUCH.  Worked but took two days for the bleeding to stop.</li>
            <li> balls as smooth as the day i was born</li>
            <li> i had never used a chemical hair remover before, so i was apprehensive... (i&#x27;ll just refer to balls balm as \\&quot;the balm\\&quot;) the balm came in an unsuspecting, brown, envelope, so that&#x27;s a plus. It actually comes with two applicator sticks that work great, as well as the advertised contents. as long as you follow the instructions, everything should go fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros!:&lt;br /&gt;comes in normal packaging.&lt;br /&gt;it works.&lt;br /&gt;the soothing solution feels great after the other solution.&lt;br /&gt;no permanent evidence, well, it&#x27;s been about a week...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons...:&lt;br /&gt;the mitt does chafe a good bit, so go easy with the scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;the smell is unpleasant, but bearable.&lt;br /&gt;i will probably have to apply it again in the next week, to maintain it.</li>
            <li> This product namely the body hair removal, does not work.  I gave it a fair chance (3 times). What it did do was burn the skin. Followed all instructions.  The balm, highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> So i tried this for my first time and it went well, its says apply the stuff in a thin manner but i recommend a little more so it gets the stuff done, I also recommend doing this two days straight because if you have think hair you WILL get a little patchy but when you do it again it should come out really clean. FOLLOW the directions on the tube! People only get burned by the chemicals if they don&#x27;t follow the directions. Tried it on my package and it left it clean! Highly recommend this over waxing!</li>
            <li> I followed the product instructions, including testing on a small area before general application. The test removed some hair &amp; had no negative side effects so I proceeded with the general application. I left the product on for 10 minutes with no adverse reaction. They came shortly afterwards when I got into the shower &amp; began to wipe the cream away using the glove that was provided. I immediately experienced a burning sensation that increased in intensity as I proceeded. I gave up using the glove &amp; rinsed away the remaining Bare Balm with lukewarm water &amp; my hand. By now the skin was so sore that I could barely stand to let the water touch it but I realized that I had to remove all of the Bare Balm so I persevered. I then blotted the area dry with a towel and applied the Calm Balm with my bare hand. Even those light touches hurt like hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was yesterday. I have been \\&quot;going commando\\&quot; since then, wearing only sweat pants. I was awakened several times during the night with pain as the affected area touched sheets or even my leg. Any contact whatsoever, whether with fabric or other skin, is still painful today. I packaged everything up for return and applied a different skin cream today to aid in healing. As before, even the gentle touch of my fingers hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, before I forget, the Bare Balm did not even remove all of the hair. It&#x27;s back to shaving for me after I heal but, if you have a high pain threshold &amp; don&#x27;t want to shave, I have an alternative suggestion. Try pouring lighter fluid on your balls &amp; igniting it. It can&#x27;t be much more painful &amp; would likely be more effective than Bare Balm in hair removal.</li>
            <li> Im not going to make a bunch of obvious jokes and just get right to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is no fun, using this makes the whole process faster and easer and with better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MOST important thing to remember is NOT to keep the cream on longer that 10-12 mins tops. It will fry your skin which you dont want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it on a small spot first, not bigger than a qtr or dollar coin. Try that and you&#x27;ll get a feel for how it works. THEN once you got it, so sections about the size of a dollar or so. If you do too large of an area by the time you finish applying your 10-12 mins are up from where you started...again you will burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this it works really well...even on a gorilla like me :)</li>
            <li> I am a returning customer because this product works.  I haven&#x27;t found any product that you can use in the sensitive areas that didn&#x27;t cause a rash or other irritation until now.  The hair is gone the package is smooth and no ill side effects.  I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and well worth the money. The application sticks make sure you apply the correct amount of remover cream and the included glove helps you remove the hair easily in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely the best package for male hair removal out there.</li>
            <li> I got me some bare ballz. Left it on too long once and with the rather vigorous scrubbing my forest needs I caused some SERIOUS discomfort. The lotion and 24 hours later all was well.</li>
            <li> Well lets just say that everything went swimmingly, I can say that this is one of the best products I have used to do manscaping ! and I will be recommending this to all the guys I know !!</li>
            <li> SEVERE irritation almost immediatly after applying to &amp;#34;test area&amp;#34;.  Immediatly washed off and applied Polysporin to area.  Avoid the problems - don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I was worried at first to use this, because I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy. It worked awesome! Just follow the directions and it will work. I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore!</li>
            <li> I only had a slight burning sensation, the least of any product I has used.  It did not remove the coarser hairs.  I left on for 15 minutes.  I guess 80% of the hairs were removed</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Has kind of a minty thing going on that helps to sooth the experience.  The after care lotion is a nice touch.  Don&#x27;t use on the same night you plan on going out.  A little warm on the sack after a while so make sure to remove within the time limit specified.  Also worked great on the taint.  Didn&#x27;t go past there.  Do so at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a cream like this before and honestly I was a bit skeptic but this exceeded expectations in every way.  The smell was not overwhelming, it did not burn AT ALL (using in the intended sensitive area), and it took away 99% of the hairs in the area I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better results once I use it a couple more times and figure out the best way to use it, but the bottom-line is - it works, and it is very easy to use, and it is very fast compared to shaving.</li>
            <li> I really liked reading the directions. (Kinda cute) The stuff works just fine. Follow the directions and you won&#x27;t have problems.</li>
