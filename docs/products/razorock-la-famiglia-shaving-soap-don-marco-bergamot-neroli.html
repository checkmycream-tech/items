            <li>Bright orange neroli scent.</li>
            <li>It created a surprising amount of lather, without even using a brush.</li>
            <li>it smells good</li>
            <li>it lather good</li>
            <li>Nice scent great lather..</li>
            <li>I will probably pass it on to someone in need of a good shave.</li>
            <li>nice lather and pleasant scent.would buy again.</li>
            <li>This one has a wonderful fresh neroli (orange-blossom) fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It works great, provides a great face lather and has a light Dreamsicle scent which is a nice summer change.</li>
            <li>Like all RazoRock soaps this one makes amazing lather that provides superior slipperiness and cushion while shaving...</li>
            <li>I truly love this stuff!</li>
            <li>While I get excellent face lathering with their Fresco and XX varieties, the Don Marco seems even more rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Did I say it smells delicious?;-)</li>
            <li>Try it you&#x27;ll love it !</li>
            <li>This has became my favorite soap!</li>
            <li>it works perfectly, and if you like a sweet citrus scent, you&#x27;re going to love this shave soap</li>
            <li>Amazing soap, amazing lather, amazing smell.</li>
            <li>I got a great smooth, bloodless shave from my R41.</li>
            <li>Great cushion, razor just glides smoothly along.</li>
            <li>kind of want to keep this soap to myself ...</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>Another nice soap from RR.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice citrus aroma.</li>
            <li>so I just have to judge vegan soaps on their own merit.  </li>
            <li>After looking through I settled on this one because people noted it had a nice orange dreamsicle scent to it.  </li>
            <li>really lathers up awesome</li>
            <li>The soap goes on well using a brush and provides a nice shave.</li>
            <li>I can confirm that there is indeed a really pleasant orange scent to it, but it&#x27;s not an overwhelmingly strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty great.</li>
            <li>Easy to lather, smells amazing</li>
            <li>Good service very fast shipping !&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely functional and provides a great shave.</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent and terrific lather!!!!</li>
            <li>Love all RazorRock soaps.</li>
            <li>Like the scent, although to me it is more citrus-y than bergamot.</li>
            <li>smells ok.</li>
            <li>and this one has just become my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is an astoundingly outstanding shave soap.  </li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite smelling soaps.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite go to shaving soaps.</li>
            <li>As it translates from Italian, &amp;#34;Father Mark,&amp;#34; my wife thought it the perfect Fathers&#x27; Day gift; I agreed but couldn&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li>I will buy some more for my son to give me on Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>When a company is praised so universally, I guess I expect to be extremely impressed with their products.  </li>
            <li>Anecdotally speaking, this seemed to leave my skin smoother and more closely shaved than the cream.  </li>
            <li>For me, its just ok.</li>
            <li>trust me and remember you may love the smell.</li>
            <li>if the smell were likeable to my taste it would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>I Look forward to trying many more of their scents.</li>
            <li>As for slickness, it is there, combined with adequate water it slides along with the best I have tried, both in the triple milled and high glycerin camps.  </li>
            <li>This shaving soap is wonderfully scented and light enough that it does not fight with a man&#x27;s cologne!</li>
            <li>It has a very sweet, creamy orange scent.</li>
            <li>The shave was comfortable and convincing.  </li>
            <li>I think you will love this product and enjoy shaving with it every day.  </li>
            <li>If it smelled more like bergamot I would want a stronger smell because I really enjoy bergamot.  </li>
            <li>It loads on the brush easily.</li>
            <li>although I find it has a strong bergamot (citrus) scent, it doesn&#x27;t linger, therefore I can use any of my scented After Shaves and</li>
            <li>I really liked it at first.  </li>
            <li>Easy to lather and fantastic scent.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the citrus Bergamot Neroli scent.</li>
            <li>Great lather, great protection, the blade glides over my skin with little irritation (my skin is very sensitive).</li>
            <li>For $10 you cannotgo wrong, easy to lather and great slickness and great peaks.</li>
            <li>The scent is superb and appropriately citrusy, the lather quite ample, the lubricity of the suds is sufficiently slick for effective closed comb shaving even on skin that tends to bind.</li>
            <li>So good i actually keep it on my desk and smell it from time to time.</li>
            <li>This company has a really good reputation, and the only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 was because of that.  </li>
            <li>it just that it is a bit to creamsicle candy sweet smelling for my.  </li>
            <li>(sweet orange blossom smell</li>
            <li>As it stands though, not bad.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>This soap smells like a delicious French Earl Grey tea, strong sweet citrus aroma fills the room.</li>
            <li>and I mean awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a crazy overpowering scent that punches you in the face, but more gentle and sweet.</li>
            <li>I do love the razorock Classic.</li>
            <li>The texture is sort of like Proraso or Cella, and the fragrance is a mild citrus type.</li>
            <li>The product page describes the smell as orange creamsicle and that&#x27;s pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using RazoRock shaving cream (Cacao Cream) for about a year or more at this point and decided I wanted to try a new one.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely and goes on nice and slick.</li>
            <li>I cannot find a single fault with this shave soap, it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>only caveat is that some of the more strongly fragranced ones might cause some skin irritation---perfumes and fragrant oils often do.  </li>
            <li>I really like this soap because, it lathers well, gives great protection and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out on my face.  </li>
            <li>foams very well and provides fantastic lubrication compared to proraso soap. .</li>
            <li>This is more soft and I assume would &amp;#34;wear out&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34; faster.</li>
            <li>But the quality of the product is well worth any &amp;#</li>
            <li>good product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty mild.  </li>
            <li>I face lather and go right from the jar to my face.</li>
            <li>Great shaving soap,it is slick and you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time loading your brush up.</li>
            <li>The Don Marco soap has a nice citrus scent that doesnâ€™t linger for a long time so it wonâ€™t conflict with your after shave lotion.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is very slippery and lathers amazingly, I used a tiny dab and rubbed it on my hand.</li>
            <li>It took a couple tries to figure out how to get it to lather, but once I did, the lather was amazing</li>
            <li>The first time I loaded my Chubby1</li>
            <li>This is my first try with one of the Razorock Artisan shops.</li>
            <li>An olive size piece provides more than enough lather for 3-4 passes.</li>
            <li>I am definitely looking forward to trying more of the RazoRock line.</li>
            <li>I have seen it described as â€˜Orange Dreamsicleâ€™, but I would say the scent is a bit more complex than that, as a side note I have started drinking Earl Grey Tea as a result to this pleasant experience with a Bergamot product.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the scent to Razo Rock XXX.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely keep buying RazorRock products.</li>
            <li>Lathers very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the scent.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes it.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped fast and without damage.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bellezz.</li>
            <li>Over the course of a couple of weeks it started to really irritate my skin</li>
            <li>I also have the Fresco and Classic and really like them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied but hardly overwhelmed.  </li>
            <li>There are better soaps out there for less money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and you will have more than enough enough for three passes.</li>
            <li>This truly is a high performance shave soap.  </li>
            <li>however I just wish it were a little more pleasing and not like a lemon flavor.</li>
            <li>, I tried face lathering instead of using a bowl as I normally would.  </li>
            <li>My skin returned to normal after I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and you can get a thick lather going.  </li>
            <li>So to recap, little drying, plenty slick, plenty of cushion, and a pleasant, sweet bitter orange smell (can bitter be sweet, well this is), I am glad I tried it, and likely you would be too.</li>
            <li>This one lathers a little better- more like regular shaving cream than the other shaving soap I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I use a boar shaving brush when using this soap mainly because my badger brush is huge and has a hard time fitting in the soap jar opening, but that is really not a problem as the boar hair shave brush</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd RazoRock Shave Soap, but first in this flavor.  </li>
            <li>Well this little gem manages just fine.  </li>
            <li>Check reviews before choosing one if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its a different consistency though compared to say a cup of proraso which is much &amp;#34;harder&amp;#34; of a cake.  </li>
            <li>If I had to choose one shaving soap, it would probably be RazoRock---easy to lather, buttery smooth &amp; slick, moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shave using straight razors and need a high quality shave soap that wont break down during use.  </li>
            <li>With just a bit of water this soap makes mounds of rich, slick, great-smelling lather.</li>
            <li>Will never buy no other cream</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 4 starts instead of 5 is that I was hoping for a scent a little closer to true bergamot.</li>
            <li>Whips easily into a rich lather, thick slick greek yoghurt consistency.</li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy, very slick and cushions the face to prevent face nicks.</li>

            <li> If it smelled more like bergamot I would want a stronger smell because I really enjoy bergamot.  </li>
            <li> It loads on the brush easily.</li>
            <li> although I find it has a strong bergamot (citrus) scent, it doesn&#x27;t linger, therefore I can use any of my scented After Shaves and</li>
            <li> I really liked it at first.  </li>
            <li> Easy to lather and fantastic scent.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the citrus Bergamot Neroli scent.</li>
            <li> Great lather, great protection, the blade glides over my skin with little irritation (my skin is very sensitive).</li>
            <li> For $10 you cannotgo wrong, easy to lather and great slickness and great peaks.</li>
            <li> The scent is superb and appropriately citrusy, the lather quite ample, the lubricity of the suds is sufficiently slick for effective closed comb shaving even on skin that tends to bind.</li>
            <li> So good i actually keep it on my desk and smell it from time to time.</li>
            <li> This company has a really good reputation, and the only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 was because of that.  </li>
            <li> it just that it is a bit to creamsicle candy sweet smelling for my.  </li>
            <li> (sweet orange blossom smell</li>
            <li> As it stands though, not bad.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> This soap smells like a delicious French Earl Grey tea, strong sweet citrus aroma fills the room.</li>
            <li> and I mean awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a crazy overpowering scent that punches you in the face, but more gentle and sweet.</li>
            <li> I do love the razorock Classic.</li>
            <li> The texture is sort of like Proraso or Cella, and the fragrance is a mild citrus type.</li>
            <li> The product page describes the smell as orange creamsicle and that&#x27;s pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using RazoRock shaving cream (Cacao Cream) for about a year or more at this point and decided I wanted to try a new one.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely and goes on nice and slick.</li>
            <li> I cannot find a single fault with this shave soap, it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> only caveat is that some of the more strongly fragranced ones might cause some skin irritation---perfumes and fragrant oils often do.  </li>
            <li> I really like this soap because, it lathers well, gives great protection and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out on my face.  </li>
            <li> foams very well and provides fantastic lubrication compared to proraso soap. .</li>
            <li> This is more soft and I assume would &amp;#34;wear out&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34; faster.</li>
            <li> But the quality of the product is well worth any &amp;#</li>
            <li> good product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty mild.  </li>
            <li> I face lather and go right from the jar to my face.</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap,it is slick and you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time loading your brush up.</li>
            <li> The Don Marco soap has a nice citrus scent that doesnâ€™t linger for a long time so it wonâ€™t conflict with your after shave lotion.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is very slippery and lathers amazingly, I used a tiny dab and rubbed it on my hand.</li>
            <li> It took a couple tries to figure out how to get it to lather, but once I did, the lather was amazing</li>
            <li> The first time I loaded my Chubby1</li>
            <li> This is my first try with one of the Razorock Artisan shops.</li>
            <li> An olive size piece provides more than enough lather for 3-4 passes.</li>
            <li> I am definitely looking forward to trying more of the RazoRock line.</li>
            <li> I have seen it described as â€˜Orange Dreamsicleâ€™, but I would say the scent is a bit more complex than that, as a side note I have started drinking Earl Grey Tea as a result to this pleasant experience with a Bergamot product.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the scent to Razo Rock XXX.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely keep buying RazorRock products.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the scent.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes it.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast and without damage.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bellezz.</li>
            <li> Over the course of a couple of weeks it started to really irritate my skin</li>
            <li> I also have the Fresco and Classic and really like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied but hardly overwhelmed.  </li>
            <li> There are better soaps out there for less money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and you will have more than enough enough for three passes.</li>
            <li> This truly is a high performance shave soap.  </li>
            <li> however I just wish it were a little more pleasing and not like a lemon flavor.</li>
            <li> , I tried face lathering instead of using a bowl as I normally would.  </li>
            <li> My skin returned to normal after I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and you can get a thick lather going.  </li>
            <li> So to recap, little drying, plenty slick, plenty of cushion, and a pleasant, sweet bitter orange smell (can bitter be sweet, well this is), I am glad I tried it, and likely you would be too.</li>
            <li> This one lathers a little better- more like regular shaving cream than the other shaving soap I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I use a boar shaving brush when using this soap mainly because my badger brush is huge and has a hard time fitting in the soap jar opening, but that is really not a problem as the boar hair shave brush</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd RazoRock Shave Soap, but first in this flavor.  </li>
            <li> Well this little gem manages just fine.  </li>
            <li> Check reviews before choosing one if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its a different consistency though compared to say a cup of proraso which is much &amp;#34;harder&amp;#34; of a cake.  </li>
            <li> If I had to choose one shaving soap, it would probably be RazoRock---easy to lather, buttery smooth &amp; slick, moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave using straight razors and need a high quality shave soap that wont break down during use.  </li>
            <li> With just a bit of water this soap makes mounds of rich, slick, great-smelling lather.</li>
            <li> Will never buy no other cream</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 starts instead of 5 is that I was hoping for a scent a little closer to true bergamot.</li>
            <li> Whips easily into a rich lather, thick slick greek yoghurt consistency.</li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy, very slick and cushions the face to prevent face nicks.</li>
            <li> Only slight negative is that I find it more drying than my other soaps and creams, but only by a little, and the dryness goes away immediately upon use of a moisturizing aftershave balm, which my skin needs in the winter anyhow.  </li>
            <li> Whip up a little lather with the old boar brush, and here comes the smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other Razorock cream soaps over the last 18 months or so</li>
            <li> Not really fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> I use a boar shaving brush and the lather whips up with only a few strokes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to try their other products</li>
            <li> The lather was immediately ready in a thick, slick protective barrier.  </li>
            <li> other thing...</li>
            <li> The Down Marco is no exception.</li>
            <li> I expect nothing less from RazoRock at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper shave soap for a few days before this and there does seem to be a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> Face does not feel dried out afterward.</li>
            <li> fanatic soap.</li>
            <li> I would say), very slick and moisturizing to my skin.  </li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with RazoRock shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having tried a couple of RazoRock products at this point, I doubt you could go wrong with anything from their line.</li>
            <li> for the money you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the performance of the product.</li>
            <li> Buy a tub, you wont be disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I truly love this stuff! It&#x27;s absolutely functional and provides a great shave. The fragrance is absolutely wonderful! Like a manly orange/citrus.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and terrific lather!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, and I literally can&#x27;t stop opening the container and smelling it. It smells so good!!! Words can&#x27;t even describe it. It has a very sweet, creamy orange scent. It&#x27;s not a crazy overpowering scent that punches you in the face, but more gentle and sweet.The soap itself is very slippery and lathers amazingly, I used a tiny dab and rubbed it on my hand. It created a surprising amount of lather, without even using a brush. The scent will not stay on your skin after you wash it off, so it won&#x27;t interfere with cologne/aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;I kind of want to keep this soap to myself ...I guess I&#x27;ll have to order another one!!</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with RazoRock shaving soaps.  This one has a wonderful fresh neroli (orange-blossom) fragrance.  The performance of the 5-6 different varieties I&#x27;ve tried has always been terrific.  If I had to choose one shaving soap, it would probably be RazoRock---easy to lather, buttery smooth &amp; slick, moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat is that some of the more strongly fragranced ones might cause some skin irritation---perfumes and fragrant oils often do.  Check reviews before choosing one if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great lather. Reasonably priced. Nice smell.</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap, lathers well, and smells excellent!</li>
            <li> Amazing soap, amazing lather, amazing smell. Bright orange neroli scent. For $10 you cannotgo wrong, easy to lather and great slickness and great peaks. Best bang for your buck in my opinion !</li>
            <li> Easy to lather and fantastic scent.  I much prefer the scent to Razo Rock XXX.</li>
            <li> Love all RazorRock soaps. This one is no exception. Great lather, great protection, the blade glides over my skin with little irritation (my skin is very sensitive). Will absolutely keep buying RazorRock products. Like the scent, although to me it is more citrus-y than bergamot.</li>
            <li> Not really fond of the smell. It&#x27;s grapefruit. Lathers great though</li>
            <li> Lathers very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the scent. My girlfriend really likes it. Your mile may vary!</li>
            <li> Excellent scent, great lather and slickness</li>
            <li> It works great, provides a great face lather and has a light Dreamsicle scent which is a nice summer change. I only wish the scent was stronger.</li>
            <li> smells ok. nothing spectacular.  performance is fairly standard for this class.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other Razorock cream soaps over the last 18 months or so and this one has just become my favorite.  While I get excellent face lathering with their Fresco and XX varieties, the Don Marco seems even more rich and creamy.  The scent is definitely citrus which is a big plus for me.  This is my new favorite soap.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving soap by an excellent company.</li>
            <li> This is an astoundingly outstanding shave soap.  The first time I loaded my Chubby1 Best brush, I tried face lathering instead of using a bowl as I normally would.  The lather was immediately ready in a thick, slick protective barrier.  The shave was comfortable and convincing.  I had found a soap that I would continue to use and give as gifts.  To understand my surprise and pleasure with the soap&#x27;s protective qualities........  You need to know that I was shaving with a  Muhle R41 DE razor.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff. One of my favorite smelling soaps. It took a couple tries to figure out how to get it to lather, but once I did, the lather was amazing</li>
            <li> These products always lather well and have some of the best smell on the market.  This is one of my favorite go to shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast and without damage.Great shaving soap,it is slick and you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time loading your brush up.Ten seconds and you will have more than enough enough for three passes.Thanks Bellezz.</li>
            <li> The scent is superb and appropriately citrusy, the lather quite ample, the lubricity of the suds is sufficiently slick for effective closed comb shaving even on skin that tends to bind. This is well-priced and the delivery was prompt. As it translates from Italian, &amp;#34;Father Mark,&amp;#34; my wife thought it the perfect Fathers&#x27; Day gift; I agreed but couldn&#x27;t wait. I will buy some more for my son to give me on Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> Another nice soap from RR. My 1st impression with the scent is it reminded me of the Orange/Vanilla sherbet ice cream. I like it.</li>
            <li> This is my first try with one of the Razorock Artisan shops. I also have the Fresco and Classic and really like them. The Down Marco is no exception. It has a really nice citrus aroma. It loads on the brush easily. I face lather and go right from the jar to my face. With just a bit of water this soap makes mounds of rich, slick, great-smelling lather. I got a great smooth, bloodless shave from my R41. All in all another great product from Razorock. And as always, Bellezz shipped super-fast.</li>
            <li> fanatic soap. foams very well and provides fantastic lubrication compared to proraso soap. . Has one of the best scents i have ever smelled in a mens grooming product. So good i actually keep it on my desk and smell it from time to time. Its a different consistency though compared to say a cup of proraso which is much &amp;#34;harder&amp;#34; of a cake.  This is more soft and I assume would &amp;#34;wear out&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34; faster. But the quality of the product is well worth any &amp;#34;faster depletion&amp;#34; of the soap.</li>
            <li> This soap smells like a delicious French Earl Grey tea, strong sweet citrus aroma fills the room. Whips easily into a rich lather, thick slick greek yoghurt consistency. Great cushion, razor just glides smoothly along. Did I say it smells delicious?;-) An olive size piece provides more than enough lather for 3-4 passes.</li>
            <li> Great scent, amazing product, good price!</li>
            <li> nice lather and pleasant scent.would buy again.</li>
            <li> Performs and smells great! Lathers like a beast.</li>
            <li> Another great product from RazoRock!  Iâ€™ve found the Italian-made shaving soaps are excellent. This is the 5th RazoRock Shaving Soap Iâ€™ve tried and everyone has been a winner; the Don Marco is no exception.  I really enjoy the citrus Bergamot Neroli scent. This soap lathers and protects well. It is rich and creamy, very slick and cushions the face to prevent face nicks. I use a boar shaving brush and the lather whips up with only a few strokes. The Don Marco soap has a nice citrus scent that doesnâ€™t linger for a long time so it wonâ€™t conflict with your after shave lotion. I think you will love this product and enjoy shaving with it every day.  Try it Mikeyâ€¦ youâ€™ll like it!  In addition, Bellezz is a great seller and always ships super-fast.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It&#x27;s a croap, folks. Lathers up nicely and goes on nice and slick. I expect nothing less from RazoRock at this point.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd RazoRock Shave Soap, but first in this flavor.  I really like this soap because, it lathers well, gives great protection and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out on my face.  I use a boar shaving brush when using this soap mainly because my badger brush is huge and has a hard time fitting in the soap jar opening, but that is really not a problem as the boar hair shave brush works great with this shave soap.  I cannot find a single fault with this shave soap, it&#x27;s that good.  I shave using straight razors and need a high quality shave soap that wont break down during use.  I&#x27;ve used this shave soap over a dozen times and each use it works perfectly, and if you like a sweet citrus scent, you&#x27;re going to love this shave soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing...although I find it has a strong bergamot (citrus) scent, it doesn&#x27;t linger, therefore I can use any of my scented After Shaves and there isn&#x27;t any conflict with competing scents.  This truly is a high performance shave soap.  Buy a tub, you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> This rocks the shaving ! This cream it the best I have ever used ! Will never buy no other cream it smells good it lather good it lets the razor slide on your face. Razorock is #1 cream for me ! Try it you&#x27;ll love it ! Good service very fast shipping !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you razorock</li>
            <li> The product page describes the smell as orange creamsicle and that&#x27;s pretty accurate.  I was going for something closer to bergamot though, as it&#x27;s in the name.  The smell is pretty mild.  If it smelled more like bergamot I would want a stronger smell because I really enjoy bergamot.  As it stands though, not bad. How it performs?  I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper shave soap for a few days before this and there does seem to be a slight difference.  This one lathers a little better- more like regular shaving cream than the other shaving soap I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m vegan so I like that this soap is made sans animal products but I&#x27;ve never used a traditional shave soap with tallow(cow fat), so I can&#x27;t say whether this works as well as one of those.  I&#x27;ll never know so I just have to judge vegan soaps on their own merit.  All in all it seems to work as advertised.  This company has a really good reputation, and the only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 was because of that.  When a company is praised so universally, I guess I expect to be extremely impressed with their products.  I&#x27;m very satisfied but hardly overwhelmed.  I&#x27;m curious to try their other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using RazoRock shaving cream (Cacao Cream) for about a year or more at this point and decided I wanted to try a new one.  After looking through I settled on this one because people noted it had a nice orange dreamsicle scent to it.  I can confirm that there is indeed a really pleasant orange scent to it, but it&#x27;s not an overwhelmingly strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I prefer the cream to the soap, just a personal preference.  I&#x27;m not going to dock any stars on this review because of my preference though.  Anecdotally speaking, this seemed to leave my skin smoother and more closely shaved than the cream.  The lather was great and lubricated the razor nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried a couple of RazoRock products at this point, I doubt you could go wrong with anything from their line.</li>
            <li> Nice scent great lather.. For me, its just ok. There are better soaps out there for less money in my opinion. I probably would not purchase again.  I do love the razorock Classic.</li>
            <li> this shave soap is awesome. really lathers up awesome and I mean awesome. However my only dilemma is the smell. it&#x27;s not bad however I just wish it were a little more pleasing and not like a lemon flavor. for the money you cant go wrong. trust me and remember you may love the smell. if the smell were likeable to my taste it would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> Like all RazoRock soaps this one makes amazing lather that provides superior slipperiness and cushion while shaving... it just that it is a bit to creamsicle candy sweet smelling for my.  I will probably pass it on to someone in need of a good shave.</li>
            <li> good product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li> I really liked it at first.  It smells nice and you can get a thick lather going.  Over the course of a couple of weeks it started to really irritate my skin and I had to stop using it.  My skin returned to normal after I stopped using it.  If it doesn&#x27;t bother your skin, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I look forward to shaving with this every day.  It makes me want to get up each morning to shave just to smell it.  Easy to lather, smells amazing (sweet orange blossom smell I would say), very slick and moisturizing to my skin.  I Look forward to trying many more of their scents.</li>
            <li> This shaving soap is wonderfully scented and light enough that it does not fight with a man&#x27;s cologne! The soap goes on well using a brush and provides a nice shave.</li>
            <li> So, what do we want from a shaving soap, slickness to prevent razor burn, cushion to prevent nicks, and a smell that would not scare a bulldog off of a meat wagon.  Well this little gem manages just fine.  Whip up a little lather with the old boar brush, and here comes the smell.  I have seen it described as â€˜Orange Dreamsicleâ€™, but I would say the scent is a bit more complex than that, as a side note I have started drinking Earl Grey Tea as a result to this pleasant experience with a Bergamot product.  As for slickness, it is there, combined with adequate water it slides along with the best I have tried, both in the triple milled and high glycerin camps.  The cushion, as in all soaps depends on your lathering skills, so you mileage with vary here.  Only slight negative is that I find it more drying than my other soaps and creams, but only by a little, and the dryness goes away immediately upon use of a moisturizing aftershave balm, which my skin needs in the winter anyhow.  So to recap, little drying, plenty slick, plenty of cushion, and a pleasant, sweet bitter orange smell (can bitter be sweet, well this is), I am glad I tried it, and likely you would be too.</li>
            <li> Loads on the brush very nicely for 3 passes. Smell is great but not overpowering and razor glides over the beard. Face does not feel dried out afterward. Razo-Rock has become part of my weekly rotation.</li>
            <li> This has became my favorite soap! For the money it is the best for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great. The scent is not quite bergamot... think &amp;#34;bergamot Koolaid&amp;#34; and you might get closer to the mark. But the cushion and slickness are very good. The only reason I give it 4 starts instead of 5 is that I was hoping for a scent a little closer to true bergamot. I am definitely looking forward to trying more of the RazoRock line.</li>
            <li> Gets an automatic Five Star rating just because it is a RazoRock product. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the performance of the product. The great scent is just a plus!</li>
            <li> A great shave soap for the price !  The texture is sort of like Proraso or Cella, and the fragrance is a mild citrus type. A real good value.</li>
