            <li>This creamy treatment smells nice.</li>
            <li>The breakage that I experienced has also diminished significantly since using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of conditioners, and so far I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more than what I got.  </li>
            <li>Just costs more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner, and believe me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Hair looks and feels much better.</li>
            <li>The smell is just ok, like a bar of (safeguard) soap?</li>
            <li>I Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw</li>
            <li>I applied in sections to make sure</li>
            <li>I figured it would be okay since it would be washed out after use.</li>
            <li>Kera pro is excellent for dry hair it moister your hair and make it soft,If your hair is nature when you condition it you will love the result of the produce.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, fresh fragrance, and it smooths the hairs.</li>
            <li>I also make sure I have a clean slate of hair that isn&#x27;t filmy with buildup from styling products, gels, oils or butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t arrive full to the top</li>
            <li>The results----soft, moisturizer, tangle free and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>use the shampoo and elixer too, which are all fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY types of masks and even used coconut oil and olive oil on both of our heads, but this is far better.</li>
            <li>Overall, a real winner and absolutely one of the best on my hair.</li>
            <li>It can be used with or without heat, and it never fails to leave my hair moisturized, yet strong.</li>
            <li>But it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is hunting for an effective hair treatment product.</li>
            <li>The product is white, super creamy and spreads very easily.</li>
            <li>the reviews were right.</li>
            <li>My hair is always soft, strong and shiny.</li>
            <li>This restorative treatment makes my hair feel soft and easy to comb after washing.</li>
            <li>I have natural AA healthy, fine curly hair that I frequently heat style and blow out straight.</li>
            <li>I got it the first time at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li>but then they didnt have it when I went back for more.</li>
            <li>Since my late forties, I have experienced shedding and breakage in my once carefree hair</li>
            <li>It perform consistently  for me week to week.</li>
            <li>The next day to combat the softness I used more hair spray.</li>
            <li>I just tried this for the first time at 10.5 post relaxer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first jar i purchased from Sally&#x27;s, but have since purchased a 3 pack from Beauty Sundance.</li>
            <li>Since I am a first time user, I don&#x27;t know whether I received a legit product or an altered one.</li>
            <li>I bought this product, along with the shampoo, based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>(Matrix Biolage, Kenra, Ojon, Joico - too many to name over the years), but strangely nothing gave a finish quite like this.</li>
            <li>(oh how I long for those days :-)  </li>
            <li>Its not a replacement for my other favorites, but I do think its a great deep treatment to give if you wear your hair straight or heat style.</li>
            <li>First of all, I would like to say that when I opened the conditioner container, it actually looked and smelled like the Udderly Smooth Body and Udder Cream.</li>
            <li>I eventually snagged it on Amazon (which sometimes can be a mistake when it comes to beauty products online from certain sellers).</li>
            <li>Also, IMO, it is reasonably priced; I won&#x27;t go bankrupt while trying to take care of my hair.</li>
            <li>it really made no diff at all.</li>
            <li>Note: I still recommend leaving it in for at least 20 minutes for superior results on relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I use many other high end products that work really well too</li>
            <li>My go to product for the last year has been Loreal Kerastase Oleo Deep treatment which has my clients keep returning for more.</li>
            <li>I liked this conditioner so much that I went to sally&#x27;s and purchased the shampoo for dry to very dry hair and the anti frizz serum.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>That is why I came back for the whole jar!!</li>
            <li>It had soo much slip, made my hair soo soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and after using with heat my hair was so soft it laid funny.</li>
            <li>I normally moisturize with a leave-in conditioner and seal my hair with oil.</li>
            <li>What I can say for sure is that this deep conditioner that I received did not live up to the reviews.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I am an international student from a country with equatorial climate and it is my first winter here in US</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other deep conditioners that are way better than this.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling soft and strengthened.</li>
            <li>I used this product after a relaxer and it made my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it just sat on my hair, which very often needs heat to open the hair cuticle and allow the treatment to absorb.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and easier to detangle.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I rinsed out the treatment.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soo incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>When i rinse it out my hair feels so soft</li>
            <li>SOFT HAIR&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The key to it being effective for me was using it in as a deep conditioning treatment, with heat or steam, for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>i got my all my new growth applied a plastic cap and a turbi twist and left in for an hour and then washed out.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying different products now that I&#x27;m going  the natural route</li>
            <li>I have a daughter with very frizzy, dry red hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft after using both the shampoo and the deep conditioner; however, my hair looked very frizzy when it dried out.</li>
            <li>I am an African American female with long, dry, fine, fragile, middle-aged hair (I have been transitioning from relaxed to natural for the past 14 months), and I have several textures in this head of hair.</li>
            <li>I put on a serum on my wet hair right after I washed and conditioned it, but that&#x27;s my usual routine and my hair has never dried like that before.</li>
            <li>This product moisturizes and strengthens my relaxed dry hair like no other!</li>

            <li> As a stylist of African American Clients, I have to deal with a lot of excessively dry relaxed damage hair.</li>
            <li> I also like to flat iron my hair twice a week.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps, my hair wasn&#x27;t dry enough to need this.</li>
            <li> I have several other deep conditioners that I rotate with this one</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work any better than much less expensive conditioners.  </li>
            <li> After applying this product and being outside in the cold for the whole day, my hair is still soft and shiny at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> My usually frizzy , unruly hair was manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> I figured for $9, at least it would be a fairly decent product if left on hair for half an hour under heat.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you are looking for a miracle product for less, this is certainly the Stuff!</li>
            <li> This was definitely money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this product after the ends of my hair became extremely dry due to the dry weather.</li>
            <li> so I feel a little short changed.</li>
            <li> In less than five minutes my Clients dry bushy brillo-like hair was like melted butter silk!</li>
            <li> I think that my hair is stronger as a result of this product and there is no hair breakage after relaxing due to this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for something to heal my hair and came across this on other reviews.</li>
            <li> and I usually can&#x27;t wait to get back to it.</li>
            <li> The jar is relatively small having only 5 ounces.</li>
            <li> So, again, I&#x27;m not sure what was actually in the container.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling slick and mushy.</li>
            <li> So i hope they are not knock offs as this deep conditioner is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> But because times are hard, people simple cant afford to splurge for my treatments.$60 a jar, ($20 Treatment)</li>
            <li> Anyway, I left it on longer than it was suggested, so I don&#x27;t know if that affected the outcome negatively, although I wouldn&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I typically stay away from products with dimethicones, but a friend suggested that I try this product to condition and moisturize.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing for thick, dry, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> so I did not have any experience dealing with the harsh winter.</li>
            <li> Let is sit for a few hours.</li>
            <li> mother&#x27;s hair type (thick tight curly</li>
            <li> I usually leave it in for about 20 mins.</li>
            <li> As a product junkie, I&#x27;ve tried expensive products that did not work half as well as Kera Pro.  </li>
            <li> I reeeally hope they never stop making it, as it is already very hard to come by.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> Pang aging was horrible, not sure if it was used, strange stickers on the jar, still tried it (crazy)</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

            <li> Absolutely love this conditioner!! It works great for getting rid of tangles. It leaves your hair feeling soft and strengthened.</li>
            <li> Wow!  the reviews were right.I waited a while to get this in the mail only to find out that Sally&#x27;s carries it.  but this treatment is so great for my hair.  My hair is relaxed and color treated, so it starves for moisture.  I also like to flat iron my hair twice a week.  I used this product after a relaxer and it made my hair so soft.  I think that my hair is stronger as a result of this product and there is no hair breakage after relaxing due to this product.  I liked this conditioner so much that I went to sally&#x27;s and purchased the shampoo for dry to very dry hair and the anti frizz serum.  The results are equally as good. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product, would buy again</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work any better than much less expensive conditioners.  I was expecting more than what I got.  Not great.</li>
            <li> I have a daughter with very frizzy, dry red hair. I actually got this for her, and it works WONDERS!! But, after dying my hair so often, I decided to give it a try on my thinner, wavy hair. This is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve tried MANY types of masks and even used coconut oil and olive oil on both of our heads, but this is far better. I got it the first time at Sally&#x27;s but then they didnt have it when I went back for more. I eventually snagged it on Amazon (which sometimes can be a mistake when it comes to beauty products online from certain sellers). I got this from Wasatch Beauty and they didn&#x27;t send me a knock off. THANKS!!</li>
            <li> This product is a line that is produced by Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. It is a knock-off of the Kerastase Oleo Relax line. I have natural AA healthy, fine curly hair that I frequently heat style and blow out straight. This gives the smoothest, softest bounciest, healthiest finish ever. I was shocked. I use many other high end products that work really well too (Matrix Biolage, Kenra, Ojon, Joico - too many to name over the years), but strangely nothing gave a finish quite like this. Its not a replacement for my other favorites, but I do think its a great deep treatment to give if you wear your hair straight or heat style. The key to it being effective for me was using it in as a deep conditioning treatment, with heat or steam, for at least 20 minutes. Otherwise, it just sat on my hair, which very often needs heat to open the hair cuticle and allow the treatment to absorb. I also make sure I have a clean slate of hair that isn&#x27;t filmy with buildup from styling products, gels, oils or butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. I believe the line is being discontinued, which is a bummer, but the Kerastase line works just as well. Just costs more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the shampoo and elixer too, which are all fantastic.</li>
            <li> bought this with the anti frizz elixir.  combined use makes my hair softer and curly as it always has been until&lt;br /&gt;it started drying out and getting frizzy.  I like it.  this jar will last me a year.</li>
            <li> Kera pro is excellent for dry hair it moister your hair and make it soft,If your hair is nature when you condition it you will love the result of the produce.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with long, dry, fine, fragile, middle-aged hair (I have been transitioning from relaxed to natural for the past 14 months), and I have several textures in this head of hair. Since my late forties, I have experienced shedding and breakage in my once carefree hair (oh how I long for those days :-)  I absolutely love this conditioner, and believe me, I have tried just about everything. It leaves my hair soft and easier to detangle. The breakage that I experienced has also diminished significantly since using this product. Also, IMO, it is reasonably priced; I won&#x27;t go bankrupt while trying to take care of my hair. As a product junkie, I&#x27;ve tried expensive products that did not work half as well as Kera Pro.  This is a keeper; I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Pang aging was horrible, not sure if it was used, strange stickers on the jar, still tried it (crazy) it really made no diff at all. My hair did not feel conditioned at all</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I rinsed out the treatment. My usually frizzy , unruly hair was manageable and soft. After air drying there was still a lot of moisture and manageability in my hair.  What a pleasant surprise ! That is why I came back for the whole jar!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have damaged hair.  It&#x27;s one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I am an international student from a country with equatorial climate and it is my first winter here in US so I did not have any experience dealing with the harsh winter. I decided to get this product after the ends of my hair became extremely dry due to the dry weather. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is hunting for an effective hair treatment product. After applying this product and being outside in the cold for the whole day, my hair is still soft and shiny at the end of the day. It takes only five minutes of your shower time for you to see the outcome. I did not regret buying this and I think you won&#x27;t too after trying it!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this deep conditioner. It has a nice, fresh fragrance, and it smooths the hairs. The results----soft, moisturizer, tangle free and easy to manage. I&#x27;m very pleased and I&#x27;ve already bought another jar. Great product!</li>
            <li> awesome, awesome, awesome!! I&#x27;d been looking for something to heal my hair and came across this on other reviews. I can&#x27;t say enough about it! I reeeally hope they never stop making it, as it is already very hard to come by.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good. Moisturizing for thick, dry, color treated hair. I put in on, put a plastic cap over. Let is sit for a few hours. Hair looks and feels much better. I like Kerapro restorative anti frizz elixir the best too.</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes and strengthens my relaxed dry hair like no other! It perform consistently  for me week to week. I have several other deep conditioners that I rotate with this one and I usually can&#x27;t wait to get back to it. My hair is always soft, strong and shiny. The smell is just ok, like a bar of (safeguard) soap? But it fades quickly.  The jar is relatively small having only 5 ounces. It doesn&#x27;t arrive full to the top so I feel a little short changed. The product is white, super creamy and spreads very easily. Overall, a real winner and absolutely one of the best on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this a lot! It made my hair soo incredibly soft. I usually leave it in for about 20 mins. When i rinse it out my hair feels so soft i keep thinking i still have a gump of product still in my hair. really nice stuff that my mom loves also. I use this with the shampoo and after using both i use the kerapro frizz elixir thingy. THAT  PRODUCT IS INSANELY AMAZING! I have been trying different products now that I&#x27;m going  the natural route and I am deffinitly putting these products on my &#x27;always have&#x27; list. I Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, my hair type is curly (mixed AA female)&lt;br /&gt;my mother&#x27;s hair type (thick tight curly hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I have now used this product 4 times. The last time I put a cap on and added heat. That was the second time within a couple days that I used it. It worked almost to well. I have naturally curly hair and after using with heat my hair was so soft it laid funny. My bangs wouldn&#x27;t say put. The next day to combat the softness I used more hair spray. From now on I will use once a week. This conditioner works. I recommend</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time at 10.5 post relaxer.  It had soo much slip, made my hair soo soft. I would highly recommend.  I applied in sections to make sure i got my all my new growth applied a plastic cap and a turbi twist and left in for an hour and then washed out.  It also smells great too!  I only gave it 4 stars because i&#x27;ve only used it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an update - 1/20/14. I still use this conditioner and it has become one of my staples. Changed my rating to 5 stars. I&#x27;m still on my first jar i purchased from Sally&#x27;s, but have since purchased a 3 pack from Beauty Sundance. I have not used those yet, but they look the same and smell the same as the one I purchased from Sally&#x27;s. So i hope they are not knock offs as this deep conditioner is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> SOFT HAIR&lt;br /&gt;I leave it in for like 2-3minutes.</li>
            <li> As a stylist of African American Clients, I have to deal with a lot of excessively dry relaxed damage hair. My go to product for the last year has been Loreal Kerastase Oleo Deep treatment which has my clients keep returning for more. But because times are hard, people simple cant afford to splurge for my treatments.$60 a jar, ($20 Treatment) I decided to do my homework and find something equivalent. That&#x27;s when I discovered Kera Pro Restorative which claimed to be just as good as Kerastase . I figured for $9, at least it would be a fairly decent product if left on hair for half an hour under heat. CAN I TELL YOU! This Kera Pro Stuff is MAGNIFICENT! In less than five minutes my Clients dry bushy brillo-like hair was like melted butter silk! I kid you not. Even after blow drying! If I didn&#x27;t look at the jar I would have sworn I had used the last bit of Kerastase! Seriously, if you are looking for a miracle product for less, this is certainly the Stuff! Try it! you&#x27;ll be a believer! Note: I still recommend leaving it in for at least 20 minutes for superior results on relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, along with the shampoo, based on all the positive reviews. I bought it from Sundance Beauty. Since I am a first time user, I don&#x27;t know whether I received a legit product or an altered one. What I can say for sure is that this deep conditioner that I received did not live up to the reviews. First of all, I would like to say that when I opened the conditioner container, it actually looked and smelled like the Udderly Smooth Body and Udder Cream. So, again, I&#x27;m not sure what was actually in the container. Anyway, I left it on longer than it was suggested, so I don&#x27;t know if that affected the outcome negatively, although I wouldn&#x27;t think so. My hair felt soft after using both the shampoo and the deep conditioner; however, my hair looked very frizzy when it dried out. I put on a serum on my wet hair right after I washed and conditioned it, but that&#x27;s my usual routine and my hair has never dried like that before. I&#x27;ve used other deep conditioners that are way better than this. This was definitely money down the drain. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Kerapro makes great products. This restorative treatment makes my hair feel soft and easy to comb after washing.</li>
            <li> I have African American relaxed hair. I normally moisturize with a leave-in conditioner and seal my hair with oil. I typically stay away from products with dimethicones, but a friend suggested that I try this product to condition and moisturize. I figured it would be okay since it would be washed out after use. It left my hair feeling slick and mushy. It didn&#x27;t like the feel of it. Perhaps, my hair wasn&#x27;t dry enough to need this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of conditioners, and so far I like this one the best. It can be used with or without heat, and it never fails to leave my hair moisturized, yet strong. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my boyfriend, and if anyone asks I&#x27;ll recommend it to them too.</li>
            <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
            <li> This creamy treatment smells nice. Haven&#x27;t noticed anything different in my hair yet, but have hope that soon it&#x27;ll work. If it doesn&#x27;t, I won&#x27;t buy it agin.</li>
