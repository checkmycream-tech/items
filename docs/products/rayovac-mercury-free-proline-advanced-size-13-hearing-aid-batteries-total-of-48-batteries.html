            <li> Some of the batteries did not seem to last as long as others and also those I have purchased in a local store.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li> ALA Prime Bought these based on the reviews as I always make my decisions based on the ratio of positive comment to the negative ones</li>
            <li> I was told today not to purchase hearing aid batteries on Amazon because they may have not been stored properly, loose their quality and don&#x27;t last until their expiration date.</li>
            <li> will last a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last at least a week of 12 hour days on my hearing aids</li>
            <li> /&gt;They don&#x27;t compare in any way to the Pro One batteries I was previously using.  </li>
            <li> much less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when the expiration date is way in the future for reasons I don&#x27;t know why the batteries are not good.</li>
            <li> I placed a battery yesterday and today audiologist checked the battery and mentioned that this battery was not good anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Rayovac Proline size 13A batteries and their performance is poor.  </li>
            <li> Silly writing reviews for hearing aid batteries?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The batteries I purchased do not last longer than 1-2 days, despite having expiration date in 2018. I placed a battery yesterday and today audiologist checked the battery and mentioned that this battery was not good anymore. I was told today not to purchase hearing aid batteries on Amazon because they may have not been stored properly, loose their quality and don&#x27;t last until their expiration date.</li>
            <li> great way to buy hearing aid batteries. they are cheaper than buying from the pharmacy and you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Buy them and never look back - best value in hearing aid batteries we&#x27;ve run across!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about them</li>
            <li> great battery longest lasting we&#x27;ve had best value</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my mom.  She likes them.</li>
            <li> Some of the batteries did not seem to last as long as others and also those I have purchased in a local store.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Rayovac Proline size 13A batteries and their performance is poor.  Sometimes I have to use three or four in an afternoon just to find on that will last a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t compare in any way to the Pro One batteries I was previously using.  I&#x27;m going back to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rayovac are also overpriced.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my mom&#x27;s hearing aids and they appear to work fine.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my audiologist</li>
            <li> good batteries, have had a couple go out within a few hours.</li>
            <li> these batteries are much better than the other size that I used with different hearing aides....... They last a few days more than the size 10.</li>
            <li> same product I have bought at Walmart, but much less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My aid uses a full battery every day. I am learning how to adjust it ...adapting, as it were.&amp;#60;G&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I tried these batteries, as they are the only brand my Audiologist sells.  Sure enough, they provide maximum power for the longest time compared to other brands of batteries.  The quality of these batteries is consistent and reliable.</li>
            <li> These batteries are premium quality, priced very reasonably and were shipped within hours of ordering.</li>
            <li> I have been using hearing aides with size 13 batteries for 21 years. RayOvac have always been the best and these are the best yet. Most batteries I get 7-8 days. These are lasting 12-14 days.</li>
            <li> Great price for the amount of batteries. They just don&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine although i have only started to use them Price was great and of course shipping was fast.ALA Prime Bought these based on the reviews as I always make my decisions based on the ratio of positive comment to the negative ones Thanks to all who take the time to review these items as they are invaluable to us to make an intelligent and successful choice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand in the past and have been happy with them.  Received the batteries quickly and I noted the expiration date is&lt;br /&gt;September Two Thousand Seventeen.  Seems if I put the date in numerical form, the powers that be refuses to post my comments.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries were received quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Probably the longest lasting batteries I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have used the batteries for my hearing aid for many years. This latest product is the same as earlier ones, dependable, long-lasting, and affordable. I recommend it to anyone wearing hearing aid.</li>
            <li> Long life and consistent power delivery until they die.</li>
            <li> Batteries each last app. 20 days, which is considerably longer than the batteries that came with the hearing aid. THANKS!</li>
            <li> very good service and price</li>
            <li> Good price and no replacement problems.  We will buy again as we use a lot of these batteries.  Satisfied Customer.</li>
            <li> They are handy to have.  Last at least a week of 12 hour days on my hearing aids</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, fresh batteries.&lt;br /&gt;These last the longest of all tried brands in my Phonak HAs.&lt;br /&gt;Best price I&#x27;ve seen too.</li>
            <li> Silly writing reviews for hearing aid batteries? Not at all. I have bought many brands which I do at various places most notably the pharmacy. Even when the expiration date is way in the future for reasons I don&#x27;t know why the batteries are not good. Are counterfeits a problem with hearing aid batteries? In any event these are the real deal and come fresh and very long lasting. I got these immediately (next day regular delivery). Amazon is going to be my source from here on end. Price is very good too!</li>
            <li> Always buy from here. Great price, long life.</li>
            <li> Love it, i am happy with my purchase, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Purchased many of these. Wish they lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Approved return promptly and offered to replace with the new requested size. Hassle free and excellent service. Would use again.</li>
