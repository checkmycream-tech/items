            <li>The took a while to get here, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>it adds a nice little flair to the ends of your eyes and looks very sweet.</li>
            <li>: It is easy to make you get rid of residues in the edge of eyelash, being natural gum</li>
            <li>These are great for me and hardly anyone notice that I&#x27;m even wearing them.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely precious and add just enough to your lashes to make the wing shape.</li>
            <li>give you just enough &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to make your eyes look more sultry.</li>
            <li>The lashes are really durable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are comfortable &amp; this K-ma 4 lashes is looks really natural, which is i like.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>so if you prefer more drama, buy a different number but def.</li>
            <li>These look like real lashes!</li>
            <li>This was the second set I ordered, I love the way it made my eyes pop.  </li>
            <li>: You can feel relived to use vegetable gum which has superior adhesive strength But not easy to get rid of residues in the edge of eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I love having long lashes</li>
            <li>Normally, I would only be able to wear lashes like this for a day..</li>
            <li>this cute little ditty&#x27;s are worth every star.</li>
            <li>the k-ma 4 makes more sense now that they&#x27;ve arrived because they smaller/ shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li>They are much cuter than they look.</li>
            <li>They are very durable.</li>
            <li>Came as described and fast</li>
            <li>the strip is very pliable.  </li>

            <li>&gt; Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>They are not very dramatic or thick, it is a nice look.</li>
            <li>They are very settle and natural looking however</li>
            <li>The trick is to place them right above your lash line after you put on your eyeliner.</li>
            <li>They look very natural, but give you that sweep a the end.  </li>
            <li>good and comfy, but just not good enough</li>
            <li>Very short - shorter than my real eye lashes.</li>
            <li>I used the yellow glue and it sticks really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;How to use: Paste natural gum arabic to Darkness eyelash and affix  it on to your eyelash in a hurry.</li>
            <li>but I like the natural look.  </li>
            <li>These are so pretty, just the right size, don&#x27;t look fake at all can wear everyday, very fun to wear makes you feel pretty, recommend.</li>
            <li>This pair is not as natural looking because it just suddenly flares at the end.</li>

            <li> These arrived way faster than I had expected (which is always a plus!)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> so I will just by one of the other numbers.  </li>

            <li> These are way to small for my eyes.</li>
            <li> I realized they were to small for my eyes</li>
            <li> /&gt;These false lashes create a subtle dolly look without over dramatizing.</li>
            <li> Dont be affraid of these false lashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very subtle.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless</li>
            <li> buy Darkness False Lashes!  </li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very short - shorter than my real eye lashes. Absolutely useless</li>
            <li> I love this eyelashes every cute</li>
            <li> 1. These arrived way faster than I had expected (which is always a plus!)&lt;br /&gt;2. The price wasn&#x27;t too bad&lt;br /&gt;3. I think the k-ma 4 makes more sense now that they&#x27;ve arrived because they smaller/ shorter than I expected. They will still do the job just fine but they&#x27;ll need to be placed closer to the outside lid.&lt;br /&gt;4. I would purchase again and plan on it! I already have others saved on my wishlist!</li>
            <li> Dont be affraid of these false lashes. They are much cuter than they look. it adds a nice little flair to the ends of your eyes and looks very sweet. They are not very dramatic or thick, it is a nice look.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very subtle. They are absolutely precious and add just enough to your lashes to make the wing shape. They are super comfortable and easy to apply. I did not use the two tubes it came with because I couldn&#x27;t identify either. I will be buying again from this brand.</li>
            <li> super cute. my second pair of false eyelashes ever. like the other reviewers said, they look very dramatic in the box, but when you actually put them on they look surprisingly natural - my friends couldn&#x27;t tell i had falsies on at all. :)</li>
            <li> These are the best lashes! I love half lashes and these give you just enough &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to make your eyes look more sultry.</li>
            <li> After wearing these once, I decided to also buy K-ma 3 because of the quality. Admittedly, I prefer K-ma 3&#x27;s style, but I love the fit of these more because no trimming is involved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are really beautiful lashes and the flair of length at the ends are flirty.  The lashes are more on the light/natural side so I would definitely suggest taking a step up to spikier lashes if you&#x27;re looking for lashes for a night with flash photography, as these would not get picked up. Darkness Brand lashes, in general, are great quality no matter which style you choose. The lashes are really durable! The glues are not bad either. I used the yellow glue and it sticks really well but it&#x27;s SO sticky that it&#x27;s tedious to clean the lashes. So, I use my Duo, but only because that peels off easier (but it&#x27;s probably not as strong).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes for this style came with an English translation for the glue and instructions for each one (my K-ma 3 lashes only came with korean). Here they are (verbatim grammar) :&lt;br /&gt;Including 2 kinds of Darkness eyelash depending on customer&#x27;s taste!&lt;br /&gt;1) White container: It is easy to make you get rid of residues in the edge of eyelash, being natural gum arabic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use: Paste natural gum arabic to Darkness eyelash and affix  it on to your eyelash in a hurry. To reuse Darkness eyelash, get rid of residues on it lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Yellow container: You can feel relived to use vegetable gum which has superior adhesive strength But not easy to get rid of residues in the edge of eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use: Paste vegetable gum on it and wait about 90 seconds until white gum becomes transparent, before sticking it on your eyeline.</li>
            <li> They are GREAT. Just what I was looking for.  I used to purchase the same when I was in Asia</li>
            <li> durable and easy to use; my faves</li>
            <li> Love this lashes, i bought 2 pair of it &amp; i cant get it enough using it.&lt;br /&gt;They are comfortable &amp; this K-ma 4 lashes is looks really natural, which is i like.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> good product but you can easily see the line where you put them on&lt;br /&gt;its good and comfy, but just not good enough</li>
            <li> These are so pretty, just the right size, don&#x27;t look fake at all can wear everyday, very fun to wear makes you feel pretty, recommend.</li>
            <li> My eyes never looked better in these. All my friends think my lashes look so pretty and natural but they no nothing mwahahahaha</li>
            <li> These are way to small for my eyes. I&#x27;m new to false eyelashes and didn&#x27;t know they came in different sizes.once I realized they were to small for my eyes I thought about it and realized that of course there are different sizes of eyes. So just be aware these are for small eyes</li>
            <li> I own these and the K-ma 5. This pair is not as natural looking because it just suddenly flares at the end. I think it might work if you use two types of lashes together and use these to create the flare on another pair. I prefer the K-ma 5.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful on and look very real.  I have wore them a couple of times, taken them off and cleaned them, and put them on again.  They are very durable.</li>
            <li> Came as described and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These false lashes create a subtle dolly look without over dramatizing. Works great with circle lens and makeup! I love it, thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I love having long lashes but I like the natural look.  These are great for me and hardly anyone notice that I&#x27;m even wearing them. The trick is to place them right above your lash line after you put on your eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Ok, I think its almost impossible for a product on here to get 5 stars but I got to say..this cute little ditty&#x27;s are worth every star. They are very settle and natural looking however so if you prefer more drama, buy a different number but def. buy Darkness False Lashes!  These look like real lashes! They feel super natural and i have NEVER purchased eyelashes from another company where i loved the glue almost as much as the lashes.  They call the one in the yellow bottle (you get two diff types)..so kind of gumglue.  Well..this stuff sticks! It stays! The lashes stay on until you take them off.  Normally, I would only be able to wear lashes like this for a day..these stayed on until I took them off! Perfect.  I wont to buy the larger bottle but im not sure where to find this exact one just yet.  I purchased a 2nd pair in a different number and cant wait to try those but these are perfect for a natural, no mascara look and I always love the slight winged look..perfect!  No cons with this one.  I want them a bit thicker so I will just by one of the other numbers.  However this one is most perfect for those who do not want to look like they are wearing lashes but still want a nice sexy eye.  Get it girls.  In fact..buy multiple pair! You wont regret it!</li>
            <li> This was the second set I ordered, I love the way it made my eyes pop.  The only problem was the glue, I didn&#x27;t know which one to use, so I used the adhesive I already had on hand for another set of lashes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these eyelashes. The took a while to get here, but it was worth it.  They are light and feathery and feel like I don&#x27;t have any falsies on! They look very natural, but give you that sweep a the end.  They go on about 3/4 of your eye and the strip is very pliable.  It was very easy to put them on (thanks to the awesome glue that comes with them) and after wearing them for 6 hours I had to touch them to make sure they were still on my eyes! They were that comfortable and still looked great! Love them.</li>
