            <li>First of all, I want to say that this is the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice as well.  </li>
            <li>skin is oily on the T-zone and normal everywhere else, and this is the perfect moisturizer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly into my skin and makes my makeup foundation go on perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Smells sort of floral and lovely.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product</li>
            <li>I love the texture of my skin and this product does not clog my pores at all.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this moisturizer!!  </li>
            <li>I love all the Arcona products and have bought these products and sent them to my friends to try.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and does a great job of preventing blemishes as well (especially the hormonal kind we women tend to get).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>go to Nordstrom atleast you can easily return it.</li>
            <li>It goes on cool and is magic.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product with nontoxic ingredients, lovely smell, easy absorption, serious moisturizing and noticeable results.</li>
            <li>The smell and the feel of Magic White Ice is amazing.</li>
            <li>Many have raved about this product, but I don&#x27;t feel it is very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Magic White ice for years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel this would be good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>very light consistency, pleasant smell, and above all, caused absolutely no irritation to my super sensitive skin, glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>Another option for winter months is the Magic Dry Ice (more moisturizing), though I have yet to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the cranberry firming gel over this, and will not purchase this again if the firming gel is available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using Philosophy products now, and although I miss the smell and feel, and the natural ingredients of Arcona, my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend spending the extra money on this product, as it is worth it to have nice skin!</li>
            <li>ARCONA makes one called Hydrating Serum - you can apply that first and layer White Ice on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Magic White Ice rocks!!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use Arcona Magic White</li>
            <li>When I talked to the Arcona representative about the first one, she told me to push the bottom of the pump up from the hole in the bottom (or try to take the bottom off altogether which I couldn&#x27;t do at first).</li>
            <li>I wish I had thought about this the first time around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and applies to wet skin easily.  </li>
            <li>It took me a little bit to get used to their full line of products, but I truly believe its helped me understand my skin more than ever.</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rotated out most of the other Arcona products but this one is a staple in every cycle.    </li>
            <li>My face becomes less oily and bright all day long!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what more I can say other than that I am totally in love with this stuff and hope I can buy it forever.  </li>
            <li>For dry skin, I would recommend a more hydrating serum or lotion (not a cream necessarily).</li>
            <li>If it works right, all it does is push product up so that there is product around the actual pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this natural product for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li>You really end up having to dig for the product when trying to get the last 1/6 of the product out.</li>
            <li>My husband mentioned that my skin seemed &amp;#34;papery&amp;#34; which is not what 37 year old skin should be.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and is not too heavy or too light.  </li>
            <li>I am 52 years old and still experience occasional adult acne.  </li>
            <li>This is the only moisturizer I can use aside from plain old sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>and I can barely get a pump out of the container.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect moisture base to but on before daily sunscreen, especially during the summer.</li>
            <li>Its really too bad because the product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Arcona&#x27;s theory of natural hydration, rather that moisturization really helped me realize I was overdoing heavy lotions on my skin.</li>
            <li>Fair product, very poor packaging, not worth the price.</li>

            <li> I like the product.  It&#x27;s light and applies to wet skin easily.  However the pump was broken after the second or third use which makes me believe the person selling bought a defectivelot of bottles.  Unfortunately I now have to dig it out so I would not recommend buying on Amazon....go to Nordstrom atleast you can easily return it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize well and it doesn&#x27;t pump well. I have over half of it left and I can barely get a pump out of the container. Fair product, very poor packaging, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I can use aside from plain old sweet almond oil. It is very lightweight and absorbs quickly. Smells sort of floral and lovely. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and does a great job of preventing blemishes as well (especially the hormonal kind we women tend to get).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel this would be good for dry skin.

            <li> very light consistency, pleasant smell, and above all, caused absolutely no irritation to my super sensitive skin, glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Works great! A little goes a long way! It&#x27;s great for oily skin and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Doesn&#x27;t make face greasy and absorbs into skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this natural product for about 2 years now. It&#x27;s the perfect moisture base to but on before daily sunscreen, especially during the summer. I&#x27;ve taken days off of the White Ice here and there during the winter, when its just not enough moisture for me. Arcona&#x27;s theory of natural hydration, rather that moisturization really helped me realize I was overdoing heavy lotions on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and I have NEVER had a problem with this one. It took me a little bit to get used to their full line of products, but I truly believe its helped me understand my skin more than ever. I have to have a bottle or two of this in the bathroom at all times. I&#x27;ve rotated out most of the other Arcona products but this one is a staple in every cycle.    The only complaint I have with this is the packaging. You really end up having to dig for the product when trying to get the last 1/6 of the product out. Its a really bad pump and I&#x27;m not sure why they haven&#x27;t or adjusted the packaging. Its really too bad because the product is amazing. I am so in love with this product but I think that the packaging brings me down to a 4 star overall review.</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and still experience occasional adult acne.  It has been very difficult finding a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t encourage break outs. Magic White Ice rocks!! I love the texture of my skin and this product does not clog my pores at all. I love it!  This is my third bottle. It is THE only thing I use for hydration.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use Arcona Magic White and I love it. It will save me this summer. My face becomes less oily and bright all day long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what more I can say other than that I am totally in love with this stuff and hope I can buy it forever.  I was sick of greasy moisturizers and this was recommended to me.  It is light but hydrating, smells wonderful, and feels really good when you put it on.  It works great under makeup.  I find that I need to supplement with a thick moisturizer at night during the super dry winter months, but other than that it is my go-to!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that feel good on your skin.  it is pricey though so I can not always afford it.</li>
            <li> The smell and the feel of Magic White Ice is amazing. I used it for almost six months but it really didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin very well. My husband mentioned that my skin seemed &amp;#34;papery&amp;#34; which is not what 37 year old skin should be. I had to move on. I&#x27;m using Philosophy products now, and although I miss the smell and feel, and the natural ingredients of Arcona, my skin looks better. Sigh.</li>
            <li> The product smells terrific, but I can&#x27;t help but feel like it was the biggest waste of money with the packaging design. From the first pump, it is incredibly difficult to get the product out. I can only imagine how hard it will be when I near the end of the serum. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Many have raved about this product, but I don&#x27;t feel it is very hydrating.  I much prefer the cranberry firming gel over this, and will not purchase this again if the firming gel is available.  I have to use the desert mist over this to get the hydration I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product with nontoxic ingredients, lovely smell, easy absorption, serious moisturizing and noticeable results. It goes on cool and is magic.</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to say that this is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It&#x27;s like wearable silk. That being said, I&#x27;m on my second jumbo size and both have had faulty pumps. When I talked to the Arcona representative about the first one, she told me to push the bottom of the pump up from the hole in the bottom (or try to take the bottom off altogether which I couldn&#x27;t do at first). All that did was poke a hole in the bottom of the pump and a ton of product leaked out. Thankfully I noticed in time and taped the hole shut but I still had product between the pump and the bottom. I did end up forcing the bottom off and getting the product out that way - messy to say in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time, I decided to use my smarts. I realized that the bottom of the pump was actually quite useless as it&#x27;s not connected to the top in any way. If it works right, all it does is push product up so that there is product around the actual pump dispenser. The pump dispenser then pushes the product out. So, I let gravity do the work instead. I store the bottle upside down and now I get perfect pumps every time! I wish I had thought about this the first time around. Sharing this tip in case anyone else is being driven nuts by the bottle.</li>
            <li> I had a facial and the spa I went to used Arcona products.  I really loved the way my skin felt, so bought the moisturizer.  I have been very happy with the results.  It is a lightweight moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling hydrated and no greasy.  I would definitely recommend spending the extra money on this product, as it is worth it to have nice skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Magic White ice for years and absolutely love it.  It smells amazing (with being perfume-y) and is the perfect weight for my combination skin.  Another option for winter months is the Magic Dry Ice (more moisturizing), though I have yet to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this moisturizer!!  It is perfect in every way.  I have oily skin and use this every day.  It moisturizes and is not too heavy or too light.  It smells really nice as well.  It is absorbed quickly into my skin and makes my makeup foundation go on perfectly.  I love all the Arcona products and have bought these products and sent them to my friends to try.</li>
            <li> Love this product - smells good and is a great addition to my skincare routine</li>
