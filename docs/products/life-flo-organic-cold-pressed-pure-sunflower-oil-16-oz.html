            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Using this for the oil cleansing method for my face, and love it!  </li>
            <li>but I had an amazing experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Enter this huge bottle of sunflower oil for a great price.</li>
            <li>Nice oil to use for assorted reasons.</li>
            <li>In my research to make my own body products, I came across this brand.</li>
            <li>We always blend our own recipes customized to the needs of each woman.</li>
            <li>I do use this as a moisturizer after showers though and it has made my skin nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li>I got it fast and it is a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li>I found out that using oil was a good face moisturizer, and I wanted to try it out, but I didn&#x27;t want a huge price commitment.</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant, not strong at all, and perfect for its use!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling afterwards and my hands are so smooth!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Will probably not order again and go with another manufacturer who&#x27;s packaging is better designed.</li>
            <li>Give it a try :)</li>
            <li>THIS COMPANY CARRIES MANY SKINCARE OILS.</li>
            <li>Its safe for ingesting, too.</li>
            <li>and now they stopped buying it and ask me to make some more for them</li>
            <li>While it was okay, I found it slipperier than most sunflower oils I&#x27;ve used which is not my preference.  </li>
            <li>Item ok.</li>
            <li>I knew better than to put oil on my skin</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of that one.</li>
            <li>I love using sunflower oil for cooking and</li>
            <li>I love this sunflower oil.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my skin has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s a great price for the amount of oil and for the high quality you get.</li>
            <li>Nice size bottle and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>It seemed to me that any light colored oil that is ok to consume would be good for painting where you want a pure debris-free medium.&lt;br /&gt;Happy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My eyelashes and eyebrows feel silky smooth, too, so that&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
            <li>perfect for oil pulling, I tried other oils and couldn&#x27;t stand the scent/taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for external uses.  </li>
            <li>Easy on the skin and softness it too.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and is not oily at all.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>This oil is light and absorbs easily into my skin.</li>
            <li>I think it is reducing fine lines.</li>
            <li>Light and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and light.</li>
            <li>So I started adding a few drops of this oil to his bath water and his skin is now looking great!</li>
            <li>The sunflower oil is really light and smooth.</li>
            <li>So far so good in that department</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, and will order more when I run low.</li>
            <li>just try not swallow any significant amounts it</li>
            <li>After I got that healed with prescription ointment, I use this before and after class - has been working great &amp; have not developed the rash again.</li>
            <li>I bought this instead of Vitamin E oil to use in my homemade body products and it was SO worth it!</li>
            <li>Now I just have to figure out how to keep my tub clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and this oil is lovely in my hair!</li>
            <li>they replied right away saying it was fine to use for that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, tasty &amp; good for you, but not big enough.  </li>
            <li>Except I don&#x27;t wash this off (nor could you really without lots of effort); I let it sink into my skin, and my face has never been happier or looked better since.</li>
            <li>My skin is moisturized and feels so fresh and clean after each wash.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was well-packaged.</li>
            <li>IT CONTAINS GOOD INGREDIENTS TO HELP WITH DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li>Plus I don&#x27;t have to us extra face lotion because it leaves it so hydrated unlike most face washes from the store!</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer before bed during the winter months, and it always leaves my skin looking clear and bright and feeling soft!</li>
            <li>It is light and pure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a mix of about 1/4 castor oil, 3/4 sunflower seed, and a few drops of lavender for a great smell.  </li>
            <li>It does sit on the skin for awhile but absorbs pretty good as long as you do not use a whole bunch of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil to start trying out oil pulling, and I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I may try it again if I don&#x27;t find another one first.</li>
            <li>I use this for the oil cleansing method and it works really well!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used sunflower oil.</li>
            <li>I normally keep jojoba oil or Sweet almond oil in a spray bottle in the shower</li>
            <li>But first thing the bottles tells you:  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that is entirely pure (for the Oil Cleansing Method, for example), then look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>so it has to be pure to not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is not as thick as castor oil and makes it go on and off my skin more easily.</li>
            <li>absorbs very well into the skin.</li>
            <li>THANKS, AGAIN, AMAZON, FOR CARRYING THIS BRAND.</li>
            <li>I used this as a moisturizer and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>, I do not use a whole lot of it either.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand/company closed shop</li>
            <li>I was ready to resign myself to pimple-hood until I tried this.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for the first time last summer, when I decided to switch my entire hair/skin regimen to one that was (arguably) healthier and certainly more environmentally-friendly.</li>
            <li>Plenty of vitamin E along with lots of other vitamins makes this a much better choice.</li>
            <li>I wanted to recreate Burts Bees LipBalm since all my friends love that stuff but the price for it can become a little to much,</li>
            <li>I use this product in my lotion making, mainly for my face lotions.</li>
            <li>THATS WHY I TRUST THIS BRAND AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS PARTICULAR LINE OF SKINCARE.</li>
            <li>and they responded to me rather quickly and said as a one time courtesy, they would credit me back what I paid for it and said I didn&#x27;t have to return it, that I could keep it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this oil and this seller.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Bought this to blend my own formula to use as a facial cleanser - it&#x27;s called the European facial oil cleanse method.</li>
            <li>Any commercial face-wash, even those marked &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sensitive-skin&amp;#34; would leave me red and flakey and even more pimply than before.</li>
            <li>This oil smells so delicate and my skin is super smooth.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m searching for a new brand.  </li>
            <li>My new staple and fav</li>
            <li>I use this on my body as my skin gets super dry from water aerobics.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problem skin; acne-prone, yet very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for the cold weather hair frizzies.</li>
            <li>but I did it anyways after reading several articles about how &amp;#34;beneficial&amp;#34; oil really is for your skin.</li>
            <li>I wake up with soft (non-tight) skin.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue buying this (in 5 years when the one bottle finally runs out)!</li>
            <li>WOW, huh?</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>so it is difficult for me to fairly judge.</li>
            <li>) bit, less than a thimble full, around in my hands and spread it on my face almost like I&#x27;m applying face wash.</li>
            <li>Seriously, do yourself a favor and try it out. :)</li>
            <li>For hair it leaves it less frizzy without it being super greasy.</li>
            <li>In the past I had oily skin and this fought it making it so smooth.</li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils</li>
            <li>Melds very well with the other ingredients and makes my skin so soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S A LARGE BOTTLE AND WILL LAST A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li>LIFE FLO IS A GOOD COMPANY AND MAKES THEIR PRODUCTS COLD PRESSED AND ALWAYS ORGANIC.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel afterwards, soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t leave a grease slick in my shower.  </li>

            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to start trying out oil pulling, and I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> I may try it again if I don&#x27;t find another one first.</li>
            <li> I use this for the oil cleansing method and it works really well!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used sunflower oil.</li>
            <li> I normally keep jojoba oil or Sweet almond oil in a spray bottle in the shower</li>
            <li> But first thing the bottles tells you:  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that is entirely pure (for the Oil Cleansing Method, for example), then look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> so it has to be pure to not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as castor oil and makes it go on and off my skin more easily.</li>
            <li> absorbs very well into the skin.</li>
            <li> THANKS, AGAIN, AMAZON, FOR CARRYING THIS BRAND.</li>
            <li> I used this as a moisturizer and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> , I do not use a whole lot of it either.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand/company closed shop</li>
            <li> I was ready to resign myself to pimple-hood until I tried this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for the first time last summer, when I decided to switch my entire hair/skin regimen to one that was (arguably) healthier and certainly more environmentally-friendly.</li>
            <li> Plenty of vitamin E along with lots of other vitamins makes this a much better choice.</li>
            <li> I wanted to recreate Burts Bees LipBalm since all my friends love that stuff but the price for it can become a little to much,</li>
            <li> I use this product in my lotion making, mainly for my face lotions.</li>
            <li> THATS WHY I TRUST THIS BRAND AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS PARTICULAR LINE OF SKINCARE.</li>
            <li> and they responded to me rather quickly and said as a one time courtesy, they would credit me back what I paid for it and said I didn&#x27;t have to return it, that I could keep it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this oil and this seller.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this to blend my own formula to use as a facial cleanser - it&#x27;s called the European facial oil cleanse method.</li>
            <li> Any commercial face-wash, even those marked &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sensitive-skin&amp;#34; would leave me red and flakey and even more pimply than before.</li>
            <li> This oil smells so delicate and my skin is super smooth.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m searching for a new brand.  </li>
            <li> My new staple and fav</li>
            <li> I use this on my body as my skin gets super dry from water aerobics.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problem skin; acne-prone, yet very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for the cold weather hair frizzies.</li>
            <li> but I did it anyways after reading several articles about how &amp;#34;beneficial&amp;#34; oil really is for your skin.</li>
            <li> I wake up with soft (non-tight) skin.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely continue buying this (in 5 years when the one bottle finally runs out)!</li>
            <li> WOW, huh?</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> so it is difficult for me to fairly judge.</li>
            <li> ) bit, less than a thimble full, around in my hands and spread it on my face almost like I&#x27;m applying face wash.</li>
            <li> Seriously, do yourself a favor and try it out. :)</li>
            <li> For hair it leaves it less frizzy without it being super greasy.</li>
            <li> In the past I had oily skin and this fought it making it so smooth.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils</li>
            <li> Melds very well with the other ingredients and makes my skin so soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A LARGE BOTTLE AND WILL LAST A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> LIFE FLO IS A GOOD COMPANY AND MAKES THEIR PRODUCTS COLD PRESSED AND ALWAYS ORGANIC.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel afterwards, soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t leave a grease slick in my shower.  </li>
            <li> It has become my new moisturizer and has dramatically reduced the acne I typically get from moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This process was met with mixed results (I&#x27;ve had little luck with natural shampoos and deodorants...)</li>
            <li> It does absorb into the skin well &amp; the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> i only use it a little after I deep condition my hair BUTTT</li>
            <li> I use this for  facial cleansing along with other organic oils</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to clear up my hormonal acne, from OTC chemical laden things, to raw honey.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin living in Wisconsin in the winters.</li>
            <li> Winter is coming and I was looking for an oil that would keep me from getting scaly dry skin.</li>
            <li> The plastic tab under the cap was bent to the side and the cap was loose.  </li>
            <li> It works to cleanse and hydrate my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> you may want to be careful as this does have vitamin E in it which can clog pores.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t dry or flakey and doesn&#x27;t get that tight, dry feeling that other lotions and moisturizers might give you when you know they aren&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower, massage a little bit onto my face, sometime mixed with some raw honey for a sugar-scrub effect, let it steam, and then wipe it all off with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> My skin is silky smooth and barely has a blemish, even during times when I should have bad hormonal breakouts!</li>
            <li> A very little bit of this goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> The flavor is not very strong.</li>
            <li> and now I use less products in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a drier oil than the jojoba I had used previously.</li>
            <li> no more dry skin!!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant since the title of this item is &amp;</li>
            <li> I mix about a tablespoon of this oil with a few drops of argan oil and apply it to my face and skin before I shower.</li>
            <li> I also use this oil on my skin all over, but I especially like to apply a thin layer on my face before bed.  </li>
            <li> Takes off your makeup without any harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a quality issue from someone opening the bottle or just bumps of travel from manufacturing to customer.  </li>
            <li> Not sure of the benefits yet.  </li>
            <li> Not many companies will do that now-a-days.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has terrible eczema and we&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li> How disappointing.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re skeptical about putting oil on your face, go with your gut instinct!</li>
            <li> I had to visit the dermatologist when I broke out in horrible body rash.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am using it for a homemade facewash with castor oil and tea tree oil. Does the job. Arrived quickly and was well-packaged.</li>
            <li> I use this in my OCM solution and have found it works great!</li>
            <li> Nice oil to use for assorted reasons.</li>
            <li> I use this with castor oil as a face cleanser. It is not as thick as castor oil and makes it go on and off my skin more easily. My skin is moisturized and feels so fresh and clean after each wash. My eyelashes and eyebrows feel silky smooth, too, so that&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I use this product in my lotion making, mainly for my face lotions. Melds very well with the other ingredients and makes my skin so soft and moisturised. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Idk why I brought this, it&#x27;s a good carrier oil...i guess.</li>
            <li> Product was received open and leaking from the box.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling afterwards and my hands are so smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought this to swish for tooth and gums and didn&#x27;t know if you could use it for that or not after I had bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I sent a email asking them about swishing and they replied right away saying it was fine to use for that just try not swallow any significant amounts it and u don&#x27;t do that swishing anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this now twice and will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I put it all over my skin.  Love this.</li>
            <li> I received this product and it was leaking all over the box.  The plastic tab under the cap was bent to the side and the cap was loose.  Not sure if this was a quality issue from someone opening the bottle or just bumps of travel from manufacturing to customer.  Either way, it makes me wonder if the oil was exposed to anything unsanitary.  Will probably not order again and go with another manufacturer who&#x27;s packaging is better designed.</li>
            <li> This oil is light and absorbs easily into my skin. It has become my new moisturizer and has dramatically reduced the acne I typically get from moisturizers. I am very pleased with this product, and will order more when I run low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT I RECOMMENDED IN FACT IM RE ORDERING</li>
            <li> I was looking for sunflower seed oil to use for the oil cleansing method (OCM) facial cleansing routine. I checked pharmacies in my area and also the local health food stores, but could not find any sunflower seed oil. This was exactly what I was looking for. I was a little hesitant since the title of this item is &amp;#34;Sunflower Oil&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;Sunflower SEED Oil&amp;#34; but it is sunflower seed oil (ingredients list). Also it&#x27;s a great price for the amount of oil and for the high quality you get.</li>
            <li> perfect for my hair!! Nice size bottle and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Product is what it claims to be.  I am new to essential oils so it is difficult for me to fairly judge.</li>
            <li> Excellent...I use it in my hand made lotions.  Doctoral Candidate P. Roulier</li>
            <li> absorbs very well into the skin. Its also non comedogenic. This will help with acne prone skin. For hair it leaves it less frizzy without it being super greasy. Would buy again. Give it a try :)</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY AND GOOD PRODUCT TO HAVE AROUND. IT CONTAINS GOOD INGREDIENTS TO HELP WITH DRY SKIN. IT&#x27;S A LARGE BOTTLE AND WILL LAST A LONG TIME. LIFE FLO IS A GOOD COMPANY AND MAKES THEIR PRODUCTS COLD PRESSED AND ALWAYS ORGANIC. THIS COMPANY CARRIES MANY SKINCARE OILS. THATS WHY I TRUST THIS BRAND AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS PARTICULAR LINE OF SKINCARE. THANKS, AGAIN, AMAZON, FOR CARRYING THIS BRAND.</li>
            <li> In my research to make my own body products, I came across this brand. It&#x27;s a great price and worked well in my sugar scrub recipes.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I have really dry hair and I use this in my hair along with conditioner! Love it and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, tasty &amp; good for you, but not big enough.  I would prefer a bigger bottle, maybe 32 oz.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to start trying out oil pulling, and I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle.  The flavor isn&#x27;t too strong,  which is great!</li>
            <li> Bought this to blend my own formula to use as a facial cleanser - it&#x27;s called the European facial oil cleanse method. I&#x27;m of French ancestors whose women have used the oil method for generations. We always blend our own recipes customized to the needs of each woman. Now brand of oil is the purest, clearest, and the cleanest I&#x27;ve found. Its safe for ingesting, too. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and shipped quickly. Highly recommend this oil and this seller.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin living in Wisconsin in the winters. I used this as a moisturizer and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great a skin care for both woman and man. It&#x27;s not too greasy and light. I gave it to my brother who refuses to use the men&#x27;s skin care lines.</li>
            <li> Note that this is NOT 100% sunflower oil.  There is Vitamin E added to the product.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that is entirely pure (for the Oil Cleansing Method, for example), then look elsewhere.  I had to return this product, as Vitamin E clogs pores.</li>
            <li> The producer claims the oil is 100% sunflower oil. When i receive the bottle and read the description, it is mixed with Vitamin E; this is misleading.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to clear up my hormonal acne, from OTC chemical laden things, to raw honey. Nothing seemed to work. This in conjunction with Tamanu oil is helping my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both this and Life-Flo&#x27;s Tamanu Oil and use them to oil cleanse my face. I use the sunflower as the oil cleanser and then I put the tamanu oil on as a moisturizer. A very little bit of this goes a very long way. It does sit on the skin for awhile but absorbs pretty good as long as you do not use a whole bunch of it. I have been using this for about two weeks now with Tamanu oil and I have never seen my face clearer, except for before hormones took over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this for your face you may want to be careful as this does have vitamin E in it which can clog pores. I have not had any problems using it on my face, I do not use a whole lot of it either. I do use this as a moisturizer after showers though and it has made my skin nice and moisturized. It isn&#x27;t dry or flakey and doesn&#x27;t get that tight, dry feeling that other lotions and moisturizers might give you when you know they aren&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this product again, this is a must for my facial regimen.</li>
            <li> I wanted to recreate Burts Bees LipBalm since all my friends love that stuff but the price for it can become a little to much, So i found a great replica recipe and now they stopped buying it and ask me to make some more for them, All i need to do is find some non-liquid food coloring to make them tinted.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it for cooking but the description didn&#x27;t mention that it wasn&#x27;t for cooking but for external body use only!  How disappointing.</li>
            <li> I got it fast and it is a good product at a great price. This was the perfect size for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Sunflower oil - its a grocery item, what is there to say?  It is what it claims!</li>
            <li> This oil smells so delicate and my skin is super smooth. I love it!</li>
            <li> I mix about a tablespoon of this oil with a few drops of argan oil and apply it to my face and skin before I shower. It works to cleanse and hydrate my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use sunflower oil almost exclusively in my massage practice.  My favorite brand/company closed shop so I&#x27;m searching for a new brand.  Life-Flo is the second one I&#x27;ve tried.  While it was okay, I found it slipperier than most sunflower oils I&#x27;ve used which is not my preference.  I may try it again if I don&#x27;t find another one first.</li>
            <li> I use this on my body as my skin gets super dry from water aerobics.  I had to visit the dermatologist when I broke out in horrible body rash.  After I got that healed with prescription ointment, I use this before and after class - has been working great &amp; have not developed the rash again. It does absorb into the skin well &amp; the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this for the oil cleansing method and it works really well!</li>
            <li> This oil was perfect for infant massage! It has no scent, it&#x27;s absorbs very easily into the skin, and it a great value buy.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and this oil is lovely in my hair! i only use it a little after I deep condition my hair BUTTT I mix it in my body lotion and it&#x27;s amazing! no more dry skin!!</li>
            <li> Great oil...I use it after sun bathing....Feels great.</li>
            <li> Good quality, very nice smell.</li>
            <li> Received as advertised</li>
            <li> Love it! I ordered this product for the first time last summer, when I decided to switch my entire hair/skin regimen to one that was (arguably) healthier and certainly more environmentally-friendly. This process was met with mixed results (I&#x27;ve had little luck with natural shampoos and deodorants...) but I had an amazing experience with this product. I&#x27;ve always had problem skin; acne-prone, yet very sensitive. Any commercial face-wash, even those marked &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sensitive-skin&amp;#34; would leave me red and flakey and even more pimply than before. I was ready to resign myself to pimple-hood until I tried this. I use it in the shower, massage a little bit onto my face, sometime mixed with some raw honey for a sugar-scrub effect, let it steam, and then wipe it all off with a washcloth. I use it as a moisturizer before bed during the winter months, and it always leaves my skin looking clear and bright and feeling soft! It&#x27;s also great for the cold weather hair frizzies. Seriously, do yourself a favor and try it out. :)</li>
            <li> perfect for oil pulling, I tried other oils and couldn&#x27;t stand the scent/taste in my mouth. this is very effective for mouth care...</li>
            <li> I used this oil to make sugar scrubs as a bridal shower activity, good quality oil with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Used for the oil cleansing method, works great! It was the only cold-pressed sunflower seed oil that I could find!</li>
            <li> Item ok. They sent the safflower oil instead of sunflower.</li>
            <li> Using this for the oil cleansing method for my face, and love it!  I&#x27;m using a mix of about 1/4 castor oil, 3/4 sunflower seed, and a few drops of lavender for a great smell.  My skin is silky smooth and barely has a blemish, even during times when I should have bad hormonal breakouts!</li>
            <li> I knew better than to put oil on my skin but I did it anyways after reading several articles about how &amp;#34;beneficial&amp;#34; oil really is for your skin. Maybe for people who rarely/never get breakouts. Broke out ALL OVER my face after using twice. If you know your skin and you&#x27;re skeptical about putting oil on your face, go with your gut instinct!</li>
            <li> I am bi-racial with medium curly hair.  I started using this for my hair, it adds shine, reduced frizz, detangles, conditions and has repaired my split ends.  I love it and now I use less products in my hair.  I only use one of the Shea moisture leave-ins.  I also use this oil on my skin all over, but I especially like to apply a thin layer on my face before bed.  I wake up with soft (non-tight) skin.  I think it is reducing fine lines. :0)  This is a great multi-use product for a great price considering all the products I no longer buy and have replaced with Sunflower oil.</li>
            <li> Use it to wash my face as I oil cleanse. No issues.</li>
            <li> I found out that using oil was a good face moisturizer, and I wanted to try it out, but I didn&#x27;t want a huge price commitment. Enter this huge bottle of sunflower oil for a great price. After I wash my face in the shower, I rub a TINY (EMPHASIS ON TINY PLEASE YOU DO NOT WANT A LOT) bit, less than a thimble full, around in my hands and spread it on my face almost like I&#x27;m applying face wash. Except I don&#x27;t wash this off (nor could you really without lots of effort); I let it sink into my skin, and my face has never been happier or looked better since. I will absolutely continue buying this (in 5 years when the one bottle finally runs out)!</li>
            <li> I use this with my oil cleansing method and for oil pulling. The flavor is not very strong. It&#x27;s great on my skin!</li>
            <li> Used in soap, worked great...</li>
            <li> I use this for pulling and it works great. The taste isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used sunflower oil. I am using it as a carrier oil on my face with tea tree and frankincense. There is not any odor to it that I notice. It is a drier oil than the jojoba I had used previously.</li>
            <li> Chose this oil for oil cleansing method because I have oily skin in my t-zone area, and read reviews sunflower oil would be beneficial for this area of concern.</li>
            <li> I use this for &amp;#34;oiling&amp;#34;.  The taste is pleasant, not strong at all, and perfect for its use! I have ordered it several times.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has terrible eczema and we&#x27;ve tried everything. Some things work, but most of them are expensive. So I started adding a few drops of this oil to his bath water and his skin is now looking great! Now I just have to figure out how to keep my tub clean.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  I normally keep jojoba oil or Sweet almond oil in a spray bottle in the shower but I ran out of both and ordered sunflower oil instead.  I spritzed it on and rubbed it in a bit before drying off.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel afterwards, soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t leave a grease slick in my shower.  Winter is coming and I was looking for an oil that would keep me from getting scaly dry skin. I think I found it.</li>
            <li> I use this for  facial cleansing along with other organic oils so it has to be pure to not cause breakouts. So far so good in that department and I&#x27;ve been using over a month.</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised.  It was leaking a bit when I received it but it wasn&#x27;t a bit deal.</li>
            <li> I use Sunflower Oil in my skin moisturizing products mixed with Shea Butter and an essential oil for fragrance. Light and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for external uses.  But I ordered this one specifically because it claims to be FOOD GRADE, for internal and external uses.  But first thing the bottles tells you:  For external use only, not for internal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So watch out!  If you plan to use this internally, it is not graded for that.</li>
            <li> which it had a stronger sweeter smell.... like the sunflower oil that comes in the just for me texturizer kit. LOVE the smell of that one.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have this.... Takes off your makeup without any harsh chemicals.  Easy on the skin and softness it too. Love this stuff!!!.</li>
            <li> Use for oil pulling.  Not sure of the benefits yet.  Teeth don&#x27;t look any brighter, time will tell?</li>
            <li> Use this for oilpulling and saw a difference in the 1st week. Teeth were whiter and gums felt healthier!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to try doing the face wash with oils. This is amazing! In the past I had oily skin and this fought it making it so smooth. Plus I don&#x27;t have to us extra face lotion because it leaves it so hydrated unlike most face washes from the store!</li>
            <li> I chose this oil to paint with instead of linseed oil. It is light and pure. It seemed to me that any light colored oil that is ok to consume would be good for painting where you want a pure debris-free medium.&lt;br /&gt;Happy!&lt;br /&gt;I might make a salad too.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil witch I use for a lot of recipes and for massages. The texture is very good and the buttle is very strong.</li>
            <li> I love using sunflower oil for cooking and when I ordered this, that&#x27;s what I thought it was for. I didn&#x27;t notice that it was for skin and hair so this was totally my fault. I contacted the seller to ask if I could return it and they responded to me rather quickly and said as a one time courtesy, they would credit me back what I paid for it and said I didn&#x27;t have to return it, that I could keep it. WOW, huh? I was pleasantly surprised. Not many companies will do that now-a-days. GREAT customer service!!</li>
            <li> I love this sunflower oil.  After I researched the healing properties of Sunflower oil, I recently started using this as a moisturizer for my face as a part of my night time skin care routine. It absorbs very quickly and is not oily at all.  When I wake up in the morning my skin has a healthy glow.  I look forward to using this in my next batch of whipped body butter.  My new staple and fav</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of Vitamin E oil to use in my homemade body products and it was SO worth it! Plenty of vitamin E along with lots of other vitamins makes this a much better choice. I&#x27;m thrilled it&#x27;s organic and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> This is great oil! Absorbs very quickly. I bought the sunflower oil and also castor oil to try oil cleansing for my face. The sunflower oil is really light and smooth. I may start using it for my body balm. Will buy again.</li>
