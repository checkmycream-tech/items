            <li>Great for super oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have eczema on my face and sensative skin so far this the the best product for my combination of problems.  </li>
            <li>So far this product is the best use</li>
            <li>This product works great, it remives that oil and keeps your face fresh for hours.  </li>
            <li>I love this and bought it here since they stopped selling it in stores.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so satisfied</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for several years, and it&#x27;s one of the best for thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li>I have mostly oily skin, with some tendencies toward dryness in the T-zone.  </li>
            <li>Most oil-control products are applied after washing to create a matte effect.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect face wash, and since ALL my local stores stopped selling it I&#x27;ve taken to buying it online.  </li>
            <li>My favorite face watch.</li>
            <li>I have been using this since i love the gel.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Granted, fewer wrinkles as I get older is great, but blackheads, pimples, and looking like</li>
            <li>I am a licensed beauty professional, and I have no qualms spending money on a great product.</li>
            <li>well then was your face as it is a strong product.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mix enought water it can be too strong on the skin.</li>
            <li>It really cleans your face, but the best for me is the beeswax ingredient, which makes your skin feel smooth, clean and absolutely clear of oil.</li>
            <li>I have an oily face and have tried many products in the market that claim to do the job of de-greasing but without any tangible success.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth to the touch without feeling greasy for hours.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I was able to return it to the store for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous face wash products throughout my career and this is by far the best face wash of them all.</li>
            <li>I can use it every day and it leaves my skin feeling clean without drying.  </li>
            <li>I like this cleanser because it LITERALLY makes your face squeaky clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>The rapid cleanser works very well to clean my face and control oil up for 5 or more hours.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, it gets my super oily face nice and clean, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it:)</li>
            <li>It smells great and gets rid of the acne especially for older women.  </li>
            <li>Depending on the condition of my skin, I alternate or combine the three products to control oil, prevent acne, and keep my skin looking healthy and smooth.    </li>
            <li>I love the way this face wash is gentle on sensitive skin but leaves your face feeling clean and grease-free.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, no change.  </li>
            <li>This is my first review for any product I&#x27;ve ever bought from Amazon despite being a customer for about 7 years.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I like this soap!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what ordered.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry and your skin feels smooth, supple and clean after washing.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d stick with it though for a few weeks to really give it a fair shot.  </li>
            <li>I tried many different cleansers (mostly high end brands) but to no avail.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed while using this product was that my face felt clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>It foams up nicely, even with just a little bit of soap.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use a little bit, and it takes quite a bit of rinsing, but it works great, no breakouts at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>You must wash your face with it 3 times a day (if you have a very oily skin just like me), and you&#x27;ll see changes in one week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had very oily skin for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>It is, however, a  fantastic part of a bigger skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>This product I must say does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>If you really want to get rid of shine specifically, I&#x27;d recommend DERMAdoctor tease zone.</li>
            <li>I was very suprised that this product cleans so well.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin on my face that gets very greasy in the summer.</li>
            <li>fresh, light foaming cleanser that doesn&#x27;t feel like lotion as other cleansers do.</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of products much more expensive than this one, but none have been better for thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but the oil control is by far greater and longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried and I have tried almost all.</li>
            <li>No other wash I&#x27;ve used really cleans the oil off my face like</li>
            <li>Order multiple tubes, as they tend to run out quickly in the smaller size bottle.</li>
            <li>Will try the Deep Clean product to REMOVE oil next.     Actually phoned Neutrogena to clarify and understand the product distinctions.</li>
            <li>, pimples and blackheads begin to calm down.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not expensive like some other things.</li>
            <li>The Rapid Clear product is a wash that controls oil for several hours after use.    </li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin because you may get irritated, just use a different face wash.</li>
            <li>My skin is neither worse nor better</li>
            <li>I have always used Nivea oil control and other face washed for my oily skin, not so much for acne just oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I only had to use a small amount while bathing and my face was left feeling fresh and non-greasy.</li>

            <li> , my skin was too dry and irritated with the second wash.  </li>
            <li> My concern has always been shine due to oil, especially around the nose and forehead areas.</li>
            <li> As long as they keep making this, I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY other cleanser that will ever use.</li>
            <li> My conspiracy theory is that Neutrogena stopped selling it widely because one tube lasts so long</li>
            <li> I only need to use a little bit of soap, so one tube lasts for a very long time!  </li>
            <li> I only use a little bit of cleanser, about a size of a pea</li>
            <li> I have acne since 10 years ago, I have tried a lot of products, and wasn&#x27;t &#x27;till late 2008 that I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few face washes on the market and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> My face was oily much quicker and much worse than with any other product I had ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other daily cleansers and this is one of the few that helps keep oiliness at bay and also cleans eye makeup well.  </li>
            <li> If you truly need treatment from a dermatologist (antibiotics or other medications-</li>
            <li> (At least from my personal experience)</li>
            <li> Washing face once was enough to control oil for at least 4 hours.    </li>
            <li> I bought this stuff as yet another attempt to help cut down on my oily face.  </li>
            <li> and I believe that it does help keep the shine down.</li>
            <li> While doing all this, it has never once aggravated or dried out my skin, even throughout winter.</li>
            <li> Anyway, my skin has actually gotten worse.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it, I was shocked at how oily my skin got afterwards in less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> and it is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> a ver small amount mix it with water</li>
            <li> No more than 2 applications a day though</li>
            <li> I tried that green stuff stress skin was that was terrible has strong perfume smell</li>
            <li> Not a good idea</li>
            <li> My skin is a little oily with some \\&quot;problems\\&quot;- not too bad, but bad enough that I take care with my soap.    </li>
            <li> SO, I am going to continue using it and see if it is a \\&quot;gets worse before it gets</li>
            <li> I know everyones skin is different, but for me this product was awful.  </li>
            <li> The cream is soothing but takes care of the bad stuff.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, because I&#x27;d used it for years</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this cleanser, it gets my super oily face nice and clean, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  You only need to use a little bit, and it takes quite a bit of rinsing, but it works great, no breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> I love the way this face wash is gentle on sensitive skin but leaves your face feeling clean and grease-free. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff as yet another attempt to help cut down on my oily face.  I thought...Neutrogena has some great products, so I&#x27;ll give it a shot.  After the first time I used it, I was shocked at how oily my skin got afterwards in less than an hour.  I figured I&#x27;d stick with it though for a few weeks to really give it a fair shot.  Unfortunately, no change.  I know everyones skin is different, but for me this product was awful.  My face was oily much quicker and much worse than with any other product I had ever tried.  Luckily, I was able to return it to the store for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Works great for oily skin...not perfect of course but the oil control is by far greater and longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried and I have tried almost all. Equally as great, it removes make up and won&#x27;t bother your eyes so I don&#x27;t have to add that step to my cleansing routine. While doing all this, it has never once aggravated or dried out my skin, even throughout winter. It has proven to be the perfect cleanser for me, and I have terribly oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product this is great for oily skin it does creat some dryness but I use a mositurizer with it.  It smells great and gets rid of the acne especially for older women.  I have eczema on my face and sensative skin so far this the the best product for my combination of problems.  I hope they never stop making it.  I tried that green stuff stress skin was that was terrible has strong perfume smell and I get acne on my chin from it.  So far this product is the best use a ver small amount mix it with water well then was your face as it is a strong product.  If you don&#x27;t mix enought water it can be too strong on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne since 10 years ago, I have tried a lot of products, and wasn&#x27;t &#x27;till late 2008 that I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear foaming cleanser. It really cleans your face, but the best for me is the beeswax ingredient, which makes your skin feel smooth, clean and absolutely clear of oil. You must wash your face with it 3 times a day (if you have a very oily skin just like me), and you&#x27;ll see changes in one week, pimples and blackheads begin to calm down. But you must keep that rule for then on, otherwise, if you quit, blackheads will return. Recommended.</li>
            <li> fresh, light foaming cleanser that doesn&#x27;t feel like lotion as other cleansers do. I love this and bought it here since they stopped selling it in stores. if you have oily-acne prone skin, then i suggest you use this. Works awesome to remove makeup as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous face wash products throughout my career and this is by far the best face wash of them all. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years now and I&#x27;m so satisfied, I wished I knew about it years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very oily skin for over 30 years. Granted, fewer wrinkles as I get older is great, but blackheads, pimples, and looking like I&#x27;ve been misting my face all day with cooking spray would be the downside of that &amp;#34;youthfulness&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for several years, and it&#x27;s one of the best for thorough cleansing. If you truly need treatment from a dermatologist (antibiotics or other medications- I have needed both), this product is not going to cure your acne. It is, however, a  fantastic part of a bigger skin care regimen. I am a licensed beauty professional, and I have no qualms spending money on a great product. I have tried dozens of products much more expensive than this one, but none have been better for thorough cleansing. Great product, great value!</li>
            <li> I have always used Nivea oil control and other face washed for my oily skin, not so much for acne just oily skin.  This product works great, it remives that oil and keeps your face fresh for hours.  I also use it for my bald head and it works.  No more than 2 applications a day though if you have sensitive skin because you may get irritated, just use a different face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to wash my face for 6 years now, it is great for shiny faces!! Combined with prescription acne meds works great.</li>
            <li> I have mostly oily skin, with some tendencies toward dryness in the T-zone.  This product does a great job of curbing the oil throughout the day without over-drying.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other daily cleansers and this is one of the few that helps keep oiliness at bay and also cleans eye makeup well.  I don&#x27;t end up with mascara all over the place after washing my face.  It all comes off with the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I used this product.  Didn&#x27;t do anything.  My skin is neither worse nor better</li>
            <li> Purchased and used this product several months back; but I started using it again only recently and noticed how well it works to CONTROL oil.    My concern has always been shine due to oil, especially around the nose and forehead areas. Most oil-control products are applied after washing to create a matte effect. The Rapid Clear product is a wash that controls oil for several hours after use.    Even if I wash my face with Rapid Clear before heading to the gym; it appears to attempt to control oil due to sweat.    Will try the Deep Clean product to REMOVE oil next.     Actually phoned Neutrogena to clarify and understand the product distinctions.</li>
            <li> This is my first review for any product I&#x27;ve ever bought from Amazon despite being a customer for about 7 years. I have an oily face and have tried many products in the market that claim to do the job of de-greasing but without any tangible success. This product I must say does the job very well. I only had to use a small amount while bathing and my face was left feeling fresh and non-greasy. No need to use a facial cleanser afterwards. I also used it after each shave to wash off the left-over shaving cream on my face and it also worked wonders. I give this product 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.  This product cleans thoroughly and keeps the oil at bay for about 6 hours.  No shine.  I have used many cleaners and this is the best.</li>
            <li> This is the best face soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  I can use it every day and it leaves my skin feeling clean without drying.  It foams up nicely, even with just a little bit of soap.  I only need to use a little bit of soap, so one tube lasts for a very long time!  My skin is a little oily with some \\&quot;problems\\&quot;- not too bad, but bad enough that I take care with my soap.    This is the perfect face wash, and since ALL my local stores stopped selling it I&#x27;ve taken to buying it online.  That&#x27;s how much I like this soap!  My conspiracy theory is that Neutrogena stopped selling it widely because one tube lasts so long and thus they don&#x27;t sell a lot of them!    Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My favorite face watch. No burn or break outs. The cream is soothing but takes care of the bad stuff. I use every three days in between exfoliating. Order multiple tubes, as they tend to run out quickly in the smaller size bottle.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser because it LITERALLY makes your face squeaky clean afterwards. I feel like it cleans thoroughly and I believe that it does help keep the shine down. I don&#x27;t think you can ever just rely on one thing, let alone a cleanser, to keep oily skin under control, though. (At least from my personal experience) But the cleanser does a good job and it&#x27;s not expensive like some other things. I use it every day--morning and night--and it doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin or irritate it. If you really want to get rid of shine specifically, I&#x27;d recommend DERMAdoctor tease zone.</li>
            <li> My face especially my nose always get too shiny.  The rapid cleanser works very well to clean my face and control oil up for 5 or more hours.  I only use a little bit of cleanser, about a size of a pea and it gets the job done. I also recommend Neutrogena pore refining skin toner and Skin Laboratory&#x27;s 20% salicylic acid chemical gel peel. Depending on the condition of my skin, I alternate or combine the three products to control oil, prevent acne, and keep my skin looking healthy and smooth.    I&#x27;ve washed my face twice in a row with the cleanser.  Not a good idea, my skin was too dry and irritated with the second wash.  Washing face once was enough to control oil for at least 4 hours.    Try it!</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed while using this product was that my face felt clean but not dry.  This product does not sting at all.  And all of the acne cysts on my face either reduced or came to a head.  I was very suprised that this product cleans so well.  My pores appear smaller as well.  Highly recommend it:)</li>
            <li> I have been using this since i love the gel. Anyway, my skin has actually gotten worse. SO, I am going to continue using it and see if it is a \\&quot;gets worse before it gets better\\&quot; kinda thing. However, it has been two weeks and it is pretty bad. If my skin dramatically clears up by the time I finish this bottle, I will write an amazing review. Until then, my pimples hurt.</li>
            <li> I thought they&#x27;d stopped making this, because it disappeared from every store in my area. I was very disappointed, because I&#x27;d used it for years and I really love it. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon! I have combination skin on my face that gets very greasy in the summer. This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever used to remove oil and keep it away for hours. It even gives my skin a matte finish. As long as they keep making this, I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> I have oily acne-prone skin. I&#x27;ve used quite a few face washes on the market and always come back to this one. No other wash I&#x27;ve used really cleans the oil off my face like this does. It makes my skin smooth to the touch without feeling greasy for hours. I&#x27;ll keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what ordered. Been using product for years. Great for super oily skin.</li>
            <li> Never had acne in my life until this year. I&#x27;m 48 and have been attacked with Adult-Onset Acne - yuck! I tried many different cleansers (mostly high end brands) but to no avail. I came across this cleanser on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Prio to my acne onset I had used Nutrogena Cleanser (in the blue bottle) for years and no matter what else I tried, I always went back to it. This is the ONLY other cleanser that will ever use. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry and your skin feels smooth, supple and clean after washing. My acne has cleared and my skin isn&#x27;t suffering from dryness. Definitely a winner. Try it. You&#x27;ll LOVE IT!</li>
