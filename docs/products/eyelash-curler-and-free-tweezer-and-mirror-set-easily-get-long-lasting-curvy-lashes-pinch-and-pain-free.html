            <li>That is also a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did receive this product in exchange for my honest inspection and review.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>BUT I LIKED THE CONTAINER</li>
            <li>The tweezers come in their own case with a mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These also came with tweezers that have their own case so you can toss them in your purse, gym bag or in your suitcase if your traveling.</li>
            <li>I think this will come in handy because I often keep a set on me</li>
            <li>I think this will come in handy because I often keep a set on me</li>
            <li>I did receive this in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This is my honest opinion</li>
            <li>Honestly, I could have no eye makeup on and just curl my lashes and leave the house.</li>
            <li>I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions—positive or otherwise—and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li>The inside where the tweezers sit is magnetic which is nice because it sort of &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; them in place.</li>
            <li>There was no pinching or pulling when I used it and it curled my lashes nicely.</li>
            <li>Regardless, my thoughts and opinions are always completely honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li>so it feels very nice and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this curler and highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>The pad is very soft and a perfect size to not rub the eyelid while curling.</li>
            <li>Almost all the ones i have used are flimsy, break very easily and always leave a kink line on my lashes.</li>
            <li>I bought three sets and love to get more as gifts for girlfriends!</li>
            <li>Better still if you warm it up with you hairdryer a bit....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was given the opportunity to receive this nice set for testing and review.</li>
            <li>We had great fun just playing with the case and tweezers,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really got a good grip on my lashes, and I  have a good grip on the handle.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice set and perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>and it made them look beautiful and ready for mascara.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and the handles are very comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li>They squeeze together very smoothly with no pinching or pulling.</li>
            <li>Curler doesn&#x27;t pinch at all, has a nice curve, and gets all my lashes in easily.</li>
            <li>I received the set for free for product review, and was glad that I got the opportunity to check out their eyelash curler set!</li>
            <li>Very pink!&lt;br /&gt;Works great and does curl the lashes without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This set comes with one eyelash curler and a cute tweezer mirror combo that comes with a lid.</li>
            <li>They curl nicely and at a great angle to look natural</li>
            <li>just apply your mascara on top</li>
            <li>Then you apply the lid across the top to protect the tweezers and the mirror</li>
            <li>This would make THE perfect gift for a pre-teen, teen, or lady in your life.  </li>
            <li>The lash curler pad was also comfortable!</li>
            <li>I need to use them more</li>
            <li>I love being able to curl my eyelashes</li>
            <li>I received this set free for review, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love how my eyelashes looks evenly not all clumped together</li>
            <li>The mirror is adorable love</li>
            <li>Love these stuffs.</li>
            <li>I love this set of eyelash curlers and I will purchase replacement pads when this one gives out.</li>
            <li>Much better than the any of the drug store</li>
            <li>I love the tweezers that came with it too.</li>
            <li>I am really quite satisfied with these and am so happy that I got them.  </li>
            <li>They have become a permanent part of my make-up routine for sure, and here&#x27;s what sold me.</li>
            <li>This set is really cute.</li>
            <li>As for curling my lashes , it was ok.</li>
            <li>really love the tweezers &amp; case</li>
            <li>I love the non-slip handle, and couture design.</li>
            <li>I got the product for free to try and share my opinion, regardless this is my 100% honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But she said that she needed to clamp them more than once for her desired curl.</li>
            <li>She said they would make an excellent gift for teen girls!</li>
            <li>I would surely recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is the most adorable gift set I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>The tweezers have a cute flower pattern on them.</li>
            <li>I really love the tweezers in this set.</li>
            <li>my drugstore curler works better than this.</li>
            <li>I love the floral design on the tweezers which gives it a more feminine feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a hinged case, the top just comes off from the bottom.</li>
            <li>It is not any better than any of them.</li>
            <li>Love both the eyelash curler and the tweezers.  </li>
            <li>After reading all of the great reviews, I had high hopes for this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>It is super cute too!</li>
            <li>This is a great little set that&#x27;s would make a great gift for yourself or even to give.</li>

            <li>you are looking for a good gift for a female of any age this holiday or just a good upgrade for yourself</li>
            <li>This item did not come with the free tweezers &amp;  the eyelash curler itself is very cheaply made</li>
            <li>The tweezers are cute and pick up fine hairs with ease.</li>
            <li>The top comes off easily and is easy to snap on to close.</li>
            <li>Not only is it absolutely cute, but it&#x27;s very precise and is great for shaping eyebrows.</li>
            <li>That being said, I find that my cheap Revlon curler does a better job than this.  </li>
            <li>That would have been better than the free tweezers.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a cool stocking Stuffer for the Beauty Queen of yours, look no further then the Best eyelash curler around by Occhio Beauty!</li>

            <li>Its definitely the most attractive eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip and use.</li>
            <li>I love that i can keep them clean and sanitary.  </li>
            <li>The non slip grip makes it easy to handle.</li>
            <li>That for me is not always easy to achieve.</li>
            <li>It has a strong spring that helps curl well.</li>
            <li>This 50+ year old mom liked the set of the tweezers, tweezer case, and the best (!) eyelash curler!</li>

            <li>So totally comfortable, and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>The cool thing, it comes with free tweezers and a free mirror!</li>
            <li>The eyelash curler is light weight yet sturdy and easy to keep a grip on.</li>

            <li>They will make perfect holiday gifts for all women, young or old.</li>

            <li>Simply because great makeup can be found any where</li>
            <li>I received a discount or free code to buy this curler.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased these items because of the reviews and the eyelash curler works really nice without much effort or any sort of pinching.</li>
            <li>The tweezer has a good grip and does a great job taking out thick eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>The only thing you should be aware of is that there is a bonus gift opportunity on the back of the package, but the link for the bonus gift takes you to an alternative website that advertises free online book to \\&quot;Secrets to Getting the Best Deals!\\&quot; Bummer. :P</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome little bonus!</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>That is why I am so excited to have found this tool.</li>
            <li>I knew exactly who would love and appreciate them the most…</li>
            <li>Tiff liked the look of the new eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been recommending this curler and tweezer set to everyone because it makes primping fun and easy.  </li>
            <li>They worked well and hold their own against all the other tweezers I own and use.</li>
            <li>but that is life as a girl right!</li>
            <li>Great set for your beauty routine - I love the cute tweezers and curling your eyelashes is pretty easy - cushioned and easy to use - this is a set to give as a gift to the women or young lady in your life- not a bad price and boxed together as a cute set - I would recommend this to anyone who wants a little beauty in their beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are also ADORABLE and they work very well.</li>
            <li>This eye lash curler comes with an adorable pair of stainless steel tweezers in a mirrored case.</li>
            <li>It is not only stylish looking but feels much better on your hands than metal handled ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the cover is taken off and the tweezers are taken out there is a mirror that you can use for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>And it came pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>It works even better when you blast it with your hairdryer on high and then use it to curl your lashes.</li>
            <li>So amazing, love these beauty products very much, Not only are they pretty</li>
            <li>I knew it was different when I first put it up to my eye, it fit so nicely.</li>
            <li>All my natural lashes! :)</li>
            <li>The tweezer set which is in the set, come in a cute black floral pattern case and is handy to carry in a purse or to use in the bathroom at home.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes super voluminous and the curl lasts all day with the right mascara.</li>
            <li>Great little set, would make some swell Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>The precise slanted tip on the Tweezers makes it much easier for plucking.</li>
            <li>Occhio Beauty Eyelash Curler Set is such amazing eyelash curler set.</li>
            <li>I have bought many eyelash curlers through the years and found there are many more bad curlers than good ones.</li>
            <li>The finger rest offers better control of the curler.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The floral design is fun.</li>
            <li>They both curled equally as well, but these felt more comfortable in my hands while I was using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The actual contraption is quite sturdy and I think it&#x27;s well-made; I just wish it would be as effective as my Lancôme or Shu Umura</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>they just slide right out of my hand, but not with these</li>
            <li>And they are a pretty purple too and the tweezers have pretty flowers too!</li>
            <li>The curler feels gentle on my eyelashes doesn&#x27;t pinch and its very pain free.</li>
            <li>She was excited because she had needed a new eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>pleased with entire purchase.</li>
            <li>(I hadn&#x27;t curled them in about 5 years!), to get back into the swing of curling my lashes again---now that I have an easier to use and comfortable curler!  </li>
            <li>Some pull your lashes out, some fall apart as soon as you try to use them, and some are just made pretty</li>
            <li>When my girls see something they like and want, I am first to let them have it.</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s got a nice little case too.  </li>
            <li>There is a  little insert to put the bottoms of the tweezers to hold them in place but there is also a magnet so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling out , I think its a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The little magnetic end in the mirror case to hold the tweezers is also a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>I used my old curler on my left eye and used the new one on my right eye and asked my husband which one looks better?</li>
            <li>my opinion this eyelash curler is very high quality, durable and very dependable for the price.</li>
            <li>When I tried OcchioBeauty&#x27;s eyelash curler, I found that the handle felt quite comfortable to hold, especially where the finger holes are.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I really like the rubber grip on the eyelash curler part.</li>
            <li>More than expected.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to work it too much to get it my lashes in it.</li>
            <li>So I really like these as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The  curler doesn&#x27;t give mine much curl for some reason.</li>
            <li>It was precise when I did my eyebrows, even the smaller hair.  </li>
            <li>gave  this 3 stars because I do really like the tweezers but didn&#x27;t really care for the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So since I am not the one normally curling my eyelashes (I like to think mine are naturally pretty  </li>
            <li>I used it and it curled my lashes so fast</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I have people asking me all the time if my lashes are real or if I am using falsies.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t decided, because I really like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they still look really</li>
            <li>then it would have lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>It contours closely to your face so you can get very close to your lash line.</li>
            <li>I did not have to use much pressure at all.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this eye lash curler and tweezers set!</li>
            <li>I also love the pink accents on the curler.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to my other pair these are much more heavy duty feeling in my hands, the other pair seems so dainty and easy to break next to these.</li>
            <li>The case it comes in is very useful, especially if you carry these around.</li>
            <li>I will admit that the Occhio eyelash curler is by far the prettiest one I&#x27;ve ever tried, but my praise pretty much ends there.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this curler and since the reviews were very favorable</li>
            <li>I have smaller lids and can not always get that full curl</li>
            <li>When I was sent a free set to review I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since most curlers are the same with very little differences.</li>
            <li>He of course all times picked the new one!</li>
            <li>It comes in cute colors of black and lavender.</li>
            <li>This one is the same in theory and besides the cute coloring it is a lot different to use.</li>
            <li>I tried out the tweezers on my eyebrows and these tweezers are high quality.</li>
            <li>Truly highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I like this cute little set.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are cute and can get the little hairs on my brows that drive me nuts.</li>
            <li>I also love the little case the tweezers come in.</li>
            <li>I love the little carrying case it comes with as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think feeling them that the spring will stay strong for years and not weaken like some springs in other products would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spring action works very well on them, they clamp and curl my eyelashes without any pain or discomfort of any type.</li>
            <li>WHICH IS WHAT I NORMALLY USE</li>
            <li>This tweezers are great, they get even the most stubborn little hairs without pain or cutting your skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far the cutest eyelash curler ever!</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised when I opened my package from the mail!</li>
            <li>The other thing I found really neat is it is made to fit these specific tweezers and it has a magnet to help catch them and keep them inside.</li>
            <li>This curler also really makes it easy to get to the inner corners of the lashes which was the problem with my previous curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like that the opening where your lashes go is pink so you can see exactly how much of your lashes you are squeezing.</li>
            <li>I think these would really rock keeping the black but having optional colors such as bright purple, neon green, etc.</li>
            <li>The case is lavender with a clear see-through cover.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with all of it.  </li>
            <li>I could either replace my old pair, or give them to her.</li>
            <li>The rubber part that your eye lash sits on gets indented within seconds of use, causing your eyelashes to completely crease.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully, it&#x27;s not one of those curlers that rips your eyelashes out or is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>The grip of the curler is surrounded by a soft rubber</li>
            <li>The other thing I found useful is the mirror.</li>
            <li>I love the pink accents on the eyelash curler and the sleek black.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a fail because it&#x27;s just a bit of pink</li>
            <li>Long-lasting Eyelashes - Non Slip Handle, Rounded, Thick Pad Forms for Intense Curl - Pinch Free Design For Long Natural Eyelashes.</li>
            <li>They also come with this really kewl case that is pink with a clear cover.</li>
            <li>I like the total package, but would have appreciated if it came with an extra rubber as a replacement</li>
            <li>The rubber on my old eye lash curler was taking it last breath when I got this one.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient for traveling because you have everything you need in that little case and they won&#x27;t get lost.</li>

            <li> I did receive this product in exchange for my honest inspection and review.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> BUT I LIKED THE CONTAINER</li>
            <li> The tweezers come in their own case with a mirror.</li>

            <li> I think this will come in handy because I often keep a set on me</li>
            <li> I did receive this in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my honest opinion</li>
            <li> Honestly, I could have no eye makeup on and just curl my lashes and leave the house.</li>
            <li> I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions—positive or otherwise—and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> The inside where the tweezers sit is magnetic which is nice because it sort of &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; them in place.</li>
            <li> There was no pinching or pulling when I used it and it curled my lashes nicely.</li>
            <li> Regardless, my thoughts and opinions are always completely honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> so it feels very nice and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this curler and highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> The pad is very soft and a perfect size to not rub the eyelid while curling.</li>
            <li> Almost all the ones i have used are flimsy, break very easily and always leave a kink line on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I bought three sets and love to get more as gifts for girlfriends!</li>
            <li> Better still if you warm it up with you hairdryer a bit....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was given the opportunity to receive this nice set for testing and review.</li>
            <li> We had great fun just playing with the case and tweezers,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really got a good grip on my lashes, and I  have a good grip on the handle.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice set and perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> and it made them look beautiful and ready for mascara.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight and the handles are very comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li> They squeeze together very smoothly with no pinching or pulling.</li>
            <li> Curler doesn&#x27;t pinch at all, has a nice curve, and gets all my lashes in easily.</li>
            <li> I received the set for free for product review, and was glad that I got the opportunity to check out their eyelash curler set!</li>
            <li> Very pink!&lt;br /&gt;Works great and does curl the lashes without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> This set comes with one eyelash curler and a cute tweezer mirror combo that comes with a lid.</li>
            <li> They curl nicely and at a great angle to look natural</li>
            <li> just apply your mascara on top</li>
            <li> Then you apply the lid across the top to protect the tweezers and the mirror</li>
            <li> This would make THE perfect gift for a pre-teen, teen, or lady in your life.  </li>
            <li> The lash curler pad was also comfortable!</li>
            <li> I need to use them more</li>
            <li> I love being able to curl my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I received this set free for review, all opinions are my own.</li>

            <li> The mirror is adorable love</li>
            <li> Love these stuffs.</li>
            <li> I love this set of eyelash curlers and I will purchase replacement pads when this one gives out.</li>
            <li> Much better than the any of the drug store</li>
            <li> I love the tweezers that came with it too.</li>
            <li> I am really quite satisfied with these and am so happy that I got them.  </li>
            <li> They have become a permanent part of my make-up routine for sure, and here&#x27;s what sold me.</li>

            <li> really love the tweezers &amp; case</li>
            <li> I love the non-slip handle, and couture design.</li>
            <li> I got the product for free to try and share my opinion, regardless this is my 100% honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But she said that she needed to clamp them more than once for her desired curl.</li>
            <li> She said they would make an excellent gift for teen girls!</li>
            <li> I would surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the most adorable gift set I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> The tweezers have a cute flower pattern on them.</li>
            <li> I really love the tweezers in this set.</li>
            <li> my drugstore curler works better than this.</li>
            <li> I love the floral design on the tweezers which gives it a more feminine feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a hinged case, the top just comes off from the bottom.</li>
            <li> It is not any better than any of them.</li>
            <li> Love both the eyelash curler and the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> After reading all of the great reviews, I had high hopes for this eyelash curler.  </li>

            <li> you are looking for a good gift for a female of any age this holiday or just a good upgrade for yourself</li>
            <li> This item did not come with the free tweezers &amp;  the eyelash curler itself is very cheaply made</li>
            <li> The tweezers are cute and pick up fine hairs with ease.</li>
            <li> The top comes off easily and is easy to snap on to close.</li>
            <li> Not only is it absolutely cute, but it&#x27;s very precise and is great for shaping eyebrows.</li>
            <li> That being said, I find that my cheap Revlon curler does a better job than this.  </li>
            <li> That would have been better than the free tweezers.</li>

            <li> The non slip grip makes it easy to handle.</li>
            <li> That for me is not always easy to achieve.</li>
            <li> It has a strong spring that helps curl well.</li>

            <li> They will make perfect holiday gifts for all women, young or old.</li>
            <li> They would be great for a teenage gal, a mom-on-the-go, or even a grandma for Christmas!</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> Simply because great makeup can be found any where</li>
            <li> I received a discount or free code to buy this curler.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased these items because of the reviews and the eyelash curler works really nice without much effort or any sort of pinching.</li>
            <li> The tweezer has a good grip and does a great job taking out thick eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> The only thing you should be aware of is that there is a bonus gift opportunity on the back of the package, but the link for the bonus gift takes you to an alternative website that advertises free online book to \\&quot;Secrets to Getting the Best Deals!\\&quot; Bummer. :P</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome little bonus!</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> That is why I am so excited to have found this tool.</li>
            <li> I knew exactly who would love and appreciate them the most…</li>
            <li> Tiff liked the look of the new eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recommending this curler and tweezer set to everyone because it makes primping fun and easy.  </li>
            <li> They worked well and hold their own against all the other tweezers I own and use.</li>
            <li> but that is life as a girl right!</li>
            <li> Great set for your beauty routine - I love the cute tweezers and curling your eyelashes is pretty easy - cushioned and easy to use - this is a set to give as a gift to the women or young lady in your life- not a bad price and boxed together as a cute set - I would recommend this to anyone who wants a little beauty in their beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are also ADORABLE and they work very well.</li>
            <li> This eye lash curler comes with an adorable pair of stainless steel tweezers in a mirrored case.</li>
            <li> It is not only stylish looking but feels much better on your hands than metal handled ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the cover is taken off and the tweezers are taken out there is a mirror that you can use for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> And it came pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> It works even better when you blast it with your hairdryer on high and then use it to curl your lashes.</li>
            <li> So amazing, love these beauty products very much, Not only are they pretty</li>
            <li> I knew it was different when I first put it up to my eye, it fit so nicely.</li>
            <li> All my natural lashes! :)</li>
            <li> The tweezer set which is in the set, come in a cute black floral pattern case and is handy to carry in a purse or to use in the bathroom at home.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes super voluminous and the curl lasts all day with the right mascara.</li>
            <li> Great little set, would make some swell Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> The precise slanted tip on the Tweezers makes it much easier for plucking.</li>
            <li> Occhio Beauty Eyelash Curler Set is such amazing eyelash curler set.</li>
            <li> I have bought many eyelash curlers through the years and found there are many more bad curlers than good ones.</li>
            <li> The finger rest offers better control of the curler.</li>
            <li> and I have to say this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The floral design is fun.</li>
            <li> They both curled equally as well, but these felt more comfortable in my hands while I was using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The actual contraption is quite sturdy and I think it&#x27;s well-made; I just wish it would be as effective as my Lancôme or Shu Umura</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> they just slide right out of my hand, but not with these</li>
            <li> And they are a pretty purple too and the tweezers have pretty flowers too!</li>
            <li> The curler feels gentle on my eyelashes doesn&#x27;t pinch and its very pain free.</li>
            <li> She was excited because she had needed a new eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> pleased with entire purchase.</li>
            <li> (I hadn&#x27;t curled them in about 5 years!), to get back into the swing of curling my lashes again---now that I have an easier to use and comfortable curler!  </li>
            <li> Some pull your lashes out, some fall apart as soon as you try to use them, and some are just made pretty</li>
            <li> When my girls see something they like and want, I am first to let them have it.</li>
            <li> Thanks !</li>
            <li> The ONLY Eyelash Curler Set with Bonus FREE Tweezer and Mirror Set!</li>
            <li> This is such a cute set.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> If you love makeup you know there is a $3 lipstick next to your $20.</li>
            <li> They have cute flowers all over them making them definitely girly.</li>
            <li> so I have to stay on top of this area constantly!</li>
            <li> so I have to stay on top of this area constantly!</li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m giving it three stars is because I love the tweezer set that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a huge beauty junkie myself, I&#x27;ve tried many an eyelash curler—from drugstore brand to high-end—and I have a few set favorites.</li>
            <li> The feel of it is great, but it doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes even after several tries.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute for a young girl or a mature woman they would both appreciate it.</li>
            <li> The fast shipping is also appreciated!</li>
            <li> My eyes lash are beautiful &amp; it only took a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Easy, painless curler and precise tweezers that came in a pretty case with a small mirror.</li>
            <li> the mirror and tweezers are a nice little bonus also...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s got a nice little case too.  </li>
            <li> There is a  little insert to put the bottoms of the tweezers to hold them in place but there is also a magnet so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling out , I think its a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The little magnetic end in the mirror case to hold the tweezers is also a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> I used my old curler on my left eye and used the new one on my right eye and asked my husband which one looks better?</li>
            <li> my opinion this eyelash curler is very high quality, durable and very dependable for the price.</li>
            <li> When I tried OcchioBeauty&#x27;s eyelash curler, I found that the handle felt quite comfortable to hold, especially where the finger holes are.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I really like the rubber grip on the eyelash curler part.</li>
            <li> More than expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to work it too much to get it my lashes in it.</li>
            <li> So I really like these as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The  curler doesn&#x27;t give mine much curl for some reason.</li>
            <li> It was precise when I did my eyebrows, even the smaller hair.  </li>
            <li> gave  this 3 stars because I do really like the tweezers but didn&#x27;t really care for the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So since I am not the one normally curling my eyelashes (I like to think mine are naturally pretty  </li>
            <li> I used it and it curled my lashes so fast</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I have people asking me all the time if my lashes are real or if I am using falsies.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t decided, because I really like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they still look really</li>
            <li> then it would have lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> It contours closely to your face so you can get very close to your lash line.</li>
            <li> I did not have to use much pressure at all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this eye lash curler and tweezers set!</li>
            <li> I also love the pink accents on the curler.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to my other pair these are much more heavy duty feeling in my hands, the other pair seems so dainty and easy to break next to these.</li>
            <li> The case it comes in is very useful, especially if you carry these around.</li>
            <li> I will admit that the Occhio eyelash curler is by far the prettiest one I&#x27;ve ever tried, but my praise pretty much ends there.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this curler and since the reviews were very favorable</li>
            <li> I have smaller lids and can not always get that full curl</li>
            <li> When I was sent a free set to review I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since most curlers are the same with very little differences.</li>
            <li> He of course all times picked the new one!</li>
            <li> It comes in cute colors of black and lavender.</li>
            <li> This one is the same in theory and besides the cute coloring it is a lot different to use.</li>
            <li> I tried out the tweezers on my eyebrows and these tweezers are high quality.</li>
            <li> Truly highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this cute little set.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are cute and can get the little hairs on my brows that drive me nuts.</li>
            <li> I also love the little case the tweezers come in.</li>
            <li> I love the little carrying case it comes with as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think feeling them that the spring will stay strong for years and not weaken like some springs in other products would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spring action works very well on them, they clamp and curl my eyelashes without any pain or discomfort of any type.</li>
            <li> WHICH IS WHAT I NORMALLY USE</li>
            <li> This tweezers are great, they get even the most stubborn little hairs without pain or cutting your skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the cutest eyelash curler ever!</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised when I opened my package from the mail!</li>
            <li> The other thing I found really neat is it is made to fit these specific tweezers and it has a magnet to help catch them and keep them inside.</li>
            <li> This curler also really makes it easy to get to the inner corners of the lashes which was the problem with my previous curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like that the opening where your lashes go is pink so you can see exactly how much of your lashes you are squeezing.</li>
            <li> I think these would really rock keeping the black but having optional colors such as bright purple, neon green, etc.</li>
            <li> The case is lavender with a clear see-through cover.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with all of it.  </li>
            <li> I could either replace my old pair, or give them to her.</li>
            <li> The rubber part that your eye lash sits on gets indented within seconds of use, causing your eyelashes to completely crease.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully, it&#x27;s not one of those curlers that rips your eyelashes out or is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> The grip of the curler is surrounded by a soft rubber</li>
            <li> The other thing I found useful is the mirror.</li>
            <li> I love the pink accents on the eyelash curler and the sleek black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a fail because it&#x27;s just a bit of pink</li>
            <li> Long-lasting Eyelashes - Non Slip Handle, Rounded, Thick Pad Forms for Intense Curl - Pinch Free Design For Long Natural Eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They also come with this really kewl case that is pink with a clear cover.</li>
            <li> I like the total package, but would have appreciated if it came with an extra rubber as a replacement</li>
            <li> The rubber on my old eye lash curler was taking it last breath when I got this one.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient for traveling because you have everything you need in that little case and they won&#x27;t get lost.</li>
            <li> used this pair on one eye, my old pair on the other eye.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very straight and have a hard time holding a curl.  </li>
            <li> It does not get close to the lashline, and it actually takes a lot of effort to physically press down due to the springs inside the device.</li>
            <li> I think its because it doesn&#x27;t get down to the lash line like my regular ones.</li>
            <li> : it WILL hold a curl, but not very close to the lashline, and not for very long.</li>
            <li> She was fine with the colors but wasn&#x27;t crazy about the flowered design on the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE EXTRA AND LET THEM PINCH</li>
            <li> I use an eyelash curler almost every day, i have purchased expensive ones and cheap ones over the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eyelash curler comes in a black and pink color with a pink mirror case and a flowered design on the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed, and on top of it I bought 2</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use any other curler after using this</li>
            <li> are not too small nor too big.</li>
            <li> I did not receive any other compensation.</li>
            <li> She states that it&#x27;s made of very high quality materials but that it&#x27;s a little difficult to use because the pivot point (just below the eyelash curling surface thingy) sticks out and slightly interferes with getting it close enough to your eye (D&#x27;Oh!)</li>
            <li> Black with pink accents</li>
            <li> /&gt;They eyelash curler is black and pink, I wish everything girly didn&#x27;t have to be in pinks or reds...</li>
            <li> Despite the &amp;#34;ergonomic design&amp;#34; the entire thing is way too clunky and hard to squeeze down on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> but they alone were not worth the money I paid for both products.</li>
            <li> I like the black &amp; pinkish color combo on the eye lash curler.</li>
            <li> and a half stars</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why i wasted so much money buying expensive ones that broke within a few months.</li>
            <li> The Tweezer case even has a little magnetic end in the mirror case to hold the tweezers.</li>
            <li> and I put the curler on and even if my hand shakes a little</li>
            <li> It did give a little lift to my lashes but not the flirty curl I look for.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> A LITTLE LONGER</li>
            <li> Beauty tools need investment and a little research.</li>
            <li> my little sister Tiffany.</li>
            <li> I had stopped curling my lashes because it was so bothersome, now I can do it everyday.</li>
            <li> so when I a have a few moments of alone downtime/waiting time I can pluck a few on my chin.</li>
            <li> so when I a have a few moments of alone downtime/waiting time I can pluck a few on my chin.</li>
            <li> It sits in there and stays put with a small magnet inside the case.</li>
            <li> One swipe and my hair was out with a small amount of pain.</li>
            <li> I usually have to curl my lashes twice</li>
            <li> I have PCOS which causes excessive hair growth</li>
            <li> I have PCOS which causes excessive hair growth</li>
            <li> There is also a small mirror inside of the case.</li>
            <li> I felt pinching and felt the curler just didn&#x27;t get all the way to the roots of my lashes, where maximum curling usually occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tweezers also come with a plastic case that has a small mirror on the inside.</li>
            <li> The mirror is small but usable if traveling.</li>
            <li> No more pinches, uneven eye lashes or eyes that look tired.</li>
            <li> That is a lot of help to someone like me who has a hard time seeing the lashes in the mirror anyway.</li>
            <li> Do you know how hard it is to please me????  </li>
            <li> I do wish it came with at least one replacement pad for the curler though just in case.</li>
            <li> Seriously these are fan-frivolous-tastic</li>
            <li> I hardly ever lose these!  </li>
            <li> The pad is very thick to curl your lashes faster and leave them looking voluminous.</li>
            <li> So if your lid got broken, lost or knocked off</li>
            <li> I have another brand in my make-up kit that I found uncomfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am not impressed by the results.  </li>
            <li> if tweezers for seven years because I was afraid none would match up.</li>
            <li> we are silly like that!</li>
            <li> we are silly like that!</li>
            <li> That lady in your life will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> you could continue using the base to hold the tweezers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Beautiful set! The eye lash curler is why I bought the set but I think I am even more excited about the cute tweezers and pretty flowers.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely all girl! Very pink!&lt;br /&gt;Works great and does curl the lashes without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with entire purchase.</li>
            <li> This set comes with one eyelash curler and a cute tweezer mirror combo that comes with a lid. I tried out the eyelash curler and it works great, just match it up with the curve of your eyelashes and squeeze. It works even better when you blast it with your hairdryer on high and then use it to curl your lashes. I find it makes it last longer. They curl nicely and at a great angle to look natural just apply your mascara on top and you&#x27;re good to go. But the thing I like the best is the look of the eyelash curler. Its definitely the most attractive eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever had. Black with pink accents it definitely stands out.  The tweezer case is so neat. It sits in there and stays put with a small magnet inside the case. Then you apply the lid across the top to protect the tweezers and the mirror so you never lose the 2.  This would make THE perfect gift for a pre-teen, teen, or lady in your life.  I tried out the tweezers on my eyebrows and these tweezers are high quality. They grip the hair nicely and fit the hand perfect. I did receive this in exchange for a review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received the set for free for product review, and was glad that I got the opportunity to check out their eyelash curler set! I have another brand in my make-up kit that I found uncomfortable to hold and use. When I tried OcchioBeauty&#x27;s eyelash curler, I found that the handle felt quite comfortable to hold, especially where the finger holes are. The lash curler pad was also comfortable! I need to use them more (I hadn&#x27;t curled them in about 5 years!), to get back into the swing of curling my lashes again---now that I have an easier to use and comfortable curler!  The tweezer set which is in the set, come in a cute black floral pattern case and is handy to carry in a purse or to use in the bathroom at home. And, the neat thing about the tweezers is that the case has a mirror in it, for quick brow touch ups! This 50+ year old mom liked the set of the tweezers, tweezer case, and the best (!) eyelash curler! They would be great for a teenage gal, a mom-on-the-go, or even a grandma for Christmas! I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this curler and since the reviews were very favorable I figured it would be a great find. The feel of it is great, but it doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes even after several tries.  Disappointed, and on top of it I bought 2 and they weren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> Great curler. Better still if you warm it up with you hairdryer a bit....</li>
            <li> She states that it&#x27;s made of very high quality materials but that it&#x27;s a little difficult to use because the pivot point (just below the eyelash curling surface thingy) sticks out and slightly interferes with getting it close enough to your eye (D&#x27;Oh!)</li>
            <li> The eyelash curler didn&#x27;t curl my eyelashes well. Tweezers were good.</li>
            <li> This is by far the cutest eyelash curler ever! My lashes are perfectly curled. Someone even thought I had on falsies because this curler works that well. This is a must buy for the girls in your life!</li>
            <li> I love being able to curl my eyelashes and I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t bought an eyelash curler before now.  I&#x27;ve been recommending this curler and tweezer set to everyone because it makes primping fun and easy.  Great little set, would make some swell Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is one of the best I&#x27;ve owned. Love the comfortable grip, the curler does the job, and the great tweezer set is an awesome bonus!    I received this set free for review, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have bought many eyelash curlers through the years and found there are many more bad curlers than good ones. Some pull your lashes out, some fall apart as soon as you try to use them, and some are just made pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well not so with the Best Eyelash Curler. I think that it is well-made curler. I really like the rubber grip on the eyelash curler part. The finger rest offers better control of the curler. It has a strong spring that helps curl well. This curler also really makes it easy to get to the inner corners of the lashes which was the problem with my previous curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the opening where your lashes go is pink so you can see exactly how much of your lashes you are squeezing. That is a lot of help to someone like me who has a hard time seeing the lashes in the mirror anyway. It is not only stylish looking but feels much better on your hands than metal handled ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed with the fact that the curler is part of a gift set. The Best Eyelash Curler not only has the curler, but has an awesome bonus Tweezer set with it. The precise slanted tip on the Tweezers makes it much easier for plucking. The case/mirror that comes with it makes it effortless to clip into the case and toss it into your purse or overnight bag. The Tweezer case even has a little magnetic end in the mirror case to hold the tweezers. That is also a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Eyelash Curler will make a perfect stocking stuffer for any beauty lover! My biggest challenge will be to keep this beautiful set for myself. When my girls see something they like and want, I am first to let them have it. I haven&#x27;t shown it to them so maybe I can get away with surprising them and putting one of their own in their stocking this Christmas!</li>
            <li> The curler feels gentle on my eyelashes doesn&#x27;t pinch and its very pain free. It gives a gorgeous curls i absolutely love how my eyelashes looks evenly not all clumped together plus it looks longer. The mirror is adorable love the color and the tweezer takes out those stubborn hairs plus those unnoticeable hairs too. The tweezer has a good grip and does a great job taking out thick eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> I like this cute little set. The handle of the eyelash curler is really comfortable to grip and easy to handle. The tweezers are cute and can get the little hairs on my brows that drive me nuts. Curler doesn&#x27;t pinch at all, has a nice curve, and gets all my lashes in easily. I love the pink accents on the eyelash curler and the sleek black. I also love the little case the tweezers come in. They&#x27;re great for travel. I&#x27;m glad I was given the opportunity to receive this nice set for testing and review.</li>
            <li> purchased for my wife... she said they work great and don&#x27;t pinch her eyelids... the mirror and tweezers are a nice little bonus also... Thanks !</li>
            <li> I never thought that I could curl my lashes with no pain at all!  So totally comfortable, and easy to hold.  Also, the tweezers are so cute, too!  I had stopped curling my lashes because it was so bothersome, now I can do it everyday.</li>
            <li> Love these stuffs. More than expected.</li>
            <li> Great set for your beauty routine - I love the cute tweezers and curling your eyelashes is pretty easy - cushioned and easy to use - this is a set to give as a gift to the women or young lady in your life- not a bad price and boxed together as a cute set - I would recommend this to anyone who wants a little beauty in their beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and let me know what you think.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of eyelash curlers and I have to say this one is by far my favorite. When I was sent a free set to review I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since most curlers are the same with very little differences. This one is the same in theory and besides the cute coloring it is a lot different to use. I knew it was different when I first put it up to my eye, it fit so nicely. I didn&#x27;t have to work it too much to get it my lashes in it. I also flinch when I was putting it on my eye because it is not bulky or big. It is lightweight and the handles are very comfortable to grip. They squeeze together very smoothly with no pinching or pulling. I love this set of eyelash curlers and I will purchase replacement pads when this one gives out. I don&#x27;t want to use any other curler after using this one.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are also ADORABLE and they work very well. One swipe and my hair was out with a small amount of pain. The don&#x27;t squeeze or pinch. So I really like these as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this set for anyone it&#x27;s cute for a young girl or a mature woman they would both appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Great set for any woman to own! Easy, painless curler and precise tweezers that came in a pretty case with a small mirror.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the great reviews, I had high hopes for this eyelash curler.  Unfortunately, I am not impressed by the results.  My eyelashes are very straight and have a hard time holding a curl.  That being said, I find that my cheap Revlon curler does a better job than this.  I will be sending this back.</li>
            <li> These are great! I have had the same pair if tweezers for seven years because I was afraid none would match up. I threw them out the second I used these. They get anything. The curlers are great as well and cute.</li>
            <li> Great product. Much better than the any of the drug store eye-lash curlers sitting in my drawer un-used. I love the tweezers that came with it too.</li>
            <li> Excellent curler! Easy to grip and use. Love that it came with a Tweezer case too! The tweezers are great and the case is awesome! I love that i can keep them clean and sanitary.  I did receive this product in exchange for my honest inspection and review.</li>
            <li> Oh boy, I cannot believe the grip on this eyelash curler.  I put my mascara on and I put the curler on and even if my hand shakes a little it&#x27;s really got a good grip on my lashes, and I  have a good grip on the handle.  My lashes don&#x27;t stick or nothing The tweezers when they&#x27;re all metal they just slide right out of my hand, but not with these and it&#x27;s got a nice little case too.  I was pleasantly surprised with all of it.  These curlers do not pinch the corner of my eyelid like the metal ones do,  I am really quite satisfied with these and am so happy that I got them.  They have become a permanent part of my make-up routine for sure, and here&#x27;s what sold me. The ONLY Eyelash Curler Set with Bonus FREE Tweezer and Mirror Set! Long-lasting Eyelashes - Non Slip Handle, Rounded, Thick Pad Forms for Intense Curl - Pinch Free Design For Long Natural Eyelashes. 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.  Come on now that doesn&#x27;t sell you?  If it doesn&#x27;t you need to get your eyes checked. 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.  Do you know how hard it is to please me????  Seriously these are fan-frivolous-tastic and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re MINE!</li>
            <li> This set is really cute. Both eyelash curler and tweezers are durable , sturdy, &amp; feel good in your hand when using them. I like the black &amp; pinkish color combo on the eye lash curler. As for curling my lashes , it was ok. The  curler doesn&#x27;t give mine much curl for some reason. I think its because it doesn&#x27;t get down to the lash line like my regular ones. It did give a little lift to my lashes but not the flirty curl I look for.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side they don&#x27;t pull out your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the tweezers &amp; case is comes in. The floral design is fun. The case it comes in is very useful, especially if you carry these around.The top comes off easily and is easy to snap on to close. There is a  little insert to put the bottoms of the tweezers to hold them in place but there is also a magnet so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling out , I think its a nice touch. The other thing I found useful is the mirror. Perfect to do touch ups. It was precise when I did my eyebrows, even the smaller hair.  I would buy this set just for these tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave  this 3 stars because I do really like the tweezers but didn&#x27;t really care for the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for an honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Both products work great &amp; for a very good price!</li>
            <li> This is such a cute set.  I am very happy with the delivery, packaging and quality.  I bought three sets and love to get more as gifts for girlfriends!</li>
            <li> THE TWEEZERS ARE ON PAR QUALITY WITH TWEEZERMAN OR JAPANESQUE WHICH IS WHAT I NORMALLY USE BUT I LIKED THE CONTAINER THESE CAME IN + AT THE PRICE WHY NOT TRY IT I THOUGHT.&lt;br /&gt;NOT DISSAPOINTED BUT YOU DO NEED TO PUMP THE EYELASHES A LITTLE EXTRA AND LET THEM PINCH A LITTLE LONGER OR THE CURLER DOESNT WORK AS WELL.</li>
            <li> Included in this set are the eyelash curlers, a set of tweezers, and a mirror with a built in holder for the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So since I am not the one normally curling my eyelashes (I like to think mine are naturally pretty  ;-) , I gave these to my wife to try out and give her opinion of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyelash curler comes in a black and pink color with a pink mirror case and a flowered design on the tweezers.  She was fine with the colors but wasn&#x27;t crazy about the flowered design on the tweezers.  Different colors and design choices might do this set well for those with different preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She felt that these are a well-made sturdy set of curlers and tweezers.  The little magnetic end in the mirror case to hold the tweezers is also a nice touch.  The curlers work well, have a strong spring are comfortable to use and curl well.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are also good quality and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good quality set that do the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 and a half stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Do you Want to look like you have on falsies without the hassle? With this i have located eyelashes I didn&#x27;t know THAT I had. My eyes lash are beautiful &amp; it only took a few seconds. The non slip grip makes it easy to handle. This cute set makes the perfect gift for the holidays, birthday, or just because gift. That lady in your life will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This set is wonderful.  I love the tweezers and the carrying case was perfect for storing them in your purse.  I hardly ever lose these!  The eyelash curlers are a great quality as well.  They are sturdy and solid feeling in your hands.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> The eyelash curler has a non slip handle which is always a good thing to have since you are putting this so close to your eye.  The pad is very thick to curl your lashes faster and leave them looking voluminous. It&#x27;s free pinch design is great because you won&#x27;t hurt your eye or cut your eyelashes off. I used it and it curled my lashes so fast and it made them look beautiful and ready for mascara.  The tweezers are supposed to be a bonus that comes with the eyelash curler. The tweezers come in their own case with a mirror. It is very convenient for traveling because you have everything you need in that little case and they won&#x27;t get lost. This tweezers are great, they get even the most stubborn little hairs without pain or cutting your skin. The floral print it&#x27;s also very nice. I would really recommend this set. It&#x27;s just a good thing to have and it could also be a great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I use an eyelash curler almost every day, i have purchased expensive ones and cheap ones over the past 20 years. Almost all the ones i have used are flimsy, break very easily and always leave a kink line on my lashes. I have to admit, this curler impressed me...ALOT! as soon as i pulked them out of the package i was impressed by the durability and stability of the tool. It is super cute too! I usually have to curl my lashes twice but I only had to curl once with this. I added mascara, curled and added another coat of mascara, they looked perfect! The pad is very soft and a perfect size to not rub the eyelid while curling. The press fit perfectly around the eyes to curl every single lash.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this eyelash curler is very high quality, durable and very dependable for the price. What a great deal! I don&#x27;t know why i wasted so much money buying expensive ones that broke within a few months. I&#x27;m very happy with this curler and highly recommend these. They will make perfect holiday gifts for all women, young or old. They will thank you after trying it!</li>
            <li> If you love makeup you know there is a $3 lipstick next to your $20. Simply because great makeup can be found any where but that is not always the case with beauty tools. Beauty tools need investment and a little research. That is why I am so excited to have found this tool. It is actually a affordable, and yet high-end design beauty must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Occhio Beauty Eyelash Curler Set is such amazing eyelash curler set. I love the non-slip handle, and couture design. Truly gives my lashes a va va voom lash look. That for me is not always easy to achieve. I have smaller lids and can not always get that full curl but then again that is when a great tool comes in. This is that tool. No matter your eye shape or size, you can achieve a great youthful eye look with ease. No more pinches, uneven eye lashes or eyes that look tired. Now you have curl, lift, and eyes that look awake and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it comes with a beautiful free mirror and tweezer set. How amazing is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a highly favored beauty item from this beauty blogger. Truly highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish they would have included replacement rubber pieces for this product. That would have been better than the free tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great lash curler!!! Makes my lashes super voluminous and the curl lasts all day with the right mascara. I have people asking me all the time if my lashes are real or if I am using falsies. Nope! All my natural lashes! :)</li>
            <li> I got the product for free to try and share my opinion, regardless this is my 100% honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had another brand for years and have a teenage daughter so I figured by trying these I could either replace my old pair, or give them to her. I still haven&#x27;t decided, because I really like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They eyelash curler is black and pink, I wish everything girly didn&#x27;t have to be in pinks or reds...but that is life as a girl right! I think these would really rock keeping the black but having optional colors such as bright purple, neon green, etc. It&#x27;s not really a fail because it&#x27;s just a bit of pink and they still look really cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my other pair these are much more heavy duty feeling in my hands, the other pair seems so dainty and easy to break next to these. The spring action works very well on them, they clamp and curl my eyelashes without any pain or discomfort of any type. I think feeling them that the spring will stay strong for years and not weaken like some springs in other products would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this pair on one eye, my old pair on the other eye. They both curled equally as well, but these felt more comfortable in my hands while I was using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These also came with tweezers that have their own case so you can toss them in your purse, gym bag or in your suitcase if your traveling. They have cute flowers all over them making them definitely girly. They worked well and hold their own against all the other tweezers I own and use. They also come with this really kewl case that is pink with a clear cover. When the cover is taken off and the tweezers are taken out there is a mirror that you can use for quick touch ups. The other thing I found really neat is it is made to fit these specific tweezers and it has a magnet to help catch them and keep them inside. So if your lid got broken, lost or knocked off you could continue using the base to hold the tweezers. We had great fun just playing with the case and tweezers, yeah we are silly like that! I think this will come in handy because I often keep a set on me so when I a have a few moments of alone downtime/waiting time I can pluck a few on my chin. I have PCOS which causes excessive hair growth so I have to stay on top of this area constantly! I&#x27;m always losing tweezers and sometimes I find them again later, sometimes I don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good gift for a female of any age this holiday or just a good upgrade for yourself definitely check these out.ase and tweezers, yeah we are silly like that!

            <li> I have used this curler now about 5 times. I used my old curler on my left eye and used the new one on my right eye and asked my husband which one looks better? He of course all times picked the new one! The cool thing, it comes with free tweezers and a free mirror! And they are a pretty purple too and the tweezers have pretty flowers too! If your looking for a cool stocking Stuffer for the Beauty Queen of yours, look no further then the Best eyelash curler around by Occhio Beauty!</li>
            <li> I received these Eyelash Curlers to try and review from Occhio Beauty. I knew exactly who would love and appreciate them the most… my little sister Tiffany. So, I gave them to her to try out. She was excited because she had needed a new eyelash curler. Tiff was at once very happy about the cute tweezers that were included with the curlers. She thought the tweezers were excellent. Tiff liked the look of the new eyelash curlers. But she said that she needed to clamp them more than once for her desired curl. Tiff really liked how pretty and cute the set was and was very impressed that it had a little mirror. She said they would make an excellent gift for teen girls!</li>
            <li> The rubber on my old eye lash curler was taking it last breath when I got this one. I received a discount or free code to buy this curler.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my decision to get a new one. The eyelash curler is light weight yet sturdy and easy to keep a grip on. The handle holes where you grip the curler are not too small nor too big. They are perfectly sized to fit most fingers. Added bonus was the tweezers and the mirror. I use tweezers almost every day to remove the stray eyebrows and a whisker here and there. I like the total package, but would have appreciated if it came with an extra rubber as a replacement then it would have lasted much longer. Also I like the box it came in, perfect to give it as a gift to someone. I would surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised when I opened my package from the mail! This is the most adorable gift set I have ever seen. This is perfect for teens or adults. This eye lash curler is lightweight but still sturdy. The lightness of the eye lash curler makes it easier to use. The holes for your fingers are the perfect size and they don&#x27;t slide off your fingers. It contours closely to your face so you can get very close to your lash line. I have tried several different kinds of eye lash curlers and this one gets a lot closer to the lash lines than the others. This curls my eye lashes perfectly and did not leave a crease. I did not have to use much pressure at all. It comes in cute colors of black and lavender. This eye lash curler comes with an adorable pair of stainless steel tweezers in a mirrored case. The tweezers have a cute flower pattern on them. The case is lavender with a clear see-through cover. There is also a small mirror inside of the case. This is perfect to put in your purse or bag while traveling. I did receive this in exchange for my honest opinion. I did not receive any other compensation. This is my honest opinion and I only recommend products that I truly believe in. This set would make a perfect gift! I would highly recommend this eye lash curler and tweezers set!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works great my lashes stay curled! It doesn&#x27;t hurt my lashes and curls well! I love the colors and that it comes with a tweezer too! It&#x27;s an awesome little bonus!</li>
            <li> The rubber part that your eye lash sits on gets indented within seconds of use, causing your eyelashes to completely crease. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really love the tweezers in this set.</li>
            <li> This item did not come with the free tweezers &amp;  the eyelash curler itself is very cheaply made</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve had! And it came pretty quickly! Also, it looks exactly as the photo shows, you&#x27;ll be happy if you buy this!</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> Eyelash curlers are a girl&#x27;s best friend. Honestly, I could have no eye makeup on and just curl my lashes and leave the house. It just wakes up your entire look, and is something I find myself doing on a daily basis. Mascara is optional; curlers are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a huge beauty junkie myself, I&#x27;ve tried many an eyelash curler—from drugstore brand to high-end—and I have a few set favorites. I will admit that the Occhio eyelash curler is by far the prettiest one I&#x27;ve ever tried, but my praise pretty much ends there. Despite the &amp;#34;ergonomic design&amp;#34; the entire thing is way too clunky and hard to squeeze down on my eyelashes. It does not get close to the lashline, and it actually takes a lot of effort to physically press down due to the springs inside the device. I felt pinching and felt the curler just didn&#x27;t get all the way to the roots of my lashes, where maximum curling usually occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, it&#x27;s not one of those curlers that rips your eyelashes out or is completely ineffective. Bottom line: it WILL hold a curl, but not very close to the lashline, and not for very long. The actual contraption is quite sturdy and I think it&#x27;s well-made; I just wish it would be as effective as my Lancôme or Shu Umura curlers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it three stars is because I love the tweezer set that&#x27;s included. Not only is it absolutely cute, but it&#x27;s very precise and is great for shaping eyebrows. I love the little carrying case it comes with as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: I received a complimentary sample of this eyelash curler set from Occhio in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions—positive or otherwise—and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> Love the tweezers!!! The eyelash curler is meh... my drugstore curler works better than this. Keeping the product because I want the tweezers but they alone were not worth the money I paid for both products. I&#x27;d advise you search for a different set or just buy these things separately.</li>
            <li> So amazing, love these beauty products very much, Not only are they pretty but they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great little set that&#x27;s would make a great gift for yourself or even to give. It comes with one eyelash curler and one set of tweezers. I love the floral design on the tweezers which gives it a more feminine feel. The tweezers also come with a plastic case that has a small mirror on the inside. It&#x27;s not a hinged case, the top just comes off from the bottom. The inside where the tweezers sit is magnetic which is nice because it sort of &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; them in place. The mirror is small but usable if traveling. The eyelash curler that came in this set is good quality too. There was no pinching or pulling when I used it and it curled my lashes nicely. I do wish it came with at least one replacement pad for the curler though just in case. The grip of the curler is surrounded by a soft rubber so it feels very nice and comfortable to hold. I also love the pink accents on the curler. Overall this is a nice set and perfect for traveling. I received a complimentary product for testing purposes. Regardless, my thoughts and opinions are always completely honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> Fast shiping very pleased... , My girlfriend love it...</li>
            <li> I purchased these items because of the reviews and the eyelash curler works really nice without much effort or any sort of pinching. The tweezers are cute and pick up fine hairs with ease. More effortless than some of those expensive metal curlers. The only thing you should be aware of is that there is a bonus gift opportunity on the back of the package, but the link for the bonus gift takes you to an alternative website that advertises free online book to \\&quot;Secrets to Getting the Best Deals!\\&quot; Bummer. :P</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler pinches like all the others I have tried. It is not any better than any of them.</li>
            <li> Love both the eyelash curler and the tweezers.  The fast shipping is also appreciated!</li>
