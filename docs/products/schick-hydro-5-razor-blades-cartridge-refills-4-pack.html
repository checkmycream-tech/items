            <li>I love this razor s</li>
            <li>Other than that, the best razor I ever had!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog up the way most of the razors do, and gives you a clean shave with just a couple of passes.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, not that I doubted it at all</li>
            <li>I have a very course beard and did not have many expectations but am extremely pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to anyone who is in need of durable and effective razors</li>
            <li>I am now 38 and from my teenage years to now, I was constantly upgrading razors to find the best.</li>
            <li>Good close, clean, shave with minimal nics/cuts!</li>
            <li>Works very well!!</li>
            <li>i consider it very HI quality staff i find always comfortable and no cuts on my face whit it</li>
            <li>TOTALLY worth getting,</li>
            <li>i only use schick-  great  product and  one blade lasts long</li>
            <li>AND THIS GIVES A VERY CLOSE SHAVE!</li>
            <li>There is no product to beat this for a guaranteed and gentle shave more so for men in their 40s and above.</li>

            <li>You can buy Suave conditioner for really cheap and it will last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend a shaver instead of this item.</li>
            <li>Overall I like these blades, however with five blades one would think a single stroke would result in a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>5 razors with oil lubrication PLUS a flip open head to get the tough spots and make everything nice and even!</li>
            <li>These are the normal, high quality, blades that you would purchase in a local store.</li>
            <li>The feel of the razor is exactly the same, but what is different is Schick Hydro&#x27;s last so much longer!  </li>
            <li>The skin guards totally help against irritation, it&#x27;s got this flip trimmer that gets those hard/sensitive areas like under your nose and even though the handle is thin it fits great in a big hand like mine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t affect the quality any, but I don&#x27;t want anyone to be surprised.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I guess my skin is not ment for shaving. I highly recommend a shaver instead of this item. I hate fat chicks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these razors! I am now 38 and from my teenage years to now, I was constantly upgrading razors to find the best. Well, this is it! 5 razors with oil lubrication PLUS a flip open head to get the tough spots and make everything nice and even! I will probably use these for the rest of my shaving life.</li>
            <li> i only use schick-  great  product and  one blade lasts long</li>
            <li> I actually use only this brand becouse i consider it very HI quality staff i find always comfortable and no cuts on my face whit it</li>
            <li> I have a very course beard and did not have many expectations but am extremely pleased with this razor. I will order more refills when these are empty.</li>
            <li> My husband really liked the razor he got as a free sample at a hotel, so we were glad to find replacement blades.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell the difference from one bought at the store. I only use this razor now I no longer like the others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product and needed to get another set of refills - they lived up to expectations and I am still happy with it.</li>
            <li> I shaved once with the Hydro 5 and won&#x27;t switch. The razor cartridges tend to be costly at the store, but online the are affordable. Good close, clean, shave with minimal nics/cuts!</li>
            <li> THE CARTRIDGES HAVE 5 BLADES EACH AND THIS GIVES A VERY CLOSE SHAVE! I LOVE THEM AND THEY LAST ALONG TIME!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well!!</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It gives me the best shave ever......I highly recommend it , especially for men with heavy beards.</li>
            <li> There is no product to beat this for a guaranteed and gentle shave more so for men in their 40s and above. It is also durable and does not cause inflammation of the skin.</li>
            <li> Never has a problem with Schick razors and still have no complaints. Fantastic product, not that I doubted it at all</li>
            <li> These razors are used in our home by females for shaving legs &amp; underarms.  They are wonderful!  Nice smooth shave w/o any type of gels or lotions to avoid nicks and cuts.  They are a definite bargain on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Gillette Mach 3 and then Mach 4 razors, then I took a chance and purchased these.  The feel of the razor is exactly the same, but what is different is Schick Hydro&#x27;s last so much longer!  I save so much money using these razors, I will never use anything else.  Also, quit buying shaving cream, you are wasting your money!  Shave with conditioner instead, you will save even more cash.  You can buy Suave conditioner for really cheap and it will last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> these are the best razors I&#x27;ve ever had.  I highly recommend them to anyone who is in need of durable and effective razors</li>
            <li> Hydro 5 beats Fusion. No contest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Schick products for more years that I care to mention. This razor gives me the closest shave with the minimal effort. It doesn&#x27;t clog up the way most of the razors do, and gives you a clean shave with just a couple of passes. The only con this product has, is that due to the relatively thick sides, it&#x27;s hard to get in the tight corners. Other than that, the best razor I ever had! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I used to use Gillette and now the Hydro 5. The blades last 3 times as long and they are also cheaper.</li>
            <li> Got to say, I am loving my Schick &amp;#34;HYDRO&amp;#34; Razor. The skin guards totally help against irritation, it&#x27;s got this flip trimmer that gets those hard/sensitive areas like under your nose and even though the handle is thin it fits great in a big hand like mine. TOTALLY worth getting,</li>
            <li> I used to spend a lot more money on fancy blades. These are the best disposable razors I have tried. I can even go 3-5 weeks on one blade, before I need to replace. Yes, I shave my face everyday. Try it-you will like it.</li>
            <li> These are the normal, high quality, blades that you would purchase in a local store. Just note that you are getting boxes printed in Chinese. Doesn&#x27;t affect the quality any, but I don&#x27;t want anyone to be surprised.</li>
            <li> Overall I like these blades, however with five blades one would think a single stroke would result in a very smooth shave.  Not my experience</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and does all I require of it. I love this razor s it gives me the closest shave ever without any cuts.</li>
