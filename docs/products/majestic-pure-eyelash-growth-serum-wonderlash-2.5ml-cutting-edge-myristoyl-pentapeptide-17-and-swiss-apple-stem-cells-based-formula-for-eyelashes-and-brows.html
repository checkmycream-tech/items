            <li>so I&#x27;m really happy to find a product that gives me good results and makes my eyelashes look fuller and longer without mascara!</li>
            <li>The shipping of the product was great but everytime I&#x27;ve used the product it burns my eyelids.</li>
            <li>It worked great for me, I got mine from RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
            <li>There is no stinging or adverse reactions which is great with any product applied so close to the eye.</li>
            <li>and I have experienced eye irritation and discomfort.</li>
            <li>and this serum is great, from it&#x27;s application brush to the quality of the product.</li>

            <li>Great product , the eyelash growth serum works.</li>
            <li>Now I have switched to this brand and quite  happy after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I would apply it twice a day once in the morning and once at night and have had great results.</li>
            <li>I guess lol</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Wonderlash!!</li>
            <li>Apply this product for about 3 weeks or more and you will see a noticeable difference in the length of your lashes!!  </li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>I applied it before going to bed, I think the product works best at night. :)</li>
            <li>i will give you more feed backs as soon as i got the best result..</li>
            <li>very good product and delivery is OK</li>
            <li>I received a great deal to try this product to share my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>It really is a good product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a fair chance so for two months...</li>
            <li>so I told him to buy me this brand because it was cheaper than Latisse and the reviews were good.  </li>
            <li>When I find out if they have good luck with it, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li>so I was hoping WonderLash would be a good replacement.</li>
            <li>The ones I had been using had been good, like I said not miraculous, but then I don&#x27;t believe any of these</li>
            <li>It is a good products if you have thinning eyelashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li>Super happy customer here!!</li>
            <li>Â  Very satisfied</li>
            <li>You apply it just like eyeliner on the top eye which I thought was great.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product I have been using it since I received</li>
            <li>The applicator wand is incredibly easy to use and runs perfectly along the top of your lash area, like you&#x27;re pinstriping your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s on the more inexpensive side for the quality!</li>
            <li>I saw more growth in about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>and I am enjoying it!</li>
            <li>But the best part is that this product really works!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product!</li>

            <li>Easy to apply, have been looking for a great product like this for a while</li>
            <li>Great product to get and easy to use too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very excited about the results!  </li>
            <li>Amazing product</li>
            <li>which is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it really has no scent (which is great!)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this but not quite as effective as Latisse</li>
            <li>I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>This review is written in my own words.</li>
            <li>and I really feel to date that this is the best one.  </li>
            <li>All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>you lose your own lashes</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think to take a before picture, but I am loving how my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product discounted in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>I did wait for 2 weeks to review this product to give honest feedback.</li>
            <li>I am not seeing as many fall out though, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>what you need to know about this kind of products is one, that it doesn&#x27;t do miracles, and two the changes don&#x27;t happen overnight.</li>
            <li>As with others, who are a litte stingy on application, I had no problem with this one, which I totally liked.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for a reduced fee to give my honest opinion</li>
            <li>for  an  honest  </li>
            <li>The serum is odorless and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li>As a blogger, companies sometimes provide me with samples of their products, and in this case, I was provided Wonderlash serum to test and review and to give my honest opinion of the results.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t attest to how effective it is after weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I purchased another kind of lash serum, Wink, from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Honestly I was about to give up on this after two weeks of use</li>
            <li>The brush is like a nice liquid eyeliner brush and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>so it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>serum is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to have been given the opportunity to try out this product and share my honest thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li>Being able to review this for free and being able to keep it was great.</li>
            <li>I have had no irritation and am amazed at how easy this product is to apply!</li>
            <li>does not hurt eye, easy to apply..love it!</li>
            <li>It comes with a very fine brush</li>
            <li>but when I ordered it I received it very quickly!</li>
            <li>Well, Majestic Pure offered me their Eyelash Growth Serum for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li>I used Rapid Lash before and found that it worked fine too!  </li>
            <li>Love the bottle and how easy I can just take it with me without a hassle!</li>
            <li>Application is extremely easy (just brush the product on) and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked how easy the application was.</li>
            <li>I have previously used the reLash product, had good results with it, and best of all, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it getting in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using on my eyebrow because I have the most thiniest eyebrows no results there either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I plan to continue to use it until it’s all gone and hope that the results turn out to be even better.</li>
            <li>I just brush it on my top lid along my lash line</li>
            <li>Much more affordable than Latisse and extensions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>but If you do it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Will follow up when I have more results from it.</li>
            <li>work better than the $125 version (Latisse).</li>
            <li>but now it is better.</li>
            <li>I thought they would be more fuller.</li>
            <li>Awesome as I have a very short lashes.</li>
            <li>More than before.</li>
            <li>Still it&#x27;s a good deal and worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love that they dont test on animals and its made here in the USA.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see more</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it and it has only been about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>and I love how I have thicker eyebrows now too.  </li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s totally filled in!</li>
            <li>love love love this product:)</li>
            <li>I wont be able to buy it again if not at discounted price.</li>
            <li>Actually better because it is natural!&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t irritate or leave any feeling that it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>there where no results and I have used many lash growth serums.  </li>
            <li>Lil Lash was my favorite</li>
            <li>AND I love that it is made for eyelashes AND eyebrows...</li>
            <li>I believe in this product, hope they come out with more.</li>
            <li>Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>and my lashes look much better.  </li>
            <li>so put it somewhere safe.</li>
            <li>I put it on 2x per day to top lash line and then on my eyebrows where I would like them fuller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I applied more often</li>
            <li>It burned my skin and I dont think this is a reputable company.</li>
            <li>and I love my eyelashes now.</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to follow and application is easy!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Another home run from Majestic Pure - I have been thrilled with all of their products!</li>
            <li>I have pretty good lashes to begin with</li>
            <li>If this was really a good product, I would certainly expect more attention to detail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try it because I&#x27;ve been wanting my lashes to grow for quite some time!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, just make sure you use it sparingly because it stings a bit if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it was easy to apply and after day 3 my lashes appear to be fuller and darker.</li>
            <li>It allows me to have a more natural appearance and makes my lashes look great with mascara</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how if this serum would work on me since I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have seen very good results especially with eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t tested on animals which is a huge plus for me, but I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with my results and the product</li>
            <li>her eyelashes are absolutely longer and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I really would loved to make this product work</li>
            <li>Since this came with a tiny brush instead of a mascara wand, I used this on my eyebrows and really loved the results!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use it doesn&#x27;t burn the eye.</li>
            <li>I like easy things.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>

            <li>I also like how fine the brush is.</li>

            <li>I received it for free from AMZ review trader but I plan to repurchase it at retail when I run out.</li>
            <li>I use it on my lower lashes lightly even though manufacturer recommends against it, and it works well.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product to try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of eye lash grower but it was all just cheap stuff from Walmart.</li>
            <li>I will write another review later, but as for now, this product is GREAT.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good as for shipping, handling, appearance and ease of application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very positive I will see more progress as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li>the application process is easy and you only have to apply it once a day which is nice!</li>
            <li>i wanted to write a review of this product right away because I absolutely love the size of the container.</li>
            <li>They have darkened up very nicely and it&#x27;s now not absolutely necessary for me to darken them before I go out!</li>
            <li>This serum is a nice one i feel like it gives instant eyelash results to make them look and feel thicker and longer.. doesnt burn or sting or run its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, very affordable  and regular use definitely yields good results.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this serum a try since I&#x27;ve undergone treatments for a health condition and lost significantly from my lashes and brows.</li>
            <li>and i am excited to see the difference it makes.</li>
            <li>This serum is seriously worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure on that though because this is the first eye lash growing syrum I have used</li>
            <li>I plan to continue using it and feel pretty confident that it will continue to make my lashes grow in fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>I also used on my eyebrows and they are growing back in nice and think!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to update my review once I&#x27;ve had time to see the product work</li>
            <li>so I think if I keep consistent I&#x27;ll see more results.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t pay the original price.</li>
            <li>I got so excited when I got this</li>
            <li>more  sensitive  skin than most.</li>
            <li>Got this item for review, It is very easy to apply and love the fact you only have to apply it once a day!</li>
            <li>I also bought it when it was on special; that being said after trying it I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>I could see a fullness difference but not enough to write good ratings about.</li>
            <li>I will update my review with pics in a couple weeks as it does take time for this stuff to start to work and show full results.</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing this product and future for myself and as gifts for loved ones</li>
            <li>I see some results, hopefully it gets better, thanks for allowing me to review this.</li>
            <li>I gave a 3 rating because I haven&#x27;t had the full affect yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product holds true to being non irritant tomtheneyes&#x27;</li>
            <li>Now, I have wonderful thick, full lashes.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the fact that it does not make my eyelids burn like other products have done.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for products to quickly regrow and thicken these eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyelid.</li>
            <li>Upon applying I get a mild burning that lasts for about 2 to 3 min then</li>
            <li>and it got in my eye quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily it did not burn-</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are sparse and anything that will help them grow and look longer and fuller is a super bonus.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product because of price, usuage and most of all it works.</li>
            <li>I am pleased at the results I have obtained so far from using Magic Pure.</li>
            <li>This works very fast!</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I was selected to receive this eyelash growth serum during a promotion at a slight discount and let you know what I thought of it.</li>
            <li>Really works!!</li>
            <li>My lashes have thinned out significantly over the years and this product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>so I am pretty excited.</li>
            <li>This is one of the reasons I enjoy MAJESTIC PURE products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hopefully she will start using even more regularly so she can get the amazing results this product offers!</li>
            <li>Havent used it enough to see drastic change, but so far it is amazing :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing much of a difference, but my eyelashes are a light brown.  </li>
            <li>that were far more generous than this and will not buy again.</li>
            <li>The results are far more noticeable if you do what I did, and that’s use mascara.</li>
            <li>I really have liked it so far</li>
            <li>My lashes are growing somewhat longer, but they have started falling out much more frequently.  </li>
            <li>I apply right about my lashes actually touching the lashes to get the product on the lashes and apply directly to eyebrows.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is very appealing, easy to use and same method as others, apply twice daily on a clean face.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be that one person that saw the difference right away.</li>
            <li>but I stopped using it because it irritated my right eyelid.</li>
            <li>I have used serums of this sort in the past, but this caught my eye because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>You just brush a tiny amount on your eyelid lash line and it&#x27;s as easy as that!</li>
            <li>And that is something that I am really pretty serious about, finding a good bargain!</li>
            <li>My wife was looking for a product that could grow and enhance her eye lashes, and since I trust the Majestic Pure product line as I have bought other products of this brand and loved them all I decided to get this for my wife to try.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well and has no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars right now because I haven&#x27;t been able to use this to</li>
            <li>Shipped very, very fast (thank you Prime).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used another type of enhancer/extender serum that worked better, but I stopped using it because although my lashed grew significantly longer, they fell out very frequently resulting in an overall look that wasn&#x27;t really any better than natural lashes.  </li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>Maybe because they are not sticking straight out!  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I have enough for a 30 day review.</li>
            <li>first time using it</li>
            <li>I love having smaller containers of things</li>
            <li>But I really enjoyed this product and definitely noticed some results.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wake up with fairy princess eyelashes or anything, but I definitely noticed some more length and fullness.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand the first question.</li>
            <li>VERY COMPARABLE!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>and I promise I think this stuff is a comic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable!</li>
            <li>I can only hope this stuff was never texted on innocent animals.</li>
            <li>Do not apply more than once daily.</li>
            <li>Have only been using it about six weeks so hoping for even more results.  </li>
            <li>I wish I took a before picture just to show how much fuller they look!</li>
            <li>but I can definitely see more</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you only apply it once a day.</li>
            <li>I used Latisse a few years ago and LOVED it</li>
            <li>The bottle you get is very small and if you don&#x27;t put it some place safe would get lost very easy.</li>
            <li>The ingredients, particularly Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 &amp; Swiss Apple Stem Cells are very powerful and used in high end products selling for over $80</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and so far am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I cannot really say my lashes have grown a lot, but I can definitely say they look more luscious and volumized.</li>
            <li>I have been using Majestic Pure&#x27;s Eyelash Growth Serum for exactly two weeks, every day.</li>
            <li>There was a very noticeable difference in my eyelashes within the first week.</li>
            <li>..pretty much forget its on there in the first place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a dramatic growth but it works and it keeps my eyelashes looking long and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is super, super tiny</li>
            <li>Pointed brush is easy to use and apply (similar to eyeliner).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My son bought this Majestic Pure Eyelash Growth Serum as a gift for my birthday</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure&#x27;s Wonderlash serum isn&#x27;t a miracle eyelash growth serum but it DOES enhance what you have.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure Eyelash Growth Serum -</li>
            <li>This is really easy to apply to your eye lashes and it is a fast simple application.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to see if they will be long because they are still in the growing process.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I could not be happier!!</li>
            <li>I have fine lashes and have notices they are starting to thicken.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is tiny but all you really need is a little bit lol</li>
            <li>because I didn&#x27;t really know what my eyelashes looked like before.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t clump as much.</li>
            <li>i been using this for about 4 days straight and already see results eyelashes look fuller and a inch longer hoping by the end of the month</li>
            <li>didnt really notice a difference..</li>
            <li>so you dont need to apply so much product.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t-I look really washed out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My lashes have thicken and lengthen, but I really like the size of container.</li>
            <li>This one, Wonderlash, filled  in my lashes and made them grow again especially in the outer corners.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I would say it adds more lashes, adds some length, not much in terms of thickness.  </li>
            <li>Tremendously I am very please with this product</li>
            <li>I swear by this serum now and rightfully so, they have done clinical trials that prove this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like wearing makeup</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s absolutely ZERO difference in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start by saying I would absolutely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li>In order to use it up, I&#x27;ve been using the Wonderlash on my eyebrows, but haven&#x27;t noticed it making much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much growth.</li>
            <li>I really think you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to take much to get results.</li>
            <li>but I guess you don&#x27;t have much product for each use.</li>
            <li>I give it a 3 stars cause it really dose work</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it&#x27;s not irritating like some of the others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and am looking forward to the results in a few weeks!</li>
            <li>SO much cheaper than eye lash extensions</li>
            <li>It dries fast though.</li>
            <li>Burns my eyes soooo much.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m noticing how much fuller they really look when I comb them in the morning</li>
            <li>I honestly can say that my eyelashes look longer and fully just after a few days.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the high positive reviews on this product?  </li>
            <li>I have seen better results from other products.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first thinking that it was to little of a product to do me any good!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to see if this product works similarly.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of doing something about making my lashes longer and this product makes it super simple to do that.</li>
            <li>Have used it for a month now and to be honest not sure if I am getting any results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my reviews short sweet and helpful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue on for 30 full days to see further results.</li>
            <li>far Ive been using the product for three weeks, and I doubt I&#x27;ll make it to the fourth, running out of it pretty quickly, but then like I said, I overuse a bit.  </li>
            <li>Good amount for the price - lasts because you only use a little.</li>
            <li>In just under a week of using this serum, my eyebrows have new growth!</li>
            <li>The bottle is super tiny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>My skimpy blonde eyelashes can only get better.  </li>
            <li>Applying it once daily is simple (make sure you&#x27;ve removed all make up), and my eyes and skin have not had any problems adjusting to it.</li>
            <li>, my eyelashes are longer and don&#x27;t fall out as much, my sparse brow areas are filling in nicely, but slowly.</li>
            <li>So far, I do like the results that are appearing for my eyelashes because as you can see, I really don&#x27;t have much length to them.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>So I am getting a major bargain purchasing from Majestic Pure!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but it may just need a little more time.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot wait to see the results in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>Can any wait to see what they look like in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After it dries I can add my normal makeup</li>
            <li>and it it will, in fact, enhance my normal lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like I said, you can&#x27;t expect miracles, but if we see this product as an enhancer you will definitely see a difference in time, which in my opinion makes it worth</li>
            <li>I plan to update this review in a few weeks from now when I have had more time with this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear makeup except when I&#x27;m going somewhere, so I tried to stay home for the past 2 weeks to truly make sure of the results.</li>
            <li>You will be able to do both eyes with one application and use less product!</li>
            <li>WonderLash is supplied in a standard eyeliner style applicator that is simple to use and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Other top companies that use these ingredients in their eyelash/brow enhancers charge an absolute arm and leg for their products, even for smaller sizes!</li>
            <li>I have absolutely fallen in love with Majestic Pure&#x27;s Wonderlash Serum for several reasons, First off it is made with very high end ingredients, including MYRISTOYL PENTAPEPTIDE-17, SWISS APPLE STEM CELL EXTRACT and BOTANICAL COMPLEX TRICHOLASTYL!</li>
            <li>My brows have also started looking more filled in, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because they are darker or actually filling in a bit, but they look so much nicer after a very short amount of time!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product until I run out, in hopes that even a very slight improvement is better than nothing, but I do not plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li>It has been making new growth come out on the outer part of my eyebrows</li>
            <li>Pure magic in a small bottle!</li>
            <li>Super teeny, tiny bottle but only using it once a day you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>the brush included makes it a little difficult to apply to eyelashes but to fix that I use an eyelash/eyebrow brush after applying to make sure it gets a good coat.</li>
            <li>Forget the struggle of applying your fake eyelashes and grow out your own!</li>
            <li>I got to try Wonderlash on a promotional price but would recommend so far!</li>
            <li>While I do not see any &#x27;growth&#x27; as of yet, I can tell that my lashes are definitely conditioned and softer.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is exactly like a liquid eyeliner;</li>
            <li>Overall it seems like a decent product that I haven&#x27;t had any real issues with.</li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to full dark lashes again!</li>
            <li>I am only giving this four stars now because I havent been able to see the full effects just yet, but I have noticed a small change (it&#x27;s only been a week).</li>
            <li>For those of you who have tried it for only a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, keep in mind that even products such as Latisse do not show results until about 4 weeks, and up to 16 weeks for the full effect.</li>
            <li>Was recommended by a friend and appears to be giving the same positive results RE longer and fuller lashes...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a different, but I do notice that it is easier to put my mascara on over top of it</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- generous amount in each bottle - certainly will last longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have several products from MAJESTIC  PURE.</li>
            <li>I was cursed with VERY light eyebrows and have had to use an eyebrow pencil in the past for them to even be visible!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and eyelids, but this product has not caused any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lashes have been very short my whole life</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive to a lot of products-not this serum.  </li>
            <li>and they are soft and lushes</li>
            <li>I noticed fuller thicker lashes, but not too much longer than my regular lashes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any changes so far though on my eye brows but we will see if that changes in the weeks to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me tell you that she absolutely loves this product, she is definitely seeing growth and noticing her lashes thicken.</li>
            <li>Plus I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far I can say it did not hurt my eyes</li>
            <li>At the end of two weeks of using it daily, I took another photo, much lighter with a needed eyebrow taming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is not for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Do not apply Eyelash Grower to the lower eyelashes nor directly to the eye surface.</li>
            <li>No irritation so far.</li>
            <li>They are longer,  darker not so much fuller but definitely healthier.</li>
            <li>So far no change in lashes.  </li>
            <li>The only difference is it really burns my eyes.</li>
            <li>But I really think this product is more so for thin lashes and not just making your lashes longer.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t have a problem if your doing it right and far enough above the lashes.</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply and looks like a small mascara type bottle.</li>
            <li>DAY 6: my lashes are already noticeably longer and my eyebrows are full in the previously sparse areas.</li>
            <li>I bought this at promotional cost and will purchase again if the result remains positive for a long run.</li>
            <li>It is a great alternative to fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 starts because it burns if you get a little in your eye.</li>
            <li>When I have purchased Revitalash in the past, I really did notice a fast and noticeable improvement so that is the product I will return</li>
            <li>By day 7 was only wearing clear mascara and coworkers noticed immediately.</li>
            <li>I began seeing results a couple of days ago, and my lashes have seen enough improvement to boost my confidence about how they naturally look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I applied the first coat above and below my lash line, be careful NOT to get any in your eyes</li>
            <li>i will be filming a full review and progression hd pics over a few weeks and you can see the results for yourself!</li>
            <li>I was so tired of spending hundreds of dollars on Latisse (A product in which I love).</li>
            <li>I have not experienced any irritation and am sure to not get too close to my eyeballs just in case, though I did poke myself in the eye once</li>
            <li>And it causes some minor itchy irritation where applied and to some extent on my eyelids, but I have generally have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They are filling in nicely at the beginning of the brow where they were very thin.</li>
            <li>I have tried this a few more times with super careful application and my left upper eyelid has developed a hard, red bump that won&#x27;t go away even though I have stopped using the product.</li>
            <li>And once again, the overall look isn&#x27;t much different than the natural lash.  </li>
            <li>I felt a little stingy at first</li>
            <li>A little hesitant at first when i didn&#x27;t see immediate results.</li>
            <li>This little product really packs a punch!</li>
            <li>The brush applicator is very thin and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I apply it nightly to my eyebrows and eyelashes, and I noticed how thick and full they have gotten in a short period of time!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The shipping of the product was great but everytime I&#x27;ve used the product it burns my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It worked great for me, I got mine from RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
            <li> There is no stinging or adverse reactions which is great with any product applied so close to the eye.</li>
            <li> and I have experienced eye irritation and discomfort.</li>

            <li> I was so happy to get this at discounted price</li>
            <li> Great product , the eyelash growth serum works.</li>
            <li> Now I have switched to this brand and quite  happy after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I would apply it twice a day once in the morning and once at night and have had great results.</li>
            <li> I guess lol</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Wonderlash!!</li>
            <li> Apply this product for about 3 weeks or more and you will see a noticeable difference in the length of your lashes!!  </li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I applied it before going to bed, I think the product works best at night. :)</li>
            <li> i will give you more feed backs as soon as i got the best result..</li>
            <li> very good product and delivery is OK</li>
            <li> I received a great deal to try this product to share my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It really is a good product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a fair chance so for two months...</li>
            <li> so I told him to buy me this brand because it was cheaper than Latisse and the reviews were good.  </li>
            <li> When I find out if they have good luck with it, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> so I was hoping WonderLash would be a good replacement.</li>
            <li> The ones I had been using had been good, like I said not miraculous, but then I don&#x27;t believe any of these</li>
            <li> It is a good products if you have thinning eyelashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li> Super happy customer here!!</li>
            <li> Â  Very satisfied</li>
            <li> You apply it just like eyeliner on the top eye which I thought was great.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product I have been using it since I received</li>
            <li> The applicator wand is incredibly easy to use and runs perfectly along the top of your lash area, like you&#x27;re pinstriping your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s on the more inexpensive side for the quality!</li>
            <li> I saw more growth in about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> and I am enjoying it!</li>
            <li> But the best part is that this product really works!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product!</li>
            <li> Love the results!</li>
            <li> More to come soon!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, have been looking for a great product like this for a while</li>
            <li> Great product to get and easy to use too.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very excited about the results!  </li>
            <li> Amazing product</li>
            <li> which is amazing.</li>
            <li> but it really has no scent (which is great!)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this but not quite as effective as Latisse</li>
            <li> I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> This review is written in my own words.</li>
            <li> and I really feel to date that this is the best one.  </li>
            <li> All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> you lose your own lashes</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think to take a before picture, but I am loving how my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product discounted in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> I did wait for 2 weeks to review this product to give honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing as many fall out though, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> what you need to know about this kind of products is one, that it doesn&#x27;t do miracles, and two the changes don&#x27;t happen overnight.</li>
            <li> As with others, who are a litte stingy on application, I had no problem with this one, which I totally liked.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a reduced fee to give my honest opinion</li>
            <li> for  an  honest  </li>
            <li> The serum is odorless and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li> As a blogger, companies sometimes provide me with samples of their products, and in this case, I was provided Wonderlash serum to test and review and to give my honest opinion of the results.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t attest to how effective it is after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased another kind of lash serum, Wink, from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was about to give up on this after two weeks of use</li>
            <li> The brush is like a nice liquid eyeliner brush and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> so it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> serum is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad to have been given the opportunity to try out this product and share my honest thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> Being able to review this for free and being able to keep it was great.</li>
            <li> I have had no irritation and am amazed at how easy this product is to apply!</li>
            <li> does not hurt eye, easy to apply..love it!</li>
            <li> It comes with a very fine brush</li>
            <li> but when I ordered it I received it very quickly!</li>
            <li> Well, Majestic Pure offered me their Eyelash Growth Serum for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li> I used Rapid Lash before and found that it worked fine too!  </li>
            <li> Love the bottle and how easy I can just take it with me without a hassle!</li>
            <li> Application is extremely easy (just brush the product on) and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked how easy the application was.</li>
            <li> I have previously used the reLash product, had good results with it, and best of all, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it getting in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using on my eyebrow because I have the most thiniest eyebrows no results there either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I plan to continue to use it until it’s all gone and hope that the results turn out to be even better.</li>
            <li> I just brush it on my top lid along my lash line</li>
            <li> Much more affordable than Latisse and extensions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> but If you do it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Will follow up when I have more results from it.</li>
            <li> work better than the $125 version (Latisse).</li>
            <li> but now it is better.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be more fuller.</li>
            <li> Awesome as I have a very short lashes.</li>
            <li> More than before.</li>
            <li> Still it&#x27;s a good deal and worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love that they dont test on animals and its made here in the USA.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see more</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it and it has only been about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> and I love how I have thicker eyebrows now too.  </li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s totally filled in!</li>
            <li> love love love this product:)</li>
            <li> I wont be able to buy it again if not at discounted price.</li>
            <li> Actually better because it is natural!&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t irritate or leave any feeling that it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> there where no results and I have used many lash growth serums.  </li>
            <li> Lil Lash was my favorite</li>
            <li> AND I love that it is made for eyelashes AND eyebrows...</li>
            <li> I believe in this product, hope they come out with more.</li>
            <li> Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> and my lashes look much better.  </li>
            <li> so put it somewhere safe.</li>
            <li> I put it on 2x per day to top lash line and then on my eyebrows where I would like them fuller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I applied more often</li>
            <li> It burned my skin and I dont think this is a reputable company.</li>
            <li> and I love my eyelashes now.</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to follow and application is easy!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Another home run from Majestic Pure - I have been thrilled with all of their products!</li>
            <li> I have pretty good lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> If this was really a good product, I would certainly expect more attention to detail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try it because I&#x27;ve been wanting my lashes to grow for quite some time!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, just make sure you use it sparingly because it stings a bit if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it was easy to apply and after day 3 my lashes appear to be fuller and darker.</li>
            <li> It allows me to have a more natural appearance and makes my lashes look great with mascara</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how if this serum would work on me since I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have seen very good results especially with eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love that it isn&#x27;t tested on animals which is a huge plus for me, but I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with my results and the product</li>
            <li> her eyelashes are absolutely longer and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> I really would loved to make this product work</li>
            <li> Since this came with a tiny brush instead of a mascara wand, I used this on my eyebrows and really loved the results!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use it doesn&#x27;t burn the eye.</li>
            <li> I like easy things.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It truly is non-irritant and easy to apply to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> :) thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> The application process is easy and convenient, you put it on and go</li>
            <li> It is easy to use it&#x27;s like an eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> so it makes it easy to carry.</li>
            <li> This serum is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- easy to put on&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also so EASY to apply (</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> After using this product for a week I notice that my lashes looks more full and define.</li>
            <li> The brush included works fine for applying to my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I also like how fine the brush is.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to get this wonderlash serum free to try!</li>
            <li> If you are in the same predicament with your eyebrows, this Eyelash Growth Serum from Majestic Pure is perfect!</li>
            <li> For someone with  short eyelash, this is simply a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for your short, brittle lashes!</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and has no smell.</li>
            <li> I received it for free from AMZ review trader but I plan to repurchase it at retail when I run out.</li>
            <li> I use it on my lower lashes lightly even though manufacturer recommends against it, and it works well.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of eye lash grower but it was all just cheap stuff from Walmart.</li>
            <li> I will write another review later, but as for now, this product is GREAT.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good as for shipping, handling, appearance and ease of application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very positive I will see more progress as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> the application process is easy and you only have to apply it once a day which is nice!</li>
            <li> i wanted to write a review of this product right away because I absolutely love the size of the container.</li>
            <li> They have darkened up very nicely and it&#x27;s now not absolutely necessary for me to darken them before I go out!</li>
            <li> This serum is a nice one i feel like it gives instant eyelash results to make them look and feel thicker and longer.. doesnt burn or sting or run its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, very affordable  and regular use definitely yields good results.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this serum a try since I&#x27;ve undergone treatments for a health condition and lost significantly from my lashes and brows.</li>
            <li> and i am excited to see the difference it makes.</li>
            <li> This serum is seriously worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure on that though because this is the first eye lash growing syrum I have used</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using it and feel pretty confident that it will continue to make my lashes grow in fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> I also used on my eyebrows and they are growing back in nice and think!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to update my review once I&#x27;ve had time to see the product work</li>
            <li> so I think if I keep consistent I&#x27;ll see more results.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t pay the original price.</li>
            <li> I got so excited when I got this</li>
            <li> more  sensitive  skin than most.</li>
            <li> Got this item for review, It is very easy to apply and love the fact you only have to apply it once a day!</li>
            <li> I also bought it when it was on special; that being said after trying it I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> I could see a fullness difference but not enough to write good ratings about.</li>
            <li> I will update my review with pics in a couple weeks as it does take time for this stuff to start to work and show full results.</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing this product and future for myself and as gifts for loved ones</li>
            <li> I see some results, hopefully it gets better, thanks for allowing me to review this.</li>
            <li> I gave a 3 rating because I haven&#x27;t had the full affect yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product holds true to being non irritant tomtheneyes&#x27;</li>
            <li> Now, I have wonderful thick, full lashes.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the fact that it does not make my eyelids burn like other products have done.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for products to quickly regrow and thicken these eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyelid.</li>
            <li> Upon applying I get a mild burning that lasts for about 2 to 3 min then</li>
            <li> and it got in my eye quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily it did not burn-</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are sparse and anything that will help them grow and look longer and fuller is a super bonus.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product because of price, usuage and most of all it works.</li>
            <li> I am pleased at the results I have obtained so far from using Magic Pure.</li>
            <li> This works very fast!</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I was selected to receive this eyelash growth serum during a promotion at a slight discount and let you know what I thought of it.</li>
            <li> Really works!!</li>
            <li> My lashes have thinned out significantly over the years and this product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> so I am pretty excited.</li>
            <li> This is one of the reasons I enjoy MAJESTIC PURE products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hopefully she will start using even more regularly so she can get the amazing results this product offers!</li>
            <li> Havent used it enough to see drastic change, but so far it is amazing :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing much of a difference, but my eyelashes are a light brown.  </li>
            <li> that were far more generous than this and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The results are far more noticeable if you do what I did, and that’s use mascara.</li>
            <li> I really have liked it so far</li>
            <li> My lashes are growing somewhat longer, but they have started falling out much more frequently.  </li>
            <li> I apply right about my lashes actually touching the lashes to get the product on the lashes and apply directly to eyebrows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is very appealing, easy to use and same method as others, apply twice daily on a clean face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be that one person that saw the difference right away.</li>
            <li> but I stopped using it because it irritated my right eyelid.</li>
            <li> I have used serums of this sort in the past, but this caught my eye because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> You just brush a tiny amount on your eyelid lash line and it&#x27;s as easy as that!</li>
            <li> And that is something that I am really pretty serious about, finding a good bargain!</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a product that could grow and enhance her eye lashes, and since I trust the Majestic Pure product line as I have bought other products of this brand and loved them all I decided to get this for my wife to try.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well and has no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars right now because I haven&#x27;t been able to use this to</li>
            <li> Shipped very, very fast (thank you Prime).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another type of enhancer/extender serum that worked better, but I stopped using it because although my lashed grew significantly longer, they fell out very frequently resulting in an overall look that wasn&#x27;t really any better than natural lashes.  </li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> Maybe because they are not sticking straight out!  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure I have enough for a 30 day review.</li>
            <li> first time using it</li>
            <li> I love having smaller containers of things</li>
            <li> But I really enjoyed this product and definitely noticed some results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wake up with fairy princess eyelashes or anything, but I definitely noticed some more length and fullness.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand the first question.</li>
            <li> VERY COMPARABLE!</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> and I promise I think this stuff is a comic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable!</li>
            <li> I can only hope this stuff was never texted on innocent animals.</li>
            <li> Do not apply more than once daily.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it about six weeks so hoping for even more results.  </li>
            <li> I wish I took a before picture just to show how much fuller they look!</li>
            <li> but I can definitely see more</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you only apply it once a day.</li>
            <li> I used Latisse a few years ago and LOVED it</li>
            <li> The bottle you get is very small and if you don&#x27;t put it some place safe would get lost very easy.</li>
            <li> The ingredients, particularly Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 &amp; Swiss Apple Stem Cells are very powerful and used in high end products selling for over $80</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and so far am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I cannot really say my lashes have grown a lot, but I can definitely say they look more luscious and volumized.</li>
            <li> I have been using Majestic Pure&#x27;s Eyelash Growth Serum for exactly two weeks, every day.</li>
            <li> There was a very noticeable difference in my eyelashes within the first week.</li>
            <li> ..pretty much forget its on there in the first place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a dramatic growth but it works and it keeps my eyelashes looking long and healthy.</li>
            <li> It is super, super tiny</li>
            <li> Pointed brush is easy to use and apply (similar to eyeliner).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My son bought this Majestic Pure Eyelash Growth Serum as a gift for my birthday</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure&#x27;s Wonderlash serum isn&#x27;t a miracle eyelash growth serum but it DOES enhance what you have.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Eyelash Growth Serum -</li>
            <li> This is really easy to apply to your eye lashes and it is a fast simple application.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to see if they will be long because they are still in the growing process.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I could not be happier!!</li>
            <li> I have fine lashes and have notices they are starting to thicken.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is tiny but all you really need is a little bit lol</li>
            <li> because I didn&#x27;t really know what my eyelashes looked like before.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t clump as much.</li>
            <li> i been using this for about 4 days straight and already see results eyelashes look fuller and a inch longer hoping by the end of the month</li>
            <li> didnt really notice a difference..</li>
            <li> so you dont need to apply so much product.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t-I look really washed out.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My lashes have thicken and lengthen, but I really like the size of container.</li>
            <li> This one, Wonderlash, filled  in my lashes and made them grow again especially in the outer corners.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I would say it adds more lashes, adds some length, not much in terms of thickness.  </li>
            <li> Tremendously I am very please with this product</li>
            <li> I swear by this serum now and rightfully so, they have done clinical trials that prove this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like wearing makeup</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely ZERO difference in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying I would absolutely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> In order to use it up, I&#x27;ve been using the Wonderlash on my eyebrows, but haven&#x27;t noticed it making much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much growth.</li>
            <li> I really think you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to take much to get results.</li>
            <li> but I guess you don&#x27;t have much product for each use.</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 stars cause it really dose work</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it&#x27;s not irritating like some of the others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and am looking forward to the results in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> SO much cheaper than eye lash extensions</li>
            <li> It dries fast though.</li>
            <li> Burns my eyes soooo much.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m noticing how much fuller they really look when I comb them in the morning</li>
            <li> I honestly can say that my eyelashes look longer and fully just after a few days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the high positive reviews on this product?  </li>
            <li> I have seen better results from other products.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first thinking that it was to little of a product to do me any good!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to see if this product works similarly.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of doing something about making my lashes longer and this product makes it super simple to do that.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a month now and to be honest not sure if I am getting any results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my reviews short sweet and helpful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue on for 30 full days to see further results.</li>
            <li> far Ive been using the product for three weeks, and I doubt I&#x27;ll make it to the fourth, running out of it pretty quickly, but then like I said, I overuse a bit.  </li>
            <li> Good amount for the price - lasts because you only use a little.</li>
            <li> In just under a week of using this serum, my eyebrows have new growth!</li>
            <li> The bottle is super tiny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> My skimpy blonde eyelashes can only get better.  </li>
            <li> Applying it once daily is simple (make sure you&#x27;ve removed all make up), and my eyes and skin have not had any problems adjusting to it.</li>
            <li> , my eyelashes are longer and don&#x27;t fall out as much, my sparse brow areas are filling in nicely, but slowly.</li>
            <li> So far, I do like the results that are appearing for my eyelashes because as you can see, I really don&#x27;t have much length to them.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> So I am getting a major bargain purchasing from Majestic Pure!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but it may just need a little more time.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot wait to see the results in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Can any wait to see what they look like in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After it dries I can add my normal makeup</li>
            <li> and it it will, in fact, enhance my normal lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like I said, you can&#x27;t expect miracles, but if we see this product as an enhancer you will definitely see a difference in time, which in my opinion makes it worth</li>
            <li> I plan to update this review in a few weeks from now when I have had more time with this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear makeup except when I&#x27;m going somewhere, so I tried to stay home for the past 2 weeks to truly make sure of the results.</li>
            <li> You will be able to do both eyes with one application and use less product!</li>
            <li> WonderLash is supplied in a standard eyeliner style applicator that is simple to use and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Other top companies that use these ingredients in their eyelash/brow enhancers charge an absolute arm and leg for their products, even for smaller sizes!</li>
            <li> I have absolutely fallen in love with Majestic Pure&#x27;s Wonderlash Serum for several reasons, First off it is made with very high end ingredients, including MYRISTOYL PENTAPEPTIDE-17, SWISS APPLE STEM CELL EXTRACT and BOTANICAL COMPLEX TRICHOLASTYL!</li>
            <li> My brows have also started looking more filled in, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because they are darker or actually filling in a bit, but they look so much nicer after a very short amount of time!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product until I run out, in hopes that even a very slight improvement is better than nothing, but I do not plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> It has been making new growth come out on the outer part of my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Pure magic in a small bottle!</li>
            <li> Super teeny, tiny bottle but only using it once a day you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> the brush included makes it a little difficult to apply to eyelashes but to fix that I use an eyelash/eyebrow brush after applying to make sure it gets a good coat.</li>
            <li> Forget the struggle of applying your fake eyelashes and grow out your own!</li>
            <li> I got to try Wonderlash on a promotional price but would recommend so far!</li>
            <li> While I do not see any &#x27;growth&#x27; as of yet, I can tell that my lashes are definitely conditioned and softer.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is exactly like a liquid eyeliner;</li>
            <li> Overall it seems like a decent product that I haven&#x27;t had any real issues with.</li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to full dark lashes again!</li>
            <li> I am only giving this four stars now because I havent been able to see the full effects just yet, but I have noticed a small change (it&#x27;s only been a week).</li>
            <li> For those of you who have tried it for only a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, keep in mind that even products such as Latisse do not show results until about 4 weeks, and up to 16 weeks for the full effect.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by a friend and appears to be giving the same positive results RE longer and fuller lashes...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a different, but I do notice that it is easier to put my mascara on over top of it</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- generous amount in each bottle - certainly will last longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have several products from MAJESTIC  PURE.</li>
            <li> I was cursed with VERY light eyebrows and have had to use an eyebrow pencil in the past for them to even be visible!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and eyelids, but this product has not caused any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lashes have been very short my whole life</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive to a lot of products-not this serum.  </li>
            <li> and they are soft and lushes</li>
            <li> I noticed fuller thicker lashes, but not too much longer than my regular lashes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes so far though on my eye brows but we will see if that changes in the weeks to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me tell you that she absolutely loves this product, she is definitely seeing growth and noticing her lashes thicken.</li>
            <li> Plus I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far I can say it did not hurt my eyes</li>
            <li> At the end of two weeks of using it daily, I took another photo, much lighter with a needed eyebrow taming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is not for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Do not apply Eyelash Grower to the lower eyelashes nor directly to the eye surface.</li>
            <li> No irritation so far.</li>
            <li> They are longer,  darker not so much fuller but definitely healthier.</li>
            <li> So far no change in lashes.  </li>
            <li> The only difference is it really burns my eyes.</li>
            <li> But I really think this product is more so for thin lashes and not just making your lashes longer.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t have a problem if your doing it right and far enough above the lashes.</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply and looks like a small mascara type bottle.</li>
            <li> DAY 6: my lashes are already noticeably longer and my eyebrows are full in the previously sparse areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this at promotional cost and will purchase again if the result remains positive for a long run.</li>
            <li> It is a great alternative to fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 starts because it burns if you get a little in your eye.</li>
            <li> When I have purchased Revitalash in the past, I really did notice a fast and noticeable improvement so that is the product I will return</li>
            <li> By day 7 was only wearing clear mascara and coworkers noticed immediately.</li>
            <li> I began seeing results a couple of days ago, and my lashes have seen enough improvement to boost my confidence about how they naturally look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I applied the first coat above and below my lash line, be careful NOT to get any in your eyes</li>
            <li> i will be filming a full review and progression hd pics over a few weeks and you can see the results for yourself!</li>
            <li> I was so tired of spending hundreds of dollars on Latisse (A product in which I love).</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any irritation and am sure to not get too close to my eyeballs just in case, though I did poke myself in the eye once</li>
            <li> And it causes some minor itchy irritation where applied and to some extent on my eyelids, but I have generally have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They are filling in nicely at the beginning of the brow where they were very thin.</li>
            <li> I have tried this a few more times with super careful application and my left upper eyelid has developed a hard, red bump that won&#x27;t go away even though I have stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> And once again, the overall look isn&#x27;t much different than the natural lash.  </li>
            <li> I felt a little stingy at first</li>
            <li> A little hesitant at first when i didn&#x27;t see immediate results.</li>
            <li> This little product really packs a punch!</li>
            <li> The brush applicator is very thin and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I apply it nightly to my eyebrows and eyelashes, and I noticed how thick and full they have gotten in a short period of time!</li>
            <li> Most products like this, you have to apply like mascara which is hard with such a small applicator.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone looking for thicker fuller lashes or a little help with eyelash regrowth.</li>
            <li> Of course because it is early, this difference is very minimal.</li>
            <li> Little advice, even though you may notice a change within a week( like I did), give it at least 4 weeks to see the true results!</li>
            <li> For the size of the product, it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it really works, really fast!</li>
            <li> and I still have a lot left so this serum will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The syrum runs down into your lashes but by putting far enough up it won&#x27;t get into your eye.</li>
            <li> You can buy a thin eyeliner brush that will use less product by gently dipping the tip (just the very tip) in the bottle slightly to grab some product and gently rub against the hairline of your eyelid.</li>
            <li> I noticed some eyelash growth after using it for a few weeks, although I look at myself everyday it is harder for me to tell, other people were able to notice it.</li>
            <li> The product content looks like it may last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a serum and highly concentrated you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Already a few new lashes are coming in, adding to thickness.</li>
            <li> I repeated this same process after work, before bed, letting it dry and absorb before putting my head on my pillow.</li>
            <li> It is therefore impossible to tell if it is effective.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days so far</li>
            <li> I typically have to rely on false eyelashes because my real lashes are very short and straight.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t you might get the serum in your eye and that will make your eye a little irritated and really that is with about anything foreign that might go in your eye.</li>
            <li> You simply brush the serum along your upper lash line as you would your eyeliner and let dry (30 sec).</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised to receive such a small bottle in the mail.</li>
            <li> Some of my lashes will fall out if I go too long with out using this.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time</li>
            <li> My lashes are not soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen how long her eyelashes are</li>
            <li> I hope they will get long as well</li>
            <li> I have already seen some minor changes and it&#x27;s just day 4</li>
            <li> After applying my eyes tear for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have noticed progress after only a few days, with signs of apparent thickness as well.</li>
            <li> (although I used other products similar and haven&#x27;t had any problems).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other similar products and they haven&#x27;t caused any stinging.</li>
            <li> cant wait to have long eyelashes!</li>
            <li> It does burn a little if you get it into your eye, but only briefly.</li>
            <li> It is in a very small bottle, much like that of a liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Only a little bit is needed and it&#x27;s only applied once a day.</li>
            <li> I naturally have long thick lashes but decided to give this a try to give them an extra boost.</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia and when I get stressed, my upper eyelashes fall out in the very center.</li>
            <li> The product itself is runny like water, after application, let it dry before blinking as it may run through and burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dutifully applied it missing only an occasional day or two.  </li>
            <li> inevitably pulls a few out, I had them back in two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had a chunk in the middle of my eyelashes missing and it has grown back.</li>
            <li> Although I did expect the bottle to be a little larger, it will probably last a long while since you only have to use a little on your eye lashes for the process to work.</li>
            <li> After having chemo for the second time and losing all my eyelashes again, your self esteem goes down the drain.</li>
            <li> My only advice is to order the larger size since this size is an extremely small bottle.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but then noticed a difference a week later.</li>
            <li> This product does not have a weird scent, quickly dries, and has not caused uneasy irritations.</li>
            <li> The vial is small, be careful not to shake it too much, I wasn&#x27;t too carefull and some of it got forced out of the bottle when I screwed the lid back on</li>
            <li> Her lashes are starting to get just a little bit longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> The oil in this little bottle made my eyes all irritated and red.</li>
            <li> The bottle was a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it is going to last.</li>
            <li> I got this because for some unknown reason my eyelashes just started falling out a lot.</li>
            <li> I am really careful when I apply this product because I don&#x27;t want to get it in my eyes</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few days</li>
            <li> and they do seem a bit longer not much tho.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get watery eyes until it dries as it does sting if you get it into the eye.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- worked quicker than expected</li>
            <li> I used this on one eye to see if I could tell a difference and within a few days I could tell a definite difference.</li>
            <li> However, I can already say that the serum was well-packaged in a bubble-wrapped package and delivered in the expected timeframe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> It seemed empty from the start.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the size of this bottle, I almost thought the box was empty.</li>
            <li> It takes very little and this bottle will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> Very small bottle, but I think it will last several months.</li>
            <li> This eyelash growth serum is clear and comes in a very small bottle</li>
            <li> Usually it takes MUCH longer to grow my eyelashes back after removing a false set</li>
            <li> Tiny little bottle made for elves that arrived half empty and sticky and proceeded to leak the rest of the product out when laid on its side.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, that&#x27;s why I gave it a five-star review.</li>
            <li> The application brush is thin and very soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half gone at only a few weeks with very minimal results.</li>
            <li> I have bought some other products from this company and they are company that I fully trust.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical but wait 2 weeks</li>
            <li> If you have tried all the other eyelash growth serums and nothing still works for you, try Careprost or Royal Lashes ...</li>
            <li> Did not work for me like other serums.</li>
            <li> If you buy it with that expectation, you are on the wrong isle, but if you buy it thinking you&#x27;ll be consistent about it and patient, you will definetely see results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about wasting or spilling product due to it&#x27;s design.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have a smell and doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply it, like other eyelash growth serums.</li>
            <li> Purchased in July due to eyelashes falling out.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time (sooner than I expected!)</li>
            <li> I have been extremely deligent in using this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but it stings like CRAZY!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> half empty cause</li>
            <li> However, I would caution anybody applying it to be extremely careful about not getting it into your eyes because it stings a little bit, almost like if you got soap in your eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to last for at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 10 eyelash growth products over the last two years</li>
            <li> I wore fake lashes and my real ones came off</li>
            <li> I had a space where my son had knocked a few lashes out on accident and it looked pretty weird</li>
            <li> but when applying a small drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Kinda creepy how fast it makes your lashes grow</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it really works.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s making my eyelids dark and the bottle is about 1/4 the size of a mascara tube</li>
            <li> I have natural long but very thin lashes myself, so I&#x27;ve always been about growth serums and enhancers.</li>
            <li> Only con is:  a very very small bottle.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re putting something at the base of your lashes, it&#x27;s kind of hard to keep it out of your eyes - so just a word of caution.</li>
            <li> Don&#x60;t be put off by the size, because this product is going alot futher than my previous purchase.</li>
            <li> I have almost used half of the bottle..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed significanat growth, I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle, and use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the hair is slightly darker and my lashes are a tad bit longer</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m trying to convince myself if there has been a slight improvement in the length and fullness of my lashes, or if it hasn&#x27;t done anything</li>
            <li> The instruction to use this product is:  Starting from the inner corner of your lash-line and working outward, draw the applicator tip carefully along the skin at the base of the upper eyelashes in one continuous stroke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse previously, but I had stopped due to the excessive cost.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not surprised, I&#x27;m having a difficult time applying this stuff without a tiny little bit getting into my eyes every time.</li>
            <li> My lashes are a little longer and even somewhat fuller.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference my eyelashes seem a little bit longer and thicker and it has strengthen them as well</li>
            <li> the serum will sting a little but it won&#x27;t irritate your eye.</li>
            <li> I wear eyeliner &amp; a little mascara.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using it for a little while now, but probably not every day like she&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> Feeling a little duped after buying this.</li>
            <li> My eyelash started growing back again, and they are so thick!</li>
            <li> So next is my brows which are also tough.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that my lashes seemed thicker after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money this was.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in my lashes in just the few days I have used this serum.</li>
            <li> it looks like I&#x27;m wearing a thin layer of mascara, but I&#x27;m only wearing this serum on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks now and the product works for me - to some extent.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing the change over a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I had one fall out because they are so short and thin as it is.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t uneven at all.</li>
            <li> After using it just for a few days I have noticed my eyelashes look thicker darker and fuller.</li>
            <li> Waste money and time.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I should see something but just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes a few weeks to take effect?&lt;br</li>
            <li> In two weeks, it has lengthened my lashes enough to the point that I can go out without having to put on false lashes.</li>
            <li> I did notice my eyelashes seem fuller and a little bit longer!</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works, but it does.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my eyelashes are fuller than they usually are.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small bottle that I apply once a day.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I came across this eyelash growth serum when it was offered to me for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing, and have been trying it out for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> Small bottle, so although this eyelash growth serum works, you might not see maximum results by the time your bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it has helped my eyebrows</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> but when I got it, i was so dissappointed to see how small it is.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I did notice longer, thicker lashes!</li>
            <li> No change after 2 months :/</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite gotten the hang of applying every night, but I&#x27;ve used it 4x in the past 7 days.  </li>
            <li> and this is what I have used in past.  </li>
            <li> I have had small eyelashes all my life</li>
            <li> This is a really small container.</li>
            <li> The bottle is so small, about 1 and 3/4 inch in height.</li>
            <li> There is actually a spot on the box where the word eyelash is spelled wrong.</li>
            <li> I have tired other eye lash grow and enhancement products</li>
            <li> While the bottle appears small, after one application, you&#x27;ll realize you use a very small amount with each application.</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever do it,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Results will take at least 1 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I think the negative reviews came from people not reading directions and not using the way the product specifies.</li>
            <li> What I can tell you is that I have not noticed any issues or negative side effects.</li>
            <li> I wish that I could give this product a favorable review because that would mean that my eyelashes and brows were showing some improvement.  </li>
            <li> When the opportunity was given to me to try this product out, I was very curious and a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> It is a very small bottle</li>
            <li> It is a very very small bottle</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 3 maybe 4 weeks now, I am disappointed because so far it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my eyelashes or eyebrows.</li>
            <li> , I felt tingling on my eyelids, a little uncomfortable at first.&lt;br /&gt;Day 5:</li>
            <li> This product stings and after two applications my eyelids had several painful bumps that lasted a couple of days.</li>
            <li> A woman with incredibly thick eyelashes that look like I have false eyelashes on.</li>
            <li> Been using it regularly for almost 3 months but don&#x27;t see any noticeable result :(</li>
            <li> I have small and very thin eye lashes, I have been using this product for 5 days now  </li>
            <li> The bottle size is a little disappointing</li>
            <li> But alas, they are not.  </li>
            <li> I have thin eyelashes and eyebrows that are falling out as</li>
            <li> This company stands behind their products and creates products for the skin that do not irritate.</li>
            <li> , I thought it was just not helping if not making my brows/lashes worse.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for something to give me that false lash look.</li>
            <li> I have grey in my brows &amp; hate it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell because my eyes are going bad but all in all this did not irritate my eyes are skin.</li>
            <li> Expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did nothing for my lashes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work like another brand I had been using for over a year.  </li>
            <li> I took photos on day one, (unfortunately the lighting was terrible) and tried to show how sparse my Asian eyelashes are.</li>
            <li> I am a latisse user, so I was a bit skeptical when I started using this.</li>
            <li> Sadly this did nothing to grow out my lashes or even thicken them.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I have already suggested it to my mom who has very thin lashes.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m going on month 3 of using this product and now my lashes are falling out and have become very thin, sparse, and wispy...</li>
            <li> : I cleaned my eyes throughly with cold water upon waking up</li>
            <li> Also, the serum stings like crazy if you get any in your eyes.</li>
            <li> a thin brush that applies serum to the base of your lashes.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this one didn&#x27;t work, but very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Boy was I WRONG!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Its not for me :(</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This stuff irritated my eyes so bad</li>
            <li> is gone nothing to bad.</li>
            <li> Ineffective and painful</li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because this brand did nothing to make my eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so dissapointed that this is happening :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 10 days and am beginning to notice that the base of my lashes is beginning to get thicker.</li>
            <li> Every time I try to use this product on the base of my eyelashes, it runs into my eyes, causing them to water and wash away the product.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate them.</li>
            <li> I am returning, as this product makes my eyes sting bad!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!!!  </li>
            <li> It burns your eyes terribly.  </li>
            <li> Got horrible allergy reaction</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is easy to use it doesn&#x27;t burn the eye. I apply right about my lashes actually touching the lashes to get the product on the lashes and apply directly to eyebrows. Doesn&#x27;t cause skin lighting.  I only used this for about 2 weeks. I haven&#x27;t seen any results but maybe it because I didn&#x27;t really know what my eyelashes looked like before. But I really think this product is more so for thin lashes and not just making your lashes longer. I&#x27;ve been using on my eyebrow because I have the most thiniest eyebrows no results there either. I apply after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Expensive.  I have received samples  that were far more generous than this and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it. It burns my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I noticed some eyelash growth after using it for a few weeks, although I look at myself everyday it is harder for me to tell, other people were able to notice it. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a way to grow their eyelashes longer.</li>
            <li> The shipping of the product was great but everytime I&#x27;ve used the product it burns my eyelids. It&#x27;s probably just me having an allergic reaction to whatever is inside (although I used other products similar and haven&#x27;t had any problems).</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now, my eyelashes are fuller and longer</li>
            <li> There is no irritation and I only apply it once a day. My eyelashes have become thicker and longer! My only advice is to order the larger size since this size is an extremely small bottle.</li>
            <li> great product! I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a different, but I do notice that it is easier to put my mascara on over top of it, it doesn&#x27;t clump as much. I really like the idea of doing something about making my lashes longer and this product makes it super simple to do that. I like easy things.</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia and when I get stressed, my upper eyelashes fall out in the very center. I am always looking for products to quickly regrow and thicken these eyelashes. This product is a godsend to me! Application is extremely easy (just brush the product on) and the results are amazing. Highly recommend to anyone looking for thicker fuller lashes or a little help with eyelash regrowth. I received a great deal to try this product to share my honest and unbiased opinion. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> For someone with  short eyelash, this is simply a great product. I apply every night before going to sleep. Some of my lashes will fall out if I go too long with out using this.</li>
            <li> i received this order to test the product and write a review on it...  I have tried this for 2 days now. I cant see any results just yet but who can after just two days. the application process is easy and you only have to apply it once a day which is nice! I cant wait to see my results then I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but then noticed a difference a week later. My lashes are a little longer and even somewhat fuller. Not sure how it works, but it does. You must use it every night in the beginning to see the best results. It takes only seconds to do. The results are far more noticeable if you do what I did, and that’s use mascara. This product is supposed to last for at least 3 months. Therefore, I plan to continue to use it until it’s all gone and hope that the results turn out to be even better. Little advice, even though you may notice a change within a week( like I did), give it at least 4 weeks to see the true results! I believe you will truly be amazed if you be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> I am returning, as this product makes my eyes sting bad!  I&#x27;ve used other similar products and they haven&#x27;t caused any stinging.</li>
            <li> This is great for eyelashes! I have noticed my eyelashes are fuller than they usually are. It comes in a small bottle that I apply once a day. Sometimes I get products and they irritate my eyes but this one has not. I just brush it on my top lid along my lash line so it is very easy to apply. I really have liked it so far and I cannot wait to see the results in a few more weeks. I have already suggested it to my mom who has very thin lashes. It really is a good product. I have bought some other products from this company and they are company that I fully trust.</li>
            <li> This product is not a lash lengthener. I did notice that my lashes seemed thicker after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> i been using this for about 4 days straight and already see results eyelashes look fuller and a inch longer hoping by the end of the month i have them celebrity eyes</li>
            <li> I typically have to rely on false eyelashes because my real lashes are very short and straight. Thankfully, I came across this eyelash growth serum when it was offered to me for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing, and have been trying it out for the past two weeks. I began seeing results a couple of days ago, and my lashes have seen enough improvement to boost my confidence about how they naturally look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- In two weeks, it has lengthened my lashes enough to the point that I can go out without having to put on false lashes. It allows me to have a more natural appearance and makes my lashes look great with mascara only.&lt;br /&gt;- Much more affordable than Latisse and extensions.&lt;br /&gt;- Pointed brush is easy to use and apply (similar to eyeliner).&lt;br /&gt;- I have sensitive skin and eyelids, but this product has not caused any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Results will take at least 1 1/2 weeks. I only began noticing results two days ago.&lt;br /&gt;- Small bottle, so although this eyelash growth serum works, you might not see maximum results by the time your bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I like the product helps my eyelash grow longer</li>
            <li> I wish that I could give this product a favorable review because that would mean that my eyelashes and brows were showing some improvement.  But alas, they are not.  I wanted to give it a fair chance so for two months...TWO....I have dutifully applied it missing only an occasional day or two.  There is no change in my eyelashes whatsoever.  They haven&#x27;t changed a bit.  When I have purchased Revitalash in the past, I really did notice a fast and noticeable improvement so that is the product I will return to.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply. Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyelid.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes appear to have grown a bit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did nothing for my lashes</li>
            <li> Amazing product but I needed something stronger so I decided to try Royal Lashes. It worked great for me, I got mine from RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
            <li> didnt really notice a difference..</li>
            <li> I saw results just after a week on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I got this because for some unknown reason my eyelashes just started falling out a lot. This eyelash growth serum is clear and comes in a very small bottle but I been using this product for a couple a weeks and I still have a lot left so this serum will last a long time. I apply it every night before I go to bed I have noticed a difference my eyelashes seem a little bit longer and thicker and it has strengthen them as well they don&#x27;t fall a lot like they use to. I am really careful when I apply this product because I don&#x27;t want to get it in my eyes but If you do it&#x27;s okay the serum will sting a little but it won&#x27;t irritate your eye.</li>
            <li> This works.My eyelashes grew after using this product. It&#x27;s not a dramatic growth but it works and it keeps my eyelashes looking long and healthy. The bottle is super tiny but I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time so you dont need to apply so much product. It will last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week but it really has no scent (which is great!), it&#x27;s easy to apply.  I use it after cleaning my face but before putting on my makeup in the morning.  My lashes have been very short my whole life and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 3 months.  Will follow up when I have more results from it.</li>
            <li> Noticed difference in 2 weeks. I would recommend this but not quite as effective as Latisse</li>
            <li> My lashes look fuller and thicker. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I just received this and I&#x27;m looking forward to the results. I liked how easy the application was. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. There is no stinging or adverse reactions which is great with any product applied so close to the eye. The only reasons I have it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I would like to see what results this produces as well as I would like to see a larger application wand.</li>
            <li> work better than the $125 version (Latisse).</li>
            <li> I was lucky to get this wonderlash serum free to try! It truly is non-irritant and easy to apply to my eyelashes. It is a great alternative to fake eyelashes! Forget the struggle of applying your fake eyelashes and grow out your own! Great for your short, brittle lashes!</li>
            <li> I have never used growth serum for my eyelashes.  I thought I didn&#x27;t want something like that close to my eyes.  Then I thought&amp;#34;I&#x27;m using all kinds of product on &amp; close to my eyes.  Mascara, eyeliner,shadows,creams &amp; not worrying!&amp;#34;.  Funny-how we think!  I&#x27;m 65 &amp; have regular eyelashes. I wear eyeliner &amp; a little mascara. If I don&#x27;t-I look really washed out.  My lashes are not soft.  I have only used this a few days but my lashes are softer &amp; look a teeny bit fuller.  Maybe because they are not sticking straight out!  I have grey in my brows &amp; hate it.  So next is my brows which are also tough.  This does not make my eyes sting or water. My eyes are sensitive to a lot of products-not this serum.  I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  I am so glad! Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have used careprost for 2 years and decided to change... big mistake! This stuff irritated my eyes so bad and it worked some I could see a fullness difference but not enough to write good ratings about.</li>
            <li> My son bought this Majestic Pure Eyelash Growth Serum as a gift for my birthday so I am not the purchaser but the user.  I wanted to save him money so I told him to buy me this brand because it was cheaper than Latisse and the reviews were good.  I am disappointed because this brand did nothing to make my eyelashes grow. What a waste of time and money.  I used this product for a month and my lashes did not grow not even a centimeter.  I don&#x27;t understand all the high positive reviews on this product?  Or, did I just get a bottle of water?  My niece used Latisse eyelash growth treatment the same time I used this brand and her eyelashes are absolutely longer and gorgeous.  What a waste of money this was.  I&#x27;ve seen how long her eyelashes are and I am convinced.  I will spend the extra myself and treat myself to something that does work.  Latisse is a prescription and needs to be obtained from a Specialist.</li>
            <li> I have small and very thin eye lashes, I have been using this product for 5 days now  and I can see the difference already. I have tired other eye lash grow and enhancement products and I have experienced eye irritation and discomfort. However, with Eyelash Growth Serum by WonderLash I have had no irritation and am amazed at how easy this product is to apply! The application brush is thin and very soft! I have also already began to see some results in the growth and fullness of my lashes. I have very sensitive eyes and this serum is great, from it&#x27;s application brush to the quality of the product. I would definitely recommend this product if you are searching for an eyelash growth and enhancement product with no discomfort! I purchased this product during a one time promotional period. This review is written in my own words.</li>
            <li> Great product  after only one application my lashes grew longer</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Got refund.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 10 eyelash growth products over the last two years and I really feel to date that this is the best one.  I follow the instructions and apply one coat daily to my eyelashes and eyebrows.  There was a very noticeable difference in my eyelashes within the first week. There has been no skin or eye irritation.  I am not sure if it has helped my eyebrows but it may just need a little more time.  I would recommend this product to anyone trying to grow their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this serum a try since I&#x27;ve undergone treatments for a health condition and lost significantly from my lashes and brows.DAY 1: I cleaned my eyes throughly with cold water upon waking up and I applied the first coat above and below my lash line, be careful NOT to get any in your eyes, it&#x27;s very uncomfortable. I repeated this same process after work, before bed, letting it dry and absorb before putting my head on my pillow. DAY 2: I noticed growth in sparse areas! DAY 6: my lashes are already noticeably longer and my eyebrows are full in the previously sparse areas. By day 7 was only wearing clear mascara and coworkers noticed immediately. I haven&#x27;t even made a dent in the tube so I&#x27;m sure I have enough for a 30 day review. For the size of the product, it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it really works, really fast!</li>
            <li> Great product my lashes look wonderful and they are soft and lushes :) thank you for such a great product. I was offered a lower price to review this item</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother because she has shirt, stubby, blonde eyelashes. She&#x27;s been using it for a little while now, but probably not every day like she&#x27;s supposed to. Even so, she&#x27;s already seeing result. Her lashes are starting to get just a little bit longer and thicker. Hopefully she will start using even more regularly so she can get the amazing results this product offers! The great part about this stuff is that it does not irritate the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I do feel like using this made my eye lashes darker. I can wait to have used the product for over a month to see the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 10 days and am beginning to notice that the base of my lashes is beginning to get thicker. Can any wait to see what they look like in a few more weeks. Easy to apply, just make sure you use it sparingly because it stings a bit if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> This works very fast! Easy to apply.  Very small bottle, but I think it will last several months.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works great! A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Have used it for a month now and to be honest not sure if I am getting any results. The bottle you get is very small and if you don&#x27;t put it some place safe would get lost very easy. Upon applying I get a mild burning that lasts for about 2 to 3 min then is gone nothing to bad.</li>
            <li> I felt a little stingy at first but now it is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and they do seem a bit longer not much tho. I thought they would be more fuller. I wore fake lashes and my real ones came off so I ordered wonderlash and it did help them grow faster. It&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> The application process is easy and convenient, you put it on and go..pretty much forget its on there in the first place. Although I did expect the bottle to be a little larger, it will probably last a long while since you only have to use a little on your eye lashes for the process to work. This product does not have a weird scent, quickly dries, and has not caused uneasy irritations. I have noticed progress after only a few days, with signs of apparent thickness as well. Cannot wait to see the end results!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 days now.  I apply it at night before I go to bed. It is easy to use it&#x27;s like an eyeliner brush. I have fine lashes and have notices they are starting to thicken.  So far I&#x27;m happy with my results and the product</li>
            <li> After having chemo for the second time and losing all my eyelashes again, your self esteem goes down the drain. I started using this product after my chemo had ended which meant that my hair would start growing back as well. Oh...my...gosh!!! I have used serums of this sort in the past, but this caught my eye because of the great reviews. My eyelash started growing back again, and they are so thick! I have not been able to see if they will be long because they are still in the growing process.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I could not be happier!! I feel like a woman again! A woman with incredibly thick eyelashes that look like I have false eyelashes on. I hope they will get long as well - I will check back in in a month and give a report on that. Super happy customer here!!</li>
            <li> great product. first time using it and i am excited to see the difference it makes. goes on smooth and has no smell. doesnt leave residue on eyes and doesn&#x27;t burn at all!</li>
            <li> Havent used it enough to see drastic change, but so far it is amazing :) cant wait to have long eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Awesome as I have a very short lashes. I&#x27;m very positive I will see more progress as I continue to use it. I applied it before going to bed, I think the product works best at night. :)</li>
            <li> Spilled everywhere in the box</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with my eye lashes</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I have seen very good results especially with eyebrows. They are filling in nicely at the beginning of the brow where they were very thin. My lashes have thicken and lengthen, but I really like the size of container. Don&#x60;t be put off by the size, because this product is going alot futher than my previous purchase. It does burn a little if you get it into your eye, but only briefly. I would highly recommend this product because of price, usuage and most of all it works.</li>
            <li> On my 3rd month and still no sign of improvement.  Disappointed!!!  Will not buy again! !</li>
            <li> This works wonders. At first I was skeptical but wait 2 weeks and you&#x27;ll definitely see results.</li>
            <li> Works Great!!  I started to notice my eyelashes where getting fewer and thinner so I decided to try this product.  I used Rapid Lash before and found that it worked fine too!  This one, Wonderlash, filled  in my lashes and made them grow again especially in the outer corners.  I noticed fuller thicker lashes, but not too much longer than my regular lashes. Definitely noticed a difference though!  Really works!!</li>
            <li> This serum is seriously worth every penny! if you havent tried any lash serums yet, then you have to try this! it&#x27;s on the more inexpensive side for the quality! i will be filming a full review and progression hd pics over a few weeks and you can see the results for yourself! follow here to catch the in depth video:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJEgjDt2WRn3_pnbqeVzAQ/videos</li>
            <li> Already noticed my eyelashes lengthening.  Just be careful not to get watery eyes until it dries as it does sting if you get it into the eye.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  It burns your eyes terribly.  Couldn&#x27;t stand to use it.</li>
            <li> Got horrible allergy reaction</li>
            <li> ive opnly used for a week and i can already see a difference. does not hurt eye, easy to apply..love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, have been looking for a great product like this for a while</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work like another brand I had been using for over a year.  I just thought I would try this because it was a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars right now because I haven&#x27;t been able to use this to it&#x27;s full potential. I will update my review with pics in a couple weeks as it does take time for this stuff to start to work and show full results. I can say I&#x27;ve been using for about 4 day&#x27;s and can see some fullness. More than before. I will post before and after photos also when I update. I think the negative reviews came from people not reading directions and not using the way the product specifies. For instance, about it getting in your eye, do as the directions say. Do not put on lower lashes and use the wand to apply above your lashes in one stroke/line. You shouldn&#x27;t have a problem if your doing it right and far enough above the lashes. The syrum runs down into your lashes but by putting far enough up it won&#x27;t get into your eye. And for people not seeing any results, like I stated before this stuff takes time and the ability to follow directions correctly. Apply once a day, not twice. I have already seen some minor changes and it&#x27;s just day 4 so I can&#x27;t wait to see what will happen in a couple weeks! Shipping was fast. Now this is a trial size version I believe. I&#x27;m not 100% sure on that though because this is the first eye lash growing syrum I have used so maybe it just doesn&#x27;t require a lot of formula to get the results you want, that or it is a trial size. Still it&#x27;s a good deal and worth a try. I haven&#x27;t seen any changes so far though on my eye brows but we will see if that changes in the weeks to come.&lt;br /&gt;Did receive discount for review.</li>
            <li> i wanted to write a review of this product right away because I absolutely love the size of the container. Im a big traveler and Im always trying to find storage solutions for my things. I love having smaller containers of things so it makes it easy to carry. I am only giving this four stars now because I havent been able to see the full effects just yet, but I have noticed a small change (it&#x27;s only been a week). I love that they dont test on animals and its made here in the USA. Ill come back and post more results after a couple of weeks. I got to try Wonderlash on a promotional price but would recommend so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small I will never see the results. It&#x27;s like a sample size. It will probably only last 2 weeks. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a product that could grow and enhance her eye lashes, and since I trust the Majestic Pure product line as I have bought other products of this brand and loved them all I decided to get this for my wife to try. Let me tell you that she absolutely loves this product, she is definitely seeing growth and noticing her lashes thicken. She says that it is the best primer before she puts on the Mascara and it enhances the look of her eyes.</li>
            <li> still waiting for results. it&#x27;s been a month.</li>
            <li> This serum has helped my eyelashes noticeably - but not dramatically.  I would say it adds more lashes, adds some length, not much in terms of thickness.  It does not darken them, but does not claim to.  The change is only noticeable when I apply mascara.  I did recommend it to 2 of my friends who are using it.  When I find out if they have good luck with it, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> For a while I was having eyelash extensions as you know it makes your eyelashes fall out also and removing these eyelashes you lose your own lashes so I had lost almost majority of my eyelashes I purchased this product within weeks I saw improvement  Tremendously I am very please with this product and I will be purchasing this product and future for myself and as gifts for loved ones</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I was selected to receive this eyelash growth serum during a promotion at a slight discount and let you know what I thought of it. Well, I have been using it for about a week faithfully and I must admit, my eyelashes seem fuller. I wasn&#x27;t sure how if this serum would work on me since I have fine hair but it works great! Did you know that my neighbor complemented me on what beautiful eyelashes I had. And I wasn&#x27;t even wearing make up! That was just the confidence boost I needed. This serum is so easy to use. I put it on every night after I wash my face. It comes with a very fine brush so you just apply the same as you would eyeliner. Since it&#x27;s a serum and highly concentrated you only need a small amount. I just brush on my upper lids as if I were applying eyeliner and that&#x27;s it!  What could be easier than that. Then while I&#x27;m asleep at night, the serum goes to work helping to strengthen my lashes and make them look like they did 20 years ago! I swear by this serum now and rightfully so, they have done clinical trials that prove this stuff really works. Plus I have sensitive skin and I have been using this serum without any adverse affects whatsoever. This works so well that I am thinking of getting some for a friend of mine who just finished chemo and is on her way to recovery. I&#x27;m hoping this will help her get her eyelashes back stronger than ever!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works but it does! I have noticed an improvement in my lashes in just the few days I have used this serum. They are already longer and fuller! I can&#x27;t wait to see more results!&lt;br /&gt;This serum is very easy to use. It is in a very small bottle, much like that of a liquid eyeliner. (You can see through the bottle to the serum and brush applicator.) You simply brush the serum along your upper lash line as you would your eyeliner and let dry (30 sec). Then go about your daily routine. Including wearing your eyeliner! Simple enough. I am happy to recieve this item to review. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I would like to clarify what I said about the product causing irritation. The product does not irritate your skin whatsoever. However, I would caution anybody applying it to be extremely careful about not getting it into your eyes because it stings a little bit, almost like if you got soap in your eyes. If you&#x27;re putting something at the base of your lashes, it&#x27;s kind of hard to keep it out of your eyes - so just a word of caution. But I really enjoyed this product and definitely noticed some results. I didn&#x27;t think to take a before picture, but I am loving how my eyelashes look. I didn&#x27;t wake up with fairy princess eyelashes or anything, but I definitely noticed some more length and fullness. I don&#x27;t really like wearing makeup and I hardly ever do it, so I&#x27;m really happy to find a product that gives me good results and makes my eyelashes look fuller and longer without mascara! Another home run from Majestic Pure - I have been thrilled with all of their products!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend the money on this product and only did after reading a ton of reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and so far am happy with the results. I feel like my lashes are growing in a bit thicker as it says will happen. I plan to continue using it and feel pretty confident that it will continue to make my lashes grow in fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> Tiny little bottle made for elves that arrived half empty and sticky and proceeded to leak the rest of the product out when laid on its side.</li>
            <li> Almost all of my lashes were ripped out when I had eyelash extensions. I looked like I had alopecia. This has started to grow them back. I am very happy with it and it has only been about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> It works so well it looks like I&#x27;m wearing a thin layer of mascara, but I&#x27;m only wearing this serum on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks now and the product works for me - to some extent.  I&#x27;ve used another type of enhancer/extender serum that worked better, but I stopped using it because although my lashed grew significantly longer, they fell out very frequently resulting in an overall look that wasn&#x27;t really any better than natural lashes.  This product seems to be doing the same thing.  My lashes are growing somewhat longer, but they have started falling out much more frequently.  And once again, the overall look isn&#x27;t much different than the natural lash.  Also FYI the product does sting if if gets into my eyes.  And it causes some minor itchy irritation where applied and to some extent on my eyelids, but I have generally have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by a friend and appears to be giving the same positive results RE longer and fuller lashes...no change in color....don&#x27;t understand the first question.</li>
            <li> No result after 2 month of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a month and have applied this serum to my eyelashes every evening.  There&#x27;s absolutely ZERO difference in my eyelashes.  Definitely over priced and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> A little hesitant at first when i didn&#x27;t see immediate results. After about 2 months,  I&#x27;m starting to see growth. Probably only about 0.25mm. However, if my eyelashes continue to grow at that rate,  in one year they&#x27;ll be at 1.5mm. Yessss. Can&#x27;t wait!!! I apply this daily underneath my mascara. Product does burn if it accidently gets into eyes.</li>
            <li> I use to use Latisse and this product works almost just as well for a fraction on the cost.  My eyelashes are thicker and longer after using it for a week.  I also tried it on my eyebrows and I love how I have thicker eyebrows now too.  After years of plucking my eyebrows they have thinned out.  This product makes them look thicker.</li>
            <li> Since this came with a tiny brush instead of a mascara wand, I used this on my eyebrows and really loved the results! I saw more growth in about 2 weeks! This is perfect for overplucked or overwaxed brows! It&#x27;s not sticks or gross and can be worn under makeup. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Apply it every morning before the makeup goes on. Super easy to use</li>
            <li> My skimpy blonde eyelashes can only get better.  I am looking forward to seeing the change over a few weeks of use.  So far I can say it did not hurt my eyes and I believe the benefits will show.  If you want longer, darker lashes, you should try this product.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure&#x27;s Wonderlash serum isn&#x27;t a miracle eyelash growth serum but it DOES enhance what you have. I took photos on day one, (unfortunately the lighting was terrible) and tried to show how sparse my Asian eyelashes are. At the end of two weeks of using it daily, I took another photo, much lighter with a needed eyebrow taming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually grown some back where falsies ripped them out! Usually it takes MUCH longer to grow my eyelashes back after removing a false set inevitably pulls a few out, I had them back in two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not, however, grown thicker-than-I-normally-have lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself comes in a tiny bottle. The applicator wand is incredibly easy to use and runs perfectly along the top of your lash area, like you&#x27;re pinstriping your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it dries I can add my normal makeup and it doesn&#x27;t affect it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it another two weeks and see how it does and it it will, in fact, enhance my normal lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in order to test and review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now and I am enjoying it! Maybe it&#x27;s all in my head but I swear my lashes look longer and they feel thicker. I had a space where my son had knocked a few lashes out on accident and it looked pretty weird but now it&#x27;s totally filled in! I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 starts because it burns if you get a little in your eye.</li>
            <li> i will try this product , got a product discounted. i will give you more feed backs as soon as i got the best result..</li>
            <li> love love love this product:)</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this at discounted price but when I got it, i was so dissappointed to see how small it is. I wont be able to buy it again if not at discounted price.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f64c833b557cb726a86a106b8253ec3b]] I have absolutely fallen in love with Majestic Pure&#x27;s Wonderlash Serum for several reasons, First off it is made with very high end ingredients, including MYRISTOYL PENTAPEPTIDE-17, SWISS APPLE STEM CELL EXTRACT and BOTANICAL COMPLEX TRICHOLASTYL! Other top companies that use these ingredients in their eyelash/brow enhancers charge an absolute arm and leg for their products, even for smaller sizes! So I am getting a major bargain purchasing from Majestic Pure! And that is something that I am really pretty serious about, finding a good bargain! But the best part is that this product really works! I can see results already in my eyelashes and brows! My eyelashes have lengthened, thickened and darkened! My brows have also started looking more filled in, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because they are darker or actually filling in a bit, but they look so much nicer after a very short amount of time! I was cursed with VERY light eyebrows and have had to use an eyebrow pencil in the past for them to even be visible! No longer! They have darkened up very nicely and it&#x27;s now not absolutely necessary for me to darken them before I go out! In this video I have demonstrated how I personally use the product so that I see results and keep any of the serum from getting into my eyes. I am so glad to have been given the opportunity to try out this product and share my honest thoughts and opinions. If you have any questions, please let me know!</li>
            <li> I did receive this product discounted in exchange for an honest review.  I am a latisse user, so I was a bit skeptical when I started using this. I did wait for 2 weeks to review this product to give honest feedback. Let&#x27;s start by saying I would absolutely recommend this product to a friend. I like to keep my reviews short sweet and helpful so....&lt;br /&gt;The Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- easy to put on&lt;br /&gt;- no residue left behind&lt;br /&gt;- no odor&lt;br /&gt;- worked quicker than expected&lt;br /&gt;- generous amount in each bottle - certainly will last longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;- did not color the skin around my eyes or my iris color&lt;br /&gt;- Gives Latisse a run for their money! VERY COMPARABLE! Actually better because it is natural!&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t irritate or leave any feeling that it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;No cons but I do have a tip. You can buy a thin eyeliner brush that will use less product by gently dipping the tip (just the very tip) in the bottle slightly to grab some product and gently rub against the hairline of your eyelid. Do the same for your eyebrows if you desire. You will be able to do both eyes with one application and use less product! Saving you some money!</li>
            <li> I did notice my eyelashes seem fuller and a little bit longer! I enjoyed this product! I would buy again! I also used on my eyebrows and they are growing back in nice and think! It really works!</li>
            <li> Although there was not irritation...there where no results and I have used many lash growth serums.  Lil Lash was my favorite but they no longer sell in the USA even though it&#x27;s made there.  Not sure why this one didn&#x27;t work, but very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Noticed results in w weeks! !</li>
            <li> I naturally have long thick lashes but decided to give this a try to give them an extra boost. After a few weeks, I did notice longer, thicker lashes! However, I&#x27;m going on month 3 of using this product and now my lashes are falling out and have become very thin, sparse, and wispy... I&#x27;m going to stop using this product and hope they grow back. I&#x27;m so dissapointed that this is happening :(</li>
            <li> No change after 2 months :/</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! It works wonders to make my skimpy lashes fuller and longer!  I received this as a trial and I&#x27;m very excited about the results!  It is a very small bottle but when applying a small drop goes a long way. I noticed added length and volume to my lashes. You just brush a tiny amount on your eyelid lash line and it&#x27;s as easy as that!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change if anything I have lost lashes. would not buy it again</li>
            <li> I see some results, hopefully it gets better, thanks for allowing me to review this.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good lashes to begin with so I was looking for something to give me that false lash look. I used Latisse a few years ago and LOVED it but I didn&#x27;t feel like getting the prescription again and paying the price for it so I was hoping WonderLash would be a good replacement. Well it&#x27;s not Latisse but I have noticed some extra length. Not at all like the pictures they show with the 75% increase but there was a noticeable growth. I also have missed a day here and there like on the weekends and I just forget to apply it so MAYBE that could be why I didn&#x27;t see that 75% growth but I doubt it. I slacked while using Latisse too and that didn&#x27;t effect the results. Nothing can beat Latisse in my opinion. I also bought it when it was on special; that being said after trying it I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> very good product and delivery is OK</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month and can&#x27;t tell a difference at all. I&#x27;ve been putting it on at night about 3 times a week and I promise I think this stuff is a comic. Also it comes in a tiny tiny bottle</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.  Just like eye liner.  I haven&#x27;t quite gotten the hang of applying every night, but I&#x27;ve used it 4x in the past 7 days.  I&#x27;m not seeing much of a difference, but my eyelashes are a light brown.  I am not seeing as many fall out though, which is a good thing.  I&#x27;ve always felt I wanted to cry each time I had one fall out because they are so short and thin as it is.</li>
            <li> Great product , the eyelash growth serum works. My eyelash are fuller and longer .</li>
            <li> If you have tried all the other eyelash growth serums and nothing still works for you, try Careprost or Royal Lashes ... it guarantees results! get it RoyalCosmetics.net with code amazon, they&#x27;re having a buy 1 get 1 discount!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me like other serums.</li>
            <li> Every time I try to use this product on the base of my eyelashes, it runs into my eyes, causing them to water and wash away the product.  It is therefore impossible to tell if it is effective.  I believe it is the watery consistency of the product which allows it to get in my eyes. In order to use it up, I&#x27;ve been using the Wonderlash on my eyebrows, but haven&#x27;t noticed it making much of a difference. I have previously used the reLash product, had good results with it, and best of all, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it getting in my eyes.  I&#x27;d recommend reLash over this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work,..!!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! I&#x27;ve been using it regularly, but I see no difference. I have almost used half of the bottle.. Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> Kinda creepy how fast it makes your lashes grow</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed significanat growth, I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle, and use it twice a day. I have seen better results from other products.</li>
            <li> A lash growth serum. what you need to know about this kind of products is one, that it doesn&#x27;t do miracles, and two the changes don&#x27;t happen overnight. If you buy it with that expectation, you are on the wrong isle, but if you buy it thinking you&#x27;ll be consistent about it and patient, you will definetely see results.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product to try and write a review on. I have natural long but very thin lashes myself, so I&#x27;ve always been about growth serums and enhancers. The ones I had been using had been good, like I said not miraculous, but then I don&#x27;t believe any of these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very appealing, easy to use and same method as others, apply twice daily on a clean face. As with others, who are a litte stingy on application, I had no problem with this one, which I totally liked. I have to say I like applying twice, two strokes on my eyelash line instead of one, so a bit always tends to fall into my eye. No irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;So far Ive been using the product for three weeks, and I doubt I&#x27;ll make it to the fourth, running out of it pretty quickly, but then like I said, I overuse a bit.  I cannot really say my lashes have grown a lot, but I can definitely say they look more luscious and volumized. When applying mascara they do seem to go out a bit further than before, and like I mentioned they looked fuller. For me it does the trick. Like I said, you can&#x27;t expect miracles, but if we see this product as an enhancer you will definitely see a difference in time, which in my opinion makes it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it, just know that this is not  miracle worker!!! and it also depends on the consistency of the use.</li>
            <li> My lashes have thinned out significantly over the years and this product works pretty well. However, lesson learned was to  follow instructions and use it on daily bases. The ingredients, particularly Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 &amp; Swiss Apple Stem Cells are very powerful and used in high end products selling for over $80 and this is what I have used in past.  Now I have switched to this brand and quite  happy after 4 weeks of use. This is an excellent product, very affordable  and regular use definitely yields good results.Â  Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it really works. I have been using it for about three weeks now and saw results after just one.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of spending hundreds of dollars on Latisse (A product in which I love). I just don&#x27;t have that type of money, especially when I would accidentally spill my product. I absolutely LOVE Wonderlash!! It&#x27;s very affordable! It&#x27;s also so EASY to apply (Similar to a liquid eyeliner). I don&#x27;t have to worry about wasting or spilling product due to it&#x27;s design. AND I love that it is made for eyelashes AND eyebrows...after years of over plucking, I am also working on growing out my eyebrows out. A girl has got to keep her eyebrows on fleek! You want longer and darker eyelashes/eyebrows? Try Wonderlash. No irritation or redness. Love the results!</li>
            <li> I have seen no growth at all after 2 months of diligent application as described. Also, the serum stings like crazy if you get any in your eyes. I can only hope this stuff was never texted on innocent animals. However, it did come on time.</li>
            <li> The oil in this little bottle made my eyes all irritated and red. This product is not for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I used this on one eye to see if I could tell a difference and within a few days I could tell a definite difference. My eyelashes and eyebrow hairs are longer and darker than before. They aren&#x27;t uneven at all. This product doesn&#x27;t have a smell and doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply it, like other eyelash growth serums. I adore this stuff. The bottle is small, but it goes a long way. I received it for free from AMZ review trader but I plan to repurchase it at retail when I run out.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s working but it&#x27;s making my eyelids dark and the bottle is about 1/4 the size of a mascara tube</li>
            <li> Purchased in July due to eyelashes falling out. Have used faithfully on a daily bases, as per directions. Now, I have wonderful thick, full lashes. Will buy again. I believe in this product, hope they come out with more.</li>
            <li> Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion. WonderLash is supplied in a standard eyeliner style applicator that is simple to use and easy to apply.The instruction to use this product is:  Starting from the inner corner of your lash-line and working outward, draw the applicator tip carefully along the skin at the base of the upper eyelashes in one continuous stroke. Do not apply Eyelash Grower to the lower eyelashes nor directly to the eye surface. Do not apply more than once daily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much growth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week. I am happy with the fact that it does not make my eyelids burn like other products have done. I have not noticed any length improvement but I have noticed thicker eyelashes and hope with continued use I will notice increased length as well.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. After using it just for a few days I have noticed my eyelashes look thicker darker and fuller. This is easy to apply and looks like a small mascara type bottle. This is really easy to apply to your eye lashes and it is a fast simple application. I would apply it twice a day once in the morning and once at night and have had great results. It takes very little and this bottle will last you a very long time. I received this bottle as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, that&#x27;s why I gave it a five-star review. After two weeks of trying this product, I&#x27;ve already noticed my lashes different than before - longer and thicker, and the amount left in the bottle is still a lot! I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll have prettier eyelashes after I&#x27;ve finished this one.</li>
            <li> So far so good...was using Smartlash from Dermstore, and it worked well until they changed the formula.  I switched to this and my lashes look much better.  Have only been using it about six weeks so hoping for even more results.  Also, this product does not burn my eyes at all, unlike Smartlash.  I use it on my lower lashes lightly even though manufacturer recommends against it, and it works well.</li>
            <li> It is everything I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I have thin eyelashes and eyebrows that are falling out as I age- and I&#x27;m only 35! When I saw this stuff I had to try it!!! It is a very very small bottle so put it somewhere safe. Says it&#x27;s enough to last 3 months. The brush is like a nice liquid eyeliner brush and is very easy to use. I have very sensitive eyes and this has not bothered my eyes at all- I put it on 2x per day to top lash line and then on my eyebrows where I would like them fuller. It says not to use on lower lash line and I should have listened- I tried it one day and it got in my eye quickly. Luckily it did not burn- but I could feel it. I am really looking forward to full dark lashes again!</li>
            <li> This serum is a nice one i feel like it gives instant eyelash results to make them look and feel thicker and longer.. doesnt burn or sting or run its a pretty good product. Being able to review this for free and being able to keep it was great. A very good product</li>
            <li> Arrived on time (sooner than I expected!) I&#x27;m excited to update my review once I&#x27;ve had time to see the product work</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a reduced fee to give my honest opinion and I was really surprised to receive such a small bottle in the mail. I was a little hesitant at first thinking that it was to little of a product to do me any good! Boy was I WRONG! This little product really packs a punch! You apply it just like eyeliner on the top eye which I thought was great. Most products like this, you have to apply like mascara which is hard with such a small applicator. I noticed a difference in just a couple days of using and will definitely purchase again for myself and my mom! It was packaged very well and has no unpleasant smell. Another big plus! I really think you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it was easy to apply and after day 3 my lashes appear to be fuller and darker. The bottle was a little smaller than I expected but it doesn&#x27;t seem to take much to get results. I would definatly recommend to others .</li>
            <li> After using this product for a week I notice that my lashes looks more full and define. My friends are complimenting my lashes and you can tell the difference when using this. I have recommended this to several of my friends to try it. Great product to get and easy to use too. No irritation so far. The bottle size is a little disappointing but I guess you don&#x27;t have much product for each use. Not sure how long it is going to last. Overall, great product to try. I bought this at promotional cost and will purchase again if the result remains positive for a long run.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and I don&#x27;t have to reapply constantly. I&#x27;m using before bed and I&#x27;m patiently waiting for results to come in. Love the bottle and how easy I can just take it with me without a hassle!</li>
            <li> THIS TOTALLY WORKS, I SWEAR ON MY LIFE!!!! I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of eye lash grower but it was all just cheap stuff from Walmart. Go big or go home. It&#x27;s been almost two weeks since I&#x27;ve started using it every night before bed and there is SUCH a difference.  I wish I could post the before and after pictures. I even forgot to apply it one or two nights!  I had a chunk in the middle of my eyelashes missing and it has grown back. They are longer,  darker not so much fuller but definitely healthier. (But it&#x27;s only been two weeks so they might fill out)  I am definitely going to be using this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I see a vast difference in my eyelashes and eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I received  this  product  for  a  discount  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review  and  this  is  my experience  with  this  product. The bottle  comes in a size  similar  to an eyeliner. I followed  all directions  and this product  irritated  my eyes and skin around  the eye area immediately  on contact. I won&#x27;t  use this product  again but I might  have  more  sensitive  skin than most.</li>
            <li> Pure magic in a small bottle! I have had small eyelashes all my life and I&#x27;m starting to see a difference in my eyelash length after using this!</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 stars cause it really dose work but the package was damaged and the bottle came half empty cause it leaks.  But overall it works.</li>
            <li> I received my product only yesterday, so I will be adding to this review with pictures at weeks 1-4.  However, I can already say that the serum was well-packaged in a bubble-wrapped package and delivered in the expected timeframe. While the bottle appears small, after one application, you&#x27;ll realize you use a very small amount with each application. So, the product should last for quite some time. I&#x27;ve used Latisse previously, but I had stopped due to the excessive cost. I am so excited to see if this product works similarly. The serum is odorless and has a nice texture. More to come soon! As a blogger, companies sometimes provide me with samples of their products, and in this case, I was provided Wonderlash serum to test and review and to give my honest opinion of the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 4 days, I apply twice, once in the morning and again at night. the brush included makes it a little difficult to apply to eyelashes but to fix that I use an eyelash/eyebrow brush after applying to make sure it gets a good coat. The brush included works fine for applying to my eyebrows. I have noticed the hair is slightly darker and my lashes are a tad bit longer but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days so far so I think if I keep consistent I&#x27;ll see more results. I&#x27;m sure if I applied more often I&#x27;d see results even faster I have not experienced any irritation and am sure to not get too close to my eyeballs just in case, though I did poke myself in the eye once and it didn&#x27;t burn or anything. The vial is small, be careful not to shake it too much, I wasn&#x27;t too carefull and some of it got forced out of the bottle when I screwed the lid back on but that was my fault for shaking it up and causing bubbles.  Overall it seems like a decent product that I haven&#x27;t had any real issues with. I received a discount for providing a review.</li>
            <li> Apply this product for about 3 weeks or more and you will see a noticeable difference in the length of your lashes!!  Only con is:  a very very small bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 3 maybe 4 weeks now, I am disappointed because so far it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my eyelashes or eyebrows. On the plus side, it&#x27;s not irritating like some of the others. I wanted to be that one person that saw the difference right away. MaybeI have to keep using it longer.</li>
            <li> I actually have eye lashes you can see now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for almost a week. The product arrived just on time and the packaging was sufficient. I am one of those people who haven&#x27;t suffered any irritation.  Already a few new lashes are coming in, adding to thickness. Of course because it is early, this difference is very minimal. However, if these results continue I have confidence that WonderLash will do what it says. For those of you who have tried it for only a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, keep in mind that even products such as Latisse do not show results until about 4 weeks, and up to 16 weeks for the full effect. Growing lashes take time!!!! I will write another review later, but as for now, this product is GREAT.</li>
            <li> Been using it regularly for almost 3 months but don&#x27;t see any noticeable result :(</li>
            <li> This is totally joke!!! Waste money and time. Nothing progress at all. Not recommend!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days so I can&#x27;t attest to how effective it is after weeks of use. What I can tell you is that I have not noticed any issues or negative side effects. Applying it once daily is simple (make sure you&#x27;ve removed all make up), and my eyes and skin have not had any problems adjusting to it. Fingers crossed that it will help my lashes grow thicker and longer!</li>
            <li> This is a really small container. What I like though is that I can actually see the amount of fluid. I purchased another kind of lash serum, Wink, from Amazon. The descender didn&#x27;t work correctly. It seemed empty from the start. Ugh! I ended up throwing it away. I also like how fine the brush is.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely deligent in using this product. After 2 months...nothing! Don&amp;#34;t understand why it has worked for some and not me.</li>
            <li> I honestly can say that my eyelashes look longer and fully just after a few days. I wish I took a before picture just to show how much fuller they look! I also think this is formulated to make your lashes look instantly fuller because it shows a difference instantly and lasted all day!</li>
            <li> I love this! I apply it nightly to my eyebrows and eyelashes, and I noticed how thick and full they have gotten in a short period of time! My lashes and brows also appear to be darker which is amazing.</li>
            <li> I used this once a day for two months or more and sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I love that it isn&#x27;t tested on animals which is a huge plus for me, but I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are sparse and anything that will help them grow and look longer and fuller is a super bonus. I am pleased at the results I have obtained so far from using Magic Pure. I can;t wait to see how my lashes look in a month or so! I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?asin&#x3D;B014A5631K#</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but it stings like CRAZY! Will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
            <li> So far no change in lashes.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Eyelash Growth Serum - I got this on a sale to try out and review.  It is a good products if you have thinning eyelashes and eyebrows like I do and do not want to try permanent cosmetics.  It has been making new growth come out on the outer part of my eyebrows so I am pretty excited. Good amount for the price - lasts because you only use a little.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! The instructions are easy to follow and application is easy! I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and am looking forward to the results in a few weeks! I will update my review with the results then so stay tuned...</li>
            <li> I have several products from MAJESTIC  PURE. This company stands behind their products and creates products for the skin that do not irritate. This is one of the reasons I enjoy MAJESTIC PURE products.&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying this serum to my lashes for several days. While I do not see any &#x27;growth&#x27; as of yet, I can tell that my lashes are definitely conditioned and softer.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is exactly like a liquid eyeliner; a thin brush that applies serum to the base of your lashes. My eyes have not been irritated by this product, nor has any product leaked into my eyes, which is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I am hopeful that with continued use I will see growth and fuller lashes. I plan to update this review in a few weeks from now when I have had more time with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to test and try this product as part of my beauty regimen. I am recommending this product based in quality and gentleness.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the size of this bottle, I almost thought the box was empty. It is super, super tiny but I promise you it is NOT sample sized. Only a little bit is needed and it&#x27;s only applied once a day. It&#x27;s also usable on the brows which is a great addition to an already awesome product. It&#x27;s too soon to tell yet, but I have felt like my lashes and brows are &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34;, if you will.</li>
            <li> This product stings my eyes. Rapid Lash didn&#x27;t. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> So far so good as for shipping, handling, appearance and ease of application. The bottle is tiny but all you really need is a little bit lol so I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;sure this will last for quite some time! I gave a 3 rating because I haven&#x27;t had the full affect yet. I will update this post&lt;br /&gt;with before and after pictures and re-rate once I start seeing change :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW in the pics the serum isn&#x27;t yellow.. that&#x27;s just the color of my hand I guess lol</li>
            <li> Sadly this did nothing to grow out my lashes or even thicken them. The only difference is it really burns my eyes. After 3 weeks I should see something but just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 days but when I ordered it I received it very quickly! I&#x27;m excited to try it because I&#x27;ve been wanting my lashes to grow for quite some time!</li>
            <li> Packaging: Shipped very, very fast (thank you Prime). Opened the package and the serum came in a box and there was a sticker all over the directions, ugh. Super teeny, tiny bottle but only using it once a day you don&#x27;t need much. Directions say two weeks and you&#x27;ll start seeing results..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: A minute or two after I applied the serum, I felt tingling on my eyelids, a little uncomfortable at first.&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: Still applying it religiously.&lt;br /&gt;Day 10: Still using it and seeing some length definitely showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes were on the longer side to begin with but I can definitely see more length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product!! SO much cheaper than eye lash extensions so if you&#x27;re looking for length, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Got this item for review, It is very easy to apply and love the fact you only have to apply it once a day!</li>
            <li> The bottle is so small, about 1 and 3/4 inch in height. The product content looks like it may last for a long time. The product itself is runny like water, after application, let it dry before blinking as it may run through and burn your eyes. It dries fast though. The brush applicator is very thin and very easy to use. I got a coupon code so I didn&#x27;t pay the original price. I really would loved to make this product work but I stopped using it because it irritated my right eyelid. When I wake up in the morning, it was swollen. I got so excited when I got this but Unfortunately Its not for me :(</li>
            <li> Product for review: I have been using product for a week. No changes in before and after pictures. Maybe it takes a few weeks to take effect?&lt;br /&gt;Product holds true to being non irritant tomtheneyes&#x27;</li>
            <li> Been using for three weeks.....no change at all.....will finish the product....supposed to use for eight weeks</li>
            <li> Burns my eyes soooo much. After applying my eyes tear for a long time. Ineffective and painful</li>
            <li> HURTS TO GET IN YOUR EYES. *Please whatever you do, try to not get this in your eyes* Honestly I was about to give up on this after two weeks of use, I thought it was just not helping if not making my brows/lashes worse. But I kept using it and now I&#x27;m noticing how much fuller they really look when I comb them in the morning, my eyelashes are longer and don&#x27;t fall out as much, my sparse brow areas are filling in nicely, but slowly. My only regret was not taking a before picture. Btw lash/brow hairs will probably start falling out when you stop using it</li>
            <li> BEWARE!! I think many of the reviews are fake or solicited .. This will probably make eyelashes fallout. It burned my skin and I dont think this is a reputable company.</li>
            <li> Feeling a little duped after buying this. I have no idea if the product actually works but there are multiple typos and misspellings on the packaging.  If this was really a good product, I would certainly expect more attention to detail. There is actually a spot on the box where the word eyelash is spelled wrong.</li>
            <li> I have received this product in order to test and review. When the opportunity was given to me to try this product out, I was very curious and a bit skeptical. I have been using Majestic Pure&#x27;s Eyelash Growth Serum for exactly two weeks, every day. I put it on in the morning after my shower. I don&#x27;t really wear makeup except when I&#x27;m going somewhere, so I tried to stay home for the past 2 weeks to truly make sure of the results. I have noticed and my husband has noticed some darkening of my eyelashes. I also put the serum on my eye brawls. I didn&#x27;t see any result with my eye brawls. I&#x27;m going to continue on for 30 full days to see further results. So far, I do like the results that are appearing for my eyelashes because as you can see, I really don&#x27;t have much length to them.&lt;br /&gt;When applying this serum, you want to dab it on the rim of the bottle to get excess serum off. If you don&#x27;t you might get the serum in your eye and that will make your eye a little irritated and really that is with about anything foreign that might go in your eye. After I did it a couple times, I got the hang of it. Just apply once a day, before any makeup is applied. I&#x27;ll come back in 30 days for a follow up review on this product</li>
            <li> this is not going to last 3 months.Sorry. It&#x27;s half gone at only a few weeks with very minimal results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m trying to convince myself if there has been a slight improvement in the length and fullness of my lashes, or if it hasn&#x27;t done anything and I&#x27;m hallucinating! I will continue to use this product until I run out, in hopes that even a very slight improvement is better than nothing, but I do not plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I think my eyelashes thickened with growth.  It&#x27;s hard to tell because my eyes are going bad but all in all this did not irritate my eyes are skin.</li>
            <li> This product stings and after two applications my eyelids had several painful bumps that lasted a couple of days.</li>
            <li> You can tell when i have it on and when i dont i loved it!</li>
            <li> Not seeing any results yet. But I&#x27;m not surprised, I&#x27;m having a difficult time applying this stuff without a tiny little bit getting into my eyes every time. And when this stuff gets in your eyes, it&#x27;s like acid. Tears, tears, tears. Eyes get red and swollen. I obviously end up washing this stuff off before it burns ulcers in my eyes. No point in trying anymore.  Update - I have tried this a few more times with super careful application and my left upper eyelid has developed a hard, red bump that won&#x27;t go away even though I have stopped using the product. I have no idea what to do.</li>
            <li> I have wanted something to help my eyebrows get thicker. I&#x27;ve been waxing my eyebrows for years if not a couple decades, and they&#x27;re kinda thinning out. So when I saw that this Eyelash growth serum works on eyebrows too, I was intrigued. Well, Majestic Pure offered me their Eyelash Growth Serum for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. As soon as it arrived, I applied it to my eyebrows. In just under a week of using this serum, my eyebrows have new growth! If you are in the same predicament with your eyebrows, this Eyelash Growth Serum from Majestic Pure is perfect!</li>
            <li> Amazing...thank,you!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product I have been using it since I received and I love my eyelashes now. I used to hate them. I love the fact that you only apply it once a day.</li>
