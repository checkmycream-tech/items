            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great electric toothbrush, this is definitely a good one but be mindful of its lifespan.  </li>
            <li>I have an older model Sonicare, which works perfectly still, but this toothbrush is great!  </li>
            <li>I always kept good oral hygiene</li>
            <li>I can also feel the difference and that it good.</li>
            <li>That would be one thing if they had a good take-back program</li>
            <li>This is a good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Consumer Reports gave it a good rating, but the quality is just not there.  </li>
            <li>Good product haven&#x27;t had it three months yet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good when it works though.</li>
            <li>The clean you get after using it is great!</li>
            <li>So I used my son&#x27;s toothbrush (with my own head of course :P)</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for years and have always been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>but im sure it works great as well</li>
            <li>and I am glad I took the plunge!  </li>
            <li>The UV brush cleaner and travel case are a nice perk as well.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way I can prove whether it works or not to sanitize, but it sure makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>Works great, I like the max clean setting for three min.</li>
            <li>Great travel pack and so far great battery life.  </li>
            <li>By far this is the the best motorized toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I think this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought for personal care that I can remember</li>
            <li>Love the carrying case it comes with for travel times.</li>
            <li>I actually love brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>My dentist was always saying either i need to brush better or get a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love that sanitizer</li>
            <li>and I love the sanitizer feature.</li>
            <li>The Flexcare, I think, does a much better job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They are more thorough than most people will do by hand.</li>
            <li>This is a top rated electric toothbrush (Consumer Reports online).  </li>
            <li>After a bunch of research I bought the HX6932 and both my wife and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy, because a sparkling smile is important to me.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love how my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use this toothbrush easily because of the easy on/off of the toothbrush head and the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to know that I can sterilize this frequently as well.</li>
            <li>I tend to brush longer and enjoy it more.</li>
            <li>Even though I had a separate sanitizer, this one is just more user friendly.</li>
            <li>The heads detach and re-attach easily for cleaning in the sanitizer.</li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is easy to use.</li>
            <li>so I pay better attention to getting all my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>already philips did it very quickly without any hassle at all.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush hands down.</li>
            <li>&quot; handle is good as new for well under $20 including parts labor and shipping!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I bought the version with the UV light.</li>
            <li>So I decided to cheap out.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want cheap junk made in China, and if that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to get from Phillips, it&#x27;s time to move on to another company once this one dies.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>she says it works great, better than any other motorized toothbrush she ever had before.</li>
            <li>Great clean - numerous cycles to choose from</li>
            <li>Love this new toothbrush , I used the Oral B for years, this is so much better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>Long battery life and caring case makes it great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the initial getting-used-to-it part, I can honestly say my teeth have never felt cleaner - ever!</li>
            <li>As far as cleaning, it is the best, and has improved my dental health significantly over regular toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend the toothbrush for clean teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>I like the sanitizer function which helps keep the brushes clean.</li>
            <li>teeth completely clean.  </li>
            <li>My mouth just wasn&#x27;t as clean.  </li>
            <li>Each toothbrush seems to last for about 4 years before the battery doesn&#x27;t keep as good of a charge and the handle begins to show wear.  </li>
            <li>it takes a good solid charge.  </li>
            <li>The timers and massage settings are cool.  </li>
            <li>but hopefully it is lasting a good while for others.  </li>
            <li>gives you that clean and fresh mouth feeling.</li>
            <li>Battery not keeping charge, brushes wearing out quickly were a couple of reason I decided to try the Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>quick working after about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted</li>
            <li>/&gt;Assuming they are lying, I checked Ebay and quickly found a vendor who repairs these items.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great as it was when it worked, its just not worth it.</li>
            <li>and though it helps the environment I really would have rather had my Toothbrush and its accessories in its originally intended packaging not sliding around in a light cardboard box that had caused all the Brush head protectors to fall off and into the box they got shipped inside</li>
            <li>The cleaning quality is amazing: way better than any other electric toothbrush I have had before.</li>
            <li>and I love the new design.</li>
            <li>Since this is my first, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with, but this Philips model has been fab!  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how clean my teeth felt after the first brushing -</li>
            <li>only real good news is that you can buy replacement bases sans sanitizer for less than the combined unit -- and if you call customer service, they&#x27;ll probably give you free brush heads or a coupon for replacing your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>I wish the replacement brushes did not cost an arm and a leg, but if guess it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Elite with this toothbrush and love it.</li>
            <li>but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This thing is actually pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s worth what it&#x27;s saved me at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the sanitizing light and easy travel case.  </li>
            <li>what but the new heads aren&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until the brush handle breaks, however, you will definitely get a good clean, and without the potential damage to your gums that stiff-brush manual toothbrushes could cause.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until the brush handle breaks, however, you will definitely get a good clean, and without the potential damage to your gums that stiff-brush manual toothbrushes could cause.</li>
            <li>only issue I had was I ordered it in full retail packaging and for some reason still came frustration free</li>
            <li>The first one DID NOT wear out.  </li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is pretty neat even though I don&#x27;t use it that often.  </li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted a lot longer than that.  </li>
            <li>This replaces a first generation Sonicare.</li>
            <li>After my simple Philips Sonicare died after 4 years I got this more fancy one.</li>
            <li>It is a better replacement for our similar, but discontinued, Braun.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 3 years before the brush heads would no longer stay attached to the charger.</li>
            <li>You have to really pull!</li>
            <li>The first one fell apart after 26 months (24 months is the warranty).  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for a few weeks and are delighted with it.  </li>
            <li>The sonic action seems to clean my teeth and gums better than standard powered tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>This item does not look or feel nearly as rugged or as waterproof as the original.  </li>
            <li>My first time using this it did feel a bit wierd, but my teeth and gums definetly felt much cleaner then any brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>In short, this is a well made toothbrush and it is worth the price because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - clean your teeth</li>
            <li>I owned one previously and liked it .</li>
            <li>I most recently had a $169 dollar Clean and White one and it seems to me that it was finished before the two years was up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to buy replacement brush heads, and that is a big plus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their turn around was fairly quick and they gave me a clear understanding of the repairs</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because the cleaning is so amazing, I decided to give Philips a second chance and just bought another sonicare (a different model).</li>
            <li>More than I expected.</li>
            <li>and she had this model on a shelf, demonstrated  how much faster</li>
            <li>My teeth cleanings have been much easier</li>
            <li>and he really enjoys using it.  </li>
            <li>The heads are very durable aand</li>
            <li>really improved.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really cleans your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I no longer even have to go to the periodonist thanks to this</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Finally, about a week or two after the sounds started, the thing just stopped working as a toothbrush and became a clunky sound machine.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if its me with to much pressure or</li>
            <li>The Sanitizer works very well</li>
            <li>their prices for parts were very reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the brush head is the right size and the way it works though different at first works very well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>After a week using the sonicare, the first thing my dentist said was \\&quot;wow, your brushing has</li>
            <li>That would be ok, but they also become loose and fall off sooner than the old ones did.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth it because I could never figure out how to use the clean and white feature AND pause the machine as well which I like to do in the middle of brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from an older Oral B Electic to this, and I&#x27;d say&lt;</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews here probably come from people who recently got a Sonicare and are reporting on its performance initially.</li>
            <li>All of our grown children and grandchildren are also brushing theri teeth with thie particular model.</li>
            <li>I definitely do not recommend buying this product and am considering going back to the older screw top model.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this came highly reccomended by my dental hygenist as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this or any power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It replaced an old Oral B electric - what a difference!!</li>
            <li>but it could be a little more user</li>
            <li>Spend your money on a better product, this one is definitely not worth the $150.00!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensitive enough not to irritate gums but gets my teeth squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, GREAT PRODUCT - if you can afford the expensive brush head replacements (sold in denominations of 3 and up</li>
            <li>Also, the last one generated the ultrasonic vibrations in the head (the brush attachment) through a coil in the handset and a powerful magnet in the brush attachment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It runs OK but has developed an odd \\&quot;delamination\\&quot; problem.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>you definitely spend the right amount of time brushing</li>
            <li>So when it died I had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>AND MY NEW HANDLE IS ON THE WAY.</li>
            <li>Had to buy a new one</li>
            <li>If you got a new head every time the color faded, you would be replacing them every 2 - 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it happens to you I would return it through amazon and get a new one.</li>
            <li>The brush is shaped similar to a regular tooth brush and will last much longer than the round unit that I had experienced.</li>
            <li>My way was clear!  </li>
            <li>My first one finally gave out after 5 years</li>
            <li>Using this new one is really heaven!&lt;br /&gt;After a recent trip to the dentist</li>
            <li>and it seems as if it&#x27;s actually designed to break in a certain spot.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, at this price, they need to last much longer.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for Hubby  because he&#x27;s been wanting to buy one and one day i just surprised him with this.</li>
            <li>I CALLED PHILLIPS DIRECTLY.  </li>
            <li>We accidentally hit the on button leaving Lake Tahoe and when we arrived home 3 hrs later it was still on and ready for use.  </li>
            <li>You didn&#x27;t feel the vibration in the handset nearly like you do in this model.</li>
            <li>and I also bought the kiddie version for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>It seems highly coincidental that they break in the same exact spot, in the same exact pattern on the same internal piece.  </li>
            <li>Narrow heads make it easier for cleaning &amp; getting into the grooves between teeth, the back of the jaw, and perhaps better for those with smaller mouths.</li>
            <li>Its a cool idea to know that you killed any bacteria that might be on it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not hard on it, using it only once a day, so we&#x27;ll say it has a lifespan of about 800 brushings.  </li>
            <li>I have to take a cheap, battery-powered brush for little trips and such.</li>
            <li>This particular Sonicare cleans as good as the old one, the battery lasts longer, there is no more muck underneath the brush with the new brush design, however the button to choose different programs is really in the wrong</li>
            <li>Four months of no sanitizing pretty much makes the machine pointless.</li>
            <li>Even though the brush has a setting that helps you \\&quot;step up\\&quot; to the regular setting, it&#x27;s still pretty rough if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t expect something like this to have such a short lifespan.acement bases sans sanitizer for less than the combined unit -- and if you call customer service, they&#x27;ll probably give you free brush heads or a coupon for replacing your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our old sonicare had it&#x27;s last</li>
            <li>When you think about how far we have come from not brushing teeth to brushing teeth &#x27;manually&#x27; to brushing teeth with an actual space ship, you wil understand what this toothbrush does for you.</li>
            <li>This model replaced my old Sonicare and it is a big improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The same thing actually happened sometime during the first year of ownership (possibly the first few months?)</li>
            <li>The customer service department was not surprised and within a minute said they will send me a new one without troubleshooting.  </li>
            <li>Then I have to push a few times again to return to the right program.</li>
            <li>Your mouth is filthy already, UV light isn&#x27;t doing anything worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I wish I had gotten rid of my old one long ago!  </li>
            <li>The new one works as well, but I have noticed it&#x27;s harder to get the brush heads off when you finish brushing.</li>
            <li>UV light is a scam and hella dumb.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Both of us attribute it to this great product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, make your teeth and mouth happy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great electric toothbrush, this is definitely a good one but be mindful of its lifespan.  </li>
            <li> I have an older model Sonicare, which works perfectly still, but this toothbrush is great!  </li>
            <li> I always kept good oral hygiene</li>
            <li> I can also feel the difference and that it good.</li>
            <li> That would be one thing if they had a good take-back program</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Consumer Reports gave it a good rating, but the quality is just not there.  </li>
            <li> Good product haven&#x27;t had it three months yet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good when it works though.</li>
            <li> The clean you get after using it is great!</li>
            <li> So I used my son&#x27;s toothbrush (with my own head of course :P)</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years and have always been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> but im sure it works great as well</li>
            <li> and I am glad I took the plunge!  </li>
            <li> The UV brush cleaner and travel case are a nice perk as well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way I can prove whether it works or not to sanitize, but it sure makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> Works great, I like the max clean setting for three min.</li>
            <li> Great travel pack and so far great battery life.  </li>
            <li> By far this is the the best motorized toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I think this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought for personal care that I can remember</li>
            <li> Love the carrying case it comes with for travel times.</li>
            <li> I actually love brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist was always saying either i need to brush better or get a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Love that sanitizer</li>
            <li> and I love the sanitizer feature.</li>
            <li> The Flexcare, I think, does a much better job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They are more thorough than most people will do by hand.</li>
            <li> This is a top rated electric toothbrush (Consumer Reports online).  </li>
            <li> After a bunch of research I bought the HX6932 and both my wife and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy, because a sparkling smile is important to me.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love how my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use this toothbrush easily because of the easy on/off of the toothbrush head and the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to know that I can sterilize this frequently as well.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush longer and enjoy it more.</li>
            <li> Even though I had a separate sanitizer, this one is just more user friendly.</li>
            <li> The heads detach and re-attach easily for cleaning in the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is easy to use.</li>
            <li> so I pay better attention to getting all my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> already philips did it very quickly without any hassle at all.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush hands down.</li>
            <li> &quot; handle is good as new for well under $20 including parts labor and shipping!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I bought the version with the UV light.</li>
            <li> So I decided to cheap out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want cheap junk made in China, and if that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to get from Phillips, it&#x27;s time to move on to another company once this one dies.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> she says it works great, better than any other motorized toothbrush she ever had before.</li>
            <li> Great clean - numerous cycles to choose from</li>
            <li> Love this new toothbrush , I used the Oral B for years, this is so much better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> Long battery life and caring case makes it great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the initial getting-used-to-it part, I can honestly say my teeth have never felt cleaner - ever!</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning, it is the best, and has improved my dental health significantly over regular toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend the toothbrush for clean teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I like the sanitizer function which helps keep the brushes clean.</li>
            <li> teeth completely clean.  </li>
            <li> My mouth just wasn&#x27;t as clean.  </li>
            <li> Each toothbrush seems to last for about 4 years before the battery doesn&#x27;t keep as good of a charge and the handle begins to show wear.  </li>
            <li> it takes a good solid charge.  </li>
            <li> The timers and massage settings are cool.  </li>
            <li> but hopefully it is lasting a good while for others.  </li>
            <li> gives you that clean and fresh mouth feeling.</li>
            <li> Battery not keeping charge, brushes wearing out quickly were a couple of reason I decided to try the Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> quick working after about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted</li>
            <li> /&gt;Assuming they are lying, I checked Ebay and quickly found a vendor who repairs these items.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great as it was when it worked, its just not worth it.</li>
            <li> and though it helps the environment I really would have rather had my Toothbrush and its accessories in its originally intended packaging not sliding around in a light cardboard box that had caused all the Brush head protectors to fall off and into the box they got shipped inside</li>
            <li> The cleaning quality is amazing: way better than any other electric toothbrush I have had before.</li>
            <li> and I love the new design.</li>
            <li> Since this is my first, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with, but this Philips model has been fab!  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how clean my teeth felt after the first brushing -</li>
            <li> only real good news is that you can buy replacement bases sans sanitizer for less than the combined unit -- and if you call customer service, they&#x27;ll probably give you free brush heads or a coupon for replacing your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I wish the replacement brushes did not cost an arm and a leg, but if guess it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Elite with this toothbrush and love it.</li>
            <li> but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This thing is actually pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s worth what it&#x27;s saved me at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the sanitizing light and easy travel case.  </li>
            <li> what but the new heads aren&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until the brush handle breaks, however, you will definitely get a good clean, and without the potential damage to your gums that stiff-brush manual toothbrushes could cause.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until the brush handle breaks, however, you will definitely get a good clean, and without the potential damage to your gums that stiff-brush manual toothbrushes could cause.</li>
            <li> only issue I had was I ordered it in full retail packaging and for some reason still came frustration free</li>
            <li> The first one DID NOT wear out.  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is pretty neat even though I don&#x27;t use it that often.  </li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted a lot longer than that.  </li>
            <li> This replaces a first generation Sonicare.</li>
            <li> After my simple Philips Sonicare died after 4 years I got this more fancy one.</li>
            <li> It is a better replacement for our similar, but discontinued, Braun.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 3 years before the brush heads would no longer stay attached to the charger.</li>
            <li> You have to really pull!</li>
            <li> The first one fell apart after 26 months (24 months is the warranty).  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for a few weeks and are delighted with it.  </li>
            <li> The sonic action seems to clean my teeth and gums better than standard powered tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> This item does not look or feel nearly as rugged or as waterproof as the original.  </li>
            <li> My first time using this it did feel a bit wierd, but my teeth and gums definetly felt much cleaner then any brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> In short, this is a well made toothbrush and it is worth the price because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - clean your teeth</li>
            <li> I owned one previously and liked it .</li>
            <li> I most recently had a $169 dollar Clean and White one and it seems to me that it was finished before the two years was up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to buy replacement brush heads, and that is a big plus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their turn around was fairly quick and they gave me a clear understanding of the repairs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because the cleaning is so amazing, I decided to give Philips a second chance and just bought another sonicare (a different model).</li>
            <li> More than I expected.</li>
            <li> and she had this model on a shelf, demonstrated  how much faster</li>
            <li> My teeth cleanings have been much easier</li>
            <li> and he really enjoys using it.  </li>
            <li> The heads are very durable aand</li>
            <li> really improved.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really cleans your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I no longer even have to go to the periodonist thanks to this</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Finally, about a week or two after the sounds started, the thing just stopped working as a toothbrush and became a clunky sound machine.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if its me with to much pressure or</li>
            <li> The Sanitizer works very well</li>
            <li> their prices for parts were very reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the brush head is the right size and the way it works though different at first works very well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> After a week using the sonicare, the first thing my dentist said was \\&quot;wow, your brushing has</li>
            <li> That would be ok, but they also become loose and fall off sooner than the old ones did.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth it because I could never figure out how to use the clean and white feature AND pause the machine as well which I like to do in the middle of brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from an older Oral B Electic to this, and I&#x27;d say&lt;</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews here probably come from people who recently got a Sonicare and are reporting on its performance initially.</li>
            <li> All of our grown children and grandchildren are also brushing theri teeth with thie particular model.</li>
            <li> I definitely do not recommend buying this product and am considering going back to the older screw top model.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this came highly reccomended by my dental hygenist as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this or any power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It replaced an old Oral B electric - what a difference!!</li>
            <li> but it could be a little more user</li>
            <li> Spend your money on a better product, this one is definitely not worth the $150.00!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensitive enough not to irritate gums but gets my teeth squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, GREAT PRODUCT - if you can afford the expensive brush head replacements (sold in denominations of 3 and up</li>
            <li> Also, the last one generated the ultrasonic vibrations in the head (the brush attachment) through a coil in the handset and a powerful magnet in the brush attachment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It runs OK but has developed an odd \\&quot;delamination\\&quot; problem.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> you definitely spend the right amount of time brushing</li>
            <li> So when it died I had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> AND MY NEW HANDLE IS ON THE WAY.</li>
            <li> Had to buy a new one</li>
            <li> If you got a new head every time the color faded, you would be replacing them every 2 - 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it happens to you I would return it through amazon and get a new one.</li>
            <li> The brush is shaped similar to a regular tooth brush and will last much longer than the round unit that I had experienced.</li>
            <li> My way was clear!  </li>
            <li> My first one finally gave out after 5 years</li>
            <li> Using this new one is really heaven!&lt;br /&gt;After a recent trip to the dentist</li>
            <li> and it seems as if it&#x27;s actually designed to break in a certain spot.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, at this price, they need to last much longer.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for Hubby  because he&#x27;s been wanting to buy one and one day i just surprised him with this.</li>
            <li> I CALLED PHILLIPS DIRECTLY.  </li>
            <li> We accidentally hit the on button leaving Lake Tahoe and when we arrived home 3 hrs later it was still on and ready for use.  </li>
            <li> You didn&#x27;t feel the vibration in the handset nearly like you do in this model.</li>
            <li> and I also bought the kiddie version for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> It seems highly coincidental that they break in the same exact spot, in the same exact pattern on the same internal piece.  </li>
            <li> Narrow heads make it easier for cleaning &amp; getting into the grooves between teeth, the back of the jaw, and perhaps better for those with smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> Its a cool idea to know that you killed any bacteria that might be on it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not hard on it, using it only once a day, so we&#x27;ll say it has a lifespan of about 800 brushings.  </li>
            <li> I have to take a cheap, battery-powered brush for little trips and such.</li>
            <li> This particular Sonicare cleans as good as the old one, the battery lasts longer, there is no more muck underneath the brush with the new brush design, however the button to choose different programs is really in the wrong</li>
            <li> Four months of no sanitizing pretty much makes the machine pointless.</li>
            <li> Even though the brush has a setting that helps you \\&quot;step up\\&quot; to the regular setting, it&#x27;s still pretty rough if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t expect something like this to have such a short lifespan.acement bases sans sanitizer for less than the combined unit -- and if you call customer service, they&#x27;ll probably give you free brush heads or a coupon for replacing your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our old sonicare had it&#x27;s last</li>
            <li> When you think about how far we have come from not brushing teeth to brushing teeth &#x27;manually&#x27; to brushing teeth with an actual space ship, you wil understand what this toothbrush does for you.</li>
            <li> This model replaced my old Sonicare and it is a big improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The same thing actually happened sometime during the first year of ownership (possibly the first few months?)</li>
            <li> The customer service department was not surprised and within a minute said they will send me a new one without troubleshooting.  </li>
            <li> Then I have to push a few times again to return to the right program.</li>
            <li> Your mouth is filthy already, UV light isn&#x27;t doing anything worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten rid of my old one long ago!  </li>
            <li> The new one works as well, but I have noticed it&#x27;s harder to get the brush heads off when you finish brushing.</li>
            <li> UV light is a scam and hella dumb.</li>
            <li> It was so quiet and the head stayed so much cleaner than the older version, though it was always a little hard to get the heads off between brushes.  </li>
            <li> single charge on this toothbrush with regular use will last you about two weeks.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time and I only have to charge by toothbrush once or twice a month.</li>
            <li> the new unit after a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I do not like is that the brush head wore easily and replacements are ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> For how much these toothbrushes cost, I find that pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t open and start using it until the past 3 months and the charger has stopped charging completely.</li>
            <li> I replaced my dead old Sonicare with this</li>
            <li> My housemate&#x27;s slightly newer brush was manufactured in China -- a possible loss in quality, and definitely a loss in U.S.</li>
            <li> However - while I do not know how long a $170 electric toothbrush should last - I was hoping it would be longer due to the expense.  </li>
            <li> After Looking for about a month at the different options for this and other toothbrushes I decided to go with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> although less that the oldert model with the larger plastic brush heads.</li>
            <li> After using it for two years and going back to the dentist, she commented that she noticed less plaque and tartar</li>
            <li> the plus side, Philips has decent customer service, and they readily offer coupons and discounts for a replacement purchase, but I was frustrated to learn only at the point of its breakdown that the expected life of the brush is 3-5 years.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve only had it for a little over a year and had to warranty it twice with philips;</li>
            <li> and the charger is small, its not the large piece shown here, just a small piece for the bottom that the brush sets on and plugs in.</li>
            <li> Try the smaller brush heads if you have trouble reaching your wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> Be careful pulling the heads off or you will bust the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> and I never really like electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> What is frustrating is this is a replacement for his old one which only lasted 8-months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> an email to their corporate offices and received no reply.&lt;br /&gt;Except for the poorly placed buttons (which you inadvertently hit while holding the handle), this one seems to be still working so far...</li>
            <li> Clearly it&#x27;s not made as well as the previous models.</li>
            <li> $57/year plus the cost of very (VERY) expensive brush heads seems high, although this may be normal.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it extremely difficult to figure out where to order a new bulb, but then it took literally 4 months for the bulb to be received as it was backordered.  </li>
            <li> First started off with random on</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not the first to report this just google soniccare random on or turned on automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers.</li>
            <li> but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this model as i&#x27;ve read the other reviews</li>
            <li> I usually brush first to loosen up tough particles between teeth,&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Considering the folks at Preserve make COMPLETELY recyclable toothbrushes (albeit no electric models that I know of), and take back their used brushes, I find this a rather lousy product design for something you have to replace so often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> up:&lt;br /&gt;The handle has now completely failed, something is disconnected inside the handle and it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> It was not even the lack of charge, the toothbrush just shut down.</li>
            <li> After a while the charger gets worn down, and the heads fall off.</li>
            <li> * don&#x27;t push the brush again your teeth, use a slight angle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is simply too expensive for an item that is likely to break after 2 years.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the travel charger does not fit in the small travel bag.  </li>
            <li> My dentist can&#x27;t believe how little plaque buildup I have when I go for cleaning.</li>
            <li> However, the bulb for the sanitizer is almost impossible to replace once it wears out, which in my case was right after the warranty expired.  </li>
            <li> This is the third sonicare I have bought and the only thing i do not understand is why the unit gets so dirty with use........</li>
            <li> The vibrations of the bristles takes a few days to get used to FYI.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It used round revolving brush heads.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with it almost from the start.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare for a few weeks</li>
            <li> My teeth have also become and stayed a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I inadvertently push this button a few times because that is where you have to hold the brush for maximum results.</li>
            <li> (another thing to clean)&lt;br /&gt;I can not recommend Sonic Care products until these issues are resolved.&lt;br /&gt;Philips is destroying their reputation to save a few bucks on their warranty costs.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> 4/5 stars because the replacement heads are expensive, and the generic ones - well don&#x27;t even waste your money on those.</li>
            <li> AND, my now-defunct brush handle was at least assembled in the United States, which I would expect to be a slightly better-quality job.</li>

            <li> But they just don&#x27;t last, and tend to fail just after the warranty expires.  </li>
            <li> After only one charging cycle it failed.  </li>

            <li> This is a very expensive toothbrush to buy that will last less than a year.</li>
            <li> like the storage/cleaning station, too hard to position brushes and close door.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended I switch to an electric toothbrush because I brush too hard</li>
            <li> at least i haven&#x27;t found it yet.</li>
            <li> That is extremely disappointing, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Suddenly about 8 months in it started making some crazy clunking sounds.  </li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s been my experience with two of them now.  </li>
            <li> Namely: in the last week, it stopped vibrating correctly, due to cracking around the base of the rod</li>
            <li> I tried the new power up one which is less than $40, but I couldn&#x27;t believe how terrible it was.  </li>
            <li> Also, when you got back to the dentist if you hate the plaque scrapping you will not have to endure what you did before you bought this brush.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the idea behind the product that is briliant and it works.</li>
            <li> tp Philips Sonicare with their poor customer service.</li>
            <li> My wife was getting sick of the goo that accumulates in the other screw-top version of the Sonicare that we used to have.  </li>
            <li> I am reviewing this as an owner since April 2009, however, because the real disappointment with the product came much later in my ownership.</li>
            <li> it makes brushing with a cheaper electric toothbrush or, heaven forbid, a standard toothbrush, seem disgusting.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the \\&quot;color indication\\&quot; on the toothbrush head is utterly useless.</li>
            <li> just shy of two weeks</li>
            <li> and I went without for a while because this model is soooo expensive to me.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this expensive unit about one year ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine was out of warranty and it still works just makes crazy noises.</li>
            <li> my teeth felt so dirty and filmy and I would never want to go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model seems to generate all the vibrations in the handset, which are merely transferred TO the brush attachment, instead of being generated IN the base of the attachment itself.  </li>
            <li> * Use a gel type toothpaste, it will not \\&quot;leak\\&quot; as badly from your mouth as you</li>
            <li> Sometimes people get a bad product</li>
            <li> bad, because my dentist thinks this has improved my oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vibrations made me feel dizzy and sick.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the quality.  </li>
            <li> It vibrated like CRAZY (and doesn&#x27;t have a timer either)!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get all the mold around the base of the brush head</li>
            <li> You will not make a bad purchase with this product!</li>
            <li> I was VERY frustrated at that</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> More than I expected. Works great and has everything you need in one package. Well worth the expense. I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has gum problems.  He loves this toothbrush and we&#x27;re hoping it helps at the dentist!</li>
            <li> Wore out two Braun Sonicares, told my hygienist  I was buying another and she had this model on a shelf, demonstrated  how much faster it was.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the storage/cleaning station, too hard to position brushes and close door.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush system. It&#x27;s only two minutes, but sometimes feels like forever when you&#x27;re in a rush to get to work! Thank goodness for the timer- my teeth have never been cleaner-even my dental hygienist says so!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of cleaning my teeth.  Almost as though I went to the dentist.  What I do not like is that the brush head wore easily and replacements are ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush to me. I was amazed at how clean my teeth felt after the first brushing - it makes brushing with a cheaper electric toothbrush or, heaven forbid, a standard toothbrush, seem disgusting. The vibrations of the bristles takes a few days to get used to FYI. The battery lasts a long time and I only have to charge by toothbrush once or twice a month. The UV brush cleaner and travel case are a nice perk as well. In short, this is a well made toothbrush and it is worth the price because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - clean your teeth well - and it will last years before you need to replace it (excluding the brush-heads, of course).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and it was working well until just after 2 months of use it stopped working. It was not even the lack of charge, the toothbrush just shut down. What is frustrating is this is a replacement for his old one which only lasted 8-months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As great as it was when it worked, its just not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Philips Sonicare over the last 8 years.  I love this toothbrush.  It holds up to every day use by several members of the family.  I especially like the sanitizing light and easy travel case.  Each toothbrush seems to last for about 4 years before the battery doesn&#x27;t keep as good of a charge and the handle begins to show wear.  My teeth cleanings have been much easier and I have haven&#x27;t had any cavities since I started using these toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for a few weeks and are delighted with it.  It replaced an old Oral B electric - what a difference!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it. I owned one previously and liked it . So when it died I had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a gift my my husband and he really enjoys using it.  The heads are very durable aand it takes a good solid charge.  Even the carrying case if perfect.</li>
            <li> Competitive price and a superb machine.  one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought for personal care that I can remember</li>
            <li> Ordered this for Hubby  because he&#x27;s been wanting to buy one and one day i just surprised him with this. He loves it! i use it as well.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you that clean and fresh mouth feeling.</li>
            <li> Great when it worked but this toothbrush still developos mold although less that the oldert model with the larger plastic brush heads. My unit also stopped working after 13 months.  First started off with random on off which I ususpect was a short. I cracked opned the unit through the bittom and noticed water all on the inside including the circuit board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the first to report this just google soniccare random on or turned on automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend</li>
            <li> Great Sonic toothbrush. Narrow heads make it easier for cleaning &amp; getting into the grooves between teeth, the back of the jaw, and perhaps better for those with smaller mouths. Cleaning is excellent, and the UV desterilization feature is perfect. Love the carrying case it comes with for travel times.</li>
            <li> Love this new toothbrush , I used the Oral B for years, this is so much better and it has the sanitizer! My teeth feel cleaner and the hygienist was happy.</li>
            <li> I always kept good oral hygiene but once I switched to the Sonicare I actually love brushing my teeth. It&#x27;s sensitive enough not to irritate gums but gets my teeth squeaky clean. It&#x27;s great to know that I can sterilize this frequently as well. My dentist says it&#x27;s working wonders. Try the smaller brush heads if you have trouble reaching your wisdom teeth. I&#x27;m looking forward to buying one for my husband.</li>
            <li> I bought the version with the UV light. What i can say is that the Sonicare feels like a flood of cleanliness as you brush. My dentist was always saying either i need to brush better or get a better toothbrush. After a week using the sonicare, the first thing my dentist said was \\&quot;wow, your brushing has really improved.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. A great and thorough cleanse every time. EXCEPT that i can never take it with me traveling. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way to ensure that it won&#x27;t start buzzing in your bag, like a total disabling feature, or at least i haven&#x27;t found it yet. But for an at-home piece, it&#x27;s the best. I have to take a cheap, battery-powered brush for little trips and such. Ah well.</li>
            <li> Just got this and it really cleans your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from an older Oral B Electic to this, and I&#x27;d say&lt;br /&gt;this came highly reccomended by my dental hygenist as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the reviews here, here are some tips that have worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;* Use a gel type toothpaste, it will not \\&quot;leak\\&quot; as badly from your mouth as you brush.&lt;br /&gt;  tilt your head back slighty.&lt;br /&gt;* use about 1/2 the amount of toothpaste you used before.&lt;br /&gt;* don&#x27;t start the toothbrush until you put it into your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;* don&#x27;t push the brush again your teeth, use a slight angle.&lt;br /&gt;* I usually brush first to loosen up tough particles between teeth,&lt;br /&gt;  floss, then brush again for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> After Looking for about a month at the different options for this and other toothbrushes I decided to go with the Sonicare. The toothbrush is perfect for me. the brush head is the right size and the way it works though different at first works very well.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was I ordered it in full retail packaging and for some reason still came frustration free.......I was VERY frustrated at that and though it helps the environment I really would have rather had my Toothbrush and its accessories in its originally intended packaging not sliding around in a light cardboard box that had caused all the Brush head protectors to fall off and into the box they got shipped inside</li>
            <li> I bought 2, one for my son, and one for my daughter. They are both extremely happy with it. Now I&#x27;m going to buy one for me!</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare toothbrush for years.  This is my second one.  The first one DID NOT wear out.  I broke the sanitizer case so I had to replace it.  Love that sanitizer feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have gum problems until my periodontist recommended this toothbrush to help my &amp;#34;aggressive brushing&amp;#34; behavior.  I no longer even have to go to the periodonist thanks to this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend the toothbrush for clean teeth and gums.  It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I CALLED PHILLIPS DIRECTLY.  NO QUESTIONS ASKED AND MY NEW HANDLE IS ON THE WAY.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the quality.  This stopped working just after the warranty period.</li>
            <li> My dentist and dental assistant  told me they have seen a big improvement in the appearance&lt;br /&gt;of my gums since I have been using the Philips Sonicare. I can also feel the difference and that it good.</li>
            <li> I replaced my dead old Sonicare with this and I love the new design. You don&#x27;t get all the mold around the base of the brush head and I love the sanitizer feature.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it! I get great check ups from my dentist after using this.  I wish the replacement brushes did not cost an arm and a leg, but if guess it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years and have always been very satisfied. I replaced my old Elite with this toothbrush and love it. The Flexcare, I think, does a much better job of cleaning. I also like have the sanitizer attached. Even though I had a separate sanitizer, this one is just more user friendly. It also helps that my dentist recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The cleaning quality is amazing: way better than any other electric toothbrush I have had before. But it broke in about 10 month. That is extremely disappointing, especially for the price. I never let it fall. It short-circuited. I am guessing water entered into it. It lit up like a Christmas tree, with all the led lights circling through. I turned it off and was never able to turn it on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the cleaning is so amazing, I decided to give Philips a second chance and just bought another sonicare (a different model). But this is the second and last chance. Clearly, at this price, they need to last much longer.</li>
            <li> This is the third sonicare I have bought and the only thing i do not understand is why the unit gets so dirty with use........</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was purchased about 6 months ago. I didn&#x27;t open and start using it until the past 3 months and the charger has stopped charging completely. After 3 months!</li>
            <li> My wife was getting sick of the goo that accumulates in the other screw-top version of the Sonicare that we used to have.  She loves this one.  The timers and massage settings are cool.  It made me a hit at Christmas, so A+!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush hands down. Be careful pulling the heads off or you will bust the toothbrush head. Mine was out of warranty and it still works just makes crazy noises. Dentist noticed a difference after 6months. Had to buy a new one but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> By far this is the the best motorized toothbrush. Bought this for my wife for Christmas and it she says it works great, better than any other motorized toothbrush she ever had before. Long battery life and caring case makes it great for traveling. The heads detach and re-attach easily for cleaning in the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist, this is the best price around!  This truly does make a big difference in controlling tarter buildup as well as gum care.  Well worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Phillips Sonicare unit (HX6932/30) A few weeks ago. It replaces another brand hat was purchased through my dentist. It used round revolving brush heads. I had trouble with it almost from the start. Battery not keeping charge, brushes wearing out quickly were a couple of reason I decided to try the Phillips Sonicare. I have been using the Sonicare for a few weeks and I love it.  It has features that I didn&#x27;t have before. The brush is shaped similar to a regular tooth brush and will last much longer than the round unit that I had experienced. One of the greatest feature is the built in timer. The unit alerts you every 30 seconds with a millisecond pause. After the forth 30-second interval, the unit automatically turns itself off. The instructions recommends brushing the upper and lower teeth (inside and outside) for 30 seconds each side. With this feature you don&#x27;t have to guess when your 30 seconds are up. I highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> I have owned the oral brushes before and I think this is by far the best.  I like the charging station and everything that comes with it.  The UV sanitizer is pretty neat even though I don&#x27;t use it that often.  Its a cool idea to know that you killed any bacteria that might be on it.  My first time using this it did feel a bit wierd, but my teeth and gums definetly felt much cleaner then any brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  After using it for two years and going back to the dentist, she commented that she noticed less plaque and tartar than I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me all of these years to finally try an electric toothbrush!!! I&#x27;m so pleased with this product. Since this is my first, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with, but this Philips model has been fab!  My only complaint is that the travel charger does not fit in the small travel bag.  The UV cleaner is easy to use. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The sonic action seems to clean my teeth and gums better than standard powered tooth brushes.  I like the sanitizer function which helps keep the brushes clean. The timer function helps me keep a thorough brushing regimen on all four quadrants of my mouth so I pay better attention to getting all my teeth clean.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers. This toothbrush is simply too expensive for an item that is likely to break after 2 years.  I most recently had a $169 dollar Clean and White one and it seems to me that it was finished before the two years was up.  My first Sonicare lasted a lot longer than that.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay that price again - It wasn&#x27;t worth it because I could never figure out how to use the clean and white feature AND pause the machine as well which I like to do in the middle of brushing. So I decided to cheap out.  I tried the new power up one which is less than $40, but I couldn&#x27;t believe how terrible it was.  It vibrated like CRAZY (and doesn&#x27;t have a timer either)!  Because I have dizziness issues relating to a concussion from several years ago I couldn&#x27;t use it.  The vibrations made me feel dizzy and sick. So I used my son&#x27;s toothbrush (with my own head of course :P) and it was perfect. It cost $64.  The next level up here cost $89.  Why spend the extra?</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews here probably come from people who recently got a Sonicare and are reporting on its performance initially. I am reviewing this as an owner since April 2009, however, because the real disappointment with the product came much later in my ownership. Namely: in the last week, it stopped vibrating correctly, due to cracking around the base of the rod the brush heads attach to. I didn&#x27;t go around beating the brush against things for air drum routines, or brush my teeth every two hours. This breakdown is based on probably using the brush 10-15 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same thing actually happened sometime during the first year of ownership (possibly the first few months?), when the brush handle was still under warranty. They promptly sent me a replacement handle at the time, which means this replacement handle has broken down in less than 32 months. For how much these toothbrushes cost, I find that pretty disappointing. AND, my now-defunct brush handle was at least assembled in the United States, which I would expect to be a slightly better-quality job. My housemate&#x27;s slightly newer brush was manufactured in China -- a possible loss in quality, and definitely a loss in U.S. jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, Philips has decent customer service, and they readily offer coupons and discounts for a replacement purchase, but I was frustrated to learn only at the point of its breakdown that the expected life of the brush is 3-5 years. That would be one thing if they had a good take-back program and/or manufactured the brushes so all parts are recyclable. However, you can only recycle the battery from what I was told on the phone. The rest goes into the landfill. Considering the folks at Preserve make COMPLETELY recyclable toothbrushes (albeit no electric models that I know of), and take back their used brushes, I find this a rather lousy product design for something you have to replace so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real good news is that you can buy replacement bases sans sanitizer for less than the combined unit -- and if you call customer service, they&#x27;ll probably give you free brush heads or a coupon for replacing your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the brush handle breaks, however, you will definitely get a good clean, and without the potential damage to your gums that stiff-brush manual toothbrushes could cause. I just didn&#x27;t expect something like this to have such a short lifespan.acement bases sans sanitizer for less than the combined unit -- and if you call customer service, they&#x27;ll probably give you free brush heads or a coupon for replacing your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the brush handle breaks, however, you will definitely get a good clean, and without the potential damage to your gums that stiff-brush manual toothbrushes could cause. I just didn&#x27;t expect something like this to have such a short lifespan.</li>
            <li> The fist time I used this toothbrush, I thought my teeth were going to fall out of my gums. Even though the brush has a setting that helps you \\&quot;step up\\&quot; to the regular setting, it&#x27;s still pretty rough if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial getting-used-to-it part, I can honestly say my teeth have never felt cleaner - ever! My teeth have also become and stayed a few shades whiter. My dentist asked me when my last cleaning was, and when I said \\&quot;last year\\&quot;, he asked me what I was doing to keep my teeth so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single charge on this toothbrush with regular use will last you about two weeks. I&#x27;ve only had to go without it once and a manual toothbrush is NO COMPARISON - my teeth felt so dirty and filmy and I would never want to go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 4/5 stars because the replacement heads are expensive, and the generic ones - well don&#x27;t even waste your money on those. The brush heads will run you about $12 every 3-ish months and the price is only going up. Oh, and the \\&quot;color indication\\&quot; on the toothbrush head is utterly useless. If you got a new head every time the color faded, you would be replacing them every 2 - 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the sanitizer regularly and have not had a problem with it. There&#x27;s no way I can prove whether it works or not to sanitize, but it sure makes me feel good. I haven&#x27;t had to replace the bulb yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, GREAT PRODUCT - if you can afford the expensive brush head replacements (sold in denominations of 3 and up - that&#x27;s about $36 up front!) you should get this toothbrush. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  If you like the way your teeth feel after the dentist cleaning, buy this toothbrush to get the same cleanliness and feel!  Also, when you got back to the dentist if you hate the plaque scrapping you will not have to endure what you did before you bought this brush.</li>
            <li> Broke after 26 months. Doesn&#x27;t charge, doesn&#x27;t brush. Warranty lasts 24 months. Don&#x27;t buy. Would have saved $90 over the same time period if I used regular toothbrushes instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also UV light is a scam and hella dumb. Your mouth is filthy already, UV light isn&#x27;t doing anything worthwhile.</li>
            <li> This has been a great toothbrush!  However - while I do not know how long a $170 electric toothbrush should last - I was hoping it would be longer due to the expense.  We purchased this toothbrush and it lasted 3 years with two people using it.  $57/year plus the cost of very (VERY) expensive brush heads seems high, although this may be normal.  I rated it as a three star for quality, as I Googled a description of how it broke and it seems as if it&#x27;s actually designed to break in a certain spot.  It seems highly coincidental that they break in the same exact spot, in the same exact pattern on the same internal piece.  Some folks had it break after two weeks, others after two years.  It does come with a warranty.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great electric toothbrush, this is definitely a good one but be mindful of its lifespan.  I don&#x27;t have another one with which to compare longevity but hopefully it is lasting a good while for others.  If I could rate it separately for quality and effectiveness, it would be a three and a five, respectively.</li>
            <li> This replaces a first generation Sonicare. It has features I probably won&#x27;t use but I like the brush sterilizer feature and the separate travel recharger stand which I keep in my trailer.It does a great job cleaning my teeth, my dentist even noticed. I highly recommend this or any power toothbrush. They are more thorough than most people will do by hand.</li>
            <li> We have beening using Sonicare since it&#x27;s conception. All of our grown children and grandchildren are also brushing theri teeth with thie particular model. Makes a great gift</li>
            <li> This is a top rated electric toothbrush (Consumer Reports online).  Also recommended by my dentist.  Also per my dentist, I never use toothpaste with this product as it clogs it up.  I rinse with a fluoride mouth wash after using this.</li>
            <li> After my simple Philips Sonicare died after 4 years I got this more fancy one. This particular Sonicare cleans as good as the old one, the battery lasts longer, there is no more muck underneath the brush with the new brush design, however the button to choose different programs is really in the wrong place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I brush my teeth I inadvertently push this button a few times because that is where you have to hold the brush for maximum results. Then I have to push a few times again to return to the right program. Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wished I had bought the simpler model with just the on and off button.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended I switch to an electric toothbrush because I brush too hard and it was affecting my gums. I had an electric toothbrush when I was younger and I never really like electric toothbrushes. This thing is actually pretty sweet. Just kick back and let the toothbrush do all the work! I still use my regular toothbrush to brush my tongue after brushing with this thing.</li>
            <li> This thing is the truth!!!! Definitely feels like you went to the dentist every time I use it. Fresher breathe and whiter teeth.....mouth just feels a lot cleaner</li>
            <li> Works great, I like the max clean setting for three min. I have not used to UV cleaning system but im sure it works great as well</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush.  However, the bulb for the sanitizer is almost impossible to replace once it wears out, which in my case was right after the warranty expired.  Not only was it extremely difficult to figure out where to order a new bulb, but then it took literally 4 months for the bulb to be received as it was backordered.  Phillips does not offer helpful customer service. Four months of no sanitizing pretty much makes the machine pointless.</li>
            <li> After a bunch of research I bought the HX6932 and both my wife and I love it.  It is a better replacement for our similar, but discontinued, Braun.  The replacement heads are more expensive.  I like the UV cleaning station, and appreciate the extra travel charger.</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten rid of my old one long ago!  Using this new one is really heaven!&lt;br /&gt;After a recent trip to the dentist i learned my current toothbrush was not getting&lt;br /&gt;my teeth completely clean.  My way was clear!  Amazon online and it was here&lt;br /&gt;before I knew it. I&#x27;m so happy, because a sparkling smile is important to me.</li>
            <li> I have an older model Sonicare, which works perfectly still, but this toothbrush is great!  I bought this for my fiance and she loves it.  I&#x27;m able to use this toothbrush easily because of the easy on/off of the toothbrush head and the UV sanitizer.  Great travel pack and so far great battery life.  We accidentally hit the on button leaving Lake Tahoe and when we arrived home 3 hrs later it was still on and ready for use.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Our old sonicare had it&#x27;s last and we decided to go for the upgrade with the UV sanitizer.  It was so quiet and the head stayed so much cleaner than the older version, though it was always a little hard to get the heads off between brushes.  Suddenly about 8 months in it started making some crazy clunking sounds.  Finally, about a week or two after the sounds started, the thing just stopped working as a toothbrush and became a clunky sound machine.  I definitely do not recommend buying this product and am considering going back to the older screw top model.</li>
            <li> I purchased my last Sonicare toothbrush in 2004, so it lasted 8 years.  I just purchased this model, and was looking forward to an upgrade.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m disappointed.  It does not feel as sturdy as the last one.  Also, the last one generated the ultrasonic vibrations in the head (the brush attachment) through a coil in the handset and a powerful magnet in the brush attachment. You didn&#x27;t feel the vibration in the handset nearly like you do in this model. This model seems to generate all the vibrations in the handset, which are merely transferred TO the brush attachment, instead of being generated IN the base of the attachment itself.  This item does not look or feel nearly as rugged or as waterproof as the original.  Consumer Reports gave it a good rating, but the quality is just not there.  I don&#x27;t mind paying for quality. Please give me quality, Sonicare! I don&#x27;t want cheap junk made in China, and if that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to get from Phillips, it&#x27;s time to move on to another company once this one dies.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been recommending me to get one for years and I finally did it! Great clean - numerous cycles to choose from and I am glad I took the plunge!  I have not used the sanitizer yet, so I cant comment on that.  Charge holds for me just shy of two weeks and the charger is small, its not the large piece shown here, just a small piece for the bottom that the brush sets on and plugs in.</li>
            <li> When you think about how far we have come from not brushing teeth to brushing teeth &#x27;manually&#x27; to brushing teeth with an actual space ship, you wil understand what this toothbrush does for you. I fell in love with it and I also bought the kiddie version for my 4 year old. Sometimes people get a bad product but they should always keep in mind that a lemon can be replaced, it&#x27;s the idea behind the product that is briliant and it works. My dentist can&#x27;t believe how little plaque buildup I have when I go for cleaning. Both of us attribute it to this great product. Don&#x27;t hesitate, make your teeth and mouth happy.</li>
            <li> Good product haven&#x27;t had it three months yet and already the head is worn don&#x27;t know if its me with to much pressure or what but the new heads aren&#x27;t cheap but I like the product with the timer on it you definitely spend the right amount of time brushing I recommend it</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush. The first one lasted about 3 years before the brush heads would no longer stay attached to the charger. It&#x27;s easy to buy replacement brush heads, and that is a big plus. After a while the charger gets worn down, and the heads fall off. The new one works as well, but I have noticed it&#x27;s harder to get the brush heads off when you finish brushing. You have to really pull! That would be ok, but they also become loose and fall off sooner than the old ones did. I still like it but it could be a little more user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BROKEN after 9 months of use! The brush heads will no longer stay attached to the toothbrush. This is a very expensive toothbrush to buy that will last less than a year. Clearly it&#x27;s not made as well as the previous models. I will not buy this brand again. Spend your money on a better product, this one is definitely not worth the $150.00!</li>
            <li> I just wore out my second one of these.  The first one fell apart after 26 months (24 months is the warranty).  I bought another and it just fell apart today after 26 months.  As far as cleaning, it is the best, and has improved my dental health significantly over regular toothbrushes.  But they just don&#x27;t last, and tend to fail just after the warranty expires.  At least that&#x27;s been my experience with two of them now.  I&#x27;m not hard on it, using it only once a day, so we&#x27;ll say it has a lifespan of about 800 brushings.  Let&#x27;s see:  That&#x27;s still only $.14 per brushing, so I guess it&#x27;s worth what it&#x27;s saved me at the dentist.  I give it five stars for cleaning and only 3 for reliability and longevity.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush back in August of 2011. The clean you get after using it is great! However I&#x27;ve only had it for a little over a year and had to warranty it twice with philips; im giving this three stars because although i had to replace the Toothbrush twice already philips did it very quickly without any hassle at all. I&#x27;m probably gonna stick with this company when my toothbrush finally gives out again and the warranty is out but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this model as i&#x27;ve read the other reviews and it seems i am not the only one whose having the problem of having to warranty their toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This the second sonicare I&#x27;ve owned and I love it. My first one finally gave out after 5 years and I went without for a while because this model is soooo expensive to me.  While waiting for it to go on sale I used a regular brush, yuck!  My mouth just wasn&#x27;t as clean.  You will not make a bad purchase with this product!</li>
            <li> After only one charging cycle it failed.  The customer service department was not surprised and within a minute said they will send me a new one without troubleshooting.  So it seems they either work or don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s good when it works though. If it happens to you I would return it through amazon and get a new one.</li>
            <li> This model replaced my old Sonicare and it is a big improvement. It is easy to use and clean.The Sanitizer works very well and I love how my teeth feel after brushing. I tend to brush longer and enjoy it more.</li>
            <li> Purchased this expensive unit about one year ago.&lt;br /&gt;It quick working after about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Sonic Care and they asked me to send in my unit for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Got the new unit after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It runs OK but has developed an odd \\&quot;delamination\\&quot; problem.&lt;br /&gt;The skin of the handle is peeling like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Customer Service again and they informed me that Sonic Care does not consider this a defect and refused to replace the handle.&lt;br /&gt;Sent an email to their corporate offices and received no reply.&lt;br /&gt;Except for the poorly placed buttons (which you inadvertently hit while holding the handle), this one seems to be still working so far...&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m getting flakes of silicone all over the inside of the medicine cabinet. (another thing to clean)&lt;br /&gt;I can not recommend Sonic Care products until these issues are resolved.&lt;br /&gt;Philips is destroying their reputation to save a few bucks on their warranty costs.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, because my dentist thinks this has improved my oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up:&lt;br /&gt;The handle has now completely failed, something is disconnected inside the handle and it is very noisy. sonicare says I&#x27;m out of warranty and it can&#x27;t be repaired.&lt;br /&gt;Assuming they are lying, I checked Ebay and quickly found a vendor who repairs these items.&lt;br /&gt;Their turn around was fairly quick and they gave me a clear understanding of the repairs required.&lt;br /&gt;Also their prices for parts were very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;My \\&quot;unrepairable\\&quot; handle is good as new for well under $20 including parts labor and shipping!&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t purchased one yet, move on, although I checked Oral B and their warranty is also a short (for the price) two years!&lt;br /&gt;When this handle fails in another two years, I&#x27;m going to send it back to be repaired again as I refuse to give anymore money tp Philips Sonicare with their poor customer service.</li>
