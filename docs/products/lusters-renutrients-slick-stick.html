            <li>I am recently natural and I often wear my shoulder length hair in updos and this product does wonders keeping my temples and nape smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for offering this on your site because I&#x27;m no longer able to find it in my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>when I first tried it, I thought it worked wonders till the end of the day</li>

            <li>Works great on my daughters tight curls along with a flat iron.  </li>

            <li> However, a little goes a long way with this product, if you use too much it starts to buildup.</li>
            <li> It last a long time</li>
            <li> It works really well in keeping the whispies of hair down, and they stay down the entire day for me.</li>
            <li> I am black with natural hair).</li>
            <li> I like the size much larger than I expected</li>
            <li> None of these products will provide all day smooth edges, especially if you have frizzy hair like I do, but at least the other options dont cause product buildup like this slick stick.</li>
            <li> It doesnt dry out like a gel may do.</li>
            <li> This also created serious product buildup on my scalp, FAST</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the real brand or not because it don&#x27;t lay- my edges down as expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold my edges down at all and it leaves a white residue on my hair</li>
            <li> it actually laid my hair down.</li>
            <li> my hair had a white residue on the edges, It does stick the edges down but not the way I would lik it too</li>
            <li> and it left my edges looking a little dry.  </li>
            <li> Not what i expected.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair and when I initially apply the product it does lay my hair down however after like 20 min my hair was no longer laid down.</li>
            <li> My edges were slick, but it did not last all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently transitioning and I&#x27;m having the HARDEST time finding a product that will really slick my edges down..</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking white and flaky as well as it does not hold or truly slick edges down</li>
            <li> I am Black with wavy coarse thick texture hair.</li>
            <li> But the slick stick has extra weight to it that seems to tame the hair for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> will give to my nieces eco styler gels work a lot beter for me and cost less too.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> holds down small hairs in front or sides.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I am a bit of a product junkie when it comes to products that claim to slick down edges.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the slick stick for a few years now</li>
            <li> I can say that the build up is thick if u use it everyday..</li>
            <li> The Slick Stick helps to keep my hair neat after putting on and removing my headgear.  </li>
            <li> I will use this when I&#x27;m in between hard of edge control gel</li>
            <li> I hate to see hair flying lose from under the headgear, thus I have shared this product with countless ladies.</li>
            <li> Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry...</li>
            <li> Sad to say this product did not do that for me.</li>
            <li> I was unable to continue using this.</li>

            <li> holds down small hairs in front or sides. like it!! it is not greasy and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Thank you Lusters for thinking of this.    I am recently natural and I often wear my shoulder length hair in updos and this product does wonders keeping my temples and nape smooth.  Thank you Amazon for offering this on your site because I&#x27;m no longer able to find it in my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected. more like a thick hair grease</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and adds sheen.  It has a nice light scent.  Works great on my daughters tight curls along with a flat iron.  It last a long time and I believe I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t hold my edges down at all and it leaves a white residue on my hair</li>
            <li> Works great. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this products keeps, my medium length, course, thick hair laid down.  The avocado and coconut scent is wonderful.  Buy this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great!! The only few times I&#x27;ve used it, because I have big chopped my hair, it worked perfectly, my hair was smooth and manageable. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great buy. I used Tigi Bed Hair stick before and was sceptic about it but it&#x27;s agreat buy!!! I returned to buy 2 more!!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my short hair cut looking great all day and evening. Even after vigorous exercise, my hair looked great. I am a woman with a very short boyish cut and this product is the icing on the cake. It makes my hair look salon styled 24/7.  It holds without being greasy or sticky.  Adds a very nice sheen. I stumbled on this product by accident and and delighted with it.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product from my hairstylist, and because it works so well on my hair, I knew I had to buy my own to keep at the house when I am styling my hair on my own. It works really well in keeping the whispies of hair down, and they stay down the entire day for me. I am Black with wavy coarse thick texture hair.</li>
            <li> Im surprised this product didn&#x27;t have more reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using the slick stick for a few years now and I must say I am hooked!!  I generally keep my hair cut short and this product helps to maintain my edges.  Not sure what I did without it...much better than gel and it smells good too.  Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry...</li>
            <li> My hair is unrelaxed, and this stick did NOTHING for me. I prefer ORS(organic root stimulator) it actually laid my hair down.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I had seen a review about a wax stick on youtube and decided to buy it at my local BSS. This stick really lays down fly aways (hair) and lasts all day. However, a little goes a long way with this product, if you use too much it starts to buildup. Other that that it&#x27;s a great product, and was cheaper online.</li>
            <li> I am natural and this stick is perfect for me.. I can say that the build up is thick if u use it everyday.. but I just use it about 3 times a week.. and if u get sew ins and dont wanna keep putting heat on your edges or leave it.. then this is perfect for u!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently transitioning and I&#x27;m having the HARDEST time finding a product that will really slick my edges down.. Sad to say this product did not do that for me. It&#x27;s very greasy and it leaves a white residue on my hair... Waste of money</li>
            <li> Good product. Didn&#x27;t have gummy build up in hair. Kept hair in place. Left hair with a shine. My daughter liked it also.</li>
            <li> found other products that work better.  will give to my nieces eco styler gels work a lot beter for me and cost less too.</li>
            <li> Works great! Especially on cowlicks!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me! It leaves my hair looking white and flaky as well as it does not hold or truly slick edges down</li>
            <li> great product only fault is that it can cause alot of bulid up if you use it everyday other than that its great</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the real brand or not because it don&#x27;t lay- my edges down as expected.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! love the smell. will rebuy it</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Shipping was great too!! Thank you</li>
            <li> For me, Theres something about the consistency this wax stick that i like better than gel. I do love my Argan oil eco styler gel. But the slick stick has extra weight to it that seems to tame the hair for a longer period of time. Great for portability and travel. Easy to touch up throughout the day or if you&#x27;re concerned about buildup, you can use water and a brush back over it. It doesnt dry out like a gel may do. Sad that you dont see this stores as much anymore, then more ppl would know about it. But beyond happy i can still order online &lt;3</li>
            <li> when I first tried it, I thought it worked wonders till the end of the day wen my hair had a white residue on the edges, It does stick the edges down but not the way I would lik it too</li>
            <li> Great product  and it has a great smell. I use it to blend my leave out when I do my sew ins</li>
            <li> I tried to love this product.  I am currently transitioning and I must admit that I am a bit of a product junkie when it comes to products that claim to slick down edges.  I tried this product along with a scarf for optimum &#x27;slickness&#x27;.  My edges were slick, but it did not last all day.  This also created serious product buildup on my scalp, FAST and it left my edges looking a little dry.  A much better option is Organic Root Stimulator Edge Control, or some Eco Styler gel along with a scarf.  None of these products will provide all day smooth edges, especially if you have frizzy hair like I do, but at least the other options dont cause product buildup like this slick stick.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I highly recommend it. It makes your hair look silky, shiney, and smoothe. My pretty niece Alexas hair looked beautiful when she applied it onto her hair that&#x27;s what made me buy it.</li>
            <li> Great product but not the best. I have 4c hair and when I initially apply the product it does lay my hair down however after like 20 min my hair was no longer laid down. Would prob work better with a gel or hold product. However I would still recommend.</li>
            <li> Did the job, thank you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I received it on time.</li>
            <li> Great product! I loved it</li>
            <li> I like the size much larger than I expected but it leave a white residue that hard to get out of your hair though it smells great and gives a decent holds for edges but I prefer my edge control gel for sure I will use this when I&#x27;m in between hard of edge control gel maybe if you use a oil or leave in before applying this product you may not get that residue but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet</li>
            <li> I still have this product and occasionally use it. I think you will have varying results depending on your hair type. I have course hair around the edge of my hair line (like 4b/4c...I am black with natural hair). It did an ok job of smoothing my hair but it wasnt a very stong hold if that is what you are looking for...also you should use this in moderation becausse it give your hair a dull look if you use too much of it (product builds up quickly). I still used it every now and then because I paid for it...its one of those products that you will have to see for yourself how it works for you.</li>
            <li> I am an active duty military member who has pretty long hair and must wear ponytails when in uniform.  The Slick Stick helps to keep my hair neat after putting on and removing my headgear.  I hate to see hair flying lose from under the headgear, thus I have shared this product with countless ladies.</li>
            <li> This stick is too greasy..If you wearing hair extentions..NOT GOOD! Hair extentions becames gooey and greasy..looks unnatural and that  VIOLATION!</li>
            <li> Does not slick down edges as I would have liked and causes white flakes. I was unable to continue using this. There are better products out there. I would not recommend this particular edge control product.</li>
