            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing brush</li>
            <li>The bristles do not fall out, which is nice...</li>
            <li>After applying liquid foundation for a week I cleaned the brush using baby shampoo and warm water.</li>
            <li>My foundation still applies nicely (reason I gave it 3 star)</li>
            <li>I am going to be completely honest here.</li>
            <li>well its an okay brush its really good for foundation but and powder</li>
            <li>Nice brush.</li>
            <li>I liked the dewy look i achieved but this is not what i need.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, very good price!</li>
            <li>I love that the hairs on this brush don&#x27;t come off and stick to your skin like some do as I&#x27;ve experienced before with cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>It blends easily with superior coverage compared to this one.</li>
            <li>very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much!!!!!</li>
            <li>I received an email after I received it to make sure I got it and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Out of the many foundation brushes I own I grab this one.</li>
            <li>best buy by far</li>
            <li>It is soft and spreads mousse foundation perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly, came as expected, great customer service :)</li>
            <li>I love how this blends everything together so nicely.</li>
            <li>Love live love this brush!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The bristles are not tightly attached so it doesn&#x27;t give me that flawless airbrushed look that the sigma f80 does.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to wash!</li>
            <li>Product was received very quickly!</li>

            <li>I love this make up brush, my foundation goes on so smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely soft and provides great coverage without the  streaking brush stroke lines that sum foundation brushes cause.</li>
            <li>Before using it for the first time, it&#x27;s best recommended to give it a bit of a rinse under warm water and let dry.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t this one is more than half the price and just as good perhaps better.  </li>
            <li>This brush is amazing so far there has been no shedding works better than my sigma F80</li>
            <li>The reviews are accurate.  </li>
            <li>I love quality products, and this one is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>the brush is great when I used it with my foundation, it left no lines..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously fantastic.</li>
            <li>thanks.is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It does the job fabulously.</li>
            <li>I love it so worth the price i use it every day</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I dot the foundation around my face and use this brush in  light circular motions to spread the foundation.</li>
            <li>and I believe it keeps me from wasting my foundation with the light</li>
            <li>i thought it was going to be a cheap made brush but its not.</li>
            <li>It is the first foundation brush I&#x27;ve purchased like this type,so I have no others to compare it to,but it gives me a nice full coverage that I was looking for without being cakey.</li>
            <li>I am sure they will love it as much as i do.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft, feels really good on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and works really good.  </li>
            <li>While the brush itself is pretty nice, the handle fell off within the first use!</li>
            <li>This is a great flat brush for all makeup enthusiasts!</li>
            <li>However, this brush has made it super easy to contour.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even as a novice, using this brush was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I would totally buy this again, it is a lot better than most of the over priced saphora brushes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly how it is described and applies foundation better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>Results in more of a natural look (very smooth, no steaks).  </li>
            <li>and I just love how soft and smooth it glides on the skin!</li>
            <li>I do clean it weekly.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of super glue fixed the issue and the brush works beautifully now, but that wasn&#x27;t a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>anyway, the brush works great for my purpose, to apply loose powder.</li>
            <li>Price is right too!</li>
            <li>I use this with a full coverage liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Actually it makes a good finger grip.</li>
            <li>Good quality I totally recomended.</li>
            <li>It has a large surface to cover more area quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to work with liquid foundation, and it feel very soft.</li>
            <li>and I stumbled across this one and let me tell you, it is seriously the best at blending out foundation.</li>
            <li>I  love the soft texture it has, I  used it with a liquid foundation and the application was so smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Now I have to order some super glue via Prime...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very neat and easy to clean</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used a makeup brush and must say it does a fantastic job...leaves no streaks...</li>
            <li>Love how it&#x27;s a flat top</li>
            <li>I love this new brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my new brush.</li>
            <li>No fall out from the brush, pretty darn durable!</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean, and has lost no bristles after several cleanings.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the brush feels,very soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>Great brush with extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t clean very well.</li>
            <li>It is soft and leaves your foundation looking pretty smooth and even on your skin!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soft and easily distributes foundation in the face without a trace or marks, 100% recommended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this brush works fine to pick up loose powder if that&#x27;s what you use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pleased with this brush and will be ordering a second.</li>
            <li>I use this for my foundation and find the little stiffer bristles perfect for filling the crevices around my nose...and overall face.  </li>
            <li>Smooth finish achieved with this brush, very soft.  </li>
            <li>I  own a lot of brushes both high end and moderately priced.</li>
            <li>I remember when I first got it...</li>
            <li>Used the brush for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely order more brushes from this line.</li>
            <li>Its so soft, it applies my makeup so smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>First time trying a brush instead of sponge.  </li>
            <li>I have paid way more for brushes and brush sets and this stands above them all.  </li>
            <li>NICE, IT WAS WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>The Dragon pad is smaller more compact,dense bristles and gives a fuller coverage.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and would definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li>I use this brush to lightly buff my face after applying foundation &amp; blush to blend everything together &amp; give a natural appearance &amp; glow.</li>
            <li>Pay heed, and switch back to a liquid foundation..... if you value having healthy lungs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty dense brush</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a flat top kabuki brush using liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>This brush seems like an exact dupe of the Sigma F80 Flat Kubuki, which is my favorite foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush because a flat top brush was recommended by my aesthetician to use with my Glo Minerals powder.  </li>
            <li>Helped me achieve an airbrushed look and helped me cover my acne better then any flat brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Women who have more mature or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Spreads make up evenly, and it&#x27;s super soft!</li>
            <li>Super soft too!</li>
            <li>It is the best brush I bought is super soft even though it is synthetic and not let me stripped when i apply the base, I love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and full, it&#x27;s a dream to apply make up with this brush</li>
            <li>Super soft too.</li>
            <li>The brush head fell off and I had to super glue it back on, but other than that I love it!  </li>
            <li>It has great texture, not too soft and not too hard.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I have never used a brush to apply my foundation but this brush makes appling it so much easier.</li>
            <li>Would cost too much to return and exchange</li>
            <li>Blends the foundation very well</li>
            <li>, I use it now all the time since it helps me apply foundation much easier now.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality, it broke the same day I got it!</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li>Very please with product.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>SOO soft and honestly worth the money.  </li>
            <li>so much its changed my life</li>
            <li>Got it fast too.</li>
            <li>Since it is synthetic, it doesn&#x27;t use too much product.</li>
            <li>, It really excelled my expectations.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Love how it give, such a natural look, after applying my foundation.</li>
            <li>I love the big brush that&#x27;s compact with lots of soft bristles.</li>
            <li>So much better priced than other high end brushes like Sigma.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft yet firm enough to provide a great application.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I ever use with foundation, and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>It is superrr soft and at first it had a marker smell</li>
            <li>I really, really love this brush and will never use any other!</li>
            <li>should consider a better quality brush with less impact.</li>
            <li>Way better than the previous Mac one I used.</li>
            <li>Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more expensive brand-name brushes and they do better job covering details than this brush.</li>
            <li>However for the price I paid, this brush does a decent job.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a decently priced kabuki brush and this is it.  </li>
            <li>Soft on sensitive skin and easy to use, this brush blends my foundations evenly making my makeup look natural and soft.</li>
            <li>This one is decent.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the high priced brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;People need to understand that cheap brushes will drag on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad i took a chance with this,thinking of a gifting these to a few people.</li>
            <li>The brush is a normal size</li>
            <li>I did think it was going to be more firm</li>
            <li>I used a regular powder brush which, instantly, stirred up the powder and worked fine.</li>
            <li>I have never used brushes for my make up and after using this brush now I cant live without it.</li>
            <li>I will need to get a new one or a refund</li>
            <li>Very soft and well made brush.  </li>
            <li>The Kabuki brush is very soft on your face and it works for blending powder or foundation which is on the face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you girls have more experience with make-up than I do, but sometimes when I apply the foundation I still have to use my sponge after to smooth it out, since some streaks are left behind at times.</li>
            <li>:) Not sure if this helps or confuses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and durable!</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how soft the bristles were!</li>
            <li>You do not have to use more foundation on the brush if you are in a hurry  to leave , just use the brush and apply again ,.it has enough applied the previous day to use again .</li>
            <li>I love the short, tight bristles.</li>
            <li>My only drawback is that it could be a little more firmer.</li>
            <li>This one had very high ratings and was only about $12</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that my foundation completely rinses out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and does the job</li>
            <li>It is soft but I wouldn&#x27;t trust using it on my face</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and my makeup just glides on now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old school and have always used my fingertips or a sponge to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>The problem is that it is too soft and doesn&#x27;t loosen the powder up from a compact so it doesn&#x27;t pick up any powder.  </li>
            <li>Wow...  </li>
            <li>The brush is quite soft &amp; well made.</li>
            <li>Foundation glides on and looks like baby soft skin.  </li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t have any pieces falling out.  </li>
            <li>Feels soft (no irritation) and blends well.</li>
            <li>Wicked soft.</li>
            <li>and it applies just as good as the expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this brush due to all the reviews.</li>
            <li>This brush is much softer than Beauty Junkees&#x27; Flat Top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never got that info from other brushes I bought and the bristles are falling out, so I learned something useful.</li>
            <li>The brush was excellent for first use but after cleaning it, it has stiffened terribly.</li>
            <li>Arrived amazingly quick and is super-soft on the face (hard to find one that is truly gentle to the touch on the face, but this one is).  </li>
            <li>and he said that many other women were having similar problems after using a dry mineral foundation for a substantial amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Brush works really well, but it arrived broken..took so long to get to arrive</li>
            <li>The brush did exactly what I expected and hoped it would do.</li>
            <li>The density of the brush equates to heavy, full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am new to contouring and blending different shades of make up.</li>
            <li>i gave this brush a 4 star because the handle was loose but it wasn&#x27;t big deal because i just super glued it back.</li>
            <li>I apply less than half of the amount of liquid foundation I was using before, and getting better coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People that want a sheer and natural finish should avoid this brush.</li>
            <li>Wish I had bought the bare minerals brush I had meant to buy.</li>
            <li>Has big full fluffy bristles and my makeup has never gone on smoother.</li>
            <li>Sigma&#x27;s is 0.3cm longer and probably a little big better quality, but this is half the price of the Sigma.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and the bristles are short enough that they don&#x27;t spread all over the face.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this one was worth taking the time to do.  </li>
            <li>Pur minerals makes a liquid form that I like just as much as the powder type, and the Kabuki brush makes it look just as natural, if not more so.</li>

            <li> The bristles do not fall out, which is nice...</li>
            <li> After applying liquid foundation for a week I cleaned the brush using baby shampoo and warm water.</li>
            <li> My foundation still applies nicely (reason I gave it 3 star)</li>
            <li> I am going to be completely honest here.</li>
            <li> well its an okay brush its really good for foundation but and powder</li>
            <li> Nice brush.</li>
            <li> I liked the dewy look i achieved but this is not what i need.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, very good price!</li>
            <li> I love that the hairs on this brush don&#x27;t come off and stick to your skin like some do as I&#x27;ve experienced before with cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> It blends easily with superior coverage compared to this one.</li>
            <li> very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received an email after I received it to make sure I got it and liked it.  </li>
            <li> Out of the many foundation brushes I own I grab this one.</li>
            <li> best buy by far</li>
            <li> It is soft and spreads mousse foundation perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly, came as expected, great customer service :)</li>
            <li> I love how this blends everything together so nicely.</li>
            <li> Love live love this brush!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are not tightly attached so it doesn&#x27;t give me that flawless airbrushed look that the sigma f80 does.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to wash!</li>
            <li> Product was received very quickly!</li>
            <li> Easy to wash and doesn&#x27;t make you look cakey!</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush!</li>

            <li> The brush has a good heft to it and seems to be great quality, the bristles are super soft and feel really good against the skin.  </li>
            <li> Applies my Bare Escentuals liquid flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed especially since it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I love how it blends my foundation</li>

            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;may thoroughly pleased with the flawless blend of my foundation.</li>
            <li> I almost wish I had a reason to redo my makeup, but the finish with this brush was so nice as well, exactly the airbrush finish everyone says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also!</li>
            <li> I love this make up brush, my foundation goes on so smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely soft and provides great coverage without the  streaking brush stroke lines that sum foundation brushes cause.</li>
            <li> Before using it for the first time, it&#x27;s best recommended to give it a bit of a rinse under warm water and let dry.</li>
            <li> So far I love it!!</li>
            <li> Using this brush makes applying foundation easy.</li>
            <li> Never really thought that genuine and awesome products can make people happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just ok nothing special.</li>
            <li> First makeup brush to own so can&#x27;t compare to others, but works well.  </li>
            <li> used it for the first time today and the bristles felt so nice on my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so..so soft and full and works great.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super silky!</li>
            <li> great MU tool for wet and dry make up, perfect for creating that airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> They are very happy and say it&#x27;s super soft and is very even when applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Very soft and light brush that provides good smooth coverage</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t this one is more than half the price and just as good perhaps better.  </li>
            <li> This brush is amazing so far there has been no shedding works better than my sigma F80</li>
            <li> The reviews are accurate.  </li>
            <li> I love quality products, and this one is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> the brush is great when I used it with my foundation, it left no lines..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously fantastic.</li>
            <li> thanks.is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It does the job fabulously.</li>
            <li> I love it so worth the price i use it every day</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I dot the foundation around my face and use this brush in  light circular motions to spread the foundation.</li>
            <li> and I believe it keeps me from wasting my foundation with the light</li>
            <li> i thought it was going to be a cheap made brush but its not.</li>
            <li> It is the first foundation brush I&#x27;ve purchased like this type,so I have no others to compare it to,but it gives me a nice full coverage that I was looking for without being cakey.</li>
            <li> I am sure they will love it as much as i do.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft, feels really good on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and works really good.  </li>
            <li> While the brush itself is pretty nice, the handle fell off within the first use!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat brush for all makeup enthusiasts!</li>
            <li> However, this brush has made it super easy to contour.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even as a novice, using this brush was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> I would totally buy this again, it is a lot better than most of the over priced saphora brushes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly how it is described and applies foundation better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Results in more of a natural look (very smooth, no steaks).  </li>
            <li> and I just love how soft and smooth it glides on the skin!</li>
            <li> I do clean it weekly.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of super glue fixed the issue and the brush works beautifully now, but that wasn&#x27;t a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> anyway, the brush works great for my purpose, to apply loose powder.</li>
            <li> Price is right too!</li>
            <li> I use this with a full coverage liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Actually it makes a good finger grip.</li>
            <li> Good quality I totally recomended.</li>
            <li> It has a large surface to cover more area quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to work with liquid foundation, and it feel very soft.</li>
            <li> and I stumbled across this one and let me tell you, it is seriously the best at blending out foundation.</li>
            <li> I  love the soft texture it has, I  used it with a liquid foundation and the application was so smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Now I have to order some super glue via Prime...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very neat and easy to clean</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used a makeup brush and must say it does a fantastic job...leaves no streaks...</li>
            <li> Love how it&#x27;s a flat top</li>
            <li> I love this new brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new brush.</li>
            <li> No fall out from the brush, pretty darn durable!</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean, and has lost no bristles after several cleanings.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the brush feels,very soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> Great brush with extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t clean very well.</li>
            <li> It is soft and leaves your foundation looking pretty smooth and even on your skin!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very soft and easily distributes foundation in the face without a trace or marks, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this brush works fine to pick up loose powder if that&#x27;s what you use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased with this brush and will be ordering a second.</li>
            <li> I use this for my foundation and find the little stiffer bristles perfect for filling the crevices around my nose...and overall face.  </li>
            <li> Smooth finish achieved with this brush, very soft.  </li>
            <li> I  own a lot of brushes both high end and moderately priced.</li>
            <li> I remember when I first got it...</li>
            <li> Used the brush for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely order more brushes from this line.</li>
            <li> Its so soft, it applies my makeup so smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> First time trying a brush instead of sponge.  </li>
            <li> I have paid way more for brushes and brush sets and this stands above them all.  </li>
            <li> NICE, IT WAS WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> The Dragon pad is smaller more compact,dense bristles and gives a fuller coverage.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and would definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to lightly buff my face after applying foundation &amp; blush to blend everything together &amp; give a natural appearance &amp; glow.</li>
            <li> Pay heed, and switch back to a liquid foundation..... if you value having healthy lungs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty dense brush</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a flat top kabuki brush using liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> This brush seems like an exact dupe of the Sigma F80 Flat Kubuki, which is my favorite foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because a flat top brush was recommended by my aesthetician to use with my Glo Minerals powder.  </li>
            <li> Helped me achieve an airbrushed look and helped me cover my acne better then any flat brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Women who have more mature or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Spreads make up evenly, and it&#x27;s super soft!</li>
            <li> Super soft too!</li>
            <li> It is the best brush I bought is super soft even though it is synthetic and not let me stripped when i apply the base, I love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and full, it&#x27;s a dream to apply make up with this brush</li>
            <li> Super soft too.</li>
            <li> The brush head fell off and I had to super glue it back on, but other than that I love it!  </li>
            <li> It has great texture, not too soft and not too hard.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I have never used a brush to apply my foundation but this brush makes appling it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Would cost too much to return and exchange</li>
            <li> Blends the foundation very well</li>
            <li> , I use it now all the time since it helps me apply foundation much easier now.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, it broke the same day I got it!</li>
            <li> Thanks..</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li> Very please with product.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> SOO soft and honestly worth the money.  </li>
            <li> so much its changed my life</li>
            <li> Got it fast too.</li>
            <li> Since it is synthetic, it doesn&#x27;t use too much product.</li>
            <li> , It really excelled my expectations.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love how it give, such a natural look, after applying my foundation.</li>
            <li> I love the big brush that&#x27;s compact with lots of soft bristles.</li>
            <li> So much better priced than other high end brushes like Sigma.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft yet firm enough to provide a great application.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I ever use with foundation, and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> It is superrr soft and at first it had a marker smell</li>
            <li> I really, really love this brush and will never use any other!</li>
            <li> should consider a better quality brush with less impact.</li>
            <li> Way better than the previous Mac one I used.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive brand-name brushes and they do better job covering details than this brush.</li>
            <li> However for the price I paid, this brush does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a decently priced kabuki brush and this is it.  </li>
            <li> Soft on sensitive skin and easy to use, this brush blends my foundations evenly making my makeup look natural and soft.</li>
            <li> This one is decent.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the high priced brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;People need to understand that cheap brushes will drag on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad i took a chance with this,thinking of a gifting these to a few people.</li>
            <li> The brush is a normal size</li>
            <li> I did think it was going to be more firm</li>
            <li> I used a regular powder brush which, instantly, stirred up the powder and worked fine.</li>
            <li> I have never used brushes for my make up and after using this brush now I cant live without it.</li>
            <li> I will need to get a new one or a refund</li>
            <li> Very soft and well made brush.  </li>
            <li> The Kabuki brush is very soft on your face and it works for blending powder or foundation which is on the face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you girls have more experience with make-up than I do, but sometimes when I apply the foundation I still have to use my sponge after to smooth it out, since some streaks are left behind at times.</li>
            <li> :) Not sure if this helps or confuses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and durable!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how soft the bristles were!</li>
            <li> You do not have to use more foundation on the brush if you are in a hurry  to leave , just use the brush and apply again ,.it has enough applied the previous day to use again .</li>
            <li> I love the short, tight bristles.</li>
            <li> My only drawback is that it could be a little more firmer.</li>
            <li> This one had very high ratings and was only about $12</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that my foundation completely rinses out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and does the job</li>
            <li> It is soft but I wouldn&#x27;t trust using it on my face</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and my makeup just glides on now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old school and have always used my fingertips or a sponge to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it is too soft and doesn&#x27;t loosen the powder up from a compact so it doesn&#x27;t pick up any powder.  </li>
            <li> Wow...  </li>
            <li> The brush is quite soft &amp; well made.</li>
            <li> Foundation glides on and looks like baby soft skin.  </li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t have any pieces falling out.  </li>
            <li> Feels soft (no irritation) and blends well.</li>
            <li> Wicked soft.</li>
            <li> and it applies just as good as the expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this brush due to all the reviews.</li>
            <li> This brush is much softer than Beauty Junkees&#x27; Flat Top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never got that info from other brushes I bought and the bristles are falling out, so I learned something useful.</li>
            <li> The brush was excellent for first use but after cleaning it, it has stiffened terribly.</li>
            <li> Arrived amazingly quick and is super-soft on the face (hard to find one that is truly gentle to the touch on the face, but this one is).  </li>
            <li> and he said that many other women were having similar problems after using a dry mineral foundation for a substantial amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Brush works really well, but it arrived broken..took so long to get to arrive</li>
            <li> The brush did exactly what I expected and hoped it would do.</li>
            <li> The density of the brush equates to heavy, full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am new to contouring and blending different shades of make up.</li>
            <li> i gave this brush a 4 star because the handle was loose but it wasn&#x27;t big deal because i just super glued it back.</li>
            <li> I apply less than half of the amount of liquid foundation I was using before, and getting better coverage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People that want a sheer and natural finish should avoid this brush.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought the bare minerals brush I had meant to buy.</li>
            <li> Has big full fluffy bristles and my makeup has never gone on smoother.</li>
            <li> Sigma&#x27;s is 0.3cm longer and probably a little big better quality, but this is half the price of the Sigma.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and the bristles are short enough that they don&#x27;t spread all over the face.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this one was worth taking the time to do.  </li>
            <li> Pur minerals makes a liquid form that I like just as much as the powder type, and the Kabuki brush makes it look just as natural, if not more so.</li>
            <li> Great brush, but very disappointed because the piece you hold onto the black end came off with the first brush!  </li>
            <li> I had been previously using a Mac goat hair brush to blend out my foundation but decided that it was time to find something new.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is worth the money and is way cheaper than the Mac brushes.</li>
            <li> They are both Taklon synthetic and flat tops.</li>
            <li> The only issue is the brush head is so large and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get to the details around nose and eyes areas.</li>
            <li> He said NEVER use the dry form again, as it could lead to having lungs like a Cole miner, with the potential to cause lung cancer.  </li>
            <li> I will usually use my beauty blender and then with no product on the brush go over my face with this brush to complete my look with the occasional translucent HD powder in the mix.</li>
            <li> The brissles are firm, but soft..</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush to put my foundation on as the one I currently use does not really blend my make up.</li>
            <li> The delivery was a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and the only downside is it calls for weekly washings and I can&#x27;t wash it like my other brushes, because it needs to stay upside-down whenever you and dealing with water, but you also can&#x27;t submerge it.</li>
            <li> had been using a dry mineral foundation, but have developed an incessant dry cough and a feeling of very heavy lungs...similar to pneumonia.  </li>
            <li> I also tried it with loose powder</li>
            <li> The bristles stuck together in the center where the foundation was applied and even when the brush was completely dry it did not lay like it did pre-washed.</li>
            <li> Also shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Today I used it, and it is soft but the hairs are a little longer than I usually like.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable soft and puts a lot of product on my face; doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is wasted!</li>
            <li> This was definitely not worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Not worth 12 dollars.</li>
            <li> I will look for some other brushes from this seller!</li>
            <li> the brush was here within 2 days, actually less than two days time</li>
            <li> I have never used a foundation brush before, typically I&#x27;ve just used sponges.  </li>
            <li> I was looking around for one and it took me a little while to find this brush.</li>
            <li> i have dry skin, so i was skeptical, because i have never used a brush to apply foundation, only my fingers or a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> However, I have a small face and it was awkward for me to use this as it is a very large brush.</li>
            <li> A little shedding already after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Just got this brush a few days ago</li>
            <li> Waste of my money</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> I washed with baby shampoo and dried as directed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed the silver part that holds the brush came apart from the handle the first time I used it</li>
            <li> When using this with my liquid highlighter, it loses the bristles and leaves a few on my face with every stroke.</li>
            <li> It was not very good quality, and it fell apart as I opened the bag.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Item was broken upon shipment.</li>
            <li> Bristles fell out after just a few uses :(</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Not happy!!</li>
            <li> I desperately needed a brush, and when I say that all I had was literally my hands because I had a ELF brush, which the bristles kept falling off and would just wipe the makeup away.</li>
            <li> but the bristle aren&#x27;t crazy abrasive &amp;t</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just got this brush a few days ago and I just love how soft and smooth it glides on the skin! I tried it with foundation and it applies just as good as the expensive brushes. I also tried it with loose powder and I love the finish I got. Great brush! Def would buy again.</li>
            <li> No stray strands left on your face after usage. Good product</li>
            <li> Just tried it once but it seems to be very good. I will look for some other brushes from this seller!</li>
            <li> Very good stippling brush</li>
            <li> Works really well. Creates a beautiful blend. No fall out from the brush, pretty darn durable! Great buy</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. It is the first foundation brush I&#x27;ve purchased like this type,so I have no others to compare it to,but it gives me a nice full coverage that I was looking for without being cakey.</li>
            <li> This brush has the perfect texture to apply foundation.  It is also very easy to clean, and has lost no bristles after several cleanings.  I also like the fact that my foundation completely rinses out.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a flat top kabuki brush using liquid foundation. The bristles do not fall out, which is nice...but it doesn&#x27;t clean very well. After applying liquid foundation for a week I cleaned the brush using baby shampoo and warm water. The bristles stuck together in the center where the foundation was applied and even when the brush was completely dry it did not lay like it did pre-washed. My foundation still applies nicely (reason I gave it 3 star) but I find myself wasting a lot of foundation as it doesn&#x27;t spread evenly.</li>
            <li> It gets three stars because it began shedding after 2nd time using. Other than that, I&#x27;may thoroughly pleased with the flawless blend of my foundation.</li>
            <li> Great brush! I love quality products, and this one is worth the buy.It does what it needs to, and more.Glad i took a chance with this,thinking of a gifting these to a few people.I am sure they will love it as much as i do.Go for it!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, yes I am a guy and yes I wears the make up. Honestly u can swipe my brush on my foundation lightly and it will pick up the powder. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and still no shedding.  Loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. My foundation goes on well.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! It is unbelievable soft and puts a lot of product on my face; doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is wasted!</li>
            <li> This brush is super awesome!!!!  I remember when I first got it...it felt so good on my skin and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. The brush head fell off and I had to super glue it back on, but other than that I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t shed at all, the price is perfect, and it feels great on my skin...can&#x27;t ask for more!  I would definitely purchase this brush again!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush. I apply less than half of the amount of liquid foundation I was using before, and getting better coverage.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome. It blends my makeup together so well and it&#x27;s easy to wash! Super soft too.</li>
            <li> I said I would write a follow-up review on this Kabuki brush after I used it. I  love the soft texture it has, I  used it with a liquid foundation and the application was so smooth and even. I  own a lot of brushes both high end and moderately priced. This is a great brush, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product and service!</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time, but the size of the brush throw me off abit. It appeared smaller that the pic on Amazon..&lt;br /&gt;Now the brush is great when I used it with my foundation, it left no lines.. Which I was so happy about...the handle is tat no short for my liking.. The brissles are firm, but soft.. Which gives that flawless airbrush finished...I&#x27;ll purchase it again now that I know what I&#x27;ll get..</li>
            <li> It is just ok nothing special.</li>
            <li> Soooo streaky! Doesn&#x27;t blend foundation at all.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Really great product, applies my foundations on smoothly</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing so far there has been no shedding works better than my sigma F80 overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush</li>
            <li> Good product for the money!</li>
            <li> The brush is a normal size and I love that! I did think it was going to be more firm but oh well, does the job and makes the face look airbrushed.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!  Makes my skin look flawless. I use mac, and thought, my make up could not look any better. I was wrong. Using this brush makes it so much better! It almost gives it a smoother, blur look, where your skin just looks perfect! I never realized  a brush could make such a difference!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I have never used a brush to apply my foundation but this brush makes appling it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Item was broken upon shipment.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Smooth application, great texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not use to this kind of brush, but it blends liquid make-up really good.</li>
            <li> Using this brush makes applying foundation easy. Looks like it was air brushed.</li>
            <li> Fell apart two days after I received it.</li>
            <li> Used the brush for the first time today.  Great brush, but very disappointed because the piece you hold onto the black end came off with the first brush!  Will have to buy some kind of glue to kept in place to use it!  Would cost too much to return and exchange</li>
            <li> I will not be buying this brand of makeup brush again. I pulled it out of the packaging and it immediately broke. This was definitely not worth what I paid for it. Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Disappointed the silver part that holds the brush came apart from the handle the first time I used it</li>
            <li> This brush was awesome until I used it for a second time and the brush and metal casing came apart from the handle. Not so surprising considering the price, but jeez! Now I have to order some super glue via Prime... anyway, the brush works great for my purpose, to apply loose powder.</li>
            <li> Bristles fell out after just a few uses :(</li>
            <li> It was not very good quality, and it fell apart as I opened the bag.  They did accept my return, however.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush to put my foundation on as the one I currently use does not really blend my make up. I bought this one to try it out and I&#x27;m one happy customer. I love this new brush. It is soft and leaves your foundation looking pretty smooth and even on your skin!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s seriously fantastic.</li>
            <li> When using this with my liquid highlighter, it loses the bristles and leaves a few on my face with every stroke. Not happy!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush and am extremely pleased. The bristles are soft yet firm enough to provide a great application. Would definitely order more brushes from this line.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used a makeup brush and must say it does a fantastic job...leaves no streaks...only regret I have is not buying it sooner....the makeup sponge can&#x27;t compare to the brush...I would recommend buying this one..I would also recommend this seller..</li>
            <li> I really, really love this brush and will never use any other!</li>
            <li> I love the way the brush feels,very soft. Blends the foundation very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this product it&#x27;s very soft and easily distributes foundation in the face without a trace or marks, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> I am new to contouring and blending different shades of make up. However, this brush has made it super easy to contour.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no complaints! It was delivered on time &amp; I could not be happier with my purchase. You will not regret buying this brush!</li>
            <li> Every woman need a cosmetic brush , it covers all flaws as well as distribute the foundation applications evenly. You do not have to use more foundation on the brush if you are in a hurry  to leave , just use the brush and apply again ,.it has enough applied the previous day to use again .</li>
            <li> I am going to be completely honest here. This is the first brush I ever use with foundation, and so far I like it. I don&#x27;t know if you girls have more experience with make-up than I do, but sometimes when I apply the foundation I still have to use my sponge after to smooth it out, since some streaks are left behind at times. Maybe I am just not that experienced with brushes like I said. But I like it, I use it now all the time since it helps me apply foundation much easier now. :) Not sure if this helps or confuses.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, it broke the same day I got it! Waste of my money</li>
            <li> i gave this brush a 4 star because the handle was loose but it wasn&#x27;t big deal because i just super glued it back. but this brush makes my makeup look flawless and speeds up my process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for close to 6 months I believe and it&#x27;s still working great!!</li>
            <li> I love it I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve tried so many brushes this is by far the BEST foundation brush I ever had! !!!!!! Love how it&#x27;s a flat top give me a perfect coverage, and so easy to use!!!!</li>
            <li> I Love this its the best  brush  I ever used&lt;br /&gt;It blend  well and make  it perfect make up  for  everyone</li>
            <li> This brush is good for cream foundation. My only drawback is that it could be a little more firmer. It does give that flawless look.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s soft and full, it&#x27;s a dream to apply make up with this brush</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Its so soft, it applies my makeup so smoothly and evenly. I would totally buy this again, it is a lot better than most of the over priced saphora brushes!</li>

Also with directions on caring for it. Love the way I can use it for powder or liquid.  I think you would be very happy with this brush. I will be ordering another one!</li>

            <li> Great brush great price</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation brush. I was looking around for one and it took me a little while to find this brush. It does the job fabulously. leaves my face flawless.

            <li> The brush does work and when washed the bristles don&#x27;t fall out. However, I have a small face and it was awkward for me to use this as it is a very large brush. Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Works really good, and does not keep the makeup on the brush.  Great deal for the price and quality!</li>

            <li> i washed this brush like i wash all my makeup brushes, and all the hairs are falling out!! i have brushes for years and this has never happened before...</li>
            <li> While the brush itself is pretty nice, the handle fell off within the first use! A little bit of super glue fixed the issue and the brush works beautifully now, but that wasn&#x27;t a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Merchandise received swiftly and in good order.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  I have always used sponges to apply my foundation...never again will I use a sponge!!!</li>

            <li> I love it so worth the price i use it every day</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush to apply foundation. It&#x27;s soft and the bristles are short enough that they don&#x27;t spread all over the face. It only takes minutes to apply foundation and it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Applies my Bare Escentuals liquid flawlessly.</li>
            <li> The best foundation brush EVER!!!!!!!!! I use this brush everyday to apply my foundation. Results &#x3D; Smooth, Flawless application of foundation.</li>
            <li> Love my brush, had no issues. it&#x27;s soft and does the job well,it does not take up muchof the face power, which is perfect and that&#x27;s because of the softnes of the brush. yes buy it it&#x27;s worth the money</li>

            <li> Love..love.love it. Great product</li>
            <li> Brush is great.  I made a really good choice.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Purchased one at merle norman for 35.00 This is the same thing. Great purchase</li>
            <li> Excellent flat top brush.  I love the short, tight bristles.</li>
            <li> very strong chemical smell. The bristles dont feel &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; at all more like plastic. It is soft but I wouldn&#x27;t trust using it on my face</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft. Awesome for the price.  Also shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Loved it...does not shed and does not absorb youre product!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Out of the many foundation brushes I own I grab this one. It doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks afterwards. I&#x27;m so impressed especially since it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This brush is much softer than Beauty Junkees&#x27; Flat Top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People need to understand that cheap brushes will drag on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is super dense with a slightly shaky ferrule.&lt;br /&gt;People that want a sheer and natural finish should avoid this brush. The density of the brush equates to heavy, full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women who have more mature or sensitive skin should consider a better quality brush with less impact.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. Perfect with spray foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen and heard good reviews about this brush so I got it, LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;Gives a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Works great! Spreads make up evenly, and it&#x27;s super soft!</li>
            <li> First makeup brush to own so can&#x27;t compare to others, but works well.  Has big full fluffy bristles and my makeup has never gone on smoother. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This brush is the bomb! Seriously. I love how it blends my foundation and it&#x27;s super silky! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great brush! The bristles are soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li> great MU tool for wet and dry make up, perfect for creating that airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the product, she&#x27;s so happy when it arrived. Never really thought that genuine and awesome products can make people happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deserves 5-star rating!!</li>
            <li> This brush works well with liquid foundation. It spreads the foundation well and evenly. The only issue is the brush head is so large and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get to the details around nose and eyes areas. I&#x27;ve used more expensive brand-name brushes and they do better job covering details than this brush. However for the price I paid, this brush does a decent job.</li>
            <li> I just got this brush and I really love it! It&#x27;s so soft and my makeup just glides on now. I&#x27;m really impressed at the quality of this brush for the price I payed!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush!! it is SOO SOO soft and honestly worth the money.  I have paid way more for brushes and brush sets and this stands above them all.  Im so happy I cancelled another order I had and got this instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time today and the bristles felt so nice on my face I almost wish I had a reason to redo my makeup, but the finish with this brush was so nice as well, exactly the airbrush finish everyone says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also! the brush was here within 2 days, actually less than two days time so that was awesome! YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BUY THIS! I use it for my liquid foundation/BB cream.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Is a great size and make my foundation smooth!!! Super soft too!</li>
            <li> Where has this makeup brush been all my life?!? I&#x27;m old school and have always used my fingertips or a sponge to apply my foundation. I wanted to give this a try after watching a YouTube video where this woman made her face look like porcelain... So beautiful!! I&#x27;m super pleased with this brush and will be ordering a second.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because a flat top brush was recommended by my aesthetician to use with my Glo Minerals powder.  The one she was selling was $35 and I have lots of brushes.  This one had very high ratings and was only about $12 so I ordered it. The Kabuki brush is very soft on your face and it works for blending powder or foundation which is on the face. The problem is that it is too soft and doesn&#x27;t loosen the powder up from a compact so it doesn&#x27;t pick up any powder.  Nothing gets on the brush.  I used a regular powder brush which, instantly, stirred up the powder and worked fine. I&#x27;m sure this brush works fine to pick up loose powder if that&#x27;s what you use.</li>
            <li> NICE, IT WAS WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Love live love this brush!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> arrived in time. I tried it for the first time this morning. Worked well. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that I sill don&#x27;t know how it will hold up with time.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because of all the great reviews But my Dragon Pad kabuki is better. They are both Taklon synthetic and flat tops. This one smelled like chemicals even after washing it. It distributed foundation just okay,i had to continuously and vigorously brush over face in circular motions to blend in foundation to get it to evenly cover without caking or settling in pores. I liked the dewy look i achieved but this is not what i need. The Dragon pad is smaller more compact,dense bristles and gives a fuller coverage. It blends easily with superior coverage compared to this one. I gave this a 4 star for being hypoallegenic and vegan. But 3 stars for.performance.  This brush was $11.88 and the dragonpad was a set of 11 for $11.82 This brush is NOT the Best IMO. I expected more from this brush due to all the reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and durable! Blends liquid foundation so evenly. Doesn&#x27;t shed. I bought one for myself, my makeup kit, even one for my mother!</li>
            <li> For the love of GOD, IF you are Contemplating this purchase, do yourself a favor,&amp;&amp; buy it!!!!  i just got mine yesterday and i already have my holy grail brush!! i have dry skin, so i was skeptical, because i have never used a brush to apply foundation, only my fingers or a beauty blender. But, i would always end up looking cakey, and &amp;#34;mask like &amp;#34; even still. Im telling you, when i applied my foundation with this, everything just melted into my skin and it was beoynd flawless!! Im honestly astounished!! you can get an inch up to my face and would never be able to tell im wearing makeup!! Outrageously low priced as well...best buy by far ..thank u so much its changed my life (no exaggeration)</li>
            <li> Smooth finish achieved with this brush, very soft.  Price is right too!</li>
            <li> I use this for my foundation and find the little stiffer bristles perfect for filling the crevices around my nose...and overall face.  I love it!</li>
            <li> The bristles are not tightly attached so it doesn&#x27;t give me that flawless airbrushed look that the sigma f80 does. Not worth 12 dollars. The $3 elf brush is better than this one.</li>
            <li> One of the best face brushes ever. I had been previously using a Mac goat hair brush to blend out my foundation but decided that it was time to find something new. I went online and I stumbled across this one and let me tell you, it is seriously the best at blending out foundation. Way better than the previous Mac one I used. It is superrr soft and at first it had a marker smell but I washed it like the instructions say and the smell went away. Seriously, this is worth the money and is way cheaper than the Mac brushes.</li>
            <li> love this Kabuki brush.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> This brush is beautiful.  It&#x27;s really soft and works really good.  So much better priced than other high end brushes like Sigma.  Got it fast too.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Flawless application!</li>
            <li> Not all that good. It leaves streak marks when I apply my foundation</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this one was worth taking the time to do.  It&#x27;s exactly how it is described and applies foundation better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this same brush by MAC and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t this one is more than half the price and just as good perhaps better.  It makes your makeup look flawless!  I absolutely love it and would definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Wow...  I have never used a foundation brush before, typically I&#x27;ve just used sponges.  Even as a novice, using this brush was quick and easy.  I applied the liquid in dots on my cheeks and t-zone and blended in a circular motion using the brush.  Foundation went on with a smooth, perfectly blended finish.  The brush has a good heft to it and seems to be great quality, the bristles are super soft and feel really good against the skin.  I&#x27;m looking forward to getting a lot of use out of this.  I am an ex-sponge convert!</li>
            <li> The reviews are accurate.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best deal I&#x27;ve come across. When I purchased it, it was at a deal for around $10, which is amazing! I desperately needed a brush, and when I say that all I had was literally my hands because I had a ELF brush, which the bristles kept falling off and would just wipe the makeup away. I use a stippling motion and then sway. It&#x27;s an amazing brush and I am glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I love this make up brush, my foundation goes on so smooth, i use it mostly with powdered foundation.</li>
            <li> I use this with a full coverage liquid foundation. I dot the foundation around my face and use this brush in  light circular motions to spread the foundation. It works great and I believe it keeps me from wasting my foundation with the light even coverage it gives. It has a large surface to cover more area quickly. I also use it for concealer I apply to darker spots on my face, not under my eyes though, I use a separate brush for that.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to lightly buff my face after applying foundation &amp; blush to blend everything together &amp; give a natural appearance &amp; glow. It works well for this purpose. The brush is quite soft &amp; well made.</li>
            <li> Brush works really well, but it arrived broken..took so long to get to arrive so I didn&#x27;t bothered to send it back.</li>
            <li> Love my brush! The delivery was a day earlier than expected. I&#x27;m very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Best make up brush i&#x27;ve ever used to apply foundation.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Foundation glides on and looks like baby soft skin.  Much better than a sponge!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to work with liquid foundation, and it feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much!!!!! It can be used as a foundation, blush, bronzer or just for blending. Since it is synthetic, it doesn&#x27;t use too much product. That it is a plus!!!! It has great texture, not too soft and not too hard. Based on it&#x27;s price, It really excelled my expectations.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  It is soft and spreads mousse foundation perfectly.  I do clean it weekly.  So far I don&#x27;t have any pieces falling out.  The metal piece was dented when I rec&#x27;d it but it doesn&#x27;t harm the brush.  Actually it makes a good finger grip.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great communication!  Thank you!  I love the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works great. Great quality!  Great customer service from the New 8 Store, I will definitely purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush ever! Helped me achieve an airbrushed look and helped me cover my acne better then any flat brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works quite well, very smooth application of liquid cc cream.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush!!! A must have!!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a decently priced kabuki brush and this is it.  Works perfectly, came as expected, great customer service :)</li>
            <li> Great product, applies high end and drugstore foundations flawlessly, thank you!</li>
            <li> Worked well for about a week and then seemed to lose integrity.  I washed with baby shampoo and dried as directed.  Wish I had bought the bare minerals brush I had meant to buy.</li>
            <li> Soft on sensitive skin and easy to use, this brush blends my foundations evenly making my makeup look natural and soft. I love that the hairs on this brush don&#x27;t come off and stick to your skin like some do as I&#x27;ve experienced before with cheap brushes. Before using it for the first time, it&#x27;s best recommended to give it a bit of a rinse under warm water and let dry. This is a great flat brush for all makeup enthusiasts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a a Kabuki brush before, but found it quite simple to use and was amazed at how evenly it distributed the liquid foundation.  I am extremely impressed with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a dry mineral foundation, but have developed an incessant dry cough and a feeling of very heavy lungs...similar to pneumonia.  I went to see my Dr., thinking that I truly had pneumonia and he said that many other women were having similar problems after using a dry mineral foundation for a substantial amount of time.  He said NEVER use the dry form again, as it could lead to having lungs like a Cole miner, with the potential to cause lung cancer.  Pay heed, and switch back to a liquid foundation..... if you value having healthy lungs. Pur minerals makes a liquid form that I like just as much as the powder type, and the Kabuki brush makes it look just as natural, if not more so.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. They are very happy and say it&#x27;s super soft and is very even when applying foundation. great brush!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, very good price!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Great for applying foundation and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Well made.  Feels soft (no irritation) and blends well. I contour my makeup 4-5 days a week and it blends the highlight and shadow well. It also smooths out my foundation on days I don&#x27;t contour. I like that it came with cleaning instructions as to not store upright after washing which may cause water to loosen the glue which causes the bristles to fall out. I never got that info from other brushes I bought and the bristles are falling out, so I learned something useful. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush seems like an exact dupe of the Sigma F80 Flat Kubuki, which is my favorite foundation brush. Sigma&#x27;s is 0.3cm longer and probably a little big better quality, but this is half the price of the Sigma. For all of you leaving comments saying that it leaves streaks, you are not supposed to sweep your liquid foundation on in back in forth motions, you are supposed to blend and buff it out in circular motions. If anyone who has bought this brush that also has the Sigma F80, please let me know your opinion.</li>
            <li> Arrived amazingly quick and is super-soft on the face (hard to find one that is truly gentle to the touch on the face, but this one is).  Great price, too!</li>
            <li> This arrived as promised. And item was as described. The brush blends liquid, as well as powder foundation flawlessly.</li>
            <li> The brush did exactly what I expected and hoped it would do. It&#x27;s also very neat and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying pressed mineral foundation</li>
            <li> It is between my beauty blender and this great brush. I love how this blends everything together so nicely. I will usually use my beauty blender and then with no product on the brush go over my face with this brush to complete my look with the occasional translucent HD powder in the mix. It&#x27;s a pretty dense brush but the bristle aren&#x27;t crazy abrasive &amp;t do have some softness to them! I love!</li>
            <li> Great brush with extra soft bristles. Product was received very quickly! I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush! Wicked soft.</li>
            <li> after 2 uses the wood part came off. I will need to get a new one or a refund</li>
            <li> i love this brush my foundation goes on flawless. i thought it was going to be a cheap made brush but its not.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for blending makeup.. I will definitely be ordering more</li>
            <li> better then the eye drop shape sponges</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how soft the bristles were! This arrived on time and the only downside is it calls for weekly washings and I can&#x27;t wash it like my other brushes, because it needs to stay upside-down whenever you and dealing with water, but you also can&#x27;t submerge it.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the high priced brush.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush really is fantastic! It&#x27;s extremely soft and provides great coverage without the  streaking brush stroke lines that sum foundation brushes cause. It pushes the foundation into the skin flawlessly. It&#x27;s a great brush for the price. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy another one at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brushes for foundation application. This one is decent. I received it yesterday and washed it. Today I used it, and it is soft but the hairs are a little longer than I usually like. I will keep this but it will not be my go-to brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for applying foundation and bronzer. I love the big brush that&#x27;s compact with lots of soft bristles. I get a flawless finish with this brush. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush! This is the best brush I have ever used! I use it to apply foundation and powder. Great price too! ;)</li>
            <li> The brush was excellent for first use but after cleaning it, it has stiffened terribly.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Before I purchased the Kabuki, I would inevitably end up with make up  on my clothes.  This brush helps me to evenly apply my make up.  I would recommend this  product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new brush. Good quality I totally recomended.</li>
            <li> Perfect application every time. Easy to wash and doesn&#x27;t make you look cakey!</li>
