            <li>Really dries fast, great shine!!!</li>
            <li>Dries super fast &amp; leaves my nails shiny &amp; beautiful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and all were fine</li>
            <li>Dries very fast and leaves an amazing shine.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and never chips.</li>
            <li>It does, smooth out the polish when applied.</li>
            <li>My current polish has been on a week and still looks great.</li>
            <li>First, let me tell you I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now, and have bought 5 more bottles.</li>
            <li>It dries instantly, goes on smooth and has a bright shine.  </li>
            <li>Then came home and searched it on Amazon and found all these great comments about this particular clear polish.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product to purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also is super glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this dries quickly and out the door you go</li>
            <li>This chips for me at the normal rate that most topcoats do.</li>
            <li>It drys fast and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Best quick dry ever :) I seriously bow to it.</li>
            <li>True to word fast drying</li>
            <li>It protects real well and dries QUICK.</li>
            <li>Drys super fast.</li>
            <li>It dries nail polish (no matter how sticky) super fast</li>
            <li>Since finding this product, I never paint my nails without using &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; as a final top coat.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted/expected.  </li>
            <li>Keeps them from chipping fast, too!</li>
            <li>And it really seems to help prolong the life of the color!</li>
            <li>sure what to tell you about chipping; the only thing that doesn&#x27;t chip for me is gel.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly but nail polish still soft for awhile after so you need to still be aware to not smudge.</li>
            <li>Within 10 minutes I&#x27;m able to get up and do minor things.  </li>
            <li>Dries so fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thinner and easier to cover, but dries just as fast as seche vite.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t thicken up as fast as seche vite does either, so the bottle lasts longer.</li>
            <li>And it dries really fast.</li>
            <li>It leaves your nails super shiny and they usually stay chip free for the whole week.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 20 years and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>My nails always dry from 2-4mins with a lustrous shine that last for days :)</li>
            <li>(My new salon doesn&#x27;t have it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quick dry and makes the manicure shiny.</li>
            <li>Polish my toes and use this after my top coat and no more smudges.....</li>
            <li>what it smelled like, also it didnt give me the shine i was looking for, and it did not dry as fast as i thought,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It tries quickly and gives your names a professional gloss.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend applying it and going directly out the door, unless it is being applied to your toes.  </li>
            <li>, that now happen near the end of the week&#x27; s manicure; with other topcoats, I often began chipping the first day of the mani.</li>
            <li>It never dulls.</li>
            <li>It came on time, a little early actually, and it exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>If you want you nails look professional and get dry in seconds</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get thick when i had the brush out for too long like some other top coats</li>

            <li> It does have a fast drying time, however it doesn&#x27;t necessarily dry in &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; and my polish was still chipped in 3 days or less.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s been my only complaint with other super fast-drying topcoats and this one takes the cake since it doesn&#x27;t do</li>

            <li> As long as you wait 10-15 mins and are careful you won&#x27;t have a problem with even that.</li>
            <li> So i tried this and was not impressed, it seemed as though i was putting remover on top of my polish, at least thats</li>

            <li> and it still looks wet.</li>
            <li> I  am hard on my manicures, and daily applications of this product give me almost one week with very few chips</li>
            <li> maybe im missing something...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually doing my nails just before running &#x27;out the door&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> None of the nasty cheapo filler ingredients you get in some polish.  </li>
            <li> Seche Vite caused my nail polish to peel off within a day or two, it was horrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Terrific topcoat! Resists chipping and helps maintain my manicure through the week. Also, it shines shines shines!</li>
            <li> Works especially well with Zoya polishes as Seche Vite causes them to shrink &amp; crack.</li>
            <li> I found this one by accident.  Then came home and searched it on Amazon and found all these great comments about this particular clear polish.  Its a great name because you really can put on a coat on all fingers and within minutes you can pick up and head out to do what you need to without worrying about getting your nail polish damaged.  A GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>

            <li> Have used this product for years. I&#x27;m usually doing my nails just before running &#x27;out the door&#x27;, so it&#x27;s a must not to have to worry about smudges at the last minute</li>

            <li> Received promptly.  Item was as described.</li>
            <li> It worked alright but definitely not the same formula that I remember using that would make your manicure last a week and then some</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now, and have bought 5 more bottles. I am in love with this stuff. It protects real well and dries QUICK. I use this at work and I&#x27;m back to filing in 20 minutes with no smudges. It does shrink the polish just a tiny bit but the overall quality makes up for that.</li>
            <li> Been using this for decades. Dries very fast and leaves an amazing shine. Highly recommend. Great for nighttime manicures before bed.  No morning sheet marks</li>

            <li> My favorite top coat! I&#x27;ve tried many and all were fine but this one takes the cake! Dries super fast &amp; leaves my nails shiny &amp; beautiful. Keeps them from chipping fast, too!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Within 10 minutes I&#x27;m able to get up and do minor things.

            <li> This top coat is excellent and resists chipping well and preserves the underlying nail color well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is super glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This in my opinion, is a great top coat.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! Dries so fast and it still looks wet. Great shine and it lasts for weeks!</li>
            <li> fast delivery great product would buy again. had sister buy some to try. this dries quickly and out the door you go</li>
            <li> I love it ! It arrived no later than 3 days</li>
            <li> This doesnt dry quicky as compared to others ive used</li>
            <li> Best. Topcoat. Ever. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 20 years and highly recommend it.  It dries instantly, goes on smooth and has a bright shine.  It never dulls.</li>
            <li> I used to always use seche vite, but this stuff is way better. It&#x27;s thinner and easier to cover, but dries just as fast as seche vite. It doesn&#x27;t thicken up as fast as seche vite does either, so the bottle lasts longer. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Finally, I can do my nails in the evening and NOT wake up with sheet marks on my nails.  I was skeptical but so glad I bought this....</li>
            <li> So i tried this and was not impressed, it seemed as though i was putting remover on top of my polish, at least thats what it smelled like, also it didnt give me the shine i was looking for, and it did not dry as fast as i thought, could just be me though, maybe im missing something...eh, oh well. Will order seche vite next time!</li>
            <li> True to word fast drying</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awesome and it dries fast and it&#x27;s shiny and mine didn&#x27;t get thick when i had the brush out for too long like some other top coats</li>
            <li> Must have for Fast drying.. should still use  caution to not bump...over all the best  top coat for  reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years..  Polish my toes and use this after my top coat and no more smudges.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tries quickly and gives your names a professional gloss.</li>
            <li> Just like in the salon!</li>
            <li> Really dries fast, great shine!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using out the door for many years now and I like it.  I don&#x27;t recommend applying it and going directly out the door, unless it is being applied to your toes.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good product to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love out the door. Drys super fast.</li>
            <li> It actually does what it boosts.... it dries your nails in record time and you can actually go Out the Door almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I keep buying this top coat over and over again. It is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I do my nails weekly. It leaves your nails super shiny and they usually stay chip free for the whole week. I will continue to buy this till they stop making it (and I pray that never happens because I  love this stuff!!!)</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of top coats. Seche Vite caused my nail polish to peel off within a day or two, it was horrible. Essie no chip topcoat wasn&#x27;t much better. This one makes my nails GLOSSY and gorgeous. And it really seems to help prolong the life of the color!</li>
            <li> I NEVER finish a manicure without using one coat of this. It&#x27;s the best of its kind out there and it looks great. My manicures end up growing out at the nail bed before they chip. And it dries really fast.</li>
            <li> My color nails last longer!</li>
            <li> Pretty good top coat. Comparable to seche vite - it&#x27;s quick dry and makes the manicure shiny. I think the formula is safer than seche too</li>
            <li> Although I have not used this product yet, I know it works well because my nail salon uses it on me whenever I get my pedicures and manicures. I decided that I wanted a bottle of my own, so now I have one!</li>
            <li> This stuff dries insanely fast, gives a beautiful shine to my nails and DOESN&#x27;T SHRINK THE POLISH UNDER IT. That&#x27;s been my only complaint with other super fast-drying topcoats and this one takes the cake since it doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what to tell you about chipping; the only thing that doesn&#x27;t chip for me is gel. This chips for me at the normal rate that most topcoats do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It dries nail polish (no matter how sticky) super fast and it doesn&#x27;t chip!  My current polish has been on a week and still looks great.</li>
            <li> Best product of its kind. It&#x27;s everything it says it is. Put it on and out the door instantly. You&#x27;re gonna love it girls.</li>
            <li> Great. Does what it claims and gives a beautiful shine</li>
            <li> Best quick dry ever :) I seriously bow to it. Been using it for years and best thus far. The name says it all Literaly out the door. My nails always dry from 2-4mins with a lustrous shine that last for days :)</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I bought it at cvs before and it was more expensive. If you want you nails look professional and get dry in seconds this is the product!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Will only buy this brand!!!!</li>
            <li> Great top coat that really lasts and protects your nail color.</li>
            <li> This is one of my fave top coats and it lives up to it&#x27;s name. You can polish and apply and be out the door in seconds. I&#x27;ve had a bottle for ages and still not done. Very good value.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly but nail polish still soft for awhile after so you need to still be aware to not smudge.</li>
            <li> It came on time, a little early actually, and it exactly what I was looking for.  It dries very quickly and is nice and glossy, great product!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my nails for years and this is the best top coat I have ever used. It drys fast and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this stuff!!! I used it at my nail salon &amp; 5 min under the fan.... I was able to put shoes &amp; socks on without any smudges or chips!! Can&#x27;t wait to get it.... (My new salon doesn&#x27;t have it &amp; I LOATHE SITTING UNDER THE DRYER for what feels like hours!!!</li>
