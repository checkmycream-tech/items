            <li>I just tried them and am really thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much Cellbone for making a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This prep may also be a nice mini peel tonic to be used after one washes their face.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that if you have problem aging skin</li>
            <li>an counting where I was having them atleast once a week before purchasing this toner, Make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards thou, I use hyaluronic acid which is a good moisturizer also an can be purchased here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>good i will order more thank you</li>
            <li>This product had so many good reviews</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t think that it was achieved by this toner on its own.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE!!</li>
            <li>I bought this toner because the ingredients seemed great and the reviews were pretty good.</li>
            <li>After I clean my face it makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>but since im super happy that i found my new best friend (prep)</li>
            <li>like all the products this brand make work perfect , is not necesary expend a lot of money for have young skin</li>
            <li>plus, they include a great collagen face wash that I&#x27;m enjoying as a free gift &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It was worth the price for beautiful skin :)</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s too strong for my skin, but it puts my oil glands into over-drive!</li>
            <li>I follow with a good clean moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>i have very smooth skin....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong stuff but effective.  </li>
            <li>I love this, I bought because of reviews and ingredients listed.</li>
            <li>I really love the products they are so refreshing.</li>
            <li>The service from the company is top notch and reliable.</li>
            <li>But then again everyones skin is different, so just try and experiment with what is best for your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love the tingle :-)</li>
            <li>Love it alone.</li>
            <li>/support my healthy skin plan of action.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Most days I don&#x27;t even put any cover up on</li>
            <li>I was able to use alcohol instead</li>
            <li>This toner also has some glycolic acid in it, so I&#x27;m sure that helps a lot.</li>
            <li>so I am very optimistic that I too will get great results for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have noticed many changes in my skin since I began using this product 2 months ago.  </li>
            <li>This is my first--and maybe only--online review, but considering how much dermatologists charge for skin care kits, I wanted to flag this product as a great value.</li>
            <li>This stuff has given me the light at the end of the tunnel feeling!</li>
            <li>Love the neutralizer and prep for before and after using the peel....</li>
            <li>being in the skin care field, I just love all the products..</li>
            <li>I do not know that it is doing more than a 60</li>
            <li>even after cleaning my face with makeup remover wipes, this product finds more to remove.</li>
            <li>I feel it helps anything you use after this to absorb better.</li>
            <li>(I attribute most of it to job-stress</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>We love this.</li>
            <li>All of Cellbone&#x27;s products are great, the lists of ingredients are all things I can pronounce, it&#x27;s like they make natural-based products that really work.</li>
            <li>I even visted their website, and they have even more stuff</li>
            <li>My skin started looking so much better</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s pretty amazing to me!  </li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Love that this is more than just a neutralizer to prep skin before adding serums or creams.</li>
            <li>but my skin was so smooth!</li>
            <li>Wish it had more glycolic though.</li>
            <li>so now im trying to give it away for free on craigslist &amp; still NO TAKERS!</li>
            <li>Excellent Toner, though I didn&#x27;t recognize that what I am buying is a toner when I add it to my cart; I thought it is a Facial Wash, I dont know</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still Satisfied.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m gonna buy it for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and wouldn&#x27;t start my day without it now.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will buy it over and over again...</li>
            <li>i do love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful that it will work better now that I have an understanding of how I should use it.</li>
            <li>How many products does just that?</li>
            <li>Free sample of a face wash which smells nice is a plus as well.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>though it need more time  to get my skin get used to refreshner  </li>
            <li>Would love to have these scars go away quicker</li>
            <li>but that is still a work in progress :)</li>
            <li>I love using this before I apply makeup as well.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely re-order these products and more from this company!!!</li>
            <li>The results are pretty good.</li>
            <li>very nicely packaged with a free (good sized) sample of their facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Which is what it supose to do..plus the free face wash is really good-refreshing, smells great</li>
            <li>I used this after many reviews and this stuff is strong.  </li>
            <li>Best daily toner, my skin is glowing and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I hope this product will help ward off any fine lines and wrinkles too :)</li>
            <li>Gets all debris off skin before a light acid peel, love this</li>
            <li>Also love the free samples that come with it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin supple and fresh and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Seller did a good job getting it to me in a reasonable timeframe; product is just not for me.</li>
            <li>I can easily see a huge, huge difference!    </li>
            <li>Love love love this a quick method to clean your face remove all the dirt &amp; oil off your face while your in bed before you sleep.</li>
            <li>those who have significant others that love to get so close to your face).</li>
            <li>I would like my skin to get a bit better before I&#x27;m brave enough to post the pictures for you all, but stay tuned.</li>
            <li>Very mild stinging.</li>
            <li>Because it is to strong for my skin type and feel burning after i use it.  </li>
            <li>was strong at the beginning.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to see two large samples of this cleanser and a lactic acid / glycolic acid peel in my order.  </li>
            <li>I think it works best right after a hot shower while my pores are still open, although it stings more and leaves some redness for about 15 minutes or so, but I can see more immediate results.</li>
            <li>( totally loved it )  and though  I can be an add to a  new routine and will include Skin prep refreshner in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is helping with the fine lines as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the first skin care product I am truly satisfied with.</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is a clean, fresh palate, and that it makes my skin better able to soak up the moisturizer I use before I apply my cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it came in the mail SUPER FAST!!!!  </li>
            <li>I no longer have huge greasy pores to contend with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light peel.</li>
            <li>But overall I am completely happy with this product.    </li>
            <li>I have sparingly used the free sample sized cleanser that came with my order.  </li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS SO SMOOTH AND RADIANT</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and the order was filled and shipped in no time.</li>
            <li>They even included a free sample.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of this company&#x27;s products; this one is really great.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten that I had GREAT skin up until recently.</li>
            <li>My face is really smooth and it is brighter.  </li>
            <li>It removes all flaky dead skin so my make-up goes on flawlessly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that your daytime lotion contains a sunscreen with this product.  </li>
            <li>a great part of a facial cleaning regimin.</li>
            <li>Goes away once you smooth on a moisturizer, so</li>
            <li>My skin absolutely looks amazing now.</li>
            <li>The glow on my skin was unmistakeable and my makeup went on so smoothly</li>
            <li>i use these two products together for smooth glowing skin.</li>
            <li>and it makes your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>Your face is smooth after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but afterwards I have baby smooth skin that glows (</li>
            <li>I did buy this primarily as a prep for an acid peel.</li>
            <li>Great product, I ordered it and 2 days later on my door step.</li>
            <li>When I got it it came with a free sample of face wash.</li>
            <li>its great for cystic acne, adult acne, and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Has made a significant improvement in my skin, just in 1 week.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m not disappointed because I figure it is helping maintain</li>
            <li>I havent tried the 60% I originally ordered yet.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait to see what it would do for my skin before writing a review and the results have been nothing short of remarkable.  </li>
            <li>At first it seems to just be water, but this stuff is potent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the momentary discomfort!  </li>
            <li>Ordered two bottles (first mistake), Yes it arrived on time applyed it thinking i would feel a lil tingle at the most....</li>
            <li>I received this product about a week ago and ichave to say that I see results already my skin and acne has been reduced significantly</li>
            <li>If you want extremely clean skin</li>
            <li>and i had a super smooth skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is how it should be when a company makes a mistake, but it is rare and I sooooo appreciate how easy this was.</li>
            <li>It has glycolic acid that is even MORE effective if the sebum is disinigrated as it is only water soluble (the layer below the sebum).</li>
            <li>My skin does feel fresh, clean, and smooth after using this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clearer and more radiant and so much softer.  </li>
            <li>In-order to get the full benefits of a peel you have to make this your step 1.  </li>
            <li>From a day toner to a quick clean wipe with a cotton ball.....and just before peels.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve been using it full strength morning and evening, every day.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel fresh and oil free.</li>
            <li>I use this once a day for my skin can&#x27;t handle it more than that, but it definitively helps remove excess dirt and preps the skin for moisturizer very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say if it makes a difference in my skin tone since I&#x27;m using other products for that, but I do feel it&#x27;s a good prep before I apply serums, and I feel my skin is much cleaner when I use it after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>The other reviews are great</li>
            <li>I feel a mild stinging and a tingling sensation while applying prep on my skin</li>
            <li>i will most def be coming back to cellbone for more since this product is the answer to my face issues (acne, acne scars, hyperpigmentation, dullness, &amp; signs of aging)</li>
            <li>I decided it was time to start a more healthy skin regimen to prevent any future breakouts, and hopefully my scars would be reduced in the process over time.</li>
            <li>I apply this after I wash my face with a mild cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My skin has tremendously improved, texture, clarity, brightness, you name it.</li>
            <li>skin was still getting super oily after one hour I used the toner .</li>
            <li>so I used pre-moistened face wipes &amp; hot water (when it was available) to cleanse my face &amp; always followed up with the Prep Skin Refresher.</li>
            <li>I also use an organic exfoliating scrub every morning then apply a vitamin c lotion with spf afterwards which I also believe contributes to my new found healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product and may go for a professional glycolic peel in a month if the deeper, darker scars are still apparent.  </li>
            <li>Also as a side note, I suggest you put a really good moisturizer on your face afterwards because it made my face really dry.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about spending $18 on just toner, but all my worries went out the window after the first day!</li>
            <li>Instead of testing it I got excited because of the results I received the first two days of use.</li>
            <li>OMG!!&lt;br /&gt;i also have very light adult acne, still waiting results on that</li>
            <li>Thanks for quick ship, and samples...will buy again from you!</li>
            <li>I have (had) very oily skin with huge pores.</li>
            <li>but im sure that will clear up.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, but I SWEAR it&#x27;s worth trying if you have acne/hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think that would ever be possible for</li>
            <li>Worth mentioning</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>Now if only I could find an effective eye cream...</li>
            <li>pimples aren&#x27;t so out of control, and I definitely see more of a smooth &amp; toned complexion.  </li>
            <li>such a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m giving myself a mini peel every day. :)</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Made my skin look fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Prep and still loving it.</li>
            <li>I burn pretty easily and I blame myself for using this too soon and too much.</li>
            <li>Cellbone also makes an excellent Body Peel that I&#x27;ve been using on my other problem areas with similar results.</li>
            <li>I experienced a little dryness and irritation around my nose edges and lines around my mouth when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I also received a free small bottle of collagen facial wash by Cellbone that was included in my order and it too is awesome.  </li>
            <li>( you know that dark skin on both of those areas that can occur), well, I am glad to say that I have noticed such a great difference in all the areas I&#x27;ve used it on.</li>
            <li>right b4 peel.</li>
            <li>I use this product right after washing my face at night...</li>
            <li>Prep will stimulate new skin cells and promote a clear, smooth, healthy looking complexion.]]</li>
            <li>I have been following new routines, but this toner definitely is the best toner i have ever tried.</li>
            <li>My pores are barely noticeable and my skin seems to produce just the right amount of healthy oil.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and smooth and calm.</li>
            <li>But it really does improve your skin)It took me alot of money and a bathroom full of patially used potions to find my miracle.</li>
            <li>The small sample of cleanser they sent with this product is great.</li>
            <li>I am even ordering a little more glycolic acid to add to it because I like about a 10% glycolic now that my skin is more used to being acid washed</li>
            <li>This is a company with high quality products and a sweet worth ethic.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast (faster than the date listed).</li>
            <li>It shipped super fast</li>
            <li>After reading such great reviews on this product I purchased this toner back in April .&lt;br</li>
            <li>wearing concealer &amp; makeup to hide the dark hyperpigmentation, which I&#x27;m certain resulted in more breakouts &#x3D; more hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>, I mean it looks darn near flawless.</li>
            <li>and afterwards I VERY gently dab Cellbone&#x27;s Prep solution over my face.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I noticed it mostly around sensitive areas of my face, I think I may have gotten a more intense feeling because my skin was very try at the time and this could have dried it out even more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique, and within a week, my acne disappeared, and my blackheads on my nose completely vanished!</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>I have used many different astringent/toner after cleansing my face to remove excess oil.  </li>
            <li>that was a surprise bonus product included in my order, I had ordered A 60% gycolac peel from another company that I intended to use with this prep, but chose to try the 35% sample first.</li>
            <li>I took pictures of my skin before I began using and when I looked back at them (before writing this review to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just my imagination)</li>
            <li>, the pads for me are easier) to apply the Prep Refresher on my face and neck, and allow it to work -- I feel a tingling sensation that&#x27;s mostly bearable (!)</li>
            <li>When I first started using it it had quite a bit of a bite but</li>
            <li>I love this product; finally a facial product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product to complement my salycilic acid routine skin care and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>First of all, it ships superfast (probably 2 days).</li>
            <li>I ordered this Toner almost two weeks ago and started using it 8 days ago and it has dramatically reduced the acne forming on my face and my scarring that was pretty severe from the cystic nodules that I had on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, I have just ordered my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li>I am able to go without makeup now with no embarrassment about red, oily, blemished skin.</li>
            <li>first week I used it, I diluted it 50% with witch hazel because of the way it made my skin burn and tingle.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>This is the third time I have purchased from this company, they don&#x27;t has as many items in amazon as they do on their website.   </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, people have been commenting on my complexion.</li>
            <li>will continue to buy (even though they&#x27;re a tad expensive, but I can see why!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &amp; best of luck!</li>
            <li>I am getting compliments on my skin for the first time in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first time I used it I thought I couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li>I first started using this in 2012.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>and it does exactly what it said it does.</li>
            <li>and this is the first product that I have been able to use that hasn&#x27;t left a rash on my face.</li>
            <li>the skin refresher very easily took off the dry skin</li>
            <li>For me, my self-esteem is directly tied to Cellbone&#x27;s Prep Skin Refresher!!!!</li>
            <li>and when it subsides I apply aloe vera gel over my whole face, let that dry which it quickly does, then a moisturizer with SPF on top of it.  </li>
            <li>It significantly cleared up my adult acne within four days.  </li>
            <li>My face was clear and felt so clean.</li>
            <li>The nuetralizer is a good product as well although its effects are not as obvious because it only nutralizes the effects of the acid( which is important)[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>My pores were larger and my skin used to be oily to the point of embarrassment and now my complexion is much smoother, clearer and more matte.  </li>
            <li>and it actually feels good because it feels like its actually dissolving everything in my pores.</li>
            <li>and I agree with the rest of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did not completely give up on this product</li>
            <li>They also included samples of their facial cleanser and glycolic peel in sizes that were almost full size!  </li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and have suffered oily skin and mild acnes over the years.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for sensitive skin, it&#x27;s pretty powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>always read the instructions, be a smart customer.</li>
            <li>It seems to actually draw other skin products deeper into the skin and dry faster and has had no adverse or unwanted effects just beautiful clean skin.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Really, just for a moment.  </li>
            <li>My face is much clearer and smoother now.  </li>
            <li>Start light like this companys 35% peel then move up in strength 2 or 3 months later.</li>
            <li>as time when on not so much.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>so i started to use this toner on my whole face and let it sit for a min or two and rinse and apply a matte toner.</li>
            <li>I really did not need to use this</li>
            <li>and my skin is ready for my moisturizers after it dries.  </li>
            <li>combine with a red light therapy ( yes it works</li>
            <li>This product has absolutely changed my life.  </li>
            <li>However those pimples healed incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li>It cleans my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I DONT REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Very efficient.  </li>
            <li>I really have not noticed a difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>this is one of my very favorites.  </li>
            <li>I know this is playing an important part because the improvements were obviously accelerated with its addition.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely reorder this.  </li>
            <li>It came with a sample of their face wash, which I will absolutely order when I am out.</li>
            <li>purchase also came with a free collagen facial cleansing gel.  </li>
            <li>Really prepares the skin.</li>
            <li>I have multiple repeat purchases of the product and it is still working well to keep my skin smooth and clearer than it would otherwise be without using this</li>
            <li>This product works really well to reduce acne and blackheads</li>
            <li>My skin is really smooth and younger looking after using this product for a couple months.</li>
            <li>I really like this toner.</li>
            <li>This product tingles my face...and makes me feel like i have REALLY finished getting all the oil and make up off my face, after washing.</li>
            <li>I always follow up with Vitamin C serum for the acne scars and use a sunscreen moisturizer in the morning and straight up borage oil at night.</li>
            <li>I do like it but don&#x27;t think is worth paying more than my regular toner since it does the same job.</li>
            <li>I do feel my skin is much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and loved it, usually everything irritates my sensitive skin and makes me break out.</li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old white female that has never been the one with the \\&quot;good skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>it effectively encourages cell turnover and removes acne-creating dead skin cells, dirt, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toner for approximately 2 years now and have been more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>The company always throws in a free sample of one of their other products, One of which is their collagen gel facial wash which I love and will also order.</li>
            <li>Iv&#x27;e tried many other products but this one beats all..skin looks smooth,clean and you feel some stinging or burning for couple min.</li>
            <li>It has a slight sting but nothing to bad :) GREAT PRODUCT :)</li>
            <li>I used this stuff after washing my face and it made my face feel extra clean however</li>
            <li>this stuff wipes your face so clean it even feels different.</li>
            <li>I like how my skin feels afterwards; clean, cool, and bright, especially after sitting in an office all day with stale air.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few products over the years but never anything that has so quickly and effectively made such a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Then we use the 100% pure Hyaluronic acid, once that soaks in we top it with a few drops of 100% pure Moroccan Argan oil.   </li>
            <li>I added this and my skin is clear for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li>However, I love it so much that I actually use it as a regular day to day toner now.  </li>
            <li>second rinse with cool water on a lighter peel solution; however, I used it.</li>
            <li>I love this toner because you can feel it get down into your skin.</li>
            <li>with my Black skin I don&#x27;t want to use a product that will cause more hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li>do)that you are not wasting your money on the products I have tried from this particular company.</li>
            <li>Particularly for what it cost</li>
            <li>Very few break outs and the scars are significantly lighter!!</li>
            <li>Like many others have stated, i got a sample of there collogen facial cleanser and an acid peel with my toner, so I put in another order for the full size and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with oily, problem skin.</li>
            <li>(Shipping from Cellbone was almost $7, high by my standards)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend (which I already did to my neighbor and both of my sisters).</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It stings a little, but I love that---</li>
            <li>But it leaves your face feeling so clean without feeling stripped and dry.  </li>
            <li>It really does clear up your skin.</li>
            <li>They say dead skin cells is what causes most acne break outs and</li>
            <li>I would say that I have normal skin.</li>
            <li>I rarely have breakouts such as blackhead and acne since I started using this product 4 months ago.</li>
            <li>and i had no negative reaction to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I&#x27;ve had this product for 4 days and all I can say is...</li>
            <li>I love how this cleans, is fragrant-free, helps shed dead skin, and washes away with a splash or two of water.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it opens the pores up so your anti-wrinkle/moisturizers actually penetrate into the skin where they can be absorbed.</li>
            <li>This makes the challenge of finding good products both daunting and exhausting.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone with mild to severe acne, like myself, because it has worked wonders for me and I will be buying more of this in the future and possibly try some of their other products as well.  </li>
            <li>The company also sent me a pretty decent size sample of their facial wash.  </li>
            <li>Also, Cellbone threw in 2 other free samples that I haven&#x27;t tried yet</li>
            <li>A new staple in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>However I don&#x27;t believe in wasting so after the new acne diminished</li>
            <li>I use it before I apply LifeCell and everyone has noticed the new me and glow my skin has.</li>
            <li>made my skin super dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>all i wished for was not to have super dry skin.</li>
            <li>when having super dry skin</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable enough to go out in public without make up already.</li>
            <li>; but I do always think it might be a bit harsh on more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>also i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than Clinique&#x27;s toners I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>the first aplication,5 min a week later</li>
            <li>the first time i used the cleanser and skin refresher i instantly saw a glow and brightness to my skin i had not seen in some time.</li>
            <li>My husband said to me this morning that my skin has done a complete 180!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware that not every product works for everyone, and everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so this review is in no way bashing the product.</li>
            <li>In addition to it&#x27;s performance, it makes your skin really soft and it gives your skin a radiant glow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a 10% salicylic acid peel (which is oil soluble so it can break through the sebum; essentially the first layer)</li>
            <li>I had more acne these past three weeks .  </li>
            <li>Cleanse, apply this prep \\&quot;toner\\&quot;, follow with a little aloe vera gel and light moisturizer with high spf.</li>
            <li>First of all, everyone understands how one&#x27;s facial appearance is directly tied to one&#x27;s self-esteem.</li>
            <li>They include a sample of one of their other products they offer which I thought was cool.</li>
            <li>I still have more than half of the bottle left.</li>
            <li>has gone down significantly.</li>
            <li>This is a great Toner for those who have acne issues, I am an African American adult male who has had some problems with acne in the past year.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the combination helps, but it smells great and a little goes a loooooooooong way!</li>
            <li>This has not completely eradicated the problem, but it has helped very much</li>
            <li>I am a 31 year old natural blond with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now, I resorted to using TCA to clear up my blemishes.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear and radiant in a way it has NEVER been before.</li>
            <li>Make my face clear and I feel it</li>
            <li>It has gotten rid of all my blackheads, shrunk my pores, reduced my wrinkles, and almost completely gotten rid of my discoloration and sun spots.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>and it has completely cleared my acne.</li>
            <li>I feel that this product goes a pretty long way.</li>
            <li>Skin is agreeing so far</li>
            <li>and I am 20 years old.  </li>
            <li>Not even joking, I got a sample cleanser with this and use that, with this toner and DCL&#x27;s lightening gel and my skin is has completely turned around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional peels done before</li>
            <li>so I know what to expect, and this is professional quality.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow.  </li>
            <li>The spots on my face from old healed pimples have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>13-yr old son&#x27;s acne was out of control, retin-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dermatologist chemical skin peels that have cost $350 and never had the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far with this product.</li>
            <li>I am 36 years old and is still suffering from break outs.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve seen nothing but improvement.  </li>
            <li>Lets face it, he is also a teen and while he doesn&#x27;t want pimples, he doesn&#x27;t want to take the time with a real skin care regimen morning and night.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 37 years old</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I looked at the ingredients (Glycolic Acid, Bilberry Extract, Sugar Cane Extract, Sugar Maple Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract, Willow Bark Extract, Cucumber Flower Extract) I was surprised because each ingredient alone is warranted for the face and used in peels.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put on too much or your face will be red for awhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be trying it again in the near future to see if my skin can tolerate it enough to let the product do something other than make my face produce more</li>
            <li>I have hormonal acne that just recently started within the past year, which was very bizarre</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed the drastic reduction in acne blemishes on my face and the extensive scarring that I have (mainly hyperpigmentation).  </li>
            <li>I have the occasional mild breakout, and this does dry it out and get rid of it quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I am 54, with normal skin; doesn&#x27;t get very oily, or very dry.</li>
            <li>It really does help and if at first it seems to harsh</li>
            <li>Anyway I&#x27;m glad that I gave this a try even though it seems to be a pretty expensive toner.  </li>
            <li>Only bad thing about the product is that when you first use it, it purges your skin meaning you do break out for the first couple of days but after that the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I never really noticed any difference in my skin after using this, but it was very gentle.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product especially after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li>We use an extraction tool a few nights week to help dislodge the clogs that are ready to come out (and they are purging quickly, he had some of the biggest, most stubborn blackheads and petrified waxy whiteheads I&#x27;d ever seen) and they are little by little all coming out of his face without trauma, bleeding, or scarring.   </li>
            <li>Well after using prep for the first time it felt as if I never had those rough spots.</li>
            <li>This product does what it says -- it certainly removes the excess dirt, oil, make-up from your face before washing, however, it severly dried out my skin under my eyes and the skin right next to my nose.  </li>
            <li>I use this after I clean my face, put some on a cotton ball and wipe twice a day (I only do my neck and chest once a week because that skin is way more sensitive and peels like crazy).</li>
            <li>I am 24 years old, brown skin african american and suffer from old, and sometimes new acne scars on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman who has been fighting against extreme oily skin, acne and large pores since my teens.</li>
            <li>using this toner for a few weeks straight i started noticing that my skin was getting way more oiler than usual and because of my skin getting oiler, it caused me to break out.</li>
            <li>It dried my skin out and it seemed at first it was trapping new acne under my skin</li>
            <li>It might cause redness and slight peeling on the first week of initial use, but that is normal.</li>
            <li>fast shipped, received items quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a product online that I could use to lighten or completely remove my hyper pigmentation on my cheeks, some of my chin and parts of my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to the letter.</li>
            <li>: I am a 42-yr old Asian-Pacific Islander and have medium-tone skin, which essentially translates into severe post-acne hyperpigmentation anytime I break out.</li>
            <li>It is possible I have overly sensitive skin, though.</li>
            <li>My face actually feels soft and moisturized as I&#x27;m washing/rinsing.  </li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old African American who has suffered from acne since 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>I even made sure not to have broken skin (didnt matter), my face was litterally  on fire.</li>
            <li>After my acne started to calm down, but I was left with noticeable acne scaring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3-4 weeks now, and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve had less breakouts and the scarring left from my past acne</li>
            <li>my initial review, I gave this toner another star because it&#x27;s done pretty much everything it says (minus the healthy looking complexion, I&#x27;m still waiting on that) but have not decided to give it 4 stars since I believe there are other products out there that are less harsh and can accomplish the same things.</li>
            <li>This really cleans deep down and helped clear my skin.</li>
            <li>Be very careful as it is very drying.</li>
            <li>I am a 44 year old African American woman with acne.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>my skin has seen a major improvement and it has only been about a month!!</li>
            <li>Over the last year especially I have been dealing with the scarring from this acne and have been experimenting with tons of products that can both deal with the cystic acne and the scarring with little success.  </li>
            <li>The dark spots are noticeably faded and my skin is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I am an African American female, 40 years young, with acne prone and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>During the first week a few pimples emerged, I think my skin was purging submerged problems.</li>
            <li>After going to three different dermatologists and being put on 3 different skin regimens, it wasn&#x27;t till my third try that my acne finally started to clear up.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money because it actually will improve your skin unlike the hundreds of products that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>This works so well, that even if he slacks on cleansing and starts seeing some acne, he uses Prep which helps right way (and usually gets him back to his skin routine).  </li>
            <li>I am a Black woman in my late 30s who has been dealing with cystic acne for the better part of 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I use this product in the morning and at night and, after the first night, the multiple tiny bumps on my nose were reduced to only a few wimpy bumps.</li>

            <li> I just tried them and am really thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> thank you so much Cellbone for making a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This prep may also be a nice mini peel tonic to be used after one washes their face.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that if you have problem aging skin</li>
            <li> an counting where I was having them atleast once a week before purchasing this toner, Make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards thou, I use hyaluronic acid which is a good moisturizer also an can be purchased here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> good i will order more thank you</li>
            <li> This product had so many good reviews</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t think that it was achieved by this toner on its own.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I bought this toner because the ingredients seemed great and the reviews were pretty good.</li>
            <li> After I clean my face it makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> but since im super happy that i found my new best friend (prep)</li>
            <li> like all the products this brand make work perfect , is not necesary expend a lot of money for have young skin</li>
            <li> plus, they include a great collagen face wash that I&#x27;m enjoying as a free gift &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It was worth the price for beautiful skin :)</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s too strong for my skin, but it puts my oil glands into over-drive!</li>
            <li> I follow with a good clean moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> i have very smooth skin....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong stuff but effective.  </li>
            <li> I love this, I bought because of reviews and ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> I really love the products they are so refreshing.</li>
            <li> The service from the company is top notch and reliable.</li>
            <li> But then again everyones skin is different, so just try and experiment with what is best for your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love the tingle :-)</li>
            <li> Love it alone.</li>
            <li> /support my healthy skin plan of action.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Most days I don&#x27;t even put any cover up on</li>
            <li> I was able to use alcohol instead</li>
            <li> This toner also has some glycolic acid in it, so I&#x27;m sure that helps a lot.</li>
            <li> so I am very optimistic that I too will get great results for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have noticed many changes in my skin since I began using this product 2 months ago.  </li>
            <li> This is my first--and maybe only--online review, but considering how much dermatologists charge for skin care kits, I wanted to flag this product as a great value.</li>
            <li> This stuff has given me the light at the end of the tunnel feeling!</li>
            <li> Love the neutralizer and prep for before and after using the peel....</li>
            <li> being in the skin care field, I just love all the products..</li>
            <li> I do not know that it is doing more than a 60</li>
            <li> even after cleaning my face with makeup remover wipes, this product finds more to remove.</li>
            <li> I feel it helps anything you use after this to absorb better.</li>
            <li> (I attribute most of it to job-stress</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> We love this.</li>
            <li> All of Cellbone&#x27;s products are great, the lists of ingredients are all things I can pronounce, it&#x27;s like they make natural-based products that really work.</li>
            <li> I even visted their website, and they have even more stuff</li>
            <li> My skin started looking so much better</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s pretty amazing to me!  </li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> Love that this is more than just a neutralizer to prep skin before adding serums or creams.</li>
            <li> but my skin was so smooth!</li>
            <li> Wish it had more glycolic though.</li>
            <li> so now im trying to give it away for free on craigslist &amp; still NO TAKERS!</li>
            <li> Excellent Toner, though I didn&#x27;t recognize that what I am buying is a toner when I add it to my cart; I thought it is a Facial Wash, I dont know</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m still Satisfied.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m gonna buy it for sure.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and wouldn&#x27;t start my day without it now.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will buy it over and over again...</li>
            <li> i do love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful that it will work better now that I have an understanding of how I should use it.</li>
            <li> How many products does just that?</li>
            <li> Free sample of a face wash which smells nice is a plus as well.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> though it need more time  to get my skin get used to refreshner  </li>
            <li> Would love to have these scars go away quicker</li>
            <li> but that is still a work in progress :)</li>
            <li> I love using this before I apply makeup as well.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely re-order these products and more from this company!!!</li>
            <li> The results are pretty good.</li>
            <li> very nicely packaged with a free (good sized) sample of their facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Which is what it supose to do..plus the free face wash is really good-refreshing, smells great</li>
            <li> I used this after many reviews and this stuff is strong.  </li>
            <li> Best daily toner, my skin is glowing and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I hope this product will help ward off any fine lines and wrinkles too :)</li>
            <li> Gets all debris off skin before a light acid peel, love this</li>
            <li> Also love the free samples that come with it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin supple and fresh and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Seller did a good job getting it to me in a reasonable timeframe; product is just not for me.</li>
            <li> I can easily see a huge, huge difference!    </li>
            <li> Love love love this a quick method to clean your face remove all the dirt &amp; oil off your face while your in bed before you sleep.</li>
            <li> those who have significant others that love to get so close to your face).</li>
            <li> I would like my skin to get a bit better before I&#x27;m brave enough to post the pictures for you all, but stay tuned.</li>
            <li> Very mild stinging.</li>
            <li> Because it is to strong for my skin type and feel burning after i use it.  </li>
            <li> was strong at the beginning.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see two large samples of this cleanser and a lactic acid / glycolic acid peel in my order.  </li>
            <li> I think it works best right after a hot shower while my pores are still open, although it stings more and leaves some redness for about 15 minutes or so, but I can see more immediate results.</li>
            <li> ( totally loved it )  and though  I can be an add to a  new routine and will include Skin prep refreshner in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it is helping with the fine lines as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the first skin care product I am truly satisfied with.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is a clean, fresh palate, and that it makes my skin better able to soak up the moisturizer I use before I apply my cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it came in the mail SUPER FAST!!!!  </li>
            <li> I no longer have huge greasy pores to contend with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light peel.</li>
            <li> But overall I am completely happy with this product.    </li>
            <li> I have sparingly used the free sample sized cleanser that came with my order.  </li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS SO SMOOTH AND RADIANT</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and the order was filled and shipped in no time.</li>
            <li> They even included a free sample.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this company&#x27;s products; this one is really great.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten that I had GREAT skin up until recently.</li>
            <li> My face is really smooth and it is brighter.  </li>
            <li> It removes all flaky dead skin so my make-up goes on flawlessly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important that your daytime lotion contains a sunscreen with this product.  </li>
            <li> a great part of a facial cleaning regimin.</li>
            <li> Goes away once you smooth on a moisturizer, so</li>
            <li> My skin absolutely looks amazing now.</li>
            <li> The glow on my skin was unmistakeable and my makeup went on so smoothly</li>
            <li> i use these two products together for smooth glowing skin.</li>
            <li> and it makes your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> Your face is smooth after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but afterwards I have baby smooth skin that glows (</li>
            <li> I did buy this primarily as a prep for an acid peel.</li>
            <li> Great product, I ordered it and 2 days later on my door step.</li>
            <li> When I got it it came with a free sample of face wash.</li>
            <li> its great for cystic acne, adult acne, and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Has made a significant improvement in my skin, just in 1 week.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m not disappointed because I figure it is helping maintain</li>
            <li> I havent tried the 60% I originally ordered yet.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to see what it would do for my skin before writing a review and the results have been nothing short of remarkable.  </li>
            <li> At first it seems to just be water, but this stuff is potent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the momentary discomfort!  </li>
            <li> Ordered two bottles (first mistake), Yes it arrived on time applyed it thinking i would feel a lil tingle at the most....</li>
            <li> I received this product about a week ago and ichave to say that I see results already my skin and acne has been reduced significantly</li>
            <li> If you want extremely clean skin</li>
            <li> and i had a super smooth skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is how it should be when a company makes a mistake, but it is rare and I sooooo appreciate how easy this was.</li>
            <li> It has glycolic acid that is even MORE effective if the sebum is disinigrated as it is only water soluble (the layer below the sebum).</li>
            <li> My skin does feel fresh, clean, and smooth after using this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clearer and more radiant and so much softer.  </li>
            <li> In-order to get the full benefits of a peel you have to make this your step 1.  </li>
            <li> From a day toner to a quick clean wipe with a cotton ball.....and just before peels.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve been using it full strength morning and evening, every day.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel fresh and oil free.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day for my skin can&#x27;t handle it more than that, but it definitively helps remove excess dirt and preps the skin for moisturizer very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say if it makes a difference in my skin tone since I&#x27;m using other products for that, but I do feel it&#x27;s a good prep before I apply serums, and I feel my skin is much cleaner when I use it after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews are great</li>
            <li> I feel a mild stinging and a tingling sensation while applying prep on my skin</li>
            <li> i will most def be coming back to cellbone for more since this product is the answer to my face issues (acne, acne scars, hyperpigmentation, dullness, &amp; signs of aging)</li>
            <li> I decided it was time to start a more healthy skin regimen to prevent any future breakouts, and hopefully my scars would be reduced in the process over time.</li>
            <li> I apply this after I wash my face with a mild cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My skin has tremendously improved, texture, clarity, brightness, you name it.</li>
            <li> skin was still getting super oily after one hour I used the toner .</li>
            <li> so I used pre-moistened face wipes &amp; hot water (when it was available) to cleanse my face &amp; always followed up with the Prep Skin Refresher.</li>
            <li> I also use an organic exfoliating scrub every morning then apply a vitamin c lotion with spf afterwards which I also believe contributes to my new found healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product and may go for a professional glycolic peel in a month if the deeper, darker scars are still apparent.  </li>
            <li> Also as a side note, I suggest you put a really good moisturizer on your face afterwards because it made my face really dry.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about spending $18 on just toner, but all my worries went out the window after the first day!</li>
            <li> Instead of testing it I got excited because of the results I received the first two days of use.</li>
            <li> OMG!!&lt;br /&gt;i also have very light adult acne, still waiting results on that</li>
            <li> Thanks for quick ship, and samples...will buy again from you!</li>
            <li> I have (had) very oily skin with huge pores.</li>
            <li> but im sure that will clear up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, but I SWEAR it&#x27;s worth trying if you have acne/hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think that would ever be possible for</li>
            <li> Worth mentioning</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> Now if only I could find an effective eye cream...</li>
            <li> pimples aren&#x27;t so out of control, and I definitely see more of a smooth &amp; toned complexion.  </li>
            <li> such a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m giving myself a mini peel every day. :)</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Made my skin look fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Prep and still loving it.</li>
            <li> I burn pretty easily and I blame myself for using this too soon and too much.</li>
            <li> Cellbone also makes an excellent Body Peel that I&#x27;ve been using on my other problem areas with similar results.</li>
            <li> I experienced a little dryness and irritation around my nose edges and lines around my mouth when I first used it.</li>
            <li> I also received a free small bottle of collagen facial wash by Cellbone that was included in my order and it too is awesome.  </li>
            <li> ( you know that dark skin on both of those areas that can occur), well, I am glad to say that I have noticed such a great difference in all the areas I&#x27;ve used it on.</li>
            <li> right b4 peel.</li>
            <li> I use this product right after washing my face at night...</li>
            <li> Prep will stimulate new skin cells and promote a clear, smooth, healthy looking complexion.]]</li>
            <li> I have been following new routines, but this toner definitely is the best toner i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> My pores are barely noticeable and my skin seems to produce just the right amount of healthy oil.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and smooth and calm.</li>
            <li> But it really does improve your skin)It took me alot of money and a bathroom full of patially used potions to find my miracle.</li>
            <li> The small sample of cleanser they sent with this product is great.</li>
            <li> I am even ordering a little more glycolic acid to add to it because I like about a 10% glycolic now that my skin is more used to being acid washed</li>
            <li> This is a company with high quality products and a sweet worth ethic.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast (faster than the date listed).</li>
            <li> It shipped super fast</li>
            <li> After reading such great reviews on this product I purchased this toner back in April .&lt;br</li>
            <li> wearing concealer &amp; makeup to hide the dark hyperpigmentation, which I&#x27;m certain resulted in more breakouts &#x3D; more hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> , I mean it looks darn near flawless.</li>
            <li> and afterwards I VERY gently dab Cellbone&#x27;s Prep solution over my face.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I noticed it mostly around sensitive areas of my face, I think I may have gotten a more intense feeling because my skin was very try at the time and this could have dried it out even more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique, and within a week, my acne disappeared, and my blackheads on my nose completely vanished!</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> I have used many different astringent/toner after cleansing my face to remove excess oil.  </li>
            <li> that was a surprise bonus product included in my order, I had ordered A 60% gycolac peel from another company that I intended to use with this prep, but chose to try the 35% sample first.</li>
            <li> I took pictures of my skin before I began using and when I looked back at them (before writing this review to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just my imagination)</li>
            <li> , the pads for me are easier) to apply the Prep Refresher on my face and neck, and allow it to work -- I feel a tingling sensation that&#x27;s mostly bearable (!)</li>
            <li> When I first started using it it had quite a bit of a bite but</li>
            <li> I love this product; finally a facial product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to complement my salycilic acid routine skin care and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> First of all, it ships superfast (probably 2 days).</li>
            <li> I ordered this Toner almost two weeks ago and started using it 8 days ago and it has dramatically reduced the acne forming on my face and my scarring that was pretty severe from the cystic nodules that I had on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Love the product, I have just ordered my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I am able to go without makeup now with no embarrassment about red, oily, blemished skin.</li>
            <li> first week I used it, I diluted it 50% with witch hazel because of the way it made my skin burn and tingle.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have purchased from this company, they don&#x27;t has as many items in amazon as they do on their website.   </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, people have been commenting on my complexion.</li>
            <li> will continue to buy (even though they&#x27;re a tad expensive, but I can see why!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &amp; best of luck!</li>
            <li> I am getting compliments on my skin for the first time in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> first time I used it I thought I couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> I first started using this in 2012.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> and it does exactly what it said it does.</li>
            <li> and this is the first product that I have been able to use that hasn&#x27;t left a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> the skin refresher very easily took off the dry skin</li>
            <li> For me, my self-esteem is directly tied to Cellbone&#x27;s Prep Skin Refresher!!!!</li>
            <li> and when it subsides I apply aloe vera gel over my whole face, let that dry which it quickly does, then a moisturizer with SPF on top of it.  </li>
            <li> It significantly cleared up my adult acne within four days.  </li>
            <li> My face was clear and felt so clean.</li>
            <li> The nuetralizer is a good product as well although its effects are not as obvious because it only nutralizes the effects of the acid( which is important)[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My pores were larger and my skin used to be oily to the point of embarrassment and now my complexion is much smoother, clearer and more matte.  </li>
            <li> and it actually feels good because it feels like its actually dissolving everything in my pores.</li>
            <li> and I agree with the rest of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did not completely give up on this product</li>
            <li> They also included samples of their facial cleanser and glycolic peel in sizes that were almost full size!  </li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and have suffered oily skin and mild acnes over the years.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for sensitive skin, it&#x27;s pretty powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> always read the instructions, be a smart customer.</li>
            <li> It seems to actually draw other skin products deeper into the skin and dry faster and has had no adverse or unwanted effects just beautiful clean skin.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Really, just for a moment.  </li>
            <li> My face is much clearer and smoother now.  </li>
            <li> Start light like this companys 35% peel then move up in strength 2 or 3 months later.</li>
            <li> as time when on not so much.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> so i started to use this toner on my whole face and let it sit for a min or two and rinse and apply a matte toner.</li>
            <li> I really did not need to use this</li>
            <li> and my skin is ready for my moisturizers after it dries.  </li>
            <li> combine with a red light therapy ( yes it works</li>
            <li> This product has absolutely changed my life.  </li>
            <li> However those pimples healed incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li> It cleans my skin very well.</li>
            <li> I DONT REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Very efficient.  </li>
            <li> I really have not noticed a difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> this is one of my very favorites.  </li>
            <li> I know this is playing an important part because the improvements were obviously accelerated with its addition.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely reorder this.  </li>
            <li> It came with a sample of their face wash, which I will absolutely order when I am out.</li>
            <li> purchase also came with a free collagen facial cleansing gel.  </li>
            <li> Really prepares the skin.</li>
            <li> I have multiple repeat purchases of the product and it is still working well to keep my skin smooth and clearer than it would otherwise be without using this</li>
            <li> This product works really well to reduce acne and blackheads</li>
            <li> My skin is really smooth and younger looking after using this product for a couple months.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner.</li>
            <li> This product tingles my face...and makes me feel like i have REALLY finished getting all the oil and make up off my face, after washing.</li>
            <li> I always follow up with Vitamin C serum for the acne scars and use a sunscreen moisturizer in the morning and straight up borage oil at night.</li>
            <li> I do like it but don&#x27;t think is worth paying more than my regular toner since it does the same job.</li>
            <li> I do feel my skin is much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and loved it, usually everything irritates my sensitive skin and makes me break out.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old white female that has never been the one with the \\&quot;good skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it effectively encourages cell turnover and removes acne-creating dead skin cells, dirt, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for approximately 2 years now and have been more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> The company always throws in a free sample of one of their other products, One of which is their collagen gel facial wash which I love and will also order.</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e tried many other products but this one beats all..skin looks smooth,clean and you feel some stinging or burning for couple min.</li>
            <li> It has a slight sting but nothing to bad :) GREAT PRODUCT :)</li>
            <li> I used this stuff after washing my face and it made my face feel extra clean however</li>
            <li> this stuff wipes your face so clean it even feels different.</li>
            <li> I like how my skin feels afterwards; clean, cool, and bright, especially after sitting in an office all day with stale air.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few products over the years but never anything that has so quickly and effectively made such a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Then we use the 100% pure Hyaluronic acid, once that soaks in we top it with a few drops of 100% pure Moroccan Argan oil.   </li>
            <li> I added this and my skin is clear for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li> However, I love it so much that I actually use it as a regular day to day toner now.  </li>
            <li> second rinse with cool water on a lighter peel solution; however, I used it.</li>
            <li> I love this toner because you can feel it get down into your skin.</li>
            <li> with my Black skin I don&#x27;t want to use a product that will cause more hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> do)that you are not wasting your money on the products I have tried from this particular company.</li>
            <li> Particularly for what it cost</li>
            <li> Very few break outs and the scars are significantly lighter!!</li>
            <li> Like many others have stated, i got a sample of there collogen facial cleanser and an acid peel with my toner, so I put in another order for the full size and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with oily, problem skin.</li>
            <li> (Shipping from Cellbone was almost $7, high by my standards)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend (which I already did to my neighbor and both of my sisters).</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It stings a little, but I love that---</li>
            <li> But it leaves your face feeling so clean without feeling stripped and dry.  </li>
            <li> It really does clear up your skin.</li>
            <li> They say dead skin cells is what causes most acne break outs and</li>
            <li> I would say that I have normal skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely have breakouts such as blackhead and acne since I started using this product 4 months ago.</li>
            <li> and i had no negative reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I&#x27;ve had this product for 4 days and all I can say is...</li>
            <li> I love how this cleans, is fragrant-free, helps shed dead skin, and washes away with a splash or two of water.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it opens the pores up so your anti-wrinkle/moisturizers actually penetrate into the skin where they can be absorbed.</li>
            <li> This makes the challenge of finding good products both daunting and exhausting.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone with mild to severe acne, like myself, because it has worked wonders for me and I will be buying more of this in the future and possibly try some of their other products as well.  </li>
            <li> The company also sent me a pretty decent size sample of their facial wash.  </li>
            <li> Also, Cellbone threw in 2 other free samples that I haven&#x27;t tried yet</li>
            <li> A new staple in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t believe in wasting so after the new acne diminished</li>
            <li> I use it before I apply LifeCell and everyone has noticed the new me and glow my skin has.</li>
            <li> made my skin super dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> all i wished for was not to have super dry skin.</li>
            <li> when having super dry skin</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable enough to go out in public without make up already.</li>
            <li> ; but I do always think it might be a bit harsh on more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> also i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than Clinique&#x27;s toners I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> the first aplication,5 min a week later</li>
            <li> the first time i used the cleanser and skin refresher i instantly saw a glow and brightness to my skin i had not seen in some time.</li>
            <li> My husband said to me this morning that my skin has done a complete 180!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware that not every product works for everyone, and everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so this review is in no way bashing the product.</li>
            <li> In addition to it&#x27;s performance, it makes your skin really soft and it gives your skin a radiant glow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a 10% salicylic acid peel (which is oil soluble so it can break through the sebum; essentially the first layer)</li>
            <li> I had more acne these past three weeks .  </li>
            <li> Cleanse, apply this prep \\&quot;toner\\&quot;, follow with a little aloe vera gel and light moisturizer with high spf.</li>
            <li> First of all, everyone understands how one&#x27;s facial appearance is directly tied to one&#x27;s self-esteem.</li>
            <li> They include a sample of one of their other products they offer which I thought was cool.</li>
            <li> I still have more than half of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> has gone down significantly.</li>
            <li> This is a great Toner for those who have acne issues, I am an African American adult male who has had some problems with acne in the past year.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the combination helps, but it smells great and a little goes a loooooooooong way!</li>
            <li> This has not completely eradicated the problem, but it has helped very much</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old natural blond with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now, I resorted to using TCA to clear up my blemishes.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear and radiant in a way it has NEVER been before.</li>
            <li> Make my face clear and I feel it</li>
            <li> It has gotten rid of all my blackheads, shrunk my pores, reduced my wrinkles, and almost completely gotten rid of my discoloration and sun spots.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> and it has completely cleared my acne.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product goes a pretty long way.</li>
            <li> Skin is agreeing so far</li>
            <li> and I am 20 years old.  </li>
            <li> Not even joking, I got a sample cleanser with this and use that, with this toner and DCL&#x27;s lightening gel and my skin is has completely turned around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional peels done before</li>
            <li> so I know what to expect, and this is professional quality.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow.  </li>
            <li> The spots on my face from old healed pimples have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> 13-yr old son&#x27;s acne was out of control, retin-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dermatologist chemical skin peels that have cost $350 and never had the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far with this product.</li>
            <li> I am 36 years old and is still suffering from break outs.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve seen nothing but improvement.  </li>
            <li> Lets face it, he is also a teen and while he doesn&#x27;t want pimples, he doesn&#x27;t want to take the time with a real skin care regimen morning and night.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 37 years old</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I looked at the ingredients (Glycolic Acid, Bilberry Extract, Sugar Cane Extract, Sugar Maple Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract, Willow Bark Extract, Cucumber Flower Extract) I was surprised because each ingredient alone is warranted for the face and used in peels.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put on too much or your face will be red for awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying it again in the near future to see if my skin can tolerate it enough to let the product do something other than make my face produce more</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne that just recently started within the past year, which was very bizarre</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed the drastic reduction in acne blemishes on my face and the extensive scarring that I have (mainly hyperpigmentation).  </li>
            <li> I have the occasional mild breakout, and this does dry it out and get rid of it quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I am 54, with normal skin; doesn&#x27;t get very oily, or very dry.</li>
            <li> It really does help and if at first it seems to harsh</li>
            <li> Anyway I&#x27;m glad that I gave this a try even though it seems to be a pretty expensive toner.  </li>
            <li> Only bad thing about the product is that when you first use it, it purges your skin meaning you do break out for the first couple of days but after that the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I never really noticed any difference in my skin after using this, but it was very gentle.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product especially after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li> We use an extraction tool a few nights week to help dislodge the clogs that are ready to come out (and they are purging quickly, he had some of the biggest, most stubborn blackheads and petrified waxy whiteheads I&#x27;d ever seen) and they are little by little all coming out of his face without trauma, bleeding, or scarring.   </li>
            <li> Well after using prep for the first time it felt as if I never had those rough spots.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says -- it certainly removes the excess dirt, oil, make-up from your face before washing, however, it severly dried out my skin under my eyes and the skin right next to my nose.  </li>
            <li> I use this after I clean my face, put some on a cotton ball and wipe twice a day (I only do my neck and chest once a week because that skin is way more sensitive and peels like crazy).</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old, brown skin african american and suffer from old, and sometimes new acne scars on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman who has been fighting against extreme oily skin, acne and large pores since my teens.</li>
            <li> using this toner for a few weeks straight i started noticing that my skin was getting way more oiler than usual and because of my skin getting oiler, it caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out and it seemed at first it was trapping new acne under my skin</li>
            <li> It might cause redness and slight peeling on the first week of initial use, but that is normal.</li>
            <li> fast shipped, received items quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product online that I could use to lighten or completely remove my hyper pigmentation on my cheeks, some of my chin and parts of my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to the letter.</li>
            <li> : I am a 42-yr old Asian-Pacific Islander and have medium-tone skin, which essentially translates into severe post-acne hyperpigmentation anytime I break out.</li>
            <li> It is possible I have overly sensitive skin, though.</li>
            <li> My face actually feels soft and moisturized as I&#x27;m washing/rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old African American who has suffered from acne since 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> I even made sure not to have broken skin (didnt matter), my face was litterally  on fire.</li>
            <li> After my acne started to calm down, but I was left with noticeable acne scaring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3-4 weeks now, and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve had less breakouts and the scarring left from my past acne</li>
            <li> my initial review, I gave this toner another star because it&#x27;s done pretty much everything it says (minus the healthy looking complexion, I&#x27;m still waiting on that) but have not decided to give it 4 stars since I believe there are other products out there that are less harsh and can accomplish the same things.</li>
            <li> This really cleans deep down and helped clear my skin.</li>
            <li> Be very careful as it is very drying.</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old African American woman with acne.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> my skin has seen a major improvement and it has only been about a month!!</li>
            <li> Over the last year especially I have been dealing with the scarring from this acne and have been experimenting with tons of products that can both deal with the cystic acne and the scarring with little success.  </li>
            <li> The dark spots are noticeably faded and my skin is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American female, 40 years young, with acne prone and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> During the first week a few pimples emerged, I think my skin was purging submerged problems.</li>
            <li> After going to three different dermatologists and being put on 3 different skin regimens, it wasn&#x27;t till my third try that my acne finally started to clear up.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money because it actually will improve your skin unlike the hundreds of products that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> This works so well, that even if he slacks on cleansing and starts seeing some acne, he uses Prep which helps right way (and usually gets him back to his skin routine).  </li>
            <li> I am a Black woman in my late 30s who has been dealing with cystic acne for the better part of 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I use this product in the morning and at night and, after the first night, the multiple tiny bumps on my nose were reduced to only a few wimpy bumps.</li>
            <li> is that even when it feels irritated, I&#x27;ve never experienced any redness from using it (which I do with many other products).</li>
            <li> Work through it because the results are WORTH EVERY MINUTE of slight (or not so slight) discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;---------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m certain that it helps to push out new skin cells because I had a few acne scar spots that dried up</li>
            <li> 33 and  have oily, active, acne proned  and sensitive to some products skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry, fair skin with some annoying dark spots and large (not gigantic) pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li> I use just enough to saturate a cotton pad and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I did have some initial stinging, but it didn&#x27;t persist long and didn&#x27;t result in any visible irritation.</li>
            <li> Since it has some of the same ingredients as facial peels it works slowly and gently to strip away instead of all at once like a peel does.</li>
            <li> In March, I took a nearly 3-week long trip to hot, dusty Tanzania (climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, went on safari, &amp; then chilled out on Zanzibar).</li>
            <li> I really wish it did anything close to what the other reviewers have written, but it just makes my skin itch when I apply it and less then an hour my face is covered in oil.</li>
            <li> I found myself at the mirror every other day doing extractions, but it has gotten better after a few weeks since I&#x27;ve found less and less to extract.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of dead cells and within about a week you can tell because your skin will look &#x27;new&#x27; and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I chose to buy Prep Skin refresher as the toner I would use because it promotes getting rid of dead skin cells, as well as promoting new cell growth, which I thought would help with my scarring.</li>
            <li> I continued to breakout a bit and was willing to suffer through the breakouts in hopes that things were merely getting worse before they would get better.</li>
            <li> The first few times you might feel a slight tingle but after that you probably won&#x27;t as I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Last year I purchased this as well as a slew of other products to help out my teen son who had some breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product after researching several other skin care products that were similar.  </li>
            <li> Most of the creams and lotions are totally disappointing (Olay and Loreal have done nothing for me, despite their glowing reviews).  </li>
            <li> my facial routine in the morn was a drag and took about 30 mins.</li>
            <li> considering I had absolutely NO acne on my face until recently</li>
            <li> Yeah, I was very skeptical at first about this, but the first thing that I did was look at the reviews.</li>
            <li> Contains 8% Glycolic acid which works deep down in dermis layer causing a 10 second delay in reaction.  </li>
            <li> Plus healing was slow and it I have new red marks all over my skin now .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, nor does it contain the same ingredients that EVERY OTHER TONER HAS...</li>
            <li> and if I do its only a small amount mixed with my daily lotion or just a bit of mineral powder cover up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also avoided wearing foundation on a daily basis as to not stir up any other acne.&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (While the glycolic acid treatment does help, I&#x27;m only doing that every other week).</li>
            <li> I will be trying their other products to see if they are of the same quality.</li>
            <li> After applying for the first time, all the white heads and black heads had started to slowly dissolve and you know that rough feeling you get when you rub your nose and chin</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this, oh, and if you have super sensitive skin, I would suggest diluting it a little to where your skin can tolerate it.  </li>
            <li> My skin has not been overly dry either.  </li>
            <li> and i did not have dry skin anywhere on my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry out</li>
            <li> but it made my skin dry after a couple of days so use sparingly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry and there has been no peeling for me.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin either.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin, I can feel it tingle just slightly</li>
            <li> Lots of tiny bumps covered my entire face, it didnt just remove dead skin cells</li>
            <li> I am 35 and used to have constant ance of all types and have always had uneven skin and giant pores......not anymore!</li>
            <li> been using everyday twice a day for almost a month and barely a break out.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use it as often as I would like because it is quite irritating, but I will attempt to use it daily in the near future.</li>
            <li> It has definitely evened out my skin tone, and reduced my hyperpigmentation from past acne scars (FINALLY!!!</li>
            <li> very dry across the eyebrow/forehead and nose area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27, female, pale complected, battle blackheads/whiteheads on nose and chin, get dry spots on lower parts of cheeks.  </li>
            <li> It stings a little bit especially a day after I used chemical peel on my face.  </li>
            <li> and you only need just a little.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s always so heartwarming to receive the extra little gift this company always includes with each order.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is I cant stand the way it makes my skin tingle during and a little after the application.</li>
            <li> I suffered from old acne scars and pimples and discoloration and dull complexion.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product another try after my favorite toner ran out (I hate to waste), and I would have to say there are a some good and bad points to it.</li>
            <li> and Ill tell you it has really put my acne into remmision big time</li>
            <li> They even give discounts for military getting shipments to APO.  </li>
            <li> My advice, if you&#x27;re skeptical about this stuff, it&#x27;s understandable, seeing how pricey it is compared to the cheaper stuff, but trust me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and initially it was to harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> There is no real evidence that this product works.</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;ssafe enough to use everyday for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> The 35% glycolic-lactic peel works just as expected.  </li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff unless you have experience.</li>
            <li> so I really figured there was nothing I could do about my poor complexion).</li>
            <li> Rough texture and skin surface \\&quot;bumps.\\</li>
            <li> This happened few months back</li>
            <li> If I miss a day or night cleansing my skin feels rough.  </li>
            <li> (I hate dealing with that kind if thing)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I let it dry and settle in then cover face and neck with a small amount of an organic facial vitamin lotion.</li>
            <li> This product gives a slight burn the few times you use it, but nothing that is unbearable and only lasts a minute or two.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight stinging that only lasts a few seconds while it dries which means it is doing it job.  </li>
            <li> It took a lot of moisturizing and a lot of time for my skin to heal and I had only used the product a few times (less than a week).  </li>
            <li> my usual routine was scrub and scrub and then apply my facial cream.</li>
            <li> I had to endure a bit of a breakout that emerged as my skin cells were turning over due to the prep refresher.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the Prep Skin Refresher daily, usually in the a.m. &amp; in the p.m. I haven&#x27;t changed any other face, body, or hair products--</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know that other toners wouldn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a skin care rampage the past year searching for products that actually DO something and</li>
            <li> I apply once every other day and sparingly.</li>
            <li> It does sting especially if you are like myself and have used Retin A in the past and have thin/sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Now... I will be checking out all of their other products.</li>
            <li> Within ONLY TWO USES prep has lighten the color of my acne scars and the current pimples and has decreased the pimple sizes.</li>
            <li> what the crap can a red light do.</li>
            <li> , I have not had an active pimple in three weeks now</li>
            <li> Few days afterward I started to dry out and get discoloration.</li>
            <li> The only thing bad I have to say is that when you first put it on, it can be a little harsh, so I&#x27;m not sure if people with sensitive skin should try it, but that&#x27;s just for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product is not right stuff for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is not your average toner.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone having issues with dark spots.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how dark they were before using.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does NOT taste good at all, and if you accidentally get it on your lip, you&#x27;ll be miserable for about 30 minutes!!</li>
            <li> I am a black African woman and I understand how hard it is to find products that work well with our skin.</li>
            <li> there is a slight tingle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a tingle or slight sting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the beginning of March, and I still have half the bottle</li>
            <li> The acne marks are slightly fading as well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> but it has helped with oiliness, and less breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I had 4-5 small blemishes pop up and a few unusually dry patches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy it again a few months down the road.</li>
            <li> They go away quickly and don&#x27;t leave the ugly marks.</li>
            <li> was a little tingle but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a little over a month now and here are some of my observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a little sting to it, when applied to skin cleaned with Cellbone&#x27;s glycolic cleanser.  </li>
            <li> little about me/</li>
            <li> I was mad at first</li>
            <li> Stings just a little, but works by dissolving excess dead skin and makeup.</li>
            <li> It will take some time for me now  to get my clear skin back  and heal those ugly marks .</li>
            <li> ever since I started using this, my face never breaks out unless i&#x27;m really stressed and been staying up for crazy hours.</li>
            <li> Prep skin refresher helps remove dead skin cells, excess oil, and any residue after cleansing.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with breakouts all of my life.  </li>
            <li> I have gone to lots of docs and still have trouble.  </li>
            <li> (they were scabs at the time) and healed up after a few days of using the toner.</li>
            <li> You can always do it again in a few months.</li>
            <li> My breakouts stopped \\&quot;dead in their tracks,\\&quot; and my hyperpigmentation appeared to improve.</li>
            <li> I like how the solution takes away all of the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face feel sticky once dried.  </li>
            <li> but it was missing something.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day after washing my face for a few days now</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had a few blemishes that just would not budge and after using this, they have been shrinking and disappearing.  </li>
            <li> I had to do this for a few weeks until my sensitivity subsided.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that removed dead skin cells without causing irritation.</li>
            <li> It is slighty irritating but not enough to stop using the product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago for peels.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel a slight tingling sensation which usually goes away when I apply moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I used to use just plain witchhazel as a cleaner/toner and which I still keep on hand, but I like this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> its very hard to apply eye makeup and foundation on when dry skin makes it look</li>
            <li> I paid 300 hundred dollars for a peel in my cosmetic surgeons office and got the same results; burning/stinging , tight uncomfortable skin for two days, flaking skin 3 to 5 days after ......</li>
            <li> I had a little pimple and this morning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old, and I&#x27;ve had a rough past with bad acne.</li>
            <li> The price may be a little high, but considering, it isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> so it was so strange to me that I started breaking out badly the last 2 years.</li>
            <li> I usually use it before I do my at home peel.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it is prepping me for anything</li>
            <li> not sure if that&#x27;s what is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Still working on getting rid of some small scars.  </li>
            <li> My medication was not working as well as it was in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m that lazy XD</li>
            <li> I was just looking for a toner that would help exfoliate the dead skin off my face after my chemical peel but didn&#x27;t realize it had glycolic acid in it!  </li>
            <li> Usually, when my skin doesn&#x27;t work well with products, it&#x27;ll react to it in a day or so.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I am recovering from a horrible, horrible breakout and I feel more confident in my skin after using these 2 gems.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Tingling wasn&#x27;t bothering me no more .</li>
            <li> No more of this stuff for me.</li>
            <li> Having oily skin, it&#x27;s hard to find products to truly tame the oil, yet balance your skin.  </li>
            <li> other secret weapon is a Glycolic acid pumpkin mask.</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin allergies and dry skin, hence only occasional use.</li>
            <li> it is awfully hard to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> Sucks that I keep spending my money on products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I started to break out like crazy after regular use of this \\&quot;refresher.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Acne is a complex problem with a lot of causes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> shave or exfoliate at least 10 to 12 hours BEFORE or AFTER using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 yrs old and have oily skin and often got pimples in the worst places that stayed forver and left hideous marks.</li>
            <li> By that I mean as I wipe my face it burns momentarily.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a small price to pay to help your self-esteem!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does sometimes make my skin burn/tingle rather unpleasantly, but it&#x27;s only for a couple of minutes before that subsides.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and everyone is telling me how \\&quot;crazy good\\&quot; my skin looks!</li>
            <li> I do not have even one pimple on my face and my skin seriously glows.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Still makes my skin itch when I apply the toner, but overall it&#x27;s not as bad as it used to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 5 days since I received it and started using: It has lessened the darkening of some of the scars and a few of the lighter ones are so faint</li>
            <li> well i was dead wrong.  </li>
            <li> I hate the white/ black heads poking out of my skin because its so rough and annoying to the touch and its actually embarrassing(for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne my since my preteen years and having kids made it worse.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister, she was secretly taking some from my room every night.</li>
            <li> the product on my poor skin, but</li>
            <li> I read some bad reviews for it and one person complained that it didn&#x27;t work but mentioned that they rinsed it off.</li>
            <li> After having my second child, I&#x27;ve been suffering with awful acne on my cheeks and underneath the surface.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product because I use to use a toner with salicylic acid for my acne and it seemed to work well.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew what their secret was!</li>
            <li> relied on reviews for this product and now I&#x27;m sorry I did.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about two weeks on my face, neck, and chest. It has gotten rid of all my blackheads, shrunk my pores, reduced my wrinkles, and almost completely gotten rid of my discoloration and sun spots. This is not your average toner. It&#x27;s a light peel. Makes my skin baby soft. Great exfoliation. I have very oily, acne prone skin and it has completely cleared my acne. I use this every day and use Aztec Clay Mask once a week and this is the best my skin has looked in years. I highly recommend it to anyone with oily, problem skin. I would not recommend it for sensitive skin, it&#x27;s pretty powerful stuff. I think it works best right after a hot shower while my pores are still open, although it stings more and leaves some redness for about 15 minutes or so, but I can see more immediate results. Cellbone also makes an excellent Body Peel that I&#x27;ve been using on my other problem areas with similar results.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff after washing my face and it made my face feel extra clean however, it made my face itch like the dickens lol. If you want extremely clean skin I recommend this product the only downfall was the itchy face.</li>
            <li> Like many others have stated, i got a sample of there collogen facial cleanser and an acid peel with my toner, so I put in another order for the full size and use it everyday.  They even give discounts for military getting shipments to APO.  What a great company!</li>
            <li> If you were like me, you&#x27;re looking at the title saying, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve never heard of these guys and the title seems a bit persuading.\\&quot; Yeah, I was very skeptical at first about this, but the first thing that I did was look at the reviews. After seeing everyone&#x27;s good comments about how it helped their skin, I decided to order it. I struggle with BAD acne during school when I have a lot of stress, and everything I tried seemed to have no effect. This toner is completely different than others. It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, nor does it contain the same ingredients that EVERY OTHER TONER HAS... It&#x27;s unique, and within a week, my acne disappeared, and my blackheads on my nose completely vanished! The acne comes and goes, but the blackheads were ALWAYS there, and this stuff got rid of it. My advice, if you&#x27;re skeptical about this stuff, it&#x27;s understandable, seeing how pricey it is compared to the cheaper stuff, but trust me, it&#x27;s worth it. It also comes in a fairly nice sized bottle.    The only thing bad I have to say is that when you first put it on, it can be a little harsh, so I&#x27;m not sure if people with sensitive skin should try it, but that&#x27;s just for me. It goes away in about 5 minutes. Also, when going around your mouth, keep your distance! This stuff does NOT taste good at all, and if you accidentally get it on your lip, you&#x27;ll be miserable for about 30 minutes!! Haha!</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a bit expensive but worth it. After washing my face with an acne colloidal silver soap (NaNo 153) wiping any residue off with witch hazel I use this Prep. It manages to still come up with &#x27;dirt&#x27;&#x27;. They say dead skin cells is what causes most acne break outs and this stuff wipes your face so clean it even feels different. Since it has some of the same ingredients as facial peels it works slowly and gently to strip away instead of all at once like a peel does. Great for Acne and Anti-aging. It is Glycolic acid with a bunch of very good extracts for your skin, like Bilberry, Sugar Cane, Maple Sugar, Orange, Lemon, Willow Bark, Cucumber and then Sodium Hyaluronate and Phenoxyethnol.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using everyday twice a day for almost a month and barely a break out. I think it is helping with the fine lines as well. A new staple in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love this, I bought because of reviews and ingredients listed. I used it for the first time and loved it, usually everything irritates my sensitive skin and makes me break out. Before I bought this I never use soap or facial cleansers only water and vinegar with a washcloth and never breakout. But I wanted to try the prep because my skin gets flaky alot. They sent me an awesome free sample of the collagen cleanser which smells fantastic and feels great on my skin.  I really love the products they are so refreshing. I follow with a rose hip seed oil and lavender oil moisturizer. My skin feels very soft and smooth and calm.</li>
            <li> I bought this toner because the ingredients seemed great and the reviews were pretty good. I feel that this product goes a pretty long way. It&#x27;s much better than Clinique&#x27;s toners I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;ll buy it again a few months down the road.</li>
            <li> This is the best toner on the market.  It cleans your face thoroughly after washing it.  The service from the company is top notch and reliable.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago after reading several reviews. I am 24 years old, brown skin african american and suffer from old, and sometimes new acne scars on my face. I purchased this and initially it was to harsh for my skin. It dried my skin out and it seemed at first it was trapping new acne under my skin and I started to break out over my cheeks and forehead. I started to be discouraged, and stop using it. However I don&#x27;t believe in wasting so after the new acne diminished I decided to try it again. This time i added about 1/3 of the bottle to my Witch Hazel and now I love it!! Very few break outs and the scars are significantly lighter!! I use African Shea butter as a moisturizer after I apply the Prep skin/Witch Hazel every night and my skin has seen a major improvement and it has only been about a month!! I am so glad I did not completely give up on this product and I would recommend it to anyone having issues with dark spots. It really does help and if at first it seems to harsh like it was for me, Witch Hazel works! But then again everyones skin is different, so just try and experiment with what is best for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I usually use it before I do my at home peel.  However, I love it so much that I actually use it as a regular day to day toner now.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  I love the tingle :-)</li>
            <li> Bought this in conjunction w/ the 30% peel. Love it alone. Has made a significant improvement in my skin, just in 1 week. Started it w/ the peel and used it 2x/day as described, but did my second peel 1 week later, as described and the peel actually burned my skin around my nose and mouth. May just stick to this or very short (1-2min), monthly peels in addition to this. Use caution when using this w/ the peel!   Will definitely be adding Prep to my daily routine! Love it!</li>
            <li> Not sure it is prepping me for anything but I feel like I&#x27;m trying to do something to help my complection over time. U need to know it has a bite to it. By that I mean as I wipe my face it burns momentarily. Really, just for a moment.  wanted to warn u cuz I don&#x27;t remember reading that b4 I bought it. I thought I was getting something to prep right b4 peel. Description seemed that way. But directions say to use daily. So not necessary for peel prep. Anyway, I&#x27;m not disappointed because I figure it is helping maintain/support my healthy skin plan of action.&lt;br /&gt;Good service from company.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;refresher\\&quot; toner is awesome!!!  It has some glycolic in it and is working wonders on my acne.  I use this once a night after cleansing.  I am now obsessed with the Cellbone line!</li>
            <li> There is no real evidence that this product works. I have not seen its effects on my skin before or after treatment.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and have suffered oily skin and mild acnes over the years.  I have used many different astringent/toner after cleansing my face to remove excess oil.  And this is the best of all.  My face is much clearer and smoother now.  It stings a little bit especially a day after I used chemical peel on my face.  But it&#x27;s something I can handle.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money because it actually will improve your skin unlike the hundreds of products that I have bought in the past. It lists gycolic acid as its second ingredient and it is definitaly enough to feel the sting (which is what you want)I used it as a prep before using the gycolic-lactic acid peel(35%) that was a surprise bonus product included in my order, I had ordered A 60% gycolac peel from another company that I intended to use with this prep, but chose to try the 35% sample first. The sample is a great product as well , it stung like a #$**, I left it on for 3 min the first aplication,5 min a week later, it is just like a profesional peel of the same strenght. I paid 300 hundred dollars for a peel in my cosmetic surgeons office and got the same results; burning/stinging , tight uncomfortable skin for two days, flaking skin 3 to 5 days after ......so if you have the funds to go to the salon then by all means have someone do it for you, but for the rest of us....just let me say, it can be done at home for just dollars per aplication. Start light like this companys 35% peel then move up in strength 2 or 3 months later. I havent tried the 60% I originally ordered yet.I just wanted to let those that read these reviews when trying to decide(like I do)that you are not wasting your money on the products I have tried from this particular company. The nuetralizer is a good product as well although its effects are not as obvious because it only nutralizes the effects of the acid( which is important)[[ASIN:B000VEMWB0 Prep skin refresher helps remove dead skin cells, excess oil, and any residue after cleansing. Prep will stimulate new skin cells and promote a clear, smooth, healthy looking complexion.]]</li>
            <li> I am a Black woman in my late 30s who has been dealing with cystic acne for the better part of 10 years.  Over the last year especially I have been dealing with the scarring from this acne and have been experimenting with tons of products that can both deal with the cystic acne and the scarring with little success.  But I have found that only glycolic acid works and after reading the reviews for this toner I thought that it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.  I wanted to wait to see what it would do for my skin before writing a review and the results have been nothing short of remarkable.  It&#x27;s been about 5 days since I received it and started using: It has lessened the darkening of some of the scars and a few of the lighter ones are so faint I can&#x27;t remember how dark they were before using.  My pores were larger and my skin used to be oily to the point of embarrassment and now my complexion is much smoother, clearer and more matte.  I took pictures of my skin before I began using and when I looked back at them (before writing this review to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just my imagination) I can easily see a huge, huge difference!    I use it morning and night.  I also received a free small bottle of collagen facial wash by Cellbone that was included in my order and it too is awesome.  I wash with that, use a cotton pad (vs. a cotton ball, the pads for me are easier) to apply the Prep Refresher on my face and neck, and allow it to work -- I feel a tingling sensation that&#x27;s mostly bearable (!) and when it subsides I apply aloe vera gel over my whole face, let that dry which it quickly does, then a moisturizer with SPF on top of it.  I am so happy with this product and may go for a professional glycolic peel in a month if the deeper, darker scars are still apparent.  I always get nervous too because with my Black skin I don&#x27;t want to use a product that will cause more hyperpigmentation.  I am going to call Cellbone to see if or when I should take a break from using this product or if it&#x27;ssafe enough to use everyday for an extended period of time.  But overall I am completely happy with this product.    (Shipping from Cellbone was almost $7, high by my standards)</li>
            <li> made my skin super dry and flaky. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> i tried it and it stings. not sure if that&#x27;s what is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female, 40 years young, with acne prone and oily skin.  This product works great.  It significantly cleared up my adult acne within four days.  Within two days, I noticed a moderate difference.  My skin is still oily but I&#x27;ve only been using the product for five days.  This is a holy grail product for me.  I&#x27;ve used quite a few products over the years but never anything that has so quickly and effectively made such a difference in my skin.  I will not be without this.  I have sparingly used the free sample sized cleanser that came with my order.  I use it in the morning, before I work out, but I continue to use my Clinique acne bar after working out and before bed.  Ladies with acne, this is a MUST!!</li>
            <li> I would say that I have normal skin. Its not horribly problematic but not perfect and glowing either. I&#x27;m 27, female, pale complected, battle blackheads/whiteheads on nose and chin, get dry spots on lower parts of cheeks.  Recently decided to start a skin care regimen and came across this on Amazon. This stuff really is great. I use it every night by rubbing in with a cotton ball. I let it dry and settle in then cover face and neck with a small amount of an organic facial vitamin lotion. When I first started using it it had quite a bit of a bite but as time when on not so much. Also note that after about a week of using it my skin went through an adjustment period. I had 4-5 small blemishes pop up and a few unusually dry patches. I&#x27;m glad I stuck it out because now my skin looks great. My pores are barely noticeable and my skin seems to produce just the right amount of healthy oil. Haven&#x27;t had a any breakouts either. Most days I don&#x27;t even put any cover up on and if I do its only a small amount mixed with my daily lotion or just a bit of mineral powder cover up.  I also use an organic exfoliating scrub every morning then apply a vitamin c lotion with spf afterwards which I also believe contributes to my new found healthy skin.  I hope this product will help ward off any fine lines and wrinkles too :)</li>
            <li> I received this item only a day or two after ordering, well in advance of the anticipated shipping date! They also included samples of their facial cleanser and glycolic peel in sizes that were almost full size!  I just tried them and am really thrilled with the results.  FINALLY...a company that gets what good customer service is all about!  I will definitely re-order these products and more from this company!!!</li>
            <li> This item arrived around 12 and I just had to wash and apply this product on my face to see what all the hype was about. After applying for the first time, all the white heads and black heads had started to slowly dissolve and you know that rough feeling you get when you rub your nose and chin (blocked pores)? Well after using prep for the first time it felt as if I never had those rough spots. I hate the white/ black heads poking out of my skin because its so rough and annoying to the touch and its actually embarrassing(for those who have significant others that love to get so close to your face). Around 8pm i took a shower and once i finished and got to my beauty routine before going to bed,  I used this product once again and let me tell you, MY SKIN IS SO SMOOTH AND RADIANT AS IF I JUST HAD A CHEMICAL PEEL!!! Within ONLY TWO USES prep has lighten the color of my acne scars and the current pimples and has decreased the pimple sizes. I feel a mild stinging and a tingling sensation while applying prep on my skin and it actually feels good because it feels like its actually dissolving everything in my pores. Theres no smell to it (well if there is a smell i couldnt smell it). Shipping was super fast (faster than the date listed). No samples provided though but since im super happy that i found my new best friend (prep) i will most def be coming back to cellbone for more since this product is the answer to my face issues (acne, acne scars, hyperpigmentation, dullness, &amp; signs of aging) Plz NEVER discontinue. THANKS YOU CELLBONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/20/2012&lt;br /&gt;After using this toner for a few weeks straight i started noticing that my skin was getting way more oiler than usual and because of my skin getting oiler, it caused me to break out. i only use skin prep on my t-zone and chin area to get rid of the white/black heads. the breakouts only occurred on my cheeks and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 5/2/12&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to get the same results my tzone and chin was getting so i started to use this toner on my whole face and let it sit for a min or two and rinse and apply a matte toner. Skin is agreeing so far</li>
            <li> I love this product; finally a facial product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The first few times you might feel a slight tingle but after that you probably won&#x27;t as I didn&#x27;t.  But it leaves your face feeling so clean without feeling stripped and dry.  It gets rid of dead cells and within about a week you can tell because your skin will look &#x27;new&#x27; and refreshed.  The seller has the best customer service and love that they always provide a sample of another one of their products.  I haven&#x27;t had a bad product or sample from them yet.</li>
            <li> I really did not need to use this I was able to use alcohol instead and it worked just as good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to complement my salycilic acid routine skin care and it worked pretty well. I rarely have breakouts such as blackhead and acne since I started using this product 4 months ago. I would definitely buy it again for my facial skin care.</li>
            <li> I am a black African woman and I understand how hard it is to find products that work well with our skin. I was worried about spending $18 on just toner, but all my worries went out the window after the first day! First of all, it ships superfast (probably 2 days). It also came with a sample of their wonderful collagen cleanser. I suffered from old acne scars and pimples and discoloration and dull complexion. I use this product in the morning and at night and, after the first night, the multiple tiny bumps on my nose were reduced to only a few wimpy bumps. I look good! This toner also has some glycolic acid in it, so I&#x27;m sure that helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and the order was filled and shipped in no time. They even included a free sample. I just tried it tonight and it felt great -there was a little tingle but nothing unbearable. The other reviews are great so I am very optimistic that I too will get great results for acne-prone skin. I will definite buy from this seller again. Will up date on my results later.</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old natural blond with sensitive skin. I have had trouble with breakouts all of my life.  I have gone to lots of docs and still have trouble.  I added this and my skin is clear for the first time in years.  Still working on getting rid of some small scars.  My skin has not been overly dry either.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> where has this product been??!!!! when i hit 30, my t-zone changed alot. very dry across the eyebrow/forehead and nose area. my facial routine in the morn was a drag and took about 30 mins. ive used plenty of products: scrubs, facial cleansing gels, etc , etc , etc. all i wished for was not to have super dry skin. when having super dry skin it is awfully hard to put on makeup. my usual routine was scrub and scrub and then apply my facial cream. its very hard to apply eye makeup and foundation on when dry skin makes it look cakey.&lt;br /&gt;this product arrived 2 days after ordering. very nicely packaged with a free (good sized) sample of their facial cleanser. the first time i used the cleanser and skin refresher i instantly saw a glow and brightness to my skin i had not seen in some time. the skin refresher very easily took off the dry skin and i had a super smooth skin. if anything the skin refresher is a great primer before applying makeup. this is my second day using it and had to write a review because the redness i had around may nose area has left and i awoke to look in the mirror and i did not have dry skin anywhere on my face. i have very smooth skin....OMG!!&lt;br /&gt;i also have very light adult acne, still waiting results on that but im sure that will clear up. also i have very sensitive skin and i had no negative reaction to it. there is a slight tingle but it last a min or two and then gone.&lt;br /&gt;take a chance and purchase this item!!</li>
            <li> It stings a little, but I love that---that way I know that it is working !!!!!  I have noticed many changes in my skin since I began using this product 2 months ago.  My skin is clearer and more radiant and so much softer.  The small sun damage spots are fading and I am amazed !!!!!!  thank you so much Cellbone for making a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Toner almost two weeks ago and started using it 8 days ago and it has dramatically reduced the acne forming on my face and my scarring that was pretty severe from the cystic nodules that I had on my cheeks.  I am on the oral antibiotic medication Septra along with receiving Chemical Peels once every two weeks from my dermatologist and doing them at home.  My medication was not working as well as it was in the past and I was running out of options in order to get rid of my acne before I had to be put on Accutane.  I have hormonal acne that just recently started within the past year, which was very bizarre considering I had absolutely NO acne on my face until recently and I am 20 years old.  Anyways, I decided to try this stuff because it has Glycolic Acid in it and I already use peels with this in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed the drastic reduction in acne blemishes on my face and the extensive scarring that I have (mainly hyperpigmentation).  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with mild to severe acne, like myself, because it has worked wonders for me and I will be buying more of this in the future and possibly try some of their other products as well.  Also as a side note, I suggest you put a really good moisturizer on your face afterwards because it made my face really dry.  I eventually after like 3 or 4 days just used the toner on the scars on my cheeks and my forehead because these are the areas of my face where I breakout.  I use 100% Organic Argan Oil, which you can buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried to like this product but it didn&#x27;t work for me. It just made my skin bumpy and caused me to break out. Sucks that I keep spending my money on products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectation and the facial cleanser sample is must have in my beauty bag.</li>
            <li> At first it seems to just be water, but this stuff is potent. The ingredients are the same as a glycol peel, but to a much smaller degree. If you can take the burn and use a very good moisturizer, you will see a difference in the radiance of your skin. I use origins nightamins cream.</li>
            <li> This is my first--and maybe only--online review, but considering how much dermatologists charge for skin care kits, I wanted to flag this product as a great value. Cleanse, apply this prep \\&quot;toner\\&quot;, follow with a little aloe vera gel and light moisturizer with high spf. Your skin skin will be tighter, clearer, and smoother in just a day or two. I am a big fan of this company&#x27;s products; this one is really great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I&#x27;ve had this product for 4 days and all I can say is... WOW!!! After having my second child, I&#x27;ve been suffering with awful acne on my cheeks and underneath the surface. I&#x27;ve done birth control, acne meds, peels and topical. Not even joking, I got a sample cleanser with this and use that, with this toner and DCL&#x27;s lightening gel and my skin is has completely turned around. My husband said to me this morning that my skin has done a complete 180! My scarring is almost nothing. I love this toner because you can feel it get down into your skin. It&#x27;s almost like a tingle or slight sting. I&#x27;ve been suffering with clogged pores underneath the skin and NOTHING has been able to kill it, and this stuff has! My skin is smooth. I feel comfortable enough to go out in public without make up already. I promise you that this is not a paid review. Everyones skin is different. I&#x27;ve had acne my since my preteen years and having kids made it worse. This stuff has given me the light at the end of the tunnel feeling! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> fast shipped, received items quicker than expected.  The 35% glycolic-lactic peel works just as expected.  Love the neutralizer and prep for before and after using the peel....being in the skin care field, I just love all the products..Thanks for quick ship, and samples...will buy again from you!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s too strong for my skin, but it puts my oil glands into over-drive! I really wish it did anything close to what the other reviewers have written, but it just makes my skin itch when I apply it and less then an hour my face is covered in oil. I&#x27;m aware that not every product works for everyone, and everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so this review is in no way bashing the product. I&#x27;ll be trying it again in the near future to see if my skin can tolerate it enough to let the product do something other than make my face produce more oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 8/26/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give this product another try after my favorite toner ran out (I hate to waste), and I would have to say there are a some good and bad points to it. I have been using it for about a little over a month now and here are some of my observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m certain that it helps to push out new skin cells because I had a few acne scar spots that dried up (they were scabs at the time) and healed up after a few days of using the toner. Beware: It stings horribly on open skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps any sort of acne congestion from developing (I have that issue around my jawline) which is always a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Still makes my skin itch when I apply the toner, but overall it&#x27;s not as bad as it used to be. I try to only use it at night and sometimes take a break for a day or two to give my face a breather if I notice my skin is looking a bit over-worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Prepare to see all the gunk underneath your skin surface! I had to endure a bit of a breakout that emerged as my skin cells were turning over due to the prep refresher. I found myself at the mirror every other day doing extractions, but it has gotten better after a few weeks since I&#x27;ve found less and less to extract. I&#x27;ve also avoided wearing foundation on a daily basis as to not stir up any other acne.&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my initial review, I gave this toner another star because it&#x27;s done pretty much everything it says (minus the healthy looking complexion, I&#x27;m still waiting on that) but have not decided to give it 4 stars since I believe there are other products out there that are less harsh and can accomplish the same things. Despite that, I would still recommend anyone considering purchasing the prep refresher to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I never really noticed any difference in my skin after using this, but it was very gentle.</li>
            <li> I bought this to prep my skin for a chemical peel. I am a 44 year old African American woman with acne. This really cleans deep down and helped clear my skin. You recieve a free sample of face wash with your order you will absolutely love the face wash!!! Great products!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product, I have just ordered my 2nd bottle. The company always throws in a free sample of one of their other products, One of which is their collagen gel facial wash which I love and will also order. Great company and so far great products!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product because I use to use a toner with salicylic acid for my acne and it seemed to work well. This toner just blows EVERYTHING I&#x27;ve ever tried out of the water! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry out and it doesn&#x27;t sting or anything like that. Best of all, my acne is now under control because of this stuff. It&#x27;s AMAZING! I wish I knew what their secret was!</li>
            <li> This prep may also be a nice mini peel tonic to be used after one washes their face.  It has a little sting to it, when applied to skin cleaned with Cellbone&#x27;s glycolic cleanser.  I was very pleased to see two large samples of this cleanser and a lactic acid / glycolic acid peel in my order.  I also have the Cellbone neutralizer for after the peel.  I do not know that it is doing more than a 60+ second rinse with cool water on a lighter peel solution; however, I used it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister, she was secretly taking some from my room every night. She loved it too.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff unless you have experience. I&#x27;ve had professional peels done before so I know what to expect, and this is professional quality. Great results, but follow directions and err on the side of caution. You can always do it again in a few months.</li>
            <li> In-order to get the full benefits of a peel you have to make this your step 1.  It gets all the oils off your face, without stripping it like alcohol would.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product online that I could use to lighten or completely remove my hyper pigmentation on my cheeks, some of my chin and parts of my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to the letter. Nothing. I did it again. Nothing, even though I let it remain on my skin longer. I&#x27;m talking no reaction to anything....no tingling sensation, no redness, no lightening of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days ago I used it and left it on my skin for 15 minutes, double the recommended time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I relied on reviews for this product and now I&#x27;m sorry I did. Particularly for what it cost me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this product again nor would I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this after many reviews and this stuff is strong.  I used it during the summer and it sopped up my oily skin but it made my skin dry after a couple of days so use sparingly.  I only used 1/25th of it so I have alot left over to use once in a blue.  It did nothing to lighten my blemish marks.  I like it for spongelike purposes.</li>
            <li> even after cleaning my face with makeup remover wipes, this product finds more to remove. feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time... From a day toner to a quick clean wipe with a cotton ball.....and just before peels. I feel it helps anything you use after this to absorb better. It has a slight sting but nothing to bad :) GREAT PRODUCT :)</li>
            <li> This toner/skin prep is great, just costly in my opinion.  It does not dry my skin, I can feel it tingle just slightly and my skin is ready for my moisturizers after it dries.  Can&#x27;t ask for anything else but maybe a lower price.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old white female that has never been the one with the \\&quot;good skin\\&quot;. I have (had) very oily skin with huge pores. Ive been using this for a couple of weeks and I can honestly say that if you have problem aging skin this is the best you will find. My skin looks amazing and I havent had my make up slide off an oil slicked face or been in the bathroom sopping oil in a while. combine with a red light therapy ( yes it works, I thought thats crazy what the crap can a red light do. But it really does improve your skin)It took me alot of money and a bathroom full of patially used potions to find my miracle. Just give it a try, you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow.  This stuff rocks.  I&#x27;ve only been using it almost 2 weeks and can totally see a difference in my skin.  I do not have even one pimple on my face and my skin seriously glows.  Actually, after the 2nd time I used it I walked out of the bathroom and my boyfriend said &amp;#34;wow, you look great&amp;#34;.  No makeup and all.  It shipped super fast and I received it way before the delivery date.  The company also sent me a pretty decent size sample of their facial wash.  Which is just as awesome.  That plus the skin refresher makes my skin look so great I can&#x27;t even believe it.  Once I&#x27;m done with this bottle, I&#x27;m defintely re-purchasing it and the cleanser.  Give it a try, I can&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this a quick method to clean your face remove all the dirt &amp; oil off your face while your in bed before you sleep. I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m that lazy XD</li>
            <li> First of all, everyone understands how one&#x27;s facial appearance is directly tied to one&#x27;s self-esteem. For me, my self-esteem is directly tied to Cellbone&#x27;s Prep Skin Refresher!!!! I won&#x27;t ever stop using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little about me/my skin: I am a 42-yr old Asian-Pacific Islander and have medium-tone skin, which essentially translates into severe post-acne hyperpigmentation anytime I break out. I never broke out as a teenager so it was so strange to me that I started breaking out badly the last 2 years. (I attribute most of it to job-stress so I really figured there was nothing I could do about my poor complexion). I recently saw a photo of myself from 2009 where I had no makeup on, and I pratically cried. I had forgotten that I had GREAT skin up until recently. I had gotten into this vicious cycle as of late: wearing concealer &amp; makeup to hide the dark hyperpigmentation, which I&#x27;m certain resulted in more breakouts &#x3D; more hyperpigmentation. It was just awful!! I was at my wit&#x27;s end. I couldn&#x27;t get my skin under control even with prescription drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In January, I began both salycylic &amp; glycolic acid treatments, and those helped the hyperpigmentation somewhat. I continued to breakout a bit and was willing to suffer through the breakouts in hopes that things were merely getting worse before they would get better. In March, I took a nearly 3-week long trip to hot, dusty Tanzania (climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, went on safari, &amp; then chilled out on Zanzibar). Well, I was without the comforts of home for the majority of that trip so I used pre-moistened face wipes &amp; hot water (when it was available) to cleanse my face &amp; always followed up with the Prep Skin Refresher. Translation: I was hot,sweaty, &amp; dusty/dirty the majority of the time. My breakouts stopped \\&quot;dead in their tracks,\\&quot; and my hyperpigmentation appeared to improve. Upon my return from my trip, I continued with the Prep Skin Refresher post-face wash and have only had 2 glycolic treatmentssince I returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how my complexion is improving!! I&#x27;m actually not scared to look in the mirror now, and I&#x27;m no longer morbidly depressed about how I look without makeup. I know it&#x27;s definitely this Cellbone product that has attributed to my vast improvement. (While the glycolic acid treatment does help, I&#x27;m only doing that every other week). I&#x27;m using the Prep Skin Refresher daily, usually in the a.m. &amp; in the p.m. I haven&#x27;t changed any other face, body, or hair products--so I know it wasn&#x27;t an allergy. Again, I was using this product religiously when I was camping on Mount Kilimanjaro (hey, I didn&#x27;t shower for 6 nights, but I still didn&#x27;t break out!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have before &amp; \\&quot;so far\\&quot; pictures, so I have an objective gauge as to my improvement. I would like my skin to get a bit better before I&#x27;m brave enough to post the pictures for you all, but stay tuned. I&#x27;ll update this review when I get up enough nerve to add the pictures. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, but I SWEAR it&#x27;s worth trying if you have acne/hyperpigmentation. I&#x27;ve been using this since the beginning of March, and I still have half the bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope others who are \\&quot;suffering in silence\\&quot; will give this a shot. I think it&#x27;s a small price to pay to help your self-esteem! Also, Cellbone threw in 2 other free samples that I haven&#x27;t tried yet (I didn&#x27;t want to \\&quot;waste\\&quot; the product on my poor skin, but I&#x27;ll try them this weekend). Cellbone: you have a customer for life. Please please please don&#x27;t get rid of this Prep!!!</li>
            <li> I started to break out like crazy after regular use of this \\&quot;refresher.\\&quot; Now, I resorted to using TCA to clear up my blemishes.  I tossed this bottle in the trash, I guess my face doesn&#x27;t react well with this product. (Asian)</li>
            <li> This is the one! Trust the reviews, it works! I don&#x27;t ever want to be without! Seller also gives you a sample bottle of heavenly face wash! If you&#x27;re into toners, PREP IS A PRODUCT THAT DELIVERS!</li>
            <li> I like how the solution takes away all of the dead skin.  My face is really smooth and it is brighter.  Prep is a very good solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman who has been fighting against extreme oily skin, acne and large pores since my teens. This product has absolutely changed my life.  I&#x27;ve been using it for six weeks. My skin is clear and radiant in a way it has NEVER been before. I am able to go without makeup now with no embarrassment about red, oily, blemished skin. I honestly didn&#x27;t think that would ever be possible for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week I used it, I diluted it 50% with witch hazel because of the way it made my skin burn and tingle. Since then I&#x27;ve been using it full strength morning and evening, every day. Sometimes I use it at noon if my nose and chin start feeling oily. During the first week a few pimples emerged, I think my skin was purging submerged problems. However those pimples healed incredibly fast.  The spots on my face from old healed pimples have completely disappeared. I no longer have huge greasy pores to contend with. My skin is soft and smooth and radiant. If I feel a pimple start to show up, it heals before it actually gives me a problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does sometimes make my skin burn/tingle rather unpleasantly, but it&#x27;s only for a couple of minutes before that subsides. It&#x27;s well worth the momentary discomfort!  Worth mentioning is that even when it feels irritated, I&#x27;ve never experienced any redness from using it (which I do with many other products). It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry and there has been no peeling for me.  It does burn unpleasantly if you get it on your lips, so I like to apply lip balm before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a superb product and an answer to prayers for me. I will be trying their other products to see if they are of the same quality. I consider it a bargain at any price and at this price it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e tried many other products but this one beats all..skin looks smooth,clean and you feel some stinging or burning for couple min. Which is what it supose to do..plus the free face wash is really good-refreshing, smells great and you only need just a little. Worth the price and it lasts..</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product multiple times! It cleans my skin very well. If I have a pop up zit and put this on before I go to bed, the pimple will be gone in the morning!! I also used this on my boyfriends hair bumps on the back of his neck and they were gone!!!</li>
            <li> I DONT REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT. Because it is to strong for my skin type and feel burning after i use it.  Maybe this product is not right stuff for my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this toner prior to peels and then 1-2x a week in between.  It&#x27;s strong stuff but effective.  I have horrible skin allergies and dry skin, hence only occasional use. But between this and an sulphur cream (plus sensitive skin soap &amp; moisturizer), my breakouts are now few and far between. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Skin tingles with cleanliness, stripping any oils or residue in preparation for treatment or exfoliation.  I love it</li>
            <li> Very efficient.  Cleared up my acne. I am 56 and the hormone pills caused severe acne. This product worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Stings just a little, but works by dissolving excess dead skin and makeup. I use it on my neck too.</li>
            <li> Great product. It removes all flaky dead skin so my make-up goes on flawlessly. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I really have not noticed a difference on my skin.  I stopped using it after one week.  The small sample of cleanser they sent with this product is great. Leaves my skin supple and fresh and it smells nice. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd order of the Celibon Prep skin refresher, and I am returning for another.  I keep a bottle at work and at home, and use it almost every day except on weekends where I just leave my skin alone.  I am 54, with normal skin; doesn&#x27;t get very oily, or very dry. I like how my skin feels afterwards; clean, cool, and bright, especially after sitting in an office all day with stale air. I used to use just plain witchhazel as a cleaner/toner and which I still keep on hand, but I like this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have purchased from this company, they don&#x27;t has as many items in amazon as they do on their website.   They are awesome and always send a great large sample size with each order that I have made.   This prep solution works great, I use it before my peel.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this before I do a home peel but I don&#x27;t know that other toners wouldn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old, and I&#x27;ve had a rough past with bad acne. After going to three different dermatologists and being put on 3 different skin regimens, it wasn&#x27;t till my third try that my acne finally started to clear up. After my acne started to calm down, but I was left with noticeable acne scaring. I decided it was time to start a more healthy skin regimen to prevent any future breakouts, and hopefully my scars would be reduced in the process over time. I chose to buy Prep Skin refresher as the toner I would use because it promotes getting rid of dead skin cells, as well as promoting new cell growth, which I thought would help with my scarring. I bought a Neutrogena liquid cleanser for my oily skin that I use once in the morning and once at night, I follow the cleanser with this Prep Skin Refresher every night. I then use 100% Argan oil for a moisturizer (bought on amazon) after using Prep skin refresher. This product gives a slight burn the few times you use it, but nothing that is unbearable and only lasts a minute or two. The first time I used it, I noticed it mostly around sensitive areas of my face, I think I may have gotten a more intense feeling because my skin was very try at the time and this could have dried it out even more. I believe there is some alcohol in it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3-4 weeks now, and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve had less breakouts and the scarring left from my past acne has gone down significantly. The price may be a little high, but considering, it isn&#x27;t too bad. I use just enough to saturate a cotton pad and it goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it every night for 3-4 weeks, and I haven&#x27;t missed a day yet. I still have more than half of the bottle left. They include a sample of one of their other products they offer which I thought was cool. Great company, great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great Toner for those who have acne issues, I am an African American adult male who has had some problems with acne in the past year. I have used this for over a month now and Ill tell you it has really put my acne into remmision big time, I have not had an active pimple in three weeks now an counting where I was having them atleast once a week before purchasing this toner, Make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards thou, I use hyaluronic acid which is a good moisturizer also an can be purchased here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> We love this. 13-yr old son&#x27;s acne was out of control, retin-a products were drying him out and weren&#x27;t helping, ProActive and Acne.org products also didn&#x27;t help.  I&#x27;m a 30-something mom who also has acne from time to time, resulting in temporary acne scarring.   This stuff is great. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been doing:  Once per week, we each do a Lactic Acid 70% peel for a minute or two.   Each night (except the Lactic Acid night) we cleanse and then swipe with this skin prep toner.   Then we use the 100% pure Hyaluronic acid, once that soaks in we top it with a few drops of 100% pure Moroccan Argan oil.   We use an extraction tool a few nights week to help dislodge the clogs that are ready to come out (and they are purging quickly, he had some of the biggest, most stubborn blackheads and petrified waxy whiteheads I&#x27;d ever seen) and they are little by little all coming out of his face without trauma, bleeding, or scarring.   Honestly, he looks great (and since I&#x27;m doing it too, it&#x27;s helping me, too) and I&#x27;m so happy for him that his acne is getting under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a skin care rampage the past year searching for products that actually DO something and this is one of my very favorites.  Most of the creams and lotions are totally disappointing (Olay and Loreal have done nothing for me, despite their glowing reviews).  I have very dry, fair skin with some annoying dark spots and large (not gigantic) pores on my nose.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks and I can definitely see a difference.  It decreases pore size.  I apply this after I wash my face with a mild cleanser.  I follow with Hyaluronic acid with a drop of water mixed in, then Neutrogena tone correcting moisturizer with a couple drops of Argon oil mixed in.  My pores have been dramatically minimized.  The dark spots are noticeably faded and my skin is much smoother.  I know this is playing an important part because the improvements were obviously accelerated with its addition.  I&#x27;ve also been using it on my neck and chest where I have some sun damage and I can see a difference there as well.  It&#x27;s important that your daytime lotion contains a sunscreen with this product.  I did have some initial stinging, but it didn&#x27;t persist long and didn&#x27;t result in any visible irritation. I will absolutely reorder this.  The customer service is excellent and they included a couple of generously sized samples with it.  If you have any sort of sun damage or pore issues this is a must-have for your skin care regimen.  I always want to choke when I say this, but I am in my mid-forties. This makes the challenge of finding good products both daunting and exhausting.  I&#x27;m so happy to have discovered this.  Now if only I could find an effective eye cream...</li>
            <li> I was just looking for a toner that would help exfoliate the dead skin off my face after my chemical peel but didn&#x27;t realize it had glycolic acid in it!  It&#x27;s perfect!  I burns when you put it on which I wasn&#x27;t expecting however I have been looking for something to use in-between my peels to keep my skin looking like \\&quot;the day after\\&quot; I do a peel - I LOVE IT!!!  Plus, it came in the mail SUPER FAST!!!!  Great seller!  Would highly recommend (which I already did to my neighbor and both of my sisters).</li>
            <li> I am AA woman with combination skin. Rough texture and skin surface \\&quot;bumps.\\&quot; My skin looks amazing after 3 days of day/night use. I&#x27;ve had dermatologist chemical skin peels that have cost $350 and never had the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far with this product. My skin wasn&#x27;t prone to lots of break-outs, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it would help with severe acne. However, the night I applied this, I had a pimple on my cheek. The next morning there wasn&#x27;t even a trace of it! A-freaking-mazing!!!! I also have been using the collagen skin wash (sample) that came with the skin prep. Not sure if the combination helps, but it smells great and a little goes a loooooooooong way!</li>
            <li> I just want to write that this company has great customer service! They sent me the wrong product. I almost just said screw it and didn&#x27;t let them know (I hate dealing with that kind if thing)&lt;br /&gt;But I decided to contact them. Like 4 days later they sent me the correct product and never even asked me to return the one I had.&lt;br /&gt;This is how it should be when a company makes a mistake, but it is rare and I sooooo appreciate how easy this was. Thank you Cellbone Tech Peeps. Now I&#x27;ll try your product and leave a great review if I like it. Which I&#x27;ve never done before btw.</li>
            <li> i use this as the 2nd part of my skin care regimen. It might cause redness and slight peeling on the first week of initial use, but that is normal. if you feel it&#x27;s too drying, use a moisturizer afterwards. its great for cystic acne, adult acne, and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ordered - did not like.  Makes my face feel sticky once dried.  Seller did a good job getting it to me in a reasonable timeframe; product is just not for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product! All of Cellbone&#x27;s products are great, the lists of ingredients are all things I can pronounce, it&#x27;s like they make natural-based products that really work. I even visted their website, and they have even more stuff, that they don&#x27;t offer on Amazon. EVERY thing I ordered came on time, and with a extra product for me to try out. Love love LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the first skin care product I am truly satisfied with. It came with a sample of their face wash, which I will absolutely order when I am out. For the first time in my life, people have been commenting on my complexion. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the reviews I read about it.  I am 36 years old and is still suffering from break outs.  I&#x27;ve been on Retin-A for years and I just started using a 20% Salycic Acid peel a couple of months ago.  My skin started looking so much better but it was missing something.  I bought the Prep and it arrived a couple of days ago.  I swear to you that this has already improved my skin.  Usually, when my skin doesn&#x27;t work well with products, it&#x27;ll react to it in a day or so.  So far, I&#x27;ve seen nothing but improvement.  The only thing I would suggest is if you are on Retin-A or any acne medication, I would use this product starting once a day so your skin can get used to it.  If this product does wonders on my skin in 2 days, only once a day, then I can&#x27;t imagine what it will do if I use it twice a day.  I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that this is my HG!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day after washing my face for a few days now and I&#x27;ve already seen an improvement in my skin!  There&#x27;s a slight stinging that only lasts a few seconds while it dries which means it is doing it job.  I have oily, acne-prone skin and I&#x27;ve had a few blemishes that just would not budge and after using this, they have been shrinking and disappearing.  I&#x27;m talking about the big, under-the-skin pimples so that&#x27;s pretty amazing to me!  Anyway I&#x27;m glad that I gave this a try even though it seems to be a pretty expensive toner.  It was worth the price for beautiful skin :)</li>
            <li> This product does what it says -- it certainly removes the excess dirt, oil, make-up from your face before washing, however, it severly dried out my skin under my eyes and the skin right next to my nose.  To the point of it crackiln, peeling and bleeding.  It took a lot of moisturizing and a lot of time for my skin to heal and I had only used the product a few times (less than a week).  It is possible I have overly sensitive skin, though.</li>
            <li> great product. i still use it! a great part of a facial cleaning regimin. (? spell check)......love it!....love it!  yea</li>
            <li> Last year I purchased this as well as a slew of other products to help out my teen son who had some breakouts.  He has used Proactiv before and while he didn&#x27;t have severe acne, it was there and his skin is a bit oily.  Lets face it, he is also a teen and while he doesn&#x27;t want pimples, he doesn&#x27;t want to take the time with a real skin care regimen morning and night.  This works so well, that even if he slacks on cleansing and starts seeing some acne, he uses Prep which helps right way (and usually gets him back to his skin routine).  I have been stealing it as well. It works especially well prior to a peel, Vit C serum, etc.  Plus, the company just seems nice!</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the reviews, so I purchased a bottle!  (crazy shipping cost, but oh well)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product about 11 times now, and I like the results so far!&lt;br /&gt;My pimples aren&#x27;t so out of control, and I definitely see more of a smooth &amp; toned complexion.  The acne marks are slightly fading as well.&lt;br /&gt;My purchase also came with a free collagen facial cleansing gel.  Love it!  My face actually feels soft and moisturized as I&#x27;m washing/rinsing.  That NEVER happens!  It&#x27;s such a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the prep skin refresher.&lt;br /&gt;Once applied, I did not feel any sort of burning, but sometimes there is a bit of an itchy feeling.  Goes away once you smooth on a moisturizer, so it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am recovering from a horrible, horrible breakout and I feel more confident in my skin after using these 2 gems.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy (even though they&#x27;re a tad expensive, but I can see why!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &amp; best of luck!</li>
            <li> Cellbone Technology is a great product! I use it often and many of their products! Cellbone Technology is a great product! I use it often and many of their products!</li>
            <li> This product is great to use before your acid peel. Really prepares the skin. Very mild stinging. Can be used as a toner also.</li>
            <li> Love that this is more than just a neutralizer to prep skin before adding serums or creams. My skin does feel fresh and oil free. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or stripped by alcohol.</li>
            <li> works well without burning my skin</li>
            <li> Best daily toner, my skin is glowing and smooth.  I use this on my face, décolleté and back. Works well with any skin care line.</li>
            <li> Updated review 8.30.2013. I have been using this product for about 18 months. Still very happy with the product after using it a year. I have multiple repeat purchases of the product and it is still working well to keep my skin smooth and clearer than it would otherwise be without using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 37 years old and I have been fighting a pitched battle with my acne prone skin since my earliest teens. Acne is a complex problem with a lot of causes.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for about nine months. My skin absolutely looks amazing now. It GLOWS. I can actually leave the house WITHOUT MAKEUP and not feel ashamed anymore.&lt;br /&gt;By glow, I mean it looks darn near flawless. I am getting compliments on my skin for the first time in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. A word of caution:&lt;br /&gt;Prep Skin Refresher CAN and DOES sting until your skin becomes accustomed to it. Work through it because the results are WORTH EVERY MINUTE of slight (or not so slight) discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I thought I couldn&#x27;t handle it. I washed it off with water after about five minutes. I was mad at first but my skin was so smooth! The glow on my skin was unmistakeable and my makeup went on so smoothly I was astounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try again the next day. I repeated the process. wipe on, let sit for five minutes, rinse off. I had to do this for a few weeks until my sensitivity subsided.&lt;br /&gt;I can now put on the product and it does not sting at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on my entire face, neck, chest, and upper arms. I follow with a good clean moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;In the summer, I use it on my legs to make them smoother. It does sting after you shave or exfoliate so plan accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;I shave or exfoliate at least 10 to 12 hours BEFORE or AFTER using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other secret weapon is a Glycolic acid pumpkin mask. i use these two products together for smooth glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this cleans, is fragrant-free, helps shed dead skin, and washes away with a splash or two of water.  Plus, it&#x27;s always so heartwarming to receive the extra little gift this company always includes with each order.  This is a company with high quality products and a sweet worth ethic.</li>
            <li> Cleans well.I like finding toners with glycolic, its like the proactive toner. Wish it had more glycolic though. I stopped using, think I need to pull it out again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product especially after reading all the reviews. Ordered two bottles (first mistake), Yes it arrived on time applyed it thinking i would feel a lil tingle at the most.... well i was dead wrong.  I even made sure not to have broken skin (didnt matter), my face was litterally  on fire. It burned my face up. Lots of tiny bumps covered my entire face, it didnt just remove dead skin cells it removed my flesh. This happened few months back and my skin still hasnt recovered. Now my skin is worst with lots of blemishes, Im stuck with an extra bottle of this dangerous stuff so now im trying to give it away for free on craigslist &amp; still NO TAKERS!</li>
            <li> Excellent Toner, though I didn&#x27;t recognize that what I am buying is a toner when I add it to my cart; I thought it is a Facial Wash, I dont know I just did not concentrate well. But I&#x27;m still Satisfied. The toner is wonderful, it gave my skin that fresh glowing clean feeling and look, its perfect to wipe your clean face using it before makeup too I didn&#x27;t breakout afterward. The seller sent me ( Collagen Wash Gel) as a sample and I was impressed with the result too, I&#x27;m gonna buy it for sure. Deserve the 5 stars. Thank you</li>
            <li> This product works really well to reduce acne and blackheads and it makes your skin really smooth. I read some bad reviews for it and one person complained that it didn&#x27;t work but mentioned that they rinsed it off. You don&#x27;t rinse it. Leave it on your skin overnight or all day. It helps your acne or scabs and scars heal up quicker too. My skin is really smooth and younger looking after using this product for a couple months. Stick with it. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I received this product about a week ago and ichave to say that I see results already my skin and acne has been reduced significantly I love it the only thing is I cant stand the way it makes my skin tingle during and a little after the application.</li>
            <li> I do believe that this product works because whenever I feel a breakout coming on I prep it in the AM and PM and it starts diminishing. The shipping charges is outrageous but hey what can you do.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner. It really does clear up your skin. i will definitely buy again. I give it a 5 star!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that removed dead skin cells without causing irritation. This is it.  In addition, it opens the pores up so your anti-wrinkle/moisturizers actually penetrate into the skin where they can be absorbed. When I looked at the ingredients (Glycolic Acid, Bilberry Extract, Sugar Cane Extract, Sugar Maple Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract, Willow Bark Extract, Cucumber Flower Extract) I was surprised because each ingredient alone is warranted for the face and used in peels. Wow, I&#x27;m giving myself a mini peel every day. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cell turnover has increased.  If I miss a day or night cleansing my skin feels rough.  Your face is smooth after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome product with excellent ingredients.  I found it by accident on Amazon and am so happy I bought it.  It works wonders.</li>
            <li> like all the products this brand make work perfect , is not necesary expend a lot of money for have young skin&lt;br /&gt;I completly recoment this brand , come on time too</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and wouldn&#x27;t start my day without it now. I am totally hooked on it. After I clean my face it makes my skin look and feel great. I started exfoliating alot and you get quite the tingle when you apply if just after home dermabrasion but it makes my skin POP with glow. I am even ordering a little more glycolic acid to add to it because I like about a 10% glycolic now that my skin is more used to being acid washed but you can&#x27;t go wrong with this toner just like it is. I use it before I apply LifeCell and everyone has noticed the new me and glow my skin has. It seems to actually draw other skin products deeper into the skin and dry faster and has had no adverse or unwanted effects just beautiful clean skin. I am ordering several bottles this time so I don&#x27;t run out because I use it twice a day. I am 50 years old and everyone is telling me how \\&quot;crazy good\\&quot; my skin looks! One of the all time best cosmetic products under $20 I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Be very careful as it is very drying. It definately removed all oils out of my facial skin!</li>
            <li> Gets all debris off skin before a light acid peel, love this</li>
            <li> This product tingles my face...and makes me feel like i have REALLY finished getting all the oil and make up off my face, after washing. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I first started using this in 2012. Then I noticed how well it worked on my acne scars on my face, I tried it on my knees and elbows( you know that dark skin on both of those areas that can occur), well, I am glad to say that I have noticed such a great difference in all the areas I&#x27;ve used it on. I will probably always use this product! In addition to it&#x27;s performance, it makes your skin really soft and it gives your skin a radiant glow! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this, oh, and if you have super sensitive skin, I would suggest diluting it a little to where your skin can tolerate it.  And it&#x27;s most effective using it twice a day too, Good luck!!!!</li>
            <li> Buying my 2nd bottle is a testament to how well this product works.... I use this product right after washing my face at night...then I follow up with an aloe vera gel moisturizer. My acne is gone, and if I do get an occasional bump, this product reduces scarring drastically! It has definitely evened out my skin tone, and reduced my hyperpigmentation from past acne scars (FINALLY!!! what a relief).... my skin has never felt soooo smoothe. The product says use twice a day, but I see results just using the product once a day, at night....I have no complaints about the product at all....i just hate the shipping cost...but considering I&#x27;ve paid thousands of dollars looking for a product that&#x27;ll reduce my acne, I can swallow the shipping cost with ease!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shared this with my sister, she&#x27;s seen the same results as well.....and is talking about buying the product for friends of hers.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to- it effectively encourages cell turnover and removes acne-creating dead skin cells, dirt, etc. I would suggest working your way up in usage (so basically once a day versus twice). I also found that it works wonders if used in conjunction with chemical peels. I&#x27;ve been using a 10% salicylic acid peel (which is oil soluble so it can break through the sebum; essentially the first layer) and afterwards I VERY gently dab Cellbone&#x27;s Prep solution over my face. It has glycolic acid that is even MORE effective if the sebum is disinigrated as it is only water soluble (the layer below the sebum). My face peels quite shockingly for a few days but afterwards I have baby smooth skin that glows (my hyperpigmentation, cystic acne and fine wrinkles are radically diminished)!! I love this product and will buy it over and over again...plus, they include a great collagen face wash that I&#x27;m enjoying as a free gift &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the product often, but I can feel the AHA in the product. I use retin-a and do bentonite clay masks so I can&#x27;t use it as often as I would like because it is quite irritating, but I will attempt to use it daily in the near future. I also like that the company sent over the face wash with the product. It smells so nice, like melon, and does a good job cleansing too.</li>
            <li> I did buy this primarily as a prep for an acid peel. However, I&#x27;ve also been using it every day after cleansing. My skin is clearer than it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
            <li> I needed a toner for my skin which suffered from occasional acne/ dullness. This product has cured my skin problems. I&#x27;m 37 yrs old and have oily skin and often got pimples in the worst places that stayed forver and left hideous marks. Well this productI swear by.  I now only have breakouts seldomly and when I do this product nips it in the bud. They go away quickly and don&#x27;t leave the ugly marks. it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin either. My skin has tremendously improved, texture, clarity, brightness, you name it. Well worth the price. AWESOME!</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says it will do. VERY refreshing! Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> i do love it. i just do not use it twice a day every day, i just try to see if my skin need it or not. it works and i use a chemical peeling every 3 or 4 months too. i use to stop the prep skin 2 or 3 days before my peeling. always read the instructions, be a smart customer.</li>
            <li> good i will order more thank you</li>
            <li> I use this once a day for my skin can&#x27;t handle it more than that, but it definitively helps remove excess dirt and preps the skin for moisturizer very well. I would recommend this product for anyone looking to up their skin regime routine.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. I burn pretty easily and I blame myself for using this too soon and too much. Instead of testing it I got excited because of the results I received the first two days of use. It was amazing!!! My face was clear and felt so clean. Few days afterward I started to dry out and get discoloration. I stopped using it to allow my skin to recover. I waited about three weeks before I started using it again. I apply once every other day and sparingly. The results are pretty good. I&#x27;m hopeful that it will work better now that I have an understanding of how I should use it.</li>
            <li> Works great to rejuvenate skin. Contains 8% Glycolic acid which works deep down in dermis layer causing a 10 second delay in reaction.  Don&#x27;t put on too much or your face will be red for awhile. Seller included sample of collagen face wash which works great also. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and it does exactly what it said it does. How many products does just that? I&#x27;m going to use it as a toner moving forward</li>
            <li> I received this toner a couple days ago and immediately stated using it once a day. After the first 3 days I noticed some small breakouts but I will continue using and monitor.  My face seems to be glowing in the mornings after I put on my makeup so it must be doing something good.  Free sample of a face wash which smells nice is a plus as well.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after researching several other skin care products that were similar.  This product had so many good reviews so I decided to try it.  My skin does feel fresh, clean, and smooth after using this product.  Sometimes I feel a slight tingling sensation which usually goes away when I apply moisturizer.  It is slighty irritating but not enough to stop using the product.  This product also came with a trial size cleanser that I absolutely love!  It works wonderfully and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping. Also love the free samples that come with it. Made my skin look fresh and rejuvenated. Only bad thing about the product is that when you first use it, it purges your skin meaning you do break out for the first couple of days but after that the results are amazing. Very pleased with it and will be ordering more. Stick with it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks now and I agree with the rest of the positive reviews.  I am a 35 year old African American who has suffered from acne since 15 years old.  I have tried everything in the book.  This has not completely eradicated the problem, but it has helped very much and I do like the product.  It does sting especially if you are like myself and have used Retin A in the past and have thin/sensitive skin but it has helped with oiliness, and less breakouts.  Great product and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Make my face clear and I feel it</li>
            <li> After reading such great reviews on this product I purchased this toner back in April .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 33 and  have oily, active, acne proned  and sensitive to some products skin.&lt;br /&gt;My daily routine with benzole peroxide, retinoin 3X a week and a moisturizer was keeping my acne under control .&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a product with glycolic acid. I though it would help my skin get back the radiance and glow . But it turned out it didnt work for my skin .  This refreshener made my skin and pores overactive. was strong at the beginning. but then skin gets used to it .  I started to break out very badly .&lt;br /&gt;I put it aside for several month and two weeks ago decided to give it another chance .&lt;br /&gt;I had cellbone TCA 15% peel a month ago( totally loved it )  and though  I can be an add to a  new routine and will include Skin prep refreshner in it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was still getting super oily after one hour I used the toner . I though it need more time  to get my skin get used to refreshner  Tingling wasn&#x27;t bothering me no more . When I started break out badly on both of my cheeks I though the skin was just purging . And it will stop soon . I didnt . I had more acne these past three weeks .  Plus healing was slow and it I have new red marks all over my skin now . No more of this stuff for me. It will take some time for me now  to get my clear skin back  and heal those ugly marks .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for approximately 2 years now and have been more than satisfied. Having oily skin, it&#x27;s hard to find products to truly tame the oil, yet balance your skin.  Forewarning, it&#x27;s 10% glycolic acid so there is sometimes some tingling after applying, but only momentarily. It is truly a great product and I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> ever since I started using this, my face never breaks out unless i&#x27;m really stressed and been staying up for crazy hours. I have been using this for couple of months, and the texture of my skin has improved. It also helped with discoloration and acne scars but i don&#x27;t think that it was achieved by this toner on its own. I have been following new routines, but this toner definitely is the best toner i have ever tried. I used to break out after threading my facial hair although i use rubbing alcohol and cortisone gels but never worked , now i use witch hazel and this toner after threading and I never get those pimples anymore. I experienced a little dryness and irritation around my nose edges and lines around my mouth when I first used it. but when using a good moisturizer this never happened again. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Prep and still loving it. I&#x27;m not going to lie, it stings a bit from the glycolic acid but I always prefer to &amp;#34;feel it working&amp;#34; but I do always think it might be a bit harsh on more sensitive skin. I am 35 and used to have constant ance of all types and have always had uneven skin and giant pores......not anymore! I use this after I clean my face, put some on a cotton ball and wipe twice a day (I only do my neck and chest once a week because that skin is way more sensitive and peels like crazy). I always follow up with Vitamin C serum for the acne scars and use a sunscreen moisturizer in the morning and straight up borage oil at night. I haven&#x27;t had any cystic acne since and any thing that does pop up is gone the next day. My redness is gone and pores appear smaller. I&#x27;m thrilled! Would love to have these scars go away quicker but that is still a work in progress :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference between this and using regular toner. I do like it but don&#x27;t think is worth paying more than my regular toner since it does the same job.</li>
            <li> Burn and itch my skin will not buy it again..</li>
            <li> I use this after I remove my makeup and also before I apply my nightly serums and/or Retin A, and also after I wash my face.  It does sting a bit, but nothing that I can&#x27;t tolerate.  I can&#x27;t honestly say if it makes a difference in my skin tone since I&#x27;m using other products for that, but I do feel it&#x27;s a good prep before I apply serums, and I feel my skin is much cleaner when I use it after washing my face.  Cleansers can leave a residue, and I feel like this takes care of that.  I do feel my skin is much cleaner.  I love using this before I apply makeup as well.  I feel like my skin is a clean, fresh palate, and that it makes my skin better able to soak up the moisturizer I use before I apply my cosmetics.  I have the occasional mild breakout, and this does dry it out and get rid of it quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  I have very sensitive dry skin and this has not caused me any problems at all.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone who has shown interest in facial skin improvement!  She indicated that it was quite soothing!</li>
            <li> I suffer from PCOS - cysts on my ovaries... All of a sudden in Feb 2012 i started breaking out BAD. I had to get on birth control, and have been left with scars. I have been washing and doing facials (pumpkin masks) bought from amazon, and i also bought CellBone&#x27;s, PH balancer for after facial peels. When I saw this I decided to wing it and buy it from the reviews. IN ONLY 3 uses Morning/Night/Morning... my marks are already starting to fade. I can NOT wait to see what my face will look like after 30 days. I wish i bought this earlier! I had a little pimple and this morning! gone! lil red dot. Great product, I ordered it and 2 days later on my door step. I shop alot on Amazon. Cellbone has a customer for life. Now... I will be checking out all of their other products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! When I got it it came with a free sample of face wash. I have very sensitive skin and this is the first product that I have been able to use that hasn&#x27;t left a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> Wow!!! I bought this a few months ago for peels.  I thought it was jusr to prep my skin, do my peel, then im done! I dcided to use it as a toner two days ago ! Oh my my !!!!!!!!! Then i read the ingredients ... Perfect amt of glycolic acid !! No pores, oily skin under control !!!</li>
