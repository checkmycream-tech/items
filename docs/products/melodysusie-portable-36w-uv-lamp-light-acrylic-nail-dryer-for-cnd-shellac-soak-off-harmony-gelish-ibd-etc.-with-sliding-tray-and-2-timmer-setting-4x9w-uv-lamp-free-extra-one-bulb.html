            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I ordered a 54W dryer instead so hopefully that one works better.</li>
            <li>I used some rubbing alcohol on them and most of the sticky feeling went away.</li>
            <li>but honestly I prefer a UV light over an LED any day.</li>
            <li>Love this light!</li>
            <li>Will purchase more products from the seller.</li>
            <li>Great purchase for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>:) Trust me, after you shell out $15 to $18 a bottle for gel or shellac nail polish (I use CND myself)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this item.</li>
            <li>I was able to do my toenails also with this as the bottom panel is removable allowing ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li>So I would love to share my product review</li>
            <li>Since I need to finish doing my nail polish on-the-go most of the time, this function does help me a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can put both my  hands together in it, which saves even more time.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I recomend, :)</li>
            <li>and I love it....</li>
            <li>I found this review to be most helpful and better than the manual.</li>
            <li>Love the quality.</li>
            <li>and I love the timed light!</li>
            <li>I read reviews and was able to get it going easily.</li>
            <li>Bulbs were easy to install (make sure they &#x27;click&#x27; in).  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping and hassle free would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in need of a cheap but great quality for me it worked perfect!!</li>
            <li>This light is huge!  </li>
            <li>Works great and havent had no issues so far for the month that i have had it.</li>
            <li>Works as expected with a great price!</li>
            <li>Works great so far.  </li>
            <li>Just as expected works great!</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; saves money on professional manicures.</li>
            <li>I  love the uv light</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s doing a great job for me.</li>
            <li>I had a RedCarpet Manicure portable light before this one and this is 100x better.</li>
            <li>Good Price and works very well.  </li>
            <li>So far it works fine and service was great.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble and use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite lightweight and easy to carry around if needed.</li>
            <li>Easy to install the bulbs</li>
            <li>it is extremely easy.  </li>
            <li>The lights are easy to install as soon as you remove the bottom panel.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to set up, despite the directions not being  helpful.</li>
            <li>and they said it &amp;#34;should work&amp;#34; with what I had and were going to contact &amp;#34;Research and Development&amp;#34; which I now strongly feel was a tactic to delay my return of this product until after the deadline.  </li>
            <li>The timer is a great way to ensure that you have your hand in the lamp for the right amount of time for a diamond cure, while the easy to clean slide out tray makes it really consumer friendly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it turned in just fine.</li>
            <li>It came in a beautiful box which contained detailed product information as well as an extra uv bulb.</li>
            <li>We set it up and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it because doing your own gel nails is so easy</li>
            <li>I have not had a light go out at all the timer</li>
            <li>cheap and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I bought an LED light</li>
            <li>UV Lamp Light Acrylic Nail Dryer for CND Shellac...)</li>
            <li>Please correct the problem immediately, it is important for my business.</li>
            <li>Works great, even has extra bulb in case you break one.</li>
            <li>One of the light sockets doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>so far so good...</li>
            <li>I chose this one from MelodySusie Direct as I thought this is a good seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such wonderful service.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new uv nail light.</li>
            <li>The value is awesome, I have been using a cnd light and taking it back and forth from Florida to New England every summer.</li>
            <li>It has made doing my gel manicures at home quick and easy, and has saved me money already not having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li>The package arrived promptly, in good condition, was well-packed and easy to open.  </li>
            <li>This UV lamp is absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I am a cosmetologist that is not currently working anymore, however, I appreciate a good product.</li>
            <li>but my hands got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>Item shipped and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>36watts make cure time quick when using quality gel polish.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for a home lamp :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this UV light to everyone that loves doing gel nails!</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It was my first time buying a light</li>
            <li>I would note that while some people may be able to fit 2 hands at once, I was only able to cure one hand at a time, though I must admit that I have large hands, and the machine itself is a travel size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a problem having the switches on the back, opposite the hand opening, but on the top would be better, to accommodate either working on your own nails, or a client&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I can do a full manicure in 25 minutes and it comes out looking so nice and lasts me weeks(thats also taking into consideration specific gel polishes).</li>
            <li>The lights come very well protected and are easy to put in place.  </li>
            <li>For those of you who like to do your nails at home like myself, investing in a reliable UV curing lamp is a must.&lt;br /&gt;This model ships out fast and is easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>More exciting is that it works very well and very fast with my nail polish.</li>
            <li>My fist UV lamp and first time doing gels was a great success due to the lamp I ordered.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great little lamp.</li>
            <li>my whole hand can fit in there at once</li>
            <li>Works great for gel polish, and heavy UV builder gels.</li>
            <li>The seller seems sincere and patiently adviced me to fully plug the bulbs into the slots until I heard an obvious CLICK sound.</li>
            <li>All well worth the effort...</li>
            <li>They sent an extra light bulb as well. :)</li>
            <li>It works very well, has clever timer setting, and is very comfortable and convenient.</li>
            <li>The LED doesn&#x27;t cure well at all and my polish starts peeling right away.</li>
            <li>Wow, I love this UV Lamp for my gel nails SO much!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be doing my own nails now and end up saving so much money!</li>
            <li>The price is very modest for such a good lamp.</li>
            <li>I just got this item delivered and tried it right away to see if it really works, and I must say it did a great job, although I only used it for a regular nail polish just to test it out.</li>
            <li>broke within the first minute of using it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t turn on the lamp at first and turned to customer serive for advice.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I should read the instruction manual carefully.</li>
            <li>Thanks MelodySusie for helping me on this issue!</li>
            <li>Tried two different brands of polish just to be sure.</li>
            <li>and this just saves you so much money!</li>
            <li>you are going to appreciate being able to save $200 bucks on the absolutely necessary UV dryer.</li>
            <li>The sliding door also makes it so much easier and convenient!</li>
            <li>The two minute timer is great and it&#x27;s big enough for your whole hand.</li>
            <li>Used for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>Love that it includes extra bulb.</li>
            <li>I love the 2 different timer option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we returned the lamp, bought the exact one</li>
            <li>This is my first UV lamp</li>
            <li>This works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>She said it is exactly like the one at the salon she went to.</li>
            <li>The reason I say &amp;#34;if not better&amp;#34; is because you have the choice to set the timer at 120 or 180 seconds, so if you&#x27;re like me and feel that 2 minutes is not quite long enough for those thicker polishes, you can safely add just one more minute to the routine where you feel you need it without running the whole 2 minute cycle twice or staring at your watch.</li>
            <li>Plus, they give you an extra light bulb right off the bat.</li>
            <li>But even drying 8 fingers first while drying two thumbs separately wouldn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li>Works every bit as good (if not better) than the $235 one they use at the salon.</li>
            <li>love this product more than the 9W UV because the 36W one has a timer feature where I can decide how long I would like to dry my nail polish.</li>
            <li>I thought the bulbs were quite easy to install, and the bonus is that it comes with an extra.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase from you again.</li>
            <li>I have extremely large hands for a woman</li>
            <li>Takes longer to fully dry other than that&#x27;s its great</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for your prompt delivery and quality.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a key point that need put the lamp tube into the slot until hearing the lock sound.</li>
            <li>When I received it, I found the item really met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping...</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>I can put my whole hand in for curing</li>
            <li>Compared to some others I have seen, this one was reasonably priced, and in my opinion, works just as well.</li>
            <li>Only thing i don&#x27;t like is the bulbs don&#x27;t fit snug in the slots..</li>
            <li>My Delivery  was fast</li>
            <li>I really debated on whether to buy a UV or LED lamp, but decided on this one because one of my structure products requires UV.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>This is the second light I&#x27;ve received.</li>
            <li>Definitely the socket and not the light bulb.</li>
            <li>and I can easily put my whole hand in to dry.</li>
            <li>If you have a special lady in your life, this is definitely the gift to give!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about two months, and it&#x27;s still working like new!</li>
            <li>I have never heard from them again and tried again on my own to see if it would work because I so badly wanted to do my own Shellac manicure at home</li>
            <li>Received very quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with the light you just need to a put a little tension on it when you&#x27;re pushing them in and they popped right in place; not wobbly they&#x27;re stable</li>
            <li>I will say after a while this one does get a little hot, and for some gels, you do need to use the 180 seconds setting because this lamp is NOT as strong as others out there.</li>
            <li>It’s just amazing how I don’t have to wait for a long time for my polish to dry, plus I love black.</li>
            <li>I had no problem with it drying my nails satisfactorily using a high quality gel polish.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for home use.  </li>
            <li>, highly recommend this lam if looking fir a UV Lamp.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>It is easy installation, easy instructions, not to big or to small.</li>
            <li>The transaction was smooth and was received when expected.</li>
            <li>I used a top coat and it dried immediately.</li>
            <li>After a few more manicures, it will have paid for itself.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s just normal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a slick-looking and black lamp, which makes it looks more professional than lamps in salons.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To compare the MelodySusie to the 9W one, this UV lamp has more room for my two hands to dry at the same time.</li>
            <li>I just received this today and I am sending it right back.</li>
            <li>It sells several kinds of nail dryers which all have a good reputation, even though I did also read some negative reviews.</li>
            <li>The first time I used Gelish brand gel polish and the second time I used CND Shellac.</li>
            <li>Its strictly black light for applying acrylic nails.....</li>
            <li>Only gave 4 stars because it is large and bulky.</li>
            <li>Really recommend for personal use.</li>
            <li>This nail dryer will be a Christmas gift for my adult daughter.  </li>
            <li>There was no paperwork as far as owners manual, warranty card or any way to register the product in the package.  </li>
            <li>This nail dryer, makes it more convenient to keep my nails glisten for at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Either way the uv light should have dried it.</li>
            <li>which is a real bonus, especially if you&#x27;re doing your toes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it.</li>
            <li>Was for my 6 year old and she LOVES it</li>
            <li>I have used this product twice so far</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, and you have enough room to put your whole hand in it.</li>
            <li>Love this lamp only had for a few weeks</li>
            <li>It gets too hot if you put your fingers in all the way, so you have to be careful, but it works well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s big enough to put your whole hand in it</li>
            <li>There is enough room to put your entire hand in, but my thumb didn&#x27;t cure very well,</li>
            <li>Being only able to do one hand at a time never occurred to me since I usually have my nails done at a shop!</li>
            <li>No regrets here!</li>
            <li>Lights are a little loose, but they still work fine.</li>
            <li>But than I realized it&#x27;s for 120 sec which isn&#x27;t really useful since you only need 30 sec to cure the gel polish the have with the amount of wattage...</li>
            <li>Much faster that the other product!</li>
            <li>(It wasn&#x27;t just sticky like normal gel, it actually made imprints of my finger prints so yes it was still wet after 2 hours of trying.)  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Easy to put in lights and works like a charm!</li>

            <li> Neatly packaged when first received and looks nice of the lamp!</li>
            <li> So please make sure you guys fully plug the UV bulbs when you are about to do your nails with this lamp.</li>
            <li> Love it salon quality</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I ordered a 54W dryer instead so hopefully that one works better.</li>
            <li> I used some rubbing alcohol on them and most of the sticky feeling went away.</li>
            <li> but honestly I prefer a UV light over an LED any day.</li>
            <li> Love this light!</li>
            <li> Will purchase more products from the seller.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> :) Trust me, after you shell out $15 to $18 a bottle for gel or shellac nail polish (I use CND myself)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item.</li>
            <li> I was able to do my toenails also with this as the bottom panel is removable allowing ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li> So I would love to share my product review</li>
            <li> Since I need to finish doing my nail polish on-the-go most of the time, this function does help me a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can put both my  hands together in it, which saves even more time.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I recomend, :)</li>
            <li> and I love it....</li>
            <li> I found this review to be most helpful and better than the manual.</li>
            <li> Love the quality.</li>
            <li> and I love the timed light!</li>
            <li> I read reviews and was able to get it going easily.</li>
            <li> Bulbs were easy to install (make sure they &#x27;click&#x27; in).  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and hassle free would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in need of a cheap but great quality for me it worked perfect!!</li>
            <li> This light is huge!  </li>
            <li> Works great and havent had no issues so far for the month that i have had it.</li>
            <li> Works as expected with a great price!</li>
            <li> Works great so far.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected works great!</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; saves money on professional manicures.</li>
            <li> I  love the uv light</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s doing a great job for me.</li>
            <li> I had a RedCarpet Manicure portable light before this one and this is 100x better.</li>
            <li> Good Price and works very well.  </li>
            <li> So far it works fine and service was great.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble and use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite lightweight and easy to carry around if needed.</li>
            <li> Easy to install the bulbs</li>
            <li> it is extremely easy.  </li>
            <li> The lights are easy to install as soon as you remove the bottom panel.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to set up, despite the directions not being  helpful.</li>
            <li> and they said it &amp;#34;should work&amp;#34; with what I had and were going to contact &amp;#34;Research and Development&amp;#34; which I now strongly feel was a tactic to delay my return of this product until after the deadline.  </li>
            <li> The timer is a great way to ensure that you have your hand in the lamp for the right amount of time for a diamond cure, while the easy to clean slide out tray makes it really consumer friendly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it turned in just fine.</li>
            <li> It came in a beautiful box which contained detailed product information as well as an extra uv bulb.</li>
            <li> We set it up and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it because doing your own gel nails is so easy</li>
            <li> I have not had a light go out at all the timer</li>
            <li> cheap and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I bought an LED light</li>
            <li> UV Lamp Light Acrylic Nail Dryer for CND Shellac...)</li>
            <li> Please correct the problem immediately, it is important for my business.</li>
            <li> Works great, even has extra bulb in case you break one.</li>
            <li> One of the light sockets doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> so far so good...</li>
            <li> I chose this one from MelodySusie Direct as I thought this is a good seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such wonderful service.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new uv nail light.</li>
            <li> The value is awesome, I have been using a cnd light and taking it back and forth from Florida to New England every summer.</li>
            <li> It has made doing my gel manicures at home quick and easy, and has saved me money already not having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> The package arrived promptly, in good condition, was well-packed and easy to open.  </li>
            <li> This UV lamp is absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist that is not currently working anymore, however, I appreciate a good product.</li>
            <li> but my hands got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> Item shipped and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> 36watts make cure time quick when using quality gel polish.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for a home lamp :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this UV light to everyone that loves doing gel nails!</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It was my first time buying a light</li>
            <li> I would note that while some people may be able to fit 2 hands at once, I was only able to cure one hand at a time, though I must admit that I have large hands, and the machine itself is a travel size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a problem having the switches on the back, opposite the hand opening, but on the top would be better, to accommodate either working on your own nails, or a client&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I can do a full manicure in 25 minutes and it comes out looking so nice and lasts me weeks(thats also taking into consideration specific gel polishes).</li>
            <li> The lights come very well protected and are easy to put in place.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who like to do your nails at home like myself, investing in a reliable UV curing lamp is a must.&lt;br /&gt;This model ships out fast and is easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> More exciting is that it works very well and very fast with my nail polish.</li>
            <li> My fist UV lamp and first time doing gels was a great success due to the lamp I ordered.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great little lamp.</li>
            <li> my whole hand can fit in there at once</li>
            <li> Works great for gel polish, and heavy UV builder gels.</li>
            <li> The seller seems sincere and patiently adviced me to fully plug the bulbs into the slots until I heard an obvious CLICK sound.</li>
            <li> All well worth the effort...</li>
            <li> They sent an extra light bulb as well. :)</li>
            <li> It works very well, has clever timer setting, and is very comfortable and convenient.</li>
            <li> The LED doesn&#x27;t cure well at all and my polish starts peeling right away.</li>
            <li> Wow, I love this UV Lamp for my gel nails SO much!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be doing my own nails now and end up saving so much money!</li>
            <li> The price is very modest for such a good lamp.</li>
            <li> I just got this item delivered and tried it right away to see if it really works, and I must say it did a great job, although I only used it for a regular nail polish just to test it out.</li>
            <li> broke within the first minute of using it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t turn on the lamp at first and turned to customer serive for advice.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I should read the instruction manual carefully.</li>
            <li> Thanks MelodySusie for helping me on this issue!</li>
            <li> Tried two different brands of polish just to be sure.</li>
            <li> and this just saves you so much money!</li>
            <li> you are going to appreciate being able to save $200 bucks on the absolutely necessary UV dryer.</li>
            <li> The sliding door also makes it so much easier and convenient!</li>
            <li> The two minute timer is great and it&#x27;s big enough for your whole hand.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> Love that it includes extra bulb.</li>
            <li> I love the 2 different timer option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we returned the lamp, bought the exact one</li>
            <li> This is my first UV lamp</li>
            <li> This works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> She said it is exactly like the one at the salon she went to.</li>
            <li> The reason I say &amp;#34;if not better&amp;#34; is because you have the choice to set the timer at 120 or 180 seconds, so if you&#x27;re like me and feel that 2 minutes is not quite long enough for those thicker polishes, you can safely add just one more minute to the routine where you feel you need it without running the whole 2 minute cycle twice or staring at your watch.</li>
            <li> Plus, they give you an extra light bulb right off the bat.</li>
            <li> But even drying 8 fingers first while drying two thumbs separately wouldn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li> Works every bit as good (if not better) than the $235 one they use at the salon.</li>
            <li> love this product more than the 9W UV because the 36W one has a timer feature where I can decide how long I would like to dry my nail polish.</li>
            <li> I thought the bulbs were quite easy to install, and the bonus is that it comes with an extra.</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase from you again.</li>
            <li> I have extremely large hands for a woman</li>
            <li> Takes longer to fully dry other than that&#x27;s its great</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for your prompt delivery and quality.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a key point that need put the lamp tube into the slot until hearing the lock sound.</li>
            <li> When I received it, I found the item really met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> I can put my whole hand in for curing</li>
            <li> Compared to some others I have seen, this one was reasonably priced, and in my opinion, works just as well.</li>
            <li> Only thing i don&#x27;t like is the bulbs don&#x27;t fit snug in the slots..</li>
            <li> My Delivery  was fast</li>
            <li> I really debated on whether to buy a UV or LED lamp, but decided on this one because one of my structure products requires UV.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> This is the second light I&#x27;ve received.</li>
            <li> Definitely the socket and not the light bulb.</li>
            <li> and I can easily put my whole hand in to dry.</li>
            <li> If you have a special lady in your life, this is definitely the gift to give!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about two months, and it&#x27;s still working like new!</li>
            <li> I have never heard from them again and tried again on my own to see if it would work because I so badly wanted to do my own Shellac manicure at home</li>
            <li> Received very quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the light you just need to a put a little tension on it when you&#x27;re pushing them in and they popped right in place; not wobbly they&#x27;re stable</li>
            <li> I will say after a while this one does get a little hot, and for some gels, you do need to use the 180 seconds setting because this lamp is NOT as strong as others out there.</li>
            <li> It’s just amazing how I don’t have to wait for a long time for my polish to dry, plus I love black.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with it drying my nails satisfactorily using a high quality gel polish.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for home use.  </li>
            <li> , highly recommend this lam if looking fir a UV Lamp.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> It is easy installation, easy instructions, not to big or to small.</li>
            <li> The transaction was smooth and was received when expected.</li>
            <li> I used a top coat and it dried immediately.</li>
            <li> After a few more manicures, it will have paid for itself.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s just normal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slick-looking and black lamp, which makes it looks more professional than lamps in salons.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To compare the MelodySusie to the 9W one, this UV lamp has more room for my two hands to dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and I am sending it right back.</li>
            <li> It sells several kinds of nail dryers which all have a good reputation, even though I did also read some negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The first time I used Gelish brand gel polish and the second time I used CND Shellac.</li>
            <li> Its strictly black light for applying acrylic nails.....</li>
            <li> Only gave 4 stars because it is large and bulky.</li>
            <li> Really recommend for personal use.</li>
            <li> This nail dryer will be a Christmas gift for my adult daughter.  </li>
            <li> There was no paperwork as far as owners manual, warranty card or any way to register the product in the package.  </li>
            <li> This nail dryer, makes it more convenient to keep my nails glisten for at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Either way the uv light should have dried it.</li>
            <li> which is a real bonus, especially if you&#x27;re doing your toes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it.</li>
            <li> Was for my 6 year old and she LOVES it</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice so far</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, and you have enough room to put your whole hand in it.</li>
            <li> Love this lamp only had for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It gets too hot if you put your fingers in all the way, so you have to be careful, but it works well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s big enough to put your whole hand in it</li>
            <li> There is enough room to put your entire hand in, but my thumb didn&#x27;t cure very well,</li>
            <li> Being only able to do one hand at a time never occurred to me since I usually have my nails done at a shop!</li>
            <li> No regrets here!</li>
            <li> Lights are a little loose, but they still work fine.</li>
            <li> But than I realized it&#x27;s for 120 sec which isn&#x27;t really useful since you only need 30 sec to cure the gel polish the have with the amount of wattage...</li>
            <li> Much faster that the other product!</li>
            <li> (It wasn&#x27;t just sticky like normal gel, it actually made imprints of my finger prints so yes it was still wet after 2 hours of trying.)  </li>
            <li> you MelodySusie High Quality Portable Black 36W Lamp.</li>
            <li> hello, I bought (MelodySusie® High Quality Portable Black 36W</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love to do our nails but usually end up smudging them waiting for them to air dry when you put on a few coats.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it every other day.  </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t push the bulbs in hard enough at first</li>
            <li> There is nothing like getting all cute and doing your nails, but the worst thing other than a chipped nail is when you get a rather annoying smudge right after a perfect application.</li>
            <li> Long story short, It began to smoke after 30 seconds of turning on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering, does this only dry gel nail polish</li>
            <li> Basically the same as the one that my nail technician used to dry my nail.  </li>
            <li> after the third time of color I realized the bulbs were loose.</li>
            <li> takes a long time to dry the polish.</li>
            <li> Takes so long for the nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to other clay artists who also use UV resin.</li>
            <li> My only desire for changes, to make this a 5 star product, would be to have other than the 2 minute setting.</li>
            <li> , they replied promptly saying that this is the first complaint about the lamp smoking and my room reeks of burnt plastic!</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how low priced it is compared to other UV lamps.</li>
            <li> Plus the other one I bought is bigger and I can dry two hands or feet at once.</li>
            <li> The bulbs have a tendency to get loose.</li>
            <li> Some say bulbs come loose, but one must remember, the bulbs must&amp;#34;Click&amp;#34; into their sockets when installing them.</li>
            <li> less time total than traveling to a shop.</li>
            <li> You have to push very hard and really get them to snap in.</li>
            <li> The manual is a little hard to read but it doesn&#x27;t have much info.</li>
            <li> It took a little figuring to install the bulbs, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> must admit, like most others I read ALL of the reviews before I made a purchase decision, and while I was initially skeptical, the price was hard to pass up.</li>
            <li> Only had for a few weeks and one of the bulbs is out already.</li>
            <li> Ok so after I wrote this review I just applied the color to the sticky base coat and that was still gummy after several tries.</li>
            <li> I bought this UV lamp on a whim since I was tired of paying so much to have my nails done for something I could do myself.</li>
            <li> Minimally functional.</li>
            <li> It dried regular nail polish and gel polish with no problems.</li>
            <li> Still useable minus one of the lights inside.</li>
            <li> This shouldn’t be a problem since the lamp cures in only a few minutes, just like those you find at the salon.</li>
            <li> The other hand can&#x27;t do anything while curing your wet hand.</li>
            <li> Other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> Works as expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not kidding!</li>
            <li> Withing two days and one other use the lights stopped coming on.</li>
            <li> Extremely dissapointing.</li>
            <li> fit badly constructed</li>
            <li> Purchased this item specifically to use with the CND Shellac base coat and top coat</li>
            <li> It cuts nail drying time down drastically.  </li>
            <li> Tray slides out so you can wipe it down</li>
            <li> I just wonder if that reviewer knows that gel Polish is a bit gummy and you need to wipe your nails down with rubbing alcohol after you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> (unless you want your house to burn down.)</li>
            <li> Cures my polish in half the time my other nail dryer used to!</li>
            <li> Half the bulbs stopped working within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> She does her nails about a little over once a week.</li>
            <li> One at a time takes a little longer, so you watch TV while the curing goes on about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> This lamp is a little flimsy and it isn&#x27;t 36 watts as described.</li>
            <li> Maybe I used the wrong gel polish, but it didn&#x27;t dry my nails, even after I put it under the lights several times.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid to push very hard on the light to install it.</li>
            <li> only complaint was how hard it was to put the bulbs in.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than other similar models.  </li>
            <li> Just bought it and have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!  </li>
            <li> No, there are no instructions to aid you in this endeavor, but there is a small catch and a small raised ridge in the form of a rectangle so you can see where the removable panel is.  </li>
            <li> I chose the 120s one, and all my nail polish was dried WITHIN 120s!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sitting here for the last 2 hours trying to dry just a uv gel base coat and my nails are still gummy.</li>
            <li> I am still returning it because it didn&#x27;t dry the base coat properly.</li>
            <li> It was packaged tight so nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> so thought it was broken.</li>
            <li> I tried again with a very very thin coat of base coat and the timer on for 3 minutes at a later date</li>
            <li> This item works, just don&#x27;t suck at life and put the bulbs in the wrong way.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it wrong.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed</li>
            <li> had to return it :(</li>
            <li> Maybe it was the BMC base coat I used..?</li>
            <li> All the lights were on and I turned the timer on for 2 minutes and then for 3 minutes and every time the base coat remained gummy.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because the product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed</li>
            <li> She was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible doesn&#x27;t work at all...</li>
            <li> terrible item, can&#x27;t get lights in/</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this UV lamp. Delivery was on time. It was packaged tight so nothing was broken. It even comes with 5 Bulbs. I used it and it works great. Great price for a great product. Easy to assemble and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering, does this only dry gel nail polish</li>
            <li> Neatly packaged when first received and looks nice of the lamp! But a bit disappoited because the UV bulbs did not turn on when I plugged them in the slots. I thought that it was defective and contacted the seller for a refund. The seller seems sincere and patiently adviced me to fully plug the bulbs into the slots until I heard an obvious CLICK sound. The suggestion worked indeed. So please make sure you guys fully plug the UV bulbs when you are about to do your nails with this lamp. After this problem was solved, I tried to do my DIY nails step by step after watching some videos about doing nails. I&#x27;ve been used this item for four times and everytime I was so proud of myself doing very nice nails with this lamp! Nothing to complain! Good seller, great service and perfect lamp!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it every other day.  I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> Wife wanted to start saving some money so she decided to start doing her own nails.  She loves it, and so does my pocket.  She does her nails about a little over once a week. Saves time and money and they look great.</li>
            <li> I was hesitating before I bought this lamp. I decided to buy and I will return it if it doesn&#x27;t meet my expectation. After i received it, I started to try it at once. Everything is perfect! I didn’t expect it to be so gooooood! It&#x27;s a slick-looking and black lamp, which makes it looks more professional than lamps in salons. More exciting is that it works very well and very fast with my nail polish. You can also change time settings. The short time setting is enough for me. Really recommend for personal use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy it&#x27;s big enough to put your whole hand in it and it comes with an extra bulb also It was packaged well and sent ON TIME.</li>
            <li> Works great and havent had no issues so far for the month that i have had it.</li>
            <li> Love it salon quality</li>
            <li> Great value and my lady loved it so five stars!</li>
            <li> This nail dryer will be a Christmas gift for my adult daughter.  I inspected the contents, but the lamp won&#x27;t actually be used until after Santa makes his delivery.  The package arrived promptly, in good condition, was well-packed and easy to open.  The product packaging is attractive and the dryer looks like a high-end product.m</li>
            <li> Horrible. Half the bulbs stopped working within 3 weeks. Bought it out of convenience,  never again.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.  That is, once I figured out how to use it.  There was no paperwork as far as owners manual, warranty card or any way to register the product in the package.  But works well for home use.</li>
            <li> Item was as described.Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Works just perfect for one hand at a time curing. The other hand can&#x27;t do anything while curing your wet hand. Being only able to do one hand at a time never occurred to me since I usually have my nails done at a shop! One at a time takes a little longer, so you watch TV while the curing goes on about 2-3 minutes. All well worth the effort... less time total than traveling to a shop. The machine works with with timer and off/on. Quality machine and good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Only had for a few weeks and one of the bulbs is out already. Other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> My daugther loved this :)</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for your prompt delivery and quality. I am very pleased with my new uv nail light. The value is awesome, I have been using a cnd light and taking it back and forth from Florida to New England every summer. I will certainly purchase from you again.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and read the reviews for 30min. This item works, just don&#x27;t suck at life and put the bulbs in the wrong way. I read reviews and was able to get it going easily. Don&#x27;t do it wrong.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered in 2 days and does what it says! One of the bulbs was not working so I removed it and put it in the opposite direction and it turned in just fine. You will feel it heat up but my hands got used to it quickly. The timers and start button are on the back so if you are using this for yourself, you&#x27;ll have to memorize where they are located. Since it uses UV radiation, I am ordering the protective gloves. Overall, very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this have had it for about 2 months not I do my nails about every week of not 2 times a week. I have not had a light go out at all the timer is really nice. You have two settings for the timer as well as just staying on. They sent an extra light bulb as well. :)</li>
            <li> broke within the first minute of using it. cheap and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t turn on the lamp at first and turned to customer serive for advice. The staff from Melodysusie told me to check whether the lamp tube is well assembled. There&#x27;s a key point that need put the lamp tube into the slot until hearing the lock sound. Then the tube is well assembled. Honestly, I should read the instruction manual carefully. Thanks MelodySusie for helping me on this issue!</li>
            <li> Great nail dryer..it drys the nails in 90 seconds..</li>
            <li> Nice design. When I browsed through Amazon I was attracted by its design. It looked beautiful and useful. When I received it, I found the item really met my expectations. I like gel nail polish so much, because it makes my nail more beautiful so I get mine designed every 3 weeks.  This nail dryer, makes it more convenient to keep my nails glisten for at least 3 weeks. It works very well, has clever timer setting, and is very comfortable and convenient. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase. I like the tray sliding in and out, will make good easy cleaning!</li>
            <li> This product works wonderful.I received my product by my promo date along with all the extras.</li>
            <li> the lamp is fast and efficient, great for the price!</li>
            <li> Received this item brought it to work to use it and it does not work!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have found a UV light that didn&#x27;t cost me and arm and a leg.  I will say after a while this one does get a little hot, and for some gels, you do need to use the 180 seconds setting because this lamp is NOT as strong as others out there.</li>
            <li> Item as pictured, and it works perfectly. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I just got this item delivered and tried it right away to see if it really works, and I must say it did a great job, although I only used it for a regular nail polish just to test it out. I’ll try the gel polish probably next week and fingers crossed it will do the same job. It’s just amazing how I don’t have to wait for a long time for my polish to dry, plus I love black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about two months, and it&#x27;s still working like new! Cures my gel polish in under two minutes!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because the product doesn&#x27;t work. Could you return an amount back?</li>
            <li> It gets too hot if you put your fingers in all the way, so you have to be careful, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping... Received in 3 days!! :) so far so good... I bought this cause I liked the two option timer.. . But than I realized it&#x27;s for 120 sec which isn&#x27;t really useful since you only need 30 sec to cure the gel polish the have with the amount of wattage... But it did the job I just had to turn it off manually.  BTW you must press timer button every time to switch it on.. So click power switch than timer button and the lights will click on.. .was worried when I turned power button on and nothing happened haha.  also the extra bulb is a plus!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this lamp. It cures my nails fast and perfectly.  I&#x27;ve used shellac and gel polish and it works great.</li>
            <li> Very easy to put together./ Works great. Nice size</li>
            <li> I just received this today and I am sending it right back. I&#x27;ve been sitting here for the last 2 hours trying to dry just a uv gel base coat and my nails are still gummy. (It wasn&#x27;t just sticky like normal gel, it actually made imprints of my finger prints so yes it was still wet after 2 hours of trying.)  I ordered a 54W dryer instead so hopefully that one works better. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!  Ok so after I wrote this review I just applied the color to the sticky base coat and that was still gummy after several tries. I used some rubbing alcohol on them and most of the sticky feeling went away. I used a top coat and it dried immediately. I am still returning it because it didn&#x27;t dry the base coat properly. Plus the other one I bought is bigger and I can dry two hands or feet at once. Maybe it was the BMC base coat I used..? I used BMC too coat and polish too. Either way the uv light should have dried it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works Great!</li>
            <li> takes a long time to dry the polish. Even after several minutes the polish still felt tacky. Tried two different brands of polish just to be sure. Still sufficient though if you&#x27;re not in a rush.</li>
            <li> I received this item a week ago, have used it twice and absolutely love it!  It cuts nail drying time down drastically.  I only wish I would have made the purchase sooner.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and is extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> This light is seriously amazing! I bought an LED light but honestly I prefer a UV light over an LED any day. The LED doesn&#x27;t cure well at all and my polish starts peeling right away. Love this light! Awesome buy and cheap price! :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and works just as good as the one they use in the salon. It came in a beautiful box which contained detailed product information as well as an extra uv bulb. Will purchase more products from the seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this UV lamp on a whim since I was tired of paying so much to have my nails done for something I could do myself. This exceeded my expectations especially considering the price point! It&#x27;s so nice and works just as well as one that would be used at a salon. I can do a full manicure in 25 minutes and it comes out looking so nice and lasts me weeks(thats also taking into consideration specific gel polishes). I really recommend it because doing your own gel nails is so easy and this just saves you so much money!</li>
            <li> This was a gift. I did this for a girl who was 13 on Christmas. I found it to be a wonderful gift for a young lady.</li>
            <li> Just bought it and have used it a few times. Works great!!!</li>
            <li> My 3D printed models have never looked better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you MelodySusie High Quality Portable Black 36W Lamp.</li>
            <li> Horrible doesn&#x27;t work at all...</li>
            <li> Works good. I like that I can put my whole hand in for curing</li>
            <li> Works great! Lights are a little loose, but they still work fine.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for a reasonable price. Compared to some others I have seen, this one was reasonably priced, and in my opinion, works just as well. The timer feature is fabulous and is the perfect time. I thought the bulbs were quite easy to install, and the bonus is that it comes with an extra. It&#x27;s quite lightweight and easy to carry around if needed. I had no problem with it drying my nails satisfactorily using a high quality gel polish. No regrets here!</li>
            <li> Works as expected with a great price!</li>
            <li> Wow, I love this UV Lamp for my gel nails SO much! Works every bit as good (if not better) than the $235 one they use at the salon. The reason I say &amp;#34;if not better&amp;#34; is because you have the choice to set the timer at 120 or 180 seconds, so if you&#x27;re like me and feel that 2 minutes is not quite long enough for those thicker polishes, you can safely add just one more minute to the routine where you feel you need it without running the whole 2 minute cycle twice or staring at your watch. Plus, they give you an extra light bulb right off the bat. And it&#x27;s lightweight, easy to move around to whatever angle you need it to be so that you can comfortably rest your hand - or your toes!! - inside without worrying about smudging your polish. Tray slides out so you can wipe it down which is a real bonus, especially if you&#x27;re doing your toes. :) Trust me, after you shell out $15 to $18 a bottle for gel or shellac nail polish (I use CND myself) you are going to appreciate being able to save $200 bucks on the absolutely necessary UV dryer.</li>
            <li> Item shipped and delivered quickly.  Bulbs were easy to install (make sure they &#x27;click&#x27; in).  Polish cured well.  It has paid for itself with just one use!  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Minimally functional. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My fist UV lamp and first time doing gels was a great success due to the lamp I ordered. It is easy installation, easy instructions, not to big or to small. The sliding door also makes it so much easier and convenient!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item. It works great...</li>
            <li> Was thinking of getting one of these for over a year.  Basically the same as the one that my nail technician used to dry my nail.  Easy to install the bulbs and you get one extra just in case.  Used it once already and plan on doing my nails every two weeks myself.  It has already paid for itself in just one sitting.Just plug it in and turn it on and set the button for 120 secs (2 minutes) or 180 secs (3 minutes) it is extremely easy.  I use this with the CND Shellac polishes and it works great.</li>
            <li> So far it works fine and service was great.</li>
            <li> hello, I bought (MelodySusie® High Quality Portable Black 36W UV Lamp Light Acrylic Nail Dryer for CND Shellac...), and it does not work. I do not know why. Please correct the problem immediately, it is important for my business. Otherwise I would have problems, and it&#x27;s because of you, because you send unchecked product.&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know what you will make to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> Good Price and works very well.  Less expensive than other similar models.  I use it with CND Shellac with great results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Works great,  love it</li>
            <li> This is a great UV Light. It is the perfect size to fit one hand at a time and it has a timer that goes off when finished</li>
            <li> The bulbs have a tendency to get loose. I didn&#x27;t realize this when I was doing my nails....after the third time of color I realized the bulbs were loose.</li>
            <li> Great Machine for home use. Fast Shipping and hassle free would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in need of a cheap but great quality for me it worked perfect!!</li>
            <li> I bought this UV dryer to use in my polymer clay jewelry making to cure my UV resin.  It works like a charm and fits nicely on my work table.  Would definitely recommend to other clay artists who also use UV resin.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my product but wondering why I haven&#x27;t got the top coat primer yet.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed Does Nt Work At All! Do Nt Buy</li>
            <li> Works great, great output and durable. Some say bulbs come loose, but one must remember, the bulbs must&amp;#34;Click&amp;#34; into their sockets when installing them. I was able to do my toenails also with this as the bottom panel is removable allowing ease of cleaning.You cant beat this as it has the best bang for your buck. 36watts make cure time quick when using quality gel polish.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.  Highly recommend it for home use.  Like saving the dollars that I would be spending at a shop.  After a few more manicures, it will have paid for itself.</li>
            <li> The product works great. It is a nice generous size. You could put one foot at a time in it if you were doing a pedicure. The tricky part for me was putting the lights in it. They each come in their own protective box. It was my first time buying a light and I was afraid to push very hard on the light to install it. They just pop in. I used a nail file to push on the metal base of the light rather than holding onto the actual light when I &amp;#34;pushed&amp;#34; it into place. Just know you do have to push on it to pop it in.</li>
            <li> Product works well. It dried regular nail polish and gel polish with no problems. Only thing i don&#x27;t like is the bulbs don&#x27;t fit snug in the slots..and i haven&#x27;t figured out how to fix that.</li>
            <li> The lights are easy to install as soon as you remove the bottom panel.  No, there are no instructions to aid you in this endeavor, but there is a small catch and a small raised ridge in the form of a rectangle so you can see where the removable panel is.  Flip the catch with the tip of a table knife, remove it, and then insert the bulbs.  Keep the extra bulb for later.  The dryer works well.  I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it.</li>
            <li> Just as expected works great! I&#x27;m very pleased with this and would recommend it to others. The two minute timer is great and it&#x27;s big enough for your whole hand. I suppose you could get your foot in there but I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li> Was for my 6 year old and she LOVES it</li>
            <li> Works perfect. Used for the first time tonight. If you do your nails like you&#x27;re supposed to for shellac or gel nails it cures perfect salon quality highly recommended. I had no problems with the light you just need to a put a little tension on it when you&#x27;re pushing them in and they popped right in place; not wobbly they&#x27;re stable it&#x27;s a good product.  The timer is a plus.</li>
            <li> Works as expected! Cures my CND sculpted gel. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Very nice. We didn&#x27;t push the bulbs in hard enough at first so thought it was broken. You have to push very hard and really get them to snap in. After that, product worked great and amazing price</li>
            <li> Worked great and delivered right on time!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it mine would not turn on.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist that is not currently working anymore, however, I appreciate a good product. This is a good product. This lamp works just as it should. The price is very modest for such a good lamp.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom. The lights are wobbly and don&#x27;t even come on. She was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need it for. Love that it includes extra bulb.</li>
            <li> My sister received this as a gift and after trying it, I had to buy one myself! My nails came out salon quality at home! I will definitely be doing my own nails now and end up saving so much money! If you have a special lady in your life, this is definitely the gift to give! I am so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> This light is huge!  I have extremely large hands for a woman and I can easily put my whole hand in to dry. The lights come very well protected and are easy to put in place.  It has made doing my gel manicures at home quick and easy, and has saved me money already not having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> So I actually just purchased the 9W UV nail dryer on Amazon, and it works well. But my friend Susan purchased a 36W UV one with 5 bulbs and I tried it at her house. And the results were amazing. I had to come back and buy one for myself. So I would love to share my product review here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product more than the 9W UV because the 36W one has a timer feature where I can decide how long I would like to dry my nail polish. It shows a 120s and 180s selection. I chose the 120s one, and all my nail polish was dried WITHIN 120s! Much faster that the other product! I&#x27;m really not kidding! Since I need to finish doing my nail polish on-the-go most of the time, this function does help me a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compare the MelodySusie to the 9W one, this UV lamp has more room for my two hands to dry at the same time. I can put both my  hands together in it, which saves even more time. But I guess I should say that my hands are not very big, so putting two hands together in this nail dryer is not a big problem for me. But even drying 8 fingers first while drying two thumbs separately wouldn&#x27;t take much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on this was excellent. I chose this one from MelodySusie Direct as I thought this is a good seller on Amazon. It sells several kinds of nail dryers which all have a good reputation, even though I did also read some negative reviews. But that&#x27;s just normal I guess, you can&#x27;t please everyone. All in all, this didn&#x27;t affect my decision to purchase this one because I like the price as well as the customer service. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This would have gotten 5 stars if it had a fan!!!  Its strictly black light for applying acrylic nails.....not drying polish in a hurry!!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift. I love it. It does a good Job. I have used it twice and have had great results. The first time I used Gelish brand gel polish and the second time I used CND Shellac. I was concerned when I read one of the reviews because one of the reviewers gave it a 1 star because she said it didn&#x27;t work with CND shellac. I was hesitant to buy a CND, but really loved one of their colors so decided to give it a chance. It worked perfectly well. I just wonder if that reviewer knows that gel Polish is a bit gummy and you need to wipe your nails down with rubbing alcohol after you&#x27;re finished. I think this is a great little lamp. I love the 2 different timer option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was how hard it was to put the bulbs in. I had to have my husband do it because I couldn&#x27;t get them to stick and the directions weren&#x27;t that great. Once they&#x27;re in, it&#x27;s a great light. It was probably user error.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother for Christmas. It was easy to set up, despite the directions not being  helpful. Worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; saves money on professional manicures.</li>
            <li> The lamp is really good!!  I recomend, :)</li>
            <li> Maybe I used the wrong gel polish, but it didn&#x27;t dry my nails, even after I put it under the lights several times.</li>
            <li> My Delivery  was fast I  love the uv light the price was awesome.</li>
            <li> Works great, even has extra bulb in case you break one. Good product for the price</li>
            <li> Love this lamp only had for a few weeks but it has been great, highly recommend this lam if looking fir a UV Lamp. I have been using with Revel Nail Polishes and it has done a fantastic job!!!</li>
            <li> Product is well packaged! It took a little figuring to install the bulbs, but not a big deal. So far, it&#x27;s doing a great job for me. My nails are cured in one or two of the settings. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice so far and I love it....</li>
            <li> This lamp works great with Shellac! It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition too! I would highly recommend it for a home lamp :)</li>
            <li> I really debated on whether to buy a UV or LED lamp, but decided on this one because one of my structure products requires UV. The packaging was good. There is enough room to put your entire hand in, but my thumb didn&#x27;t cure very well, so now I cure the thumbs separately. The manual is a little hard to read but it doesn&#x27;t have much info. I found this review to be most helpful and better than the manual. (She also does some discussion on UV vs LED). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;YZZ7bM3pooM</li>
            <li> Love the quality. This is my 2nd purchase. I needed 2 for my job. They are constantly on for my job I&#x27;m a nail tech</li>
            <li> Takes longer to fully dry other than that&#x27;s its great</li>
            <li> I turned it on once and then it wouldn&#x27;t work again. Tried taking bulbs out and put back in but no use. It&#x27;s dead. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent UV lamp for the price; it seems to be of good, quality manufacture. My only desire for changes, to make this a 5 star product, would be to have other than the 2 minute setting. The switches seem like they will last forever, and you can turn on and off manually for any time you want. It&#x27;s not a problem having the switches on the back, opposite the hand opening, but on the top would be better, to accommodate either working on your own nails, or a client&#x27;s. I am thoroughly satisfied with the MelodySusie lamp, and I would recommend others buy this great value, quality item if you want a UV nail lamp.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this light. Did her nails in 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> Thank you.  Received very quickly and as expected. Great quality item! Thanks for such wonderful service.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister.  We set it up and it worked fine. Withing two days and one other use the lights stopped coming on. While it worked, it worked great from what she said. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. Waste of money and time</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.  Takes so long for the nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> This is the second light I&#x27;ve received. My brother ordered this for me for Christmas. Long story short, It began to smoke after 30 seconds of turning on. I was really disappointed so I emailed Melody Susie about the problem, they replied promptly saying that this is the first complaint about the lamp smoking and my room reeks of burnt plastic! Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we returned the lamp, bought the exact one and it has the same problem. How could they send 2, both as a fire hazard. Its made in China so the fixture probably doesn&#x27;t go through quality control. It even smokes without any bulbs plugged in! I won&#x27;t be ordering products from Melody Susie anymore. I suggest you don&#x27;t ether. (unless you want your house to burn down.)</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, and you have enough room to put your whole hand in it. I love it!</li>
            <li> One of the light sockets doesn&#x27;t work. Definitely the socket and not the light bulb. Pretty disappointed. Still useable minus one of the lights inside.</li>
            <li> Easy to put in lights and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This UV lamp is absolutely worth it! I am amazed at how low priced it is compared to other UV lamps. This is my first UV lamp and I think I made a great choice choosing this one. I highly recommend this UV light to everyone that loves doing gel nails! </li>
            <li> I love this lamp! my whole hand can fit in there at once and I love the timed light!</li>
            <li> Cures my polish in half the time my other nail dryer used to! Works great for me!</li>
            <li> Love this light and being able to do my own gel nails!</li>
            <li> Nails still tacky after 5 minutes</li>
            <li> This works exactly as described.  I love it!  It&#x27;s nice to be able to do my nails at home on my time.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product but it was defective! Extremely dissapointing. The lights did not work at all. Not ok. I do not recomend this item!</li>
            <li> There is nothing like getting all cute and doing your nails, but the worst thing other than a chipped nail is when you get a rather annoying smudge right after a perfect application. For those of you who like to do your nails at home like myself, investing in a reliable UV curing lamp is a must.&lt;br /&gt;This model ships out fast and is easy to assemble. The lights come packaged separately and are simple to install by just popping them in. The body of the curing lamp is a sleek black which is great for permanent use at home, or even for discrete travel when you want to look your best on the road. Its compact size does not affect the salon quality cure that you get on your gel or shellac nails, or even on simple nail polish regardless of brand. The timer is a great way to ensure that you have your hand in the lamp for the right amount of time for a diamond cure, while the easy to clean slide out tray makes it really consumer friendly.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, like most others I read ALL of the reviews before I made a purchase decision, and while I was initially skeptical, the price was hard to pass up. Once my unit arrived, and I tried it out, I was really happy with the results, the product went beyond my expectations and gave me that salon style mirror cure that we all love. I would note that while some people may be able to fit 2 hands at once, I was only able to cure one hand at a time, though I must admit that I have large hands, and the machine itself is a travel size. This shouldn’t be a problem since the lamp cures in only a few minutes, just like those you find at the salon. I am really happy that I got it!</li>
            <li> I purchasedan this for my wife so she could do her nails at home. She loves it. She said it is exactly like the one at the salon she went to. She had a smaller one that would not even do all her fingers at one time (the thumb had to be done seperatly). This one nto only does all her fingernails at one time, but she can also use it to do her toenails. The transaction was smooth and was received when expected. Great job MelodySusie. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Works great.  My daughter and I love to do our nails but usually end up smudging them waiting for them to air dry when you put on a few coats.  This dries them in record time!  Fun for mother/daughter manicures at home!!!</li>
            <li> This lamp is a little flimsy and it isn&#x27;t 36 watts as described. It is only 9 watts. It worked, but I didn&#x27;t get what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK WITH CND BRAND SHELLAC!!!  Purchased this item specifically to use with the CND Shellac base coat and top coat I purchased elsewhere.  All the lights were on and I turned the timer on for 2 minutes and then for 3 minutes and every time the base coat remained gummy.  I tried again with a very very thin coat of base coat and the timer on for 3 minutes at a later date and it remained gummy.  I contacted customer service on 12/6 and they said it &amp;#34;should work&amp;#34; with what I had and were going to contact &amp;#34;Research and Development&amp;#34; which I now strongly feel was a tactic to delay my return of this product until after the deadline.  I have never heard from them again and tried again on my own to see if it would work because I so badly wanted to do my own Shellac manicure at home but it just would never work.  I would not recommend this product or any purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> terrible item, can&#x27;t get lights in/ fit badly constructed</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work one bit.  had to return it :(</li>
            <li> Excellent lamp! I recommend this product highly. Works great for gel polish, and heavy UV builder gels.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Only gave 4 stars because it is large and bulky. Other than that it is perfect. I had a RedCarpet Manicure portable light before this one and this is 100x better.</li>
