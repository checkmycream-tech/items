            <li>Great product, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>It is citrusy and refreshing without being too overbearing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it and its ok.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this mask.</li>
            <li>what you get the morning after you use this mask is the most glowy, lovely skin.</li>
            <li>It is a magical mask that is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>so I use that more :)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice to clean.</li>
            <li>I have had the last laugh, because my skin is flawless.</li>
            <li>it dries it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth than ever</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, which becomes smooth and non-oily after use.</li>
            <li>bought this product because I was looking for a mask with natural ingredients, but it&#x27;s far from being the best.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they did to this product, but I had an old one that I found and I loved it.</li>
            <li>so I get special prices and a coupon, but the Amazon price is competitive.</li>
            <li>I use this mask two nights a week unless I have a special occasion.</li>
            <li>I love this face mask so much.</li>
            <li>The reviews are true, it does burn.</li>
            <li>Love this brand leaves my face feeling clean, smooth, soft and fresh!</li>
            <li>I will purchase this product again, or I might try her mint julep mask, which other users say is equally great.</li>
            <li>It definitely perks up the skin, leaving it sooo nice and smooth, radiant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to remind myself that doing in just once in a blue moon is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good mask well worth the money.</li>
            <li>good news is, the short five minutes of burning is worth it.</li>
            <li>At first I was like OMG I made a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>and when it&#x27;s off you are left with nice smooth, fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li>Ive&#x27;s Even &amp; Bright Pink Lemon and Mandarin Orange Scrub, and at night, I use the St.</li>
            <li>I Washed it of right away to finally discover a smooth and healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>I then check other reviews and many experienced the same.</li>
            <li>I have tried Queen Helene&#x27;s other masques -- they are also good.</li>
            <li>After that settles down, it feels SO good.</li>
            <li>I would have wiped it all off the first time I used it if my sister hadn&#x27;t warned me that happens every time you use it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li>The product really stings but worth the pain.</li>
            <li>I have pretty clear and acne free skin</li>
            <li>I like this product even better than non-fat yogurt, which has a similar effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Immediately after removing the mask the first time, I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel really soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I literally got on Amazon and began reading reviews to make sure I wasn&#x27;t the only one feeling that much</li>
            <li>First of all, the shipping was ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li>Luckily other reviewers experienced the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>My face definitely looked more blemish free the next morning.</li>
            <li>The minute I squeezed the bottle a large amount of oil shot out at me.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why my skin loves it so much , but it does.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>It goes on well, and does not flake as much when it dries as their mud</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the product really didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absolutely burned and stung around the sides of my face.</li>
            <li>It dries out fast</li>
            <li>but I never surpass 4 because I feel that would be too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>really should not have added so much water to this new</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recently started to be more pro-active and consistent in applying masks, like every 2 or 3 days, and after a few weeks my skin looks much, much better, tighter and younger.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I must say, it is not hard to get off of your face as much as it is to get off of your fingers when you are wiping it off.</li>
            <li>A decent face mask.</li>
            <li>For a little more than 4 dollars, it&#x27;s such a great product, it&#x27;s almost hard to believe.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and seller.</li>
            <li>You can also leave a little dab on overnight and the pimple will be much better by morning.</li>
            <li>Sure there maybe a little burn but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle, but I definitely like it and it was worth the $$</li>
            <li>Overall, this mask is worth it.</li>
            <li>It was a running joke with me and my last significant other who would laugh at me every Saturday morning when I would put off plans by telling whomever was trying to make them &amp;#34;I can meet you, but not for a while -- I have to do my masque.&amp;#34; Hardy-har-har.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a five star rating is because when you first put the mask on, it stings your face.</li>
            <li>It makes my face soft as ever!  </li>
            <li>At the first second I tried, I immediately felt my skin irritated.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>i dont look 20 years old anymore.</li>
            <li>Least favorite of all of the Queen Helene masques I have used.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re sensitive to scent this product might not be for you.</li>
            <li>it feels so natural.</li>
            <li>My blackheads on my nose had nearly disappeared and my skin had a matte finish and feel to it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like this as much as the classic Mint Julep- not sure why, but the clean feeling after left something to be desired.  </li>
            <li>Price was right but not worth it.</li>
            <li>I will give it another try when my face is not so wet and open right after a wash.</li>
            <li>As far as the product, don&#x27;t be discouraged by the fact that it burns a little at first.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin do not use it will burn and leave your face red</li>
            <li>and it actually calms my sensitive</li>
            <li>, it does tingle and sting a little at first but works like a charm.</li>
            <li>This stuff totally made me break out in a major way like I haven&#x27;t in years.</li>
            <li>i recomend leaving it on longer to prevent irritation, it can burn a little at first, because of the enzymes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped with break outs and black heads too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took longer to wash off than the other ones, and afterwards my skin felt normal.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive ( psoriasis prone) skin with hormonal acne.</li>

            <li> I have very dry, sensitive ( psoriasis prone) skin with hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it stings me a bit when I first apply it- because my skin was irritated by other factors, but after a little while the stinging subsides</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it has a strange consistency and if you squeeze too hard on the tube, it will go everywhere.</li>
            <li> , i think because i put it in a different place in my bathroom where i wasn&#x27;t looking at it , and i started breaking out and getting dry skin again on queue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I smear it on my dry face and leave it on for five to ten minutes.</li>
            <li> key ive found actually is to use it as an overnight treatment instead of just a few minutes,  When i left it on the recommended time</li>
            <li> The next morning when I woke up, my skin looked brighter overall and had less</li>
            <li> With facemask on, I had to go back to Amazon and check that other reviewers did indeed say it burned like a you know what.</li>
            <li> my skin was kinda dry.  </li>
            <li> ( I always felt dry after cleaning my face, but not anymore).  </li>
            <li> i usually would end up using different products for different areas of my face, and still have unsatisfactory results.</li>
            <li> if you exfoliate daily I would advise that you either do it (at least) 30 minutes prior or just do it afterward.</li>
            <li> Not overly drying but not really moisturizing either.</li>
            <li> Though I also have the plain mud mask which produces the same out come without the pain</li>
            <li> The product was extremely cost-effective, well packaged and arrived when promised.</li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago, forgot about it and pulled it out the other night.</li>
            <li> No worries, back to the green tube!</li>
            <li> Perhaps less oily as when I had put it on, but other than that it didn&#x27;t feel purified, tighter, or brightened.&lt;br /&gt;I felt pampered, but other than that nada</li>
            <li> and i actually usually have very little left on my face, as if it has drank it all</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love this face mask so much. I usually put it on at night and in the morning, when my face usually feels greasy, I feel as though i don&#x27;t even have to wash my face. It&#x27;s really helped with break outs and black heads too. I love it! The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a five star rating is because when you first put the mask on, it stings your face. I would have wiped it all off the first time I used it if my sister hadn&#x27;t warned me that happens every time you use it.</li>
            <li> Great product. , it does tingle and sting a little at first but works like a charm. I plan on making it part of my regular skin care routine.</li>
            <li> jeese- my face was literrally burned after applying this - is this what it supposed to be or just me not used to it? but i dont wanna use it anymore</li>
            <li> A decent face mask. Not overly drying but not really moisturizing either. It burns like the dickens, so if you exfoliate daily I would advise that you either do it (at least) 30 minutes prior or just do it afterward. It literally felt like I poured rubbing alcohol in an open wound on my face. I like that it&#x27;s not difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!  It makes my face soft as ever!  It smells so fantastic!  I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Awful. Face burned as soon as I put it on. Threw&lt;br /&gt;It out immediately.</li>
            <li> I have a burning sensation every time I apply it, so not best for those with sensitive skin. The result is very smooth skin, I love how my face feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who does face masques. Yes, I&#x27;ll admit it. It was a running joke with me and my last significant other who would laugh at me every Saturday morning when I would put off plans by telling whomever was trying to make them &amp;#34;I can meet you, but not for a while -- I have to do my masque.&amp;#34; Hardy-har-har.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I have had the last laugh, because my skin is flawless. When I tell people my age, they are uniformly shocked. I am always told I look 5-7 years younger than I am. Of course, it&#x27;s part of a well though-out and diligently executed skin care regimen. But this face masque is an integral part of that regimen. I have tried Queen Helene&#x27;s other masques -- they are also good. But this one is the best of the bunch, for me.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin do not use it will burn and leave your face red</li>
            <li> Queen Helene has been a favorite product of mine for a coupe of decades. It is very economical and produces great results. I have extremely sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin. The product was extremely cost-effective, well packaged and arrived when promised. I highly recommend the product and seller.</li>
            <li> This stuff totally made me break out in a major way like I haven&#x27;t in years. Price was right but not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive ( psoriasis prone) skin with hormonal acne. I get the very painful cysts under skin by my jawline around that time of the month, but otherwise my skin is generally very clear.. I am also a picker though,when any spot does start to form, which does not help the situation. I have tried just about everything to treat my skin. i usually would end up using different products for different areas of my face, and still have unsatisfactory results. I am also just starting to age a bit. i dont look 20 years old anymore. ( or maybe i do because im still carded ) but you get my drift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point it that this mask has addressed all these issues for me . I have no idea why my skin loves it so much , but it does.&lt;br /&gt;They key ive found actually is to use it as an overnight treatment instead of just a few minutes,  When i left it on the recommended time my skin was kinda dry.  if i sleep in it, my skin is glowy and healthy. and i actually usually have very little left on my face, as if it has drank it all up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have been commenting on my skin since i started using it, im writing this review now because i stopped using it for a week, i think because i put it in a different place in my bathroom where i wasn&#x27;t looking at it , and i started breaking out and getting dry skin again on queue.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m actually staying in the house with it all over my face today as i write this, to get it under control.&lt;br /&gt;again i recomend leaving it on longer to prevent irritation, it can burn a little at first, because of the enzymes.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Least favorite of all of the Queen Helene masques I have used. Among them including the mud masque and the mint julep masque. This one smells awesome. It is citrusy and refreshing without being too overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is nice. It goes on well, and does not flake as much when it dries as their mud mask.&lt;br /&gt;However, the product really didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It took longer to wash off than the other ones, and afterwards my skin felt normal. Perhaps less oily as when I had put it on, but other than that it didn&#x27;t feel purified, tighter, or brightened.&lt;br /&gt;I felt pampered, but other than that nada</li>
            <li> I put it on after I washed my face so It irritated it a little bit.  I will give it another try when my face is not so wet and open right after a wash.</li>
            <li> At first I was like OMG I made a huge mistake. After cleaning and exfoliating my skin I tried a thin layer of the product. It started to burned like it was some kind of acid within seconds. I Washed it of right away to finally discover a smooth and healthy looking skin. And it didn t even stay for a whole minute !!!!!!!!  I then check other reviews and many experienced the same. The product really stings but worth the pain.</li>
            <li> The minute I squeezed the bottle a large amount of oil shot out at me. This needs to be in a jar, so it can be mixed before using as the ingredients separate.  I&#x27;ve used Queen Helene products before and never had this problem. It has a fragrance to it which I don&#x27;t mind but if you&#x27;re sensitive to scent this product might not be for you. Other than that...I&#x27;ve used it and its ok.</li>
            <li> Nice mask but the burning is almost unbearble</li>
            <li> Good face mask. Love this brand leaves my face feeling clean, smooth, soft and fresh! It does tingle at the beginning but it goes away after a few minutes! i would definitely recommend and buy it again in the future!</li>
            <li> horrible, horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I was looking for a mask with natural ingredients, but it&#x27;s far from being the best. At the first second I tried, I immediately felt my skin irritated. I removed it and I threw everything to the trash. Super disappointed !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they did to this product, but I had an old one that I found and I loved it. I think they really diluted the product because the old one I had was really thick and not watery and liquidy when shaken..&lt;br /&gt;I am really disappointed in this product. It used to work miracles because it was not diluted and it was thicker.&lt;br /&gt;They really should not have added so much water to this new product.&lt;br /&gt;I wasted my money buying 2.</li>
            <li> First of all, the shipping was ridiculously fast. I ordered on a Saturday and got it on a Tuesday. As far as the product, don&#x27;t be discouraged by the fact that it burns a little at first. After that settles down, it feels SO good. It makes my face feel really soft and clean. I like that it feels so natural. You can also leave a little dab on overnight and the pimple will be much better by morning. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but I definitely like it and it was worth the $$</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago, forgot about it and pulled it out the other night. I am so glad I found this mask. Sure there maybe a little burn but what you get the morning after you use this mask is the most glowy, lovely skin. It is a magical mask that is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> With facemask on, I had to go back to Amazon and check that other reviewers did indeed say it burned like a you know what. It absolutely burned and stung around the sides of my face. I have pretty clear and acne free skin and it&#x27;s definitely not oily so I was a little concerned. Luckily other reviewers experienced the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it dries it&#x27;s fine and when it&#x27;s off you are left with nice smooth, fresh looking skin. I use about once or twice a month. Though I also have the plain mud mask which produces the same out come without the pain so I use that more :)</li>
            <li> I used it today. My face feels smooth than ever ( I always felt dry after cleaning my face, but not anymore).  I love it</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I love the way it makes my face feel!</li>
            <li> I feel a burning sensation when i use it, especially as it&#x27;s drying. I have pretty sensitive skin. But after a rinse my face feels nice.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! It stings when u put it on but stops after a minute. The results are awesome afterwards. Love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this as much as the classic Mint Julep- not sure why, but the clean feeling after left something to be desired.  No worries, back to the green tube!</li>
            <li> This mask stings quite a bit but it is not unbearable. It dries out fast and I remove it 5 minutes after putting it on. My skin feels nice to clean. My face definitely looked more blemish free the next morning. Although I like it I am unlikely to repurchase this when I run out.</li>
            <li> For a little more than 4 dollars, it&#x27;s such a great product, it&#x27;s almost hard to believe. There&#x27;s a lot of it, so I apply generously every time I use it, not just a thin film. It definitely perks up the skin, leaving it sooo nice and smooth, radiant. Sometimes it stings me a bit when I first apply it- because my skin was irritated by other factors, but after a little while the stinging subsides and it actually calms my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently started to be more pro-active and consistent in applying masks, like every 2 or 3 days, and after a few weeks my skin looks much, much better, tighter and younger. I&#x27;ll have to remind myself that doing in just once in a blue moon is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good mask well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This masque is queenly! I have oily skin, which becomes smooth and non-oily after use. I like this product even better than non-fat yogurt, which has a similar effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I smear it on my dry face and leave it on for five to ten minutes. One caution: it does sting a bit, but I interpret the sting as a good sign. I will purchase this product again, or I might try her mint julep mask, which other users say is equally great.</li>
            <li> The reviews are true, it does burn. When you first put it on it has a strange consistency and if you squeeze too hard on the tube, it will go everywhere. Trust me. After about 20 seconds, it began to sting. It was probably the worst burning I have ever felt on my face. And that&#x27;s including a peeling sunburn after being outside in the sun for 14 hours. I literally got on Amazon and began reading reviews to make sure I wasn&#x27;t the only one feeling that much pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, the short five minutes of burning is worth it. As it approaches the end of its time, it begins to harden and the stinging lessens. I must say, it is not hard to get off of your face as much as it is to get off of your fingers when you are wiping it off. I have found that simply putting it on five minutes before you plan to shower and washing it off there makes it a lot easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after removing the mask the first time, I could tell a difference. My blackheads on my nose had nearly disappeared and my skin had a matte finish and feel to it. This may not be for everyone, but personally, I like the matte finish look. The next morning when I woke up, my skin looked brighter overall and had less imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at Sally&#x27;s because I am a beauty club member so I get special prices and a coupon, but the Amazon price is competitive. Overall, this mask is worth it. After all, beauty is pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a reference, my daily beauty routine is that in the morning I use the St. Ive&#x27;s Even &amp; Bright Pink Lemon and Mandarin Orange Scrub, and at night, I use the St. Ive&#x27;s Blemish Control Apricot Scrub. I use this mask two nights a week unless I have a special occasion. For those times, I usually increase my usage to 3-4 times a week but I never surpass 4 because I feel that would be too much for my skin.</li>
