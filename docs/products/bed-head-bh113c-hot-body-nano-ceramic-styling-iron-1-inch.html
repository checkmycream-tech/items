            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>this is by far the best curing iron i have every purchased.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this curling iron so far.  </li>
            <li>The curling iron heats up quickly and the &#x27;on&#x27; light is very bright.  </li>
            <li>The hair falls out way too easily!  </li>
            <li>Great deal for such a great item.</li>
            <li>The iron does not pull your hair and it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>This was better than the model she wanted</li>
            <li>and I love Bead Head styling irons.  </li>
            <li>and they love it as well</li>
            <li>This curling iron is okay.</li>
            <li>After using nicer ceramic curling irons, this one feels like it is damaging my hair more.</li>
            <li>Great for real hair and HD wigs.</li>
            <li>I love the color of it.</li>
            <li>so I bought 2-3 more over time.</li>
            <li>Love this tool...</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>This is my second Bed Head Nano Ceramic curling iron and i love it !!!</li>
            <li>I also like the thickness of the cord because it doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle as easily as others.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, very fast, and has a good feel.  </li>
            <li>This iron heats quick, has a high temperature setting that gives you perfect curls quick and easy, is a fun color and design.  </li>
            <li>the curls are perfect, wavy and pretty, and stays all day and into the next day.</li>
            <li>So far it is working really good.</li>
            <li>And one more thing: The paint started chipping off the barrel the first day.</li>
            <li>Fresh out of package, didn&#x27;t heat up at all and the top iron part fell right off.</li>
            <li>this curler is the best i like how it heats up and cools down fast.</li>
            <li>This iron doesn&#x27;t get near as hot as my old iron and it doesn&#x27;t get a very good grab on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot allowing the hair to curl quickly.</li>
            <li>I have had many curling irons, have thick and mid-back length hair, and this iron by far is the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>This curler is easy to use and heats up so fast.</li>
            <li>I just got this Styling Iron and have been having fun playing with it</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t even get my moneys worth out of it.</li>
            <li>i love bed head brand and bought this to replace my old one because my dog chewed the cord.</li>
            <li>However, I have shoulder-length, hard to curl hair (very fine and soft), and this curling iron worked great.  </li>
            <li>That shouldn&#x27;t be happening right out of the package.</li>
            <li>I feel like it doesn&#x27;t curl as effectively or hold it as long.</li>
            <li>I have it on medium heat and it curls my hair very fast.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and helps you create nice tight curls.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a higher quality iron, and the lack of automatic shut off can make it a fire hazard.</li>
            <li>The first one broke (I travel quite a bit, so in and out of the suitcase for 3 years beat it up).  </li>
            <li>(Plus its pretty when it lights up)</li>
            <li>I should have bought more back then.</li>
            <li>The pink color looks nice.</li>
            <li>One warning though - be careful because you can get burned very easily with this iron.</li>
            <li>Lights up with green at the stand, very cute curling iron.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for about 2 months, then day before yesterday it shorted or something &amp; literally fried my hair, turning it black &amp; it fell off instantly in a 1/8 inch or so line on one spot on the barrel.  </li>
            <li>and It wasn&#x27;t even above the Fine hair setting threw it away</li>
            <li>Her hair felt like hay and was very frizzy.</li>
            <li>Over all if you are looking for a quality curling iron for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and does its job very well.</li>
            <li>It curls my hair well and is a very well made curler.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that falls flat almost immediately after curling...until now.</li>
            <li>(My 4 year old brother threw my first one and it broke)</li>
            <li>This barrel iron is not only cute, but it works wonders on your hair, curls are lasting and does overheat.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron, it&#x27;s my second one of the same brand.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend the Bed Head curling irons.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another right now, which I believe is my 5th one (Over several years)!</li>
            <li>The hair felt dry &amp; even damaged right after using it.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I see no more damage than any other heat tools, you just need to use good protectants.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to receive It with in two or three days.  </li>
            <li>3 1/2 months old.</li>
            <li>I like the green light and settings.</li>
            <li>They last a very long time and quick heat.</li>
            <li>This curling iron heats up incredibly fast and has quite a few heat settings so you can have it just about as hot as you want it.  </li>
            <li>I have super straight, thin hair which never held a curl very well.</li>
            <li>Rarely do I find tools for my hair that last this long with the beating I give them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it gives me the curl and volume with out the major price tag!i would recommend for a budget!</li>
            <li>I first bought this iron from a salon, since then they quit carrying them, then Target got them I bought another one because my other one had just gotten old &amp; caked with build up.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much everyday.</li>
            <li>have very thick, curly hair that normally takes over an hour to curl but with this iron I&#x27;m able to curl and style all of my hair in about half an hour.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair that does not want to hold a curl.</li>

            <li> I had been wanting to curl my long bob, but was afriad the hair in the back was to short to curl with my flat iron, so I bought this and the curls lasted 2 days!</li>
            <li> Some cool green lights turn on when the iron is on, which makes it hard to leave it in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position accidentally.  </li>
            <li> The curl stays on for a long time even without hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, straight hair and this curling</li>
            <li> Hoping it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I lost my last one on vacation and tried other brands</li>
            <li> The curls last all day and night with a little bit of product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i recommend the other one</li>
            <li> The curls last, which I&#x27;ve had problems with in the past.</li>
            <li> I have expensive ones, but I like this, heats up fast and uses color to determine heat level.</li>
            <li> Also I have dark longer hair that I use bleach on to weave blond into it</li>
            <li> Not worth your money!</li>
            <li> My hair stays curly all day long which I&#x27;ve never experienced with irons I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Too late to return it</li>
            <li> I really like the base of the curling iron because there isn&#x27;t a metal piece that you have to keep moving up and down to hold the curling iron up on the counter; it instead rests on the plastic base.</li>
            <li> so your arm won&#x27;t get tired.</li>
            <li> Too bad the price increased.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this curling iron from another merchant and was immediately very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst curling iron ever, the coating melts off after not even 1 month of use, ended up melting my hair</li>

            <li> The curling iron heats up quickly and the &#x27;on&#x27; light is very bright.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I use it pretty much everyday. I have super straight, thin hair which never held a curl very well. This curler is easy to use and heats up so fast. The curls last all day and night with a little bit of product. It only takes me about 10 minutes to curl all my hair. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have used about every curling iron on the market and this is line is great! It curls and holds the curl great.I highly reccomend the Bed Head curling irons.</li>
            <li> This iron doesn&#x27;t get near as hot as my old iron and it doesn&#x27;t get a very good grab on my hair.  The hair falls out way too easily!  I think I fell in love with the color and let that blind me when ordering.</li>
            <li> my fav is the bed head 1/2 inch but this one is certainly amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend the other one but this one is still amazing. its just not my style</li>
            <li> I was given this curling iron by a friend about 3 years ago and just had to buy another one. Rarely do I find tools for my hair that last this long with the beating I give them!&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, curly hair that normally takes over an hour to curl but with this iron I&#x27;m able to curl and style all of my hair in about half an hour. The curls are the perfect size and hold up really well throughout the day. My hair looks shiny and polished when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I do lots of updo&#x27;s and I love Bead Head styling irons.  They last a very long time and quick heat.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for about 2 months, then day before yesterday it shorted or something &amp; literally fried my hair, turning it black &amp; it fell off instantly in a 1/8 inch or so line on one spot on the barrel.  Thought maybe it was a power surge or something so tried it today &amp; the same spot overheated &amp; has turned brown on the barrel.  Too late to return it so I&#x27;m stuck without $ &amp; with a section of hair gone.  Don&#x27;t buy!!!</li>
            <li> *Smiles* This barrel iron is not only cute, but it works wonders on your hair, curls are lasting and does overheat.</li>
            <li> beed head sells great products  this is by far the best curing iron i have every purchased. i have it in multiple sizes and both of the daughter have this and they love it as well</li>
            <li> Best iron in this price range. It heats up quickly and helps you create nice tight curls. The curls last, which I&#x27;ve had problems with in the past. The iron does not pull your hair and it&#x27;s very light so your arm won&#x27;t get tired.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this curling iron from another merchant and was immediately very disappointed. The hair, rather than curling, just flipped or kinked. The hair felt dry &amp; even damaged right after using it.  This happened even though she used heat protection spray beforehand. Her hair felt like hay and was very frizzy. And one more thing: The paint started chipping off the barrel the first day. Not worth your money!</li>
            <li> At $18 dollars this iron is a steal!! I had been wanting to curl my long bob, but was afriad the hair in the back was to short to curl with my flat iron, so I bought this and the curls lasted 2 days!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this curling iron so far.  I received it very recently, so I can&#x27;t attest to its durability.  However, I have shoulder-length, hard to curl hair (very fine and soft), and this curling iron worked great.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is okay. After using nicer ceramic curling irons, this one feels like it is damaging my hair more. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a higher quality iron, and the lack of automatic shut off can make it a fire hazard. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t curl as effectively or hold it as long.</li>
            <li> Who says cheap isn&#x27;t good?! I have expensive ones, but I like this, heats up fast and uses color to determine heat level. Great for real hair and HD wigs.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, straight hair and this curling iron works wonders on it! I really like the base of the curling iron because there isn&#x27;t a metal piece that you have to keep moving up and down to hold the curling iron up on the counter; it instead rests on the plastic base.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, it&#x27;s my second one of the same brand.  The first one broke (I travel quite a bit, so in and out of the suitcase for 3 years beat it up).  It gets very hot, very fast, and has a good feel.  One warning though - be careful because you can get burned very easily with this iron.</li>
            <li> I have used this product prior to buying it through Amazon so I already knew I loved it. (My 4 year old brother threw my first one and it broke) It gets very hot allowing the hair to curl quickly. It shipped in no time.. I was so surprised to receive It with in two or three days.  Over all if you are looking for a quality curling iron for a reasonable price this is it. (Plus its pretty when it lights up)</li>
            <li> I just got this Styling Iron and have been having fun playing with it so I can figure out just what heat setting I need. I love the color of it. So far it is working really good.</li>
            <li> Great deal for such a great item. Lights up with green at the stand, very cute curling iron. Curls great, the heat level is nice. Im happy with this buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Worst curling iron ever, the coating melts off after not even 1 month of use, ended up melting my hair and It wasn&#x27;t even above the Fine hair setting threw it away didn&#x27;t even get my moneys worth out of it.</li>
            <li> I first bought this iron from a salon, since then they quit carrying them, then Target got them I bought another one because my other one had just gotten old &amp; caked with build up. Target quit carrying them in store but they do online so I bought 2-3 more over time. I now found them here on amazon for even cheaper! I&#x27;m buying another right now, which I believe is my 5th one (Over several years)! That&#x27;s all I have to say. Money is not an issue with me for a good product &amp; I have tried many this is my favorite! Also I have dark longer hair that I use bleach on to weave blond into it &amp; I see no more damage than any other heat tools, you just need to use good protectants.</li>
            <li> This is my second Bed Head Nano Ceramic curling iron and i love it !!! I lost my last one on vacation and tried other brands but they just did not compare! I hope they never stop making this product. My hair never holds a curl. Unless its with this curling iron</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron in the beginning of October. Loved it. Went to use it yesterday and it died. Doesn&#x27;t turn on. 3 1/2 months old. Junk.</li>
            <li> I have had many curling irons, have thick and mid-back length hair, and this iron by far is the best I have used.  I have had people tell me that the curls I left with, are still the same as when I come back 5 hours later.  I don&#x27;t even need to use curling styling sprays.  Very easy to use.  I have it on medium heat and it curls my hair very fast.  Clamp is also good quality and does a good job of holding my hair in place.  I would highly recommend. Sometimes it will even hold the curl to the next day. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Fresh out of package, didn&#x27;t heat up at all and the top iron part fell right off. That shouldn&#x27;t be happening right out of the package.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT! It heats up really fast and does its job very well. Takes me around 15 min to do my entire head and I have a lot of hair. The curl stays on for a long time even without hairspray. I bought a total of 4 of them for my relatives and myself. Too bad the price increased. When I bought this thing-it was only $11. I should have bought more back then.</li>
            <li> This iron heats quick, has a high temperature setting that gives you perfect curls quick and easy, is a fun color and design.  I also like the thickness of the cord because it doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle as easily as others.</li>
            <li> its cheap but a great product. i love bed head brand and bought this to replace my old one because my dog chewed the cord.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that falls flat almost immediately after curling...until now. this tool actually works on my hair. the curls are perfect, wavy and pretty, and stays all day and into the next day. Love this tool...finally! I curl my hair by wrapping around the curler with the clamp kept up, and hold for 10 seconds. works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron. I like the green light and settings. It curls my hair well and is a very well made curler. My mom and sis actually want one now too.</li>
            <li> This styling iron heats quickly, is easy to use, and does a good job of curling hair.  The pink color looks nice.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product, but my daughter seems happy with it.  Her hair looks nice when she is finished and she hasn&#x27;t burned any off.  What more can you ask for?</li>
