    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful blush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned, so it&#x27;s not my skin tone - and could almost be used as a bronzer for me.</li>
            <li>This is a great color.  </li>
            <li>Also great with a tan.</li>
            <li>all are great for airbrushing.</li>
            <li>Great color</li>
            <li>and I feel like it&#x27;s a great deal for the price you pay and quantity you receive.</li>
            <li>This color is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Liked it alot!</li>
            <li>I think it was fairly priced as well.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>good for any complexion I think.</li>
            <li>Awesome loved it and was just he right  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Great color and doesn&#x27;t take much to get a great glow on your cheeks.</li>
            <li>It does work well for warm skin tones, though.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect color and the product doesn&#x27;t seem to clog as much as one I had tried from another company.</li>
            <li>Charming Lily Blush is a pretty color but wasn&#x27;t good for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Definitely, my favorite.</li>
            <li>It stays on most of the day and hasn&#x27;t caused any issues with my skin.</li>
            <li>But I do love Belloccio&#x27;s Products</li>
            <li>This blush (Charming Lily) goes on much darker -</li>
            <li>Its rubs off easy.</li>
            <li>Good quality highly recommended.</li>
            <li>it looks really light</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful deal and dont hesitate if you have an airbrush machine, this works great with my luminess airbush machine and you only need a few dops to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Charming Lily Blush is a nice spring/summer color that isn&#x27;t too pink.  </li>
            <li>The size is great, for I&#x27;ve found that if you do your makeup daily, the sample would be gone fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The image shows a swatch that seems much lighter and more pigmented than what I received.</li>
            <li>This is much lighter and gives more of a powdered effect than the shine I get from others.</li>
            <li>The formula is thicker, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>but I love color and how it goes on, it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I change my hair color a lot and keeping my blush in the right tones can be tricky.</li>
            <li>Perfect for me with blonde hair, green eyes</li>
            <li>The color is pretty</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for saving me all that $$$$!</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied</li>
            <li>This color is so pretty and works well with both the light golden brown I am currently sporting and the blonde I was wearing.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice color that will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>as far as airbrush makeup goes this stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li>This blush is a light pink.  </li>
            <li>This looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Add a shimmer to the mix and you have a very soft blush.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I have to mix in some pink blush from another company to make it look more like a pink</li>
            <li>but since this can be layered, it gets pretty dark if too much is apply.</li>
            <li>I really like the color and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>it stays on all day as long as you dont sweat to much.</li>
            <li>I usually use about 2-3 drops under my foundation and it looks really natural and pretty.</li>

            <li> When my 7 year old needs a little makeup for an event, I use this color on her and it gives her a natural pink flushed look even though our skin is very different.</li>
            <li> Not too pink or red.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t pink at all.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Came out a little darker than I thought it would</li>
            <li> I tried Belloccio because it was less expensive than the brand I have been using.  </li>

            <li> For starters the price wasn&#x27;t bad for the size,  the color did not show on my cheeks, I had to mix an darker color to make it show too bad I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Did not like it. Its rubs off easy.</li>
            <li> Awesome loved it and was just he right  color</li>
            <li> This is a great color.  Not too pink or red.  Perfect for me with blonde hair, green eyes and I mix my airbrush foundation to a smidge lighter than medium beige.  This looks very natural.</li>
            <li> This blush is a light pink.  It&#x27;s not an overbearing blush.  It gives just enough color so you don&#x27;t look too made up.  Definitely, my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice color that will last a very long time. A little goes a long way. I usually use about 2-3 drops under my foundation and it looks really natural and pretty.

            <li> Wonderful blush. My daughter said I was glowing today!</li>
            <li> I change my hair color a lot and keeping my blush in the right tones can be tricky.

            <li> I love this product! Great color and doesn&#x27;t take much to get a great glow on your cheeks. I use it every day and it has lasted me a couple of months! Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This color is very nice.  Add a shimmer to the mix and you have a very soft blush. Also great with a tan.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t pink at all. It was brown! Very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> I do like this blush, but it&#x27;s not what I was expecting. The image shows a swatch that seems much lighter and more pigmented than what I received. This blush (Charming Lily) goes on much darker - I&#x27;m very fair skinned, so it&#x27;s not my skin tone - and could almost be used as a bronzer for me. I have to mix in some pink blush from another company to make it look more like a pink blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t dislike it, it&#x27;s just not the color it appears to be. It does work well for warm skin tones, though.</li>
            <li> Good price. I bought luminess air brush system and the make up that came with it was horrid. It went on like emulsion paint. This is much lighter and gives more of a powdered effect than the shine I get from others. I like it!</li>
            <li> as far as airbrush makeup goes this stuff works pretty well it stays on all day as long as you dont sweat to much.</li>
