            <li>They shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li>i have to say i love these towels.</li>
            <li>what more could you want.</li>
            <li>I just wish I could fund them for a better price.</li>
            <li>I give these to friends to try out, and they, too, love them and have ordered them.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with these towels;they&#x27;re</li>
            <li>I am truly satisfied.</li>
            <li>but the softees are better.</li>
            <li>They are very absorbent and the color works great with muddy feet.</li>
            <li>just make sure you wash them separately.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and works great.</li>
            <li>Never received and no follow up to tell me they were not longer available.    </li>
            <li>NEVER STAINS OR SHRINKS AND ABSORBS SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a Softee mfgr thing or a diane by Fromm special order or what.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li>nice and soft, good quality for the price, wash well and hold up to the daily use in the salon.</li>
            <li>I really like them and would buy more.</li>
            <li>They are also fine in the hot towel warmer.</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>IT DRIES FAST !!</li>
            <li>I am a stylist doing house calls and am happy to work with these new towels presented by Fromm International.  </li>
            <li>They are also available in a whole host of colors.  </li>
            <li>they stay soft, absorb more and are resistant to bleach.</li>
            <li>Smaller, more efficient.</li>
            <li>i always reach for the softee towel first.</li>
            <li>Wash hot</li>
            <li>first impressions; I like the size; 15&amp;#34; x 28&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I washed them twice at home first then took them to the salon after 3 weeks of washing we still can&#x27;t trust them.</li>
            <li>I actually bought the off brand comfy as well they hold up fine too</li>
            <li>They work very well, and are very well made.</li>
            <li>These are really absorbent....</li>
            <li>I noticed a strong chemical odor when I opened them and figured a good long wash cycle would take care of them--12 cycles later they STILL have the chemical odor (from the black dye, no doubt).  </li>
            <li>These are not good for bathroom but good for washing car and floors</li>
            <li>Turns out they&#x27;re even better than the towels that the other salon used!</li>
            <li>they are very absorbent and soft!</li>
            <li>Absorb very well and soft !&lt;</li>
            <li>Floor spills more quickly dried around shampoo bowl; safety issue.</li>
            <li>They seem very soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li>They are far better at drying dishes and glassware than ordinary cotton ones.  </li>
            <li>The only negative comment I have is that they come out of the dryer with a lot of static and all stick together making folding a little more time consuming.  </li>
            <li>These towels are soft to skin for wisking away hair particles from client&#x27;s face after haircut.</li>
            <li>Thanks International!</li>
            <li>They actually feel better after they get washed a few times.</li>
            <li>FEELS FUNNY AGAINST DRY SKIN</li>
            <li>Out-performance includes, three times the absorbancy, lighter weight, less drying time, thinner for draping under wet-service capes and more wicking for those wet services.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these towels when I opened my hair studio thinking that they were the same ones that my old salon used that I used to work at.</li>
            <li>The only negatives are their tendancy to melt when used to handle hot pots and pans from oven or stove and the micro fiber snags on rough surfaces like serrated knives.  </li>
            <li>They are clearly not black - they are navy blue.  </li>
            <li>use them to dry hair quickly (to absorb excess moisture) and it has cut down on hair blower time by 5 min.  </li>
            <li>It looks like Softees may have had a bunch of their navy blue towels bundled incorrectly and marked as &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; or maybe they don&#x27;t really offer black, I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disappointing, and not the seller&#x27;s fault - it is not obvious from the outside, but all should be checked and sent back to Softees and find out if they really do have black or not.  </li>

            <li> Softees micro fiber towels are incredibly absorbant.  They are far better at drying dishes and glassware than ordinary cotton ones.  They are also available in a whole host of colors.  The only negatives are their tendancy to melt when used to handle hot pots and pans from oven or stove and the micro fiber snags on rough surfaces like serrated knives.  Otherwise, they&#x27;re the best kitchen towels I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These towels are awesome! I&#x27;m a hairstylist and these towels are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I am a stylist doing house calls and am happy to work with these new towels presented by Fromm International.

            <li> i have to say i love these towels. they stay soft, absorb more and are resistant to bleach. what more could you want. i always reach for the softee towel first.</li>
            <li> I love these towels! They work very well, and are very well made. I just wish I could fund them for a better price.</li>
            <li> nice and soft, good quality for the price, wash well and hold up to the daily use in the salon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered these towels. I was very pleased when I opened them. They are very soft and works great.</li>
            <li> This is the only way to go for drying dishes (or anything for that matter).  Wash them twice, no fabric softener and you will have the best dish towels on the planet.  In addition, they will probably last until you give up washing dishes!  Excellent quality, great size and they actually have square corners - I hate crooked stuff.</li>
            <li> These are really absorbent....use them to dry hair quickly (to absorb excess moisture) and it has cut down on hair blower time by 5 min.  I can blow it dry in 3 minutes now instead of 8 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also use these in the kitchen as a drying towel....best microfiber towel I have ever bought.  Threw all the others away.  I give these to friends to try out, and they, too, love them and have ordered them.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SALON OR HOME USE !! NEVER STAINS OR SHRINKS AND ABSORBS SO MUCH!!! THEY R PRICEY BUT WORTH IT!!!! COLOR DOESNT FADE NOR DOES IT STAY WET IT DRIES FAST !! SO GREAT!!! FEELS FUNNY AGAINST DRY SKIN BUT ILL SUFFER !!!</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with these towels;they&#x27;re super absorbant!They don&#x27;t leave any lint in my locks.They also came in a timely fashion.I am truly satisfied.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for my make up messes. They don&#x27;t stain or shrink. I actually bought the off brand comfy as well they hold up fine too but the softees are better. Wash hot don&#x27;t use a fabric softener.</li>
            <li> This is about the *product* not the seller.  I ordered black, the package is marked at black.  They are clearly not black - they are navy blue.  It looks like Softees may have had a bunch of their navy blue towels bundled incorrectly and marked as &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; or maybe they don&#x27;t really offer black, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disappointing, and not the seller&#x27;s fault - it is not obvious from the outside, but all should be checked and sent back to Softees and find out if they really do have black or not.  If not, they should not claim they sell it.</li>
            <li> Never received and no follow up to tell me they were not longer available.    Not a good company</li>
            <li> These are great value...I washed them a few times based on the reviews...and two washes did the trip. They actually feel better after they get washed a few times. I will be keeping these handy for all sorts of things...including camping, sea kayaking, road trips. Great Value, and the product came on time and shipped in mint condition. Thanks International!</li>
            <li> Tried to cancel this order, but did not want to pay to send it back myself, totall unfair, didn&#x27;t send it back , a twenty-nine dollar product and have to pay 16.00 out of pocket to return it.</li>
            <li> I had the towels embroidered and they are what I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought the Black version.&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions; I like the size; 15&amp;#34; x 28&amp;#34;. They seem very soft and absorbent. I use them with my vehicles; wiping down interiors,spills, windshields (inside and out), etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a four away to family for the same purpose; or whatever they decided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed one with a load of regular laundry without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again, but my remaining six should last a while.</li>
            <li> Not happy. I have been using fromm softees black micro fiber towels for 3 years in my salon . No problems at all. I bought what I thought was the same thing. These say Diane in the label as well as softees by Fromm, they have ruined 2 of our clients shirts by getting black dye all over them. I washed them twice at home first then took them to the salon after 3 weeks of washing we still can&#x27;t trust them. They are not colorsafe as stated. Very unhappy and still waiting to hear back from the company who makes them. Beware I don&#x27;t want anyone else to have this problem.</li>
            <li> I use the towels to wipe the dogs feet.  They are very absorbent and the color works great with muddy feet.</li>
            <li> A Softee I&#x27;ve had for some time (don&#x27;t know where I got it) is wonderful. Microfiber but not the &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; kind.&lt;br /&gt;These &amp;#34;diane by Fromm,&amp;#34; made by Softee are not quite the same. They are fuzzy, not as bad as other microfiber towels, still...&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a Softee mfgr thing or a diane by Fromm special order or what.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> These towels are being used in my salon...they are very absorbent and soft! The only negative comment I have is that they come out of the dryer with a lot of static and all stick together making folding a little more time consuming.  They shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and I use these for facial towels. I really like them and would buy more. They are also fine in the hot towel warmer.</li>
            <li> CANNOT RATE IT ..... NOT IN MY POSSESION. + + + + + + + + + + + +</li>
            <li> I ordered these towels when I opened my hair studio thinking that they were the same ones that my old salon used that I used to work at. Turns out they&#x27;re even better than the towels that the other salon used! They&#x27;re bigger so you can actually wrap the clients hair in them to keep their shirts dry and they are twice as absorbent! I am very pleased! :)</li>
            <li> These are great!!! First time I washed them with my other spa linens, they dyed the other sheets so just make sure you wash them separately.</li>
            <li> Absorb very well and soft !&lt;br /&gt;But if u have dry hands the towels grab and stick to your hands !!</li>
            <li> These towels were a great deal for the price as I had purchased them as workout towels. I noticed a strong chemical odor when I opened them and figured a good long wash cycle would take care of them--12 cycles later they STILL have the chemical odor (from the black dye, no doubt).  May be best for cleaning your car, house etc, but not recommended for using as a workout sweat towel.</li>
