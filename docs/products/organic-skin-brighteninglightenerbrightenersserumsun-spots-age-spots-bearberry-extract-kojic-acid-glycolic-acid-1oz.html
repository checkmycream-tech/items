            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It feels nice on my skin, I don&#x27;t see it doing any harm...</li>
            <li>I gave it a chance because I liked what I read about it and summer</li>
            <li>I just got my bottle about a week ago and can already see a huge difference in my skin and how bright it looks.</li>
            <li>but I honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference &amp; my skin tone hasn&#x27;t gotten better.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell</li>
            <li>I think it is mostly aloe vera juice</li>
            <li>lovely.</li>
            <li>Dr. Oz Naturals was a waaaaaay better product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After hearing about the toxic side-effects of hydroquinone (banned in most countries) she gave this serum a try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see no difference on my skin tone nor any of my freckles fading after using more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have tried several products and this seems to work the best.  </li>
            <li>and you will love it too</li>
            <li>This is a one of a kind of skin lotion that works quickly that does not come with a pricey wallet cleaner.</li>
            <li>The scent is delightful and does not linger and feels so sheer and light.</li>
            <li>It light weight and absorbs easily into your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to mention that it is important to heed the instructions and use a moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to review a product that you&#x27;ve been using for a week only.</li>
            <li>May be too soon still hoping for some improvement but no bad reaction.</li>
            <li>I tried this due to the fact it is organic but insta naturals vit c serum is WAY better!!</li>
            <li>All those positive comments sound like a marketing pitches...</li>
            <li>After using this product twice daily for a short time, my skin&#x27;s tone was more even and amazingly bright.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still waiting to see full results and there is no instructions on how much to use for results.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that is having any effect.  </li>
            <li>It contains salicylic acid which can be pretty drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>She has oily skin, so she tends to use the serum as her main moisturizer before applying make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t clear my blemish marks at all.. expected more since I saw it on.</li>
            <li>She also has hyperpigmentation from old acne scars- very embarrassing</li>
            <li>After too much time in the sun, I&#x27;ve developed spots along my forehead and after using this 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a diminished appearance of spots.</li>
            <li>It truly does lighten those sun spots and old acne scars</li>
            <li>This is quite a compliment coming from a 70 year old.  </li>
            <li>it can burn a sensitive skin in seconds...</li>
            <li>She is in her early 30&#x27;s and concerned about premature aging.</li>
            <li>So far over two months of use am/pm.</li>
            <li>Directly addresses my age spots.</li>
            <li>Both spots developed breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Please do a check on these reviews--they are all exactly the same length and repeat the same things.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the smell of it and a little product goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I hoped that it would reduce the appearance of my old acne scars and red marks.  </li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to notice any significant changes in my sun spots, I have, however, noticed a general clarity and luminescence to my skin in the few weeks.</li>
            <li>I have hereditary dark circles that are very stubborn.</li>

            <li> I really feel you get a lot for the small amount of money you pay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that upon religious use -- twice daily -- my dark circles have become roughly %50 lighter.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I even use it an the back of me hands and am seeing lighter and less flakey age spots</li>
            <li> a month later my scars were not any less visible than before I began using this on my face.</li>
            <li> Have only used for a few weeks so this may not be enough time to see any noticeable improvement in tone of skin or dark spots.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results it has definitely brightened my skin a little</li>
            <li> I randomly checked the reviewers profiles and ALL of those I checked had only ONE review...is this real?</li>
            <li> The consistency i like and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I had some pretty difficult areas of sun damage that needed both lightening and my skin needed toning.</li>
            <li> I have used it in combination with the other skincare products.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of the dark spot yet</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen any change on my dark spots yet.</li>
            <li> I had thought, when I purchased it, it would remove the dark spot I had</li>
            <li> Maybe the spot was too dark.</li>
            <li> it  takes around 4 weeks to see a difference in the apperance of the dark marks..</li>
            <li> The product does not lighten dark skin spot for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it is supposed to take but</li>
            <li> Did nothing waste of money don&#x27;t waste ur money didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> My sister and I both have acne scars and after not seeing her for a few months, I saw that hers had disappeared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past two months to lighten my undereye circles.</li>
            <li> I mean what can I say?</li>
            <li> is it doesn&#x27;t use hydroquinone which is known to thin the skin, making skin cancer an issue.</li>
            <li> I asked what her secret was</li>
            <li> I saw a review on this and decided to try it since my dark spots around my cheeks have been getting bad.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write bad reviews</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> Her scars have seriously started to fade!!!</li>
            <li> I will not be buying this product again. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of the dark spot yet but I love the smell and I&#x27;m still hopeful</li>
            <li> I am using this to lighten the appearance of sun spots on my face.  I have tried much more expensive products.  This is the first one that is having any effect.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Have only used for a few weeks so this may not be enough time to see any noticeable improvement in tone of skin or dark spots. What I do have as a result of using this organic skin oil is acne at 53! The product broke my skin out horribly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to know if it lightened my dark spots, but it does leave my skin soft. And the customer service us AWESOME.    Update: 1/29/15  I&#x27;ve been using this product 2 times a day and it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> Please do a check on these reviews--they are all exactly the same length and repeat the same things. Looks like a scam, as someone else has already pointed out.</li>
            <li> Using twice a day before moisturizing. It light weight and absorbs easily into your skin. It has been three weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any change on my dark spots yet. May be too soon still hoping for some improvement but no bad reaction.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on my skin, I don&#x27;t see it doing any harm... however, it hasn&#x27;t made one bit of difference on my skin -skin looks the same. I won&#x27;t order it again. I think it is mostly aloe vera juice, that is what it feels like to me. Also, the bottle and dispensing method is awkward to use, and the bottle tips easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past two months to lighten my undereye circles. I have hereditary dark circles that are very stubborn. I&#x27;ve noticed that upon religious use -- twice daily -- my dark circles have become roughly %50 lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to mention that it is important to heed the instructions and use a moisturizer afterward. It contains salicylic acid which can be pretty drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I can&#x27;t live without it! It truly does lighten those sun spots and old acne scars Best thing about this product is it doesn&#x27;t use hydroquinone which is known to thin the skin, making skin cancer an issue. After using this product twice daily for a short time, my skin&#x27;s tone was more even and amazingly bright. I use it daily to keep pigmentation from the sun to a minimum. It is the best product I have tried over the years. It also smells very pleasant !</li>
            <li> This is a one of a kind of skin lotion that works quickly that does not come with a pricey wallet cleaner. I gave it a chance because I liked what I read about it and summer is coming. I had some pretty difficult areas of sun damage that needed both lightening and my skin needed toning. This having a Vita. C origin it lightens and tones your skin. It also has a brightening agent that gives your skin a youthful glow. I really feel you get a lot for the small amount of money you pay.  I use it on my arms and chest, legs, face and upper back.  I guess you can say anywhere skin is exposed. I am completely happy with how my skin looks an feels.  This is quite a compliment coming from a 70 year old.  I would recommend this to any of my friends or family.</li>
            <li> Did nothing waste of money don&#x27;t waste ur money didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> Changed my eval to five stars.  lovely.</li>
            <li> Gave me skin allergies and had to visit the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz Naturals was a waaaaaay better product. I have not seen any noticeable difference in my skin with this product.</li>
            <li> it can burn a sensitive skin in seconds...dont use it</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to notice any significant changes in my sun spots, I have, however, noticed a general clarity and luminescence to my skin in the few weeks. I have used it in combination with the other skincare products. This makes me extremely hopeful as the Organica brightening serum has already delivered on what many other brightening skincare lines have failed to do.</li>
            <li> I discovered the Brightening Serum through a friend who recommended it, and let me tell you, it is LIFE CHANGING! I apply two pumps in the morning and before bed - how simple is that? I noticed a difference in my skin tone in literally a week! I am amazed!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle purchased and its because i believe that it is adding a brightness to my skin that was absent. The consistency i like and a little goes a long way. I am impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> Why wife loves this with the advice of some friends, she decided I needed to buy some grown-up skincare products for her. She is in her early 30&#x27;s and concerned about premature aging. She also has hyperpigmentation from old acne scars- very embarrassing and she always have to wear makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hearing about the toxic side-effects of hydroquinone (banned in most countries) she gave this serum a try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW! Her scars have seriously started to fade!!! Incredible! So far over two months of use am/pm. She has oily skin, so she tends to use the serum as her main moisturizer before applying make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to all my friends as a must-have skincare product! The scent is delightful and does not linger and feels so sheer and light.</li>
            <li> My sister and I both have acne scars and after not seeing her for a few months, I saw that hers had disappeared. I asked what her secret was and she told me all about this serum. I bought my own and now I&#x27;m hooked!  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever! I will never live without this stuff from now on. I just got my bottle about a week ago and can already see a huge difference in my skin and how bright it looks. Amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I had thought, when I purchased it, it would remove the dark spot I had but it didn&#x27;t. I used it faithfully until it was all gone. Maybe the spot was too dark.</li>
            <li> Directly addresses my age spots. After too much time in the sun, I&#x27;ve developed spots along my forehead and after using this 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a diminished appearance of spots. A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> Causes breakouts.  I tried it on two spots.  Both spots developed breakouts.  Nowhere else did.  Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t clear my blemish marks at all.. expected more since I saw it on. Steve harvey show.... maybe I needed a didn&#x27;t brand</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and great customer service. Will buy this again and recommend it to others. I even use it an the back of me hands and am seeing lighter and less flakey age spots</li>
            <li> I saw a review on this and decided to try it since my dark spots around my cheeks have been getting bad. This is an excellent product! it  takes around 4 weeks to see a difference in the apperance of the dark marks.. I also enjoy the smell of it and a little product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my completion. I am trying to fade some hyperpigmentation on my face and this just didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> This product has a great ideal, but it did not work. I applied it every morning and night, and there was no change in my skin&#x27;s tone. The people who shipped it were great, but the serum just isn&#x27;t effective at all.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results it has definitely brightened my skin a little but I&#x27;m still waiting to see full results and there is no instructions on how much to use for results. Also if it can be mixed for not...</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it, in fact I just ordered another bottle, and yes, I can tell a difference where my skin tone is darker on my arms is looking smoother.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write bad reviews but I honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference &amp; my skin tone hasn&#x27;t gotten better. I tried this due to the fact it is organic but insta naturals vit c serum is WAY better!! I will not be buying this product again. :(</li>
            <li> Weird. All those positive comments sound like a marketing pitches...I randomly checked the reviewers profiles and ALL of those I checked had only ONE review...is this real?</li>
            <li> The product does not lighten dark skin spot for me.</li>
            <li> Being an organic product I was very disappointed.I used the product twice a day. Did not see any change. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I see no difference on my skin tone nor any of my freckles fading after using more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products and this seems to work the best.  give it about 6wks and you will love it too</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to review a product that you&#x27;ve been using for a week only. I mean what can I say? It hasn&#x27;t done anything for me yet but I wasn&#x27;t expecting any results in a week. I will have to get back to you on this product after I finish using it.</li>
            <li> I brought this after reading the reviews.my skin kept breaking out after I use this.I tried it for about 3 weeks.I wish I could get a refund.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.  I hoped that it would reduce the appearance of my old acne scars and red marks.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it is supposed to take but a month later my scars were not any less visible than before I began using this on my face.</li>
