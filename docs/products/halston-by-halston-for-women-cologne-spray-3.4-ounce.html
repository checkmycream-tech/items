            <li>it also came in the original box</li>
            <li>This is it--the original, in the original packaging, delivered on time, no damage.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m in love with all sorts of perfume but this one has a fragrance where it can be a bit too much but</li>
            <li>one spray is just enough to give a good scent.</li>
            <li>to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected.</li>
            <li>Still cool looking though.</li>
            <li>price, quick shippingâ€¦.</li>
            <li>As always a classic :-)</li>

            <li>Love this classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks VERY much!  </li>
            <li>if the real thing as there is no Halston logo on the bottle and it was not sealed,  but the box appeared to be genuine.  </li>
            <li>, IT WASN&#x27;T AS FRESH SMELLING</li>
            <li>Only my friend will be able to tell as she is familiar with the scent</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time.  </li>
            <li>I got super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Great price for quantity!!&lt;br /&gt;Update, just reordered from same company, not the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Halston for years, and because of all the compliments I get, I plan to use it several more years.</li>
            <li>After doing some research, many have had this same problem with online perfume purchases -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what my Sister-in Law wanted for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was thoroughly pleased with this entire deal.</li>
            <li>lovely lasting fragrance</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to give this classic fragrance as a birthday gift for my sister!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this for a gift, and I ordered 2 times a month apart, both times they didn&#x27;t have the stock and couldn&#x27;t make the shipping on time.</li>
            <li>This non-alcohol-free product is the real Halston, the one my wife loves and has used for years.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two for my mother and she absolutely loves Halston.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to think too much for her gift.</li>
            <li>I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE SMELL</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Womanly, warm, floral, and deep - this is a scent suited for me.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume and will not wear any other, people ask me what scent I am wearing</li>
            <li>Things change so quickly these days and it can be hard to find authenticity in many products.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried this I wasn&#x27;t so wild about it.  </li>
            <li>ONE OF MY CLASSIC FAVORITES.</li>
            <li>This particular bottle is a gift for my elderly mother who has been a Halston fan for years.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend you try it.  </li>
            <li>After purchasing some weird version of this (apparently without alcohol!), I found this and was happy to find out it smelled exactly like it is supposed to smell.  </li>
            <li>Still very nice for casual events.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a new fragrance and remembered this one that a friend had give me years ago.  </li>
            <li>This is actually Halston Vaporisateur that smells completely different than original Halston Cologne for women.  </li>
            <li>This is clearly old old very old perfume.</li>
            <li>It was onviously old and did NOT smell like Halston.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other colognes and they didn&#x27;t match right with my skin.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it attracts the people who are around her and they always ask what she&#x27;s wearing!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not as strong and does not stay on as long as usual.</li>

            <li> I have been searching for a new fragrance and remembered this one that a friend had give me years ago.  </li>
            <li> This is actually Halston Vaporisateur that smells completely different than original Halston Cologne for women.  </li>
            <li> This is clearly old old very old perfume.</li>
            <li> It was onviously old and did NOT smell like Halston.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other colognes and they didn&#x27;t match right with my skin.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it attracts the people who are around her and they always ask what she&#x27;s wearing!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not as strong and does not stay on as long as usual.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to get old classic scent: I wanted it as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> know right away if it is a little off or not fresh.  </li>
            <li> Amazon.com is the ONLY place I can find this fragrance which is the only fragrance I can were due to allergies.  </li>
            <li> The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked into the carton only a little but enough to overwhelm me when I opened the package. ?</li>
            <li> It was probably due to the weather that delivery took so long.</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> note: After ordering a few times, I find that not all of the bottles have the same sent.</li>
            <li> She likes it and when it is almost gone, she lets me know for other to order</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely upset!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, I knew this fragrance, but this perfume smells not good, it seems very old,  would be possible to return the money with gift card</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product for my sister in law.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased.</li>
            <li> Not citrusy or overly spicy, this fragrance has subtle tones that are not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Yet, there is a subtle sensuality about it.</li>
            <li> not good at all.&lt;br /&gt;disatisfied</li>
            <li> But spray it crazily and it just ruins the fragrance!</li>
            <li> It smelled old and awful!</li>
            <li> The Halston I have been using has a slightly oil base and the perfume lasts hours.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I bought this.</li>
            <li> the item arrived in condiion that I was unable to give as a give.  </li>
            <li> Box all dirty with fingerprints...</li>
            <li> This is my fragrance of choice and I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I WAS UNHAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> This product has a lighter base and the scent is fleeting.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible, not how I remember Halston.  </li>
            <li> Worst purchase ever from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, I knew this fragrance, but this perfume smells not good, it seems very old,  would be possible to return the money with gift card</li>
            <li> Great fragrancce from days gone by, it lasts and lasts and smells wonderful. More spicy then flowery perhas, smells very clean. I hope this vendor continues to carry it!!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend who could not find this anywhere.  She loved it, so I love it!  Also- this smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, quick shippingâ€¦. Amazon rocks!</li>
            <li> Upon arrival I opened package and noticed that there was leakage into the box.  The smell is horrible, not how I remember Halston.  Glad that this was not purchased as a gift for someone.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne.  It is not too strong, not too sweet and not too musky.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect.  Arrived right on time.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought this. It smelled old and awful!</li>
            <li> I used to wear Halston for years in the &#x27;80&#x27;s. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it again; and at a great price! Brings back fond memories.</li>
            <li> Bottle was even bigger than I remembered ordering. Exactly what I wanted and at a great price.</li>
            <li> This has been my signature fragrance for 40+ years ~ I never tire of it.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift. The recipient was extremely happy. Would order again</li>
            <li> This product was an excellent deal.  The price was excellent.  I got super fast delivery.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.. Great price for quantity!!&lt;br /&gt;Update, just reordered from same company, not the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li> I love the smell I use to when I go to the gym.  It is very inexpensive but smells great, specially after all the sweat</li>
            <li> I have used this for 30 years and love it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this for a gift, and I ordered 2 times a month apart, both times they didn&#x27;t have the stock and couldn&#x27;t make the shipping on time. I end up buying another brand.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this I wasn&#x27;t so wild about it.  It caught me off guard because it is so very different from all the fruity, candy-ass scents on the market today.  I just tried Halston again tonight and I am loving it.  For some reason I can now appreciate this sensual and unique fragrance.  This scent makes me think of the beach in autumn at dusk and no worries, just smooth sailing ahead.  I do recommend finding a way to try before you buy.  I believe Halston may be an acquired taste.</li>
            <li> excelente producto 100% recomendado</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my cousin, she likes it and that is that.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was different than I remember it. All in all it&#x27;s alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just not as fragrant.</li>
            <li> This is a classic scent that I love and this is a great purse size. You needn&#x27;t worry about carrying around a jug of perfume. It was probably due to the weather that delivery took so long.</li>
            <li> Worst purchase ever from Amazon.  It was onviously old and did NOT smell like Halston.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY CLASSIC FAVORITES. GREAT VALUE SIZE AND PRICE,</li>
            <li> This is clearly old old very old perfume.Box all dirty with fingerprints...no plastic wrap and smells terrible...wish I could get a refund:(....don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> This non-alcohol-free product is the real Halston, the one my wife loves and has used for years.  The price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> recently rediscovered!  I have been searching for a new fragrance and remembered this one that a friend had give me years ago.  I am so glad it is still available.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell, muy mom loved it. Recomended.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> A favorite of my mom&#x27;s. When I smell it in the air it remains me of her.</li>
            <li> Halston is one of my favorite colognes. Totally pleased with my purchase and the cost.</li>
            <li> I love Halston.  I have used it since I was in highschool.  I&#x27;ve tried other colognes and they didn&#x27;t match right with my skin.</li>
            <li> This items is what I expect and love the smell</li>
            <li> This is a hard to get old classic scent: I wanted it as a gift for a friend. The bottle leaked into the carton only a little but enough to overwhelm me when I opened the package. ? if the real thing as there is no Halston logo on the bottle and it was not sealed,  but the box appeared to be genuine.  Only my friend will be able to tell as she is familiar with the scent and I am not.</li>
            <li> Love Halston. This particular bottle is a gift for my elderly mother who has been a Halston fan for years.</li>
            <li> As always a classic :-)</li>
            <li> It was just as I remember it, love the smell!</li>
            <li> I ordered two for my mother and she absolutely loves Halston. Apparently, it attracts the people who are around her and they always ask what she&#x27;s wearing! It has to be good and it is! Now, I&#x27;m in love with all sorts of perfume but this one has a fragrance where it can be a bit too much but one spray is just enough to give a good scent. But spray it crazily and it just ruins the fragrance! I was very happy with my purchase and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying Halston from here again very soon! :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this cologne for years but always thought about it. So grateful it was still available and the smell is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Great price, good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Halston for years, and because of all the compliments I get, I plan to use it several more years.</li>
            <li> smell is not like i remember; gave it away</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted!! she really liked the spray and has been wearing it every day, I like to smell her neck!</li>
            <li> perfect, from Venezuela</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t worn this fragrance in quite a while, but saw it and had to buy again.  I am so glad I did!  I had forgotten how much I love Halston!  Great fragrance that lasts!</li>
            <li> Lightening quick!  Wonderful packaging and perfect product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks VERY much!  Can&#x27;t wait to give this classic fragrance as a birthday gift for my sister!</li>
            <li> This is my fragrance of choice and I am disappointed.  The Halston I have been using has a slightly oil base and the perfume lasts hours.  This product has a lighter base and the scent is fleeting.  I hope this isn&#x27;t a reformulation because it isn&#x27;t an improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for many years, and it still is as great as always.  My husband has loved this Halston on me from the time when we met, and he says it&#x27;s just perfect, not too strong and always so very pleasant. It is unique and wonderful, and though I considered changing scents just for a change, I could not bring myself to do it. I do love this Halston, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day, she had been looking for it in stores for some time and couldn&#x27;t find it. She is very happy :)</li>
            <li> my favorite cologne ever</li>
            <li> I have used Halston Spray Cologne for years, and the bottle I received seemed to be diluted.  The fragrance is not as strong and does not stay on as long as usual.</li>
            <li> 100% confiables gracias al vendedor, en realidad no hay nada de que colocar algunas observacion gracias por el producto desde venezuela</li>
            <li> Perfect size and perfect smell.</li>
            <li> This has been a staple fragrance of mine for over 30 years. I question if this is even an authentic fragrance, or Halston has changed their formula. It smells like Halston, however, immediately after applying, you can&#x27;t even smell it!  Extremely disappointed!! After doing some research, many have had this same problem with online perfume purchases - that&#x27;s why I question its authenticity. Never again will I order fragrances online.</li>
            <li> After purchasing some weird version of this (apparently without alcohol!), I found this and was happy to find out it smelled exactly like it is supposed to smell.  It is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent on me, and I am glad to have found this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what my Sister-in Law wanted for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells pleasant and it is not too pricey.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product for my sister in law. I bought already 2. She likes it and when it is almost gone, she lets me know for other to order and it is always and event coming..like Xmas, b-day so I don&#x27;t have to think too much for her gift.</li>
            <li> the item arrived in condiion that I was unable to give as a give.  I am not pleased.</li>
            <li> Hi, I got my item in the mail since the 24th and it&#x27;s awesome,&lt;br /&gt;it came in a well packaged box and some free samples and coupons.&lt;br /&gt;it was the original fragrance I used about 10 years ago and I used it for a relax evening and my blouse still has the scent. it also came in the original box and I can say I am a satisfied customer and will continue buying.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne. Has been since the 70&#x27;s! Glad I could purchase it on line. It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the scent isn&#x27;t quite as strong as I have had in the past but sill a good buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have been wearing this perfume for over 35 years.</li>
            <li> I am a Halston girl and have been using this cologne for years....love it!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I get so many compliments on this scent.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Halson since 1988!  This is actually Halston Vaporisateur that smells completely different than original Halston Cologne for women.  The description from Amazon was Halston Cologne for women, but should have said Halston Vaporisateur Cologne for women.  The scent is completely different than the Halston Cologne.  Not only is this NOT the cologne I thought I was ordering, but Amazon does NOT accept returns on perfumes or colognes so DO NOT purchase these items from Amazon!  If they can&#x27;t give an accurate description of the product, then they should lose the business.  I&#x27;m extremely upset!</li>
            <li> this is the only cologne I ever use. I know different people have different preferences, but for me, this is the very best.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for years.  After trying others, I always go back to Halston.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Price was great.  I got my shipment in speedy time. It&#x27;s great to have a renewed supply! I was thoroughly pleased with this entire deal.</li>
            <li> My order came quickly and satisfied my expectations.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com is the ONLY place I can find this fragrance which is the only fragrance I can were due to allergies.  Hope I can continue to purchase this here for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal!!!!!</li>
            <li> lovely lasting fragrance</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I USE TO WEAR HALSTONS ALL THE TIME MANY YEARS AGO. WHEN I RECEIVED IT I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE SMELL, IT WASN&#x27;T AS FRESH SMELLING AS I REMEMBERED. I WENT TO THE STORE AND COMPARED IT, AND IT WAS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT. I WAS UNHAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for almost 40 years (how can that even be!). This is it--the original, in the original packaging, delivered on time, no damage.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, product came open and dripping, 1/2 way of it content. not good at all.&lt;br /&gt;disatisfied</li>
            <li> I love it very much.I am so glad that you carryit.</li>
            <li> Good! My mom lovesss this perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and will not wear any other, people ask me what scent I am wearing and I proudly say Halston, they say it such a beautiful fresh like air smell!</li>
            <li> Love this classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  I have &amp;#34;always&amp;#34; used Halston and always get compliments.  It is part of my identity...Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know right away if it is a little off or not fresh.  Things change so quickly these days and it can be hard to find authenticity in many products.  I ordered two of these and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I will order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have always used Halston for women. The price was chearper than anywhere else and the product was received in three days</li>
            <li> Halston by Halston spray cologne is my signature fragrance and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 30 years.  I am so happy I can obtain it easily on Amazon.com!  I spritz it on just to feel good.  It is a light fragrance, but long-lasting.  Not citrusy or overly spicy, this fragrance has subtle tones that are not overwhelming.  Yet, there is a subtle sensuality about it. It is not screamingly obvious.  As the day goes on, I like to to smell the lingering scent on my wrist. Womanly, warm, floral, and deep - this is a scent suited for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this cologne for my wife for 35 years, and it was always a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; until we tried the parfume.  Still very nice for casual events.</li>
            <li> The shape of the bottle has been updated. Still cool looking though. I bought it as a gift for my mom for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It is not for everyone (my step-mother gave it to me as a teen because it did not work with her chemistry), but it fits mine great and seems to syncwith my personality.  It is both sporty and elegant.  I would highly recommend you try it.  If it works for you, you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Please note: After ordering a few times, I find that not all of the bottles have the same sent. This,I find to be a frustration.)</li>
