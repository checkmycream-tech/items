            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to get some more once I finish all of mine.</li>
            <li>The colors I use the most are brown.  </li>
            <li>WE LOVE THESE</li>
            <li>by more</li>
            <li>Products are cheap &amp; break very easily</li>
            <li>i bought the right size beads after and made do with the hair, my hair still looked great, but my hair would have lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, good quality, thank you very much :)</li>
            <li>Well...if my daughter doesn&#x27;t get a hold of them first! :)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and nice beads.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look anymore and get these great quality, lasting beads.</li>
            <li>Even the blonde ones dont look that great in blond hair.  </li>
            <li>I got these in early and they work great easy to open and easy to close and have stayed in place</li>
            <li>They were easy to use and the variety of colors handy when doing hair on various people.</li>
            <li>Found these to be very useful for putting feathers in my hair, and definitely wanted some more to use!</li>
            <li>Package came quickly but I would rather they be separated into colors then all jumbled together.</li>
            <li>i received only 4 of the red/brown color and have to order more links to go with more clientele&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>shipping took almost 2 weeks but worth the wait</li>
            <li>These worked very well!</li>
            <li>You get what you want, exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like is that there were more black and light tan/beige beads.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and last until the hair gets clipped out of grows out.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always great to have a few extra on hand with the feathers.  </li>
            <li>Fast and well-kept service</li>
            <li>were much longer then</li>
            <li>so i trimmed the ends of the hair off to fit the beads, BIG MISTAKE</li>
            <li>these micro links work really well.  </li>
            <li>Not damaging my hair now and much easier for her to work with.</li>
            <li>i really like it</li>
            <li>very happy with this, it comes in a small round container that screws on</li>
            <li>We received our micro-links in just a few days in great condition and just what we expected them to be.  </li>
            <li>try using the smaller rings, you may find they blend better in your hair and seem to last longer.</li>
            <li>Too bad, The product shipped quickly and was good quality.</li>
            <li>they are not perfect and get lose, but for the price are great , make sure you put inside enough of hair other way they can slip down with 2 weeks</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>they sent colors that was not specified other than that I like them they are the silicone micro links really but who really needs red beads?</li>
            <li>They only fit small braids and that&#x27;s not what I wanted</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t counted, and i don&#x27;t plan too, but there looks like 100 beads... or at least pretty close to it.</li>
            <li> Out of the 100 beads, only 25 were silicone lined and of those 25 only 5 were blonde color, the other 20 were red.  </li>
            <li> but I expected them to look like the picture and be a lot bigger.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s four colors, red, black, dark&amp;light brown and blonde.</li>
            <li> but a little too big for what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get them until late September, but I got them far sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> bought them as replacement beads for hair feathers i already own,i imagine they can be used for other hair extension items.</li>
            <li> But the brown and black</li>
            <li> If you like hair feathers, you may want to have a few backup beads.</li>
            <li> too big for thin hair</li>
            <li> I have a few hair extensions and my hair stylist used metal beads to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> Did the trick, and hold small extensions in place.</li>
            <li> I was confused by this</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product, they&#x27;re well made and do what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> , i got the wrong size beads, which i didn&#x27;t know at the time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> But the timing is awful</li>

            <li> Package came quickly but I would rather they be separated into colors then all jumbled together. I had to take time to separate them individually</li>
            <li> Perfect I will order them again....  Price is amazing.</li>
            <li> You only gave me 75-85 when it said that there were 100</li>

            <li> Took over a month to receive this item. I ordered them way before my wedding and didn&#x27;t receive them until after the wedding.  So my purpose in using them was ppointless.  Very disappointing.  The product is fine. But the timing is awful</li>
            <li> These worked very well!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and nice beads.</li>
            <li> It took forever to get these in the mail! But when they finally came (yesterday) I had a great time with them! They are very easy to use and are defiantly great!</li>

            <li> These are exactly what I expected. I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get them until late September, but I got them far sooner than expected. If you like hair feathers, you may want to have a few backup beads.</li>
            <li> My mistake.  I thought these were braid beads where you could attach to french braids.  I didn&#x27;t read thru however my hairstylist was happy I gave them to her.  She loves them.</li>
            <li> You get what you want, exactly as shown. I was very pleased with the quality of these beads, and for the price it was a much better deal! I&#x27;ll be sure to get some more once I finish all of mine. Don&#x27;t look anymore and get these great quality, lasting beads.</li>
            <li> This was what it said was. Nothing to be upset about at all. It is always nice to have more beads when dealing with kids.</li>
            <li> Perfect, as described!</li>
            <li> I just them for everything!  The colors I use the most are brown.  Even the blonde ones dont look that great in blond hair.  But the brown and black I use all the time.  I would def recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> soooo many!! These beads work great and do not damage the hair because of its silicone lining inside eat one.&lt;br /&gt;and they are at a great price!!</li>
            <li> they are not perfect and get lose, but for the price are great , make sure you put inside enough of hair other way they can slip down with 2 weeks</li>
            <li> but a little too big for what I needed.  I still use them for people with thicker hair. too big for thin hair</li>
            <li> WE LOVE THESE THEY HOLD THE EXTENSIONS GREAT.  IT IS A GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE AND THEY WORK GREAT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE FOR ANYONE.</li>
            <li> i bought these and ordered the tools and hair at the same time, when i recieved the beads and the hair the hair ends were much longer then the beads. I was confused by this so i trimmed the ends of the hair off to fit the beads, BIG MISTAKE, i got the wrong size beads, which i didn&#x27;t know at the time. i bought the right size beads after and made do with the hair, my hair still looked great, but my hair would have lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> these micro links work really well.  I like the size, colors and the fact that they are lined with silicon to keep from injuring the hair.  What I don&#x27;t like is that there were more black and light tan/beige beads.  i received only 4 of the red/brown color and have to order more links to go with more clientele&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> The manufacturing of the beads themselves are great but I expected them to look like the picture and be a lot bigger. They only fit small braids and that&#x27;s not what I wanted but I will have to deal with what I got. Plus, the shipping speed wasn&#x27;t all that great. It took quite some time to get here.</li>
            <li> good beads, hold up well and do not slip out of hair, and i did get them all and in the variety stated. bought them as replacement beads for hair feathers i already own,i imagine they can be used for other hair extension items. shipping took almost 2 weeks but worth the wait</li>
            <li> 100 Multi Color 5mm Silicone Lined Micro-ring Links Beads Linkies for...&lt;br /&gt;It came on time i got all  100 beads&lt;br /&gt;will by more</li>
            <li> Did the trick, and hold small extensions in place. Took a while to arrive but I was in no hurry for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> easy to use and last until the hair gets clipped out of grows out.  I did not have a matting problem</li>
            <li> These were a joke,they were way to small,definitely not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved them</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this purchase.  I have a few hair extensions and my hair stylist used metal beads to keep them in place.
