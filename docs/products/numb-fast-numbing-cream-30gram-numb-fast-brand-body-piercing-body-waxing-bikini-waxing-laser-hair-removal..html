            <li>I applied on all the zone and waited for more than an hour and nothing!!</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>and it is really good.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job numbing</li>
            <li>The priolocaine can cause a warm to burning sensation for a moment or two</li>
            <li>One good coat, lightly rubbed-</li>
            <li>Did it once more.</li>
            <li>anything just make the pain more bearable.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work I love pain my wife</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Leave it on for a good hour prior</li>
            <li>so I put on a whole bunch more of the cream.</li>
            <li>Super bummed I bought this.  </li>
            <li>Kind of cool actually.</li>
            <li>this is extremely useful.</li>
            <li>It numbs fast and is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Only numbs the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>first off it arrived with the box</li>
            <li>I went back to the area that I started at around 10 minutes and it felt slightly better when I zapped that area again.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly in discretely marked packaging.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t medical advice, but I would say if you give yourself your own shots for your own medical condition, or if your kid is afraid of getting shots, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This cream num for real is not a joke tanks</li>
            <li>very beat up, I suppose this could have happened during shipping</li>
            <li>If you want something which really knocks skin pain</li>
            <li>not so much she said if don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>but then it shows its superior abilities to numb the area 100% better than lidocaine alone.  </li>
            <li>To be fair to the product, there WAS a tiny amount of numbing - my experience with my hair removal laser went from crushing to significant at the most numb area - but it was still painful.</li>
            <li>this works very well apply just keep applying dont let it dry out and your ear or</li>
            <li>When first applied it warms up a little bit, but then goes away and numbs the area.</li>

            <li> When first applied it warms up a little bit, but then goes away and numbs the area.</li>
            <li> I applied it multiple times and waited for a long time and nothing happened!</li>
            <li> but you have to leave it on for a long time to take effect and use two layers of the stuff.</li>
            <li> I could slightly feel the pressure of the vaccine fluid injecting, but that was it.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later when I got to that area, it was really still pretty painful.</li>
            <li> The injections of the numbing stuff the doctor puts in your toe normally hurts pretty bad, but I didn&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later, at around 20 minutes, there was no decrease in the laser zapping pain</li>
            <li> I felt that five minutes later I sensed the maximal amount of numbness which was very very slight.</li>
            <li> The key is to put it on at least 30 minutes ahead of time.</li>
            <li> All in all, not worth any money at all.</li>
            <li> It helps your subject to hold still while you give them a tattoo which makes for a nicer tattoo with Straighter Lines</li>
            <li> I recommend you apply 2 hours before if you really want it numb.</li>
            <li> Not very effective.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it still works.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Plus it is 5% lidocaine + 5% prilocaine, others are usually 2.5 + 2.5 &#x3D; 5%.  </li>
            <li> and I can feel the area that I&#x27;ve numbed hurts less!!</li>
            <li> , it was at least noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my hand because I wanted to use on lips, which are MUCH harder to numb.</li>
            <li> I had some Baby Orajel that I compared it to, and as weak as the Orajel was</li>
            <li> Not sure about this.... doesn&#x27;t numb my skin</li>
            <li> Maybe I have some weird response system that doesn&#x27;t recognize you are suppose to get some numbness with this product.</li>
            <li> and my face was completely numb..</li>
            <li> I used it to help numb my septum before I pierced it.</li>
            <li> Is there anything you can get OTC that will actually numb your skin.</li>
            <li> It numb the area and made the session tolerable.</li>
            <li> what ever place u want to be numb</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream num for real is not a joke tanks</li>
            <li> This is a good product.It helps your subject to hold still while you give them a tattoo which makes for a nicer tattoo with Straighter Lines</li>
            <li> It numbs fast and is worth the price. I left it on. Y skin for 45 minutes longer than suggested and my face was completely numb..</li>
            <li> I used it to help numb my septum before I pierced it. It takes a bit to work (like 10 min) but it&#x27;s fantastic. The key is to rub it in, not let it sit,</li>
            <li> God the product on Feb 2nd, 2014 ,but the expiration date printed on the box is Apr 1st, 2014. It was made in Apr,2011. Not sure if it still works.</li>
            <li> I went by the directions. Nothing. Did it once more. Nothing. What the heck?  I tried it on my hand because I wanted to use on lips, which are MUCH harder to numb. Maybe I have some weird response system that doesn&#x27;t recognize you are suppose to get some numbness with this product. Anyway, can&#x27;t use it anybody else if it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I had some Baby Orajel that I compared it to, and as weak as the Orajel was, it was at least noticeable.  Is there anything you can get OTC that will actually numb your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once with a dermaroller and it is really good.  The key is to put it on at least 30 minutes ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Great for sugaring. It numb the area and made the session tolerable. When first applied it warms up a little bit, but then goes away and numbs the area. I recommend you apply 2 hours before if you really want it numb. I will never sugar w/o this anymore.</li>
            <li> It didnt work.. I applied on all the zone and waited for more than an hour and nothing!! I guess for the cheaper price .</li>
            <li> Only numbs the top layer of skin. Not very effective.</li>
            <li> It came in a beat up package and when I tried to use it it did not do anything! I applied it multiple times and waited for a long time and nothing happened!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me but I didn&#x27;t feel any numbing.  Not that I was expecting not to feel  anything just make the pain more bearable.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare this to, but it has been used for laser hair removal. It definitely makes a difference and I can feel the area that I&#x27;ve numbed hurts less!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work---at ALL. It was like rubbing regular cream on my arm--zero numbing despite following directions. Super bummed I bought this.  I recommend you try something else--another brand perhaps b/c this stuff quite simply doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this.... doesn&#x27;t numb my skin like I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;I doesn&#x27;t come with instructions so I googled to get some ideas</li>
            <li> I purchased this and used it on my toe before having the ingrown toenail procedure done. The injections of the numbing stuff the doctor puts in your toe normally hurts pretty bad, but I didn&#x27;t feel a thing. I could feel the pressure of the numbing stuff being injected in, but no pain from the injection. I had some left over, so for the heck of it, I put some on my arm prior to getting a vaccine. Same deal, I felt nothing. I could slightly feel the pressure of the vaccine fluid injecting, but that was it. No pain what-so-ever. Kind of cool actually. This isn&#x27;t medical advice, but I would say if you give yourself your own shots for your own medical condition, or if your kid is afraid of getting shots, this stuff is amazing.  Leave it on for a good hour prior and you won&#x27;t feel anything. The next time I have a blood draw, I&#x27;m going to use up the rest of the tube, so I don&#x27;t have to feel a thing.</li>
            <li> I give this one star because it did not work for me whatsoever.  first off it arrived with the box very beat up, I suppose this could have happened during shipping it arrived in envelope not box, however I bought for purposes of laser hair removal. I tried it 3 times in a test area and nothing. I even tried wrapping with saran wrap, still nothing even 2 hours later.  So I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is I checked expiration date and it was not expired yet.</li>
            <li> Works if you put it maybe 2hours before</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product works well</li>
            <li> this works very well apply just keep applying dont let it dry out and your ear or what ever place u want to be numb it will be in 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly in discretely marked packaging.  Numbfast contains both lidocaine &amp; prilocaine.  The priolocaine can cause a warm to burning sensation for a moment or two but then it shows its superior abilities to numb the area 100% better than lidocaine alone.  Plus it is 5% lidocaine + 5% prilocaine, others are usually 2.5 + 2.5 &#x3D; 5%.  If you want something which really knocks skin pain this is extremely useful.</li>
            <li> To be fair to the product, there WAS a tiny amount of numbing - my experience with my hair removal laser went from crushing to significant at the most numb area - but it was still painful. The cream went on and I began zapping away around 10 minutes later. I felt that five minutes later I sensed the maximal amount of numbness which was very very slight. I went back to the area that I started at around 10 minutes and it felt slightly better when I zapped that area again. A few minutes later, at around 20 minutes, there was no decrease in the laser zapping pain so I put on a whole bunch more of the cream. A few minutes later when I got to that area, it was really still pretty painful. All in all, not worth any money at all.</li>
            <li> Does a good job numbing but you have to leave it on for a long time to take effect and use two layers of the stuff.</li>
            <li> No,I will not buy this again. It did not serve the purpose I purchased it for. Do not Recommend this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work I love pain my wife not so much she said if don&#x27;t work try again ppl you&#x27;ll get it one day</li>
            <li> This works very well.  Numbfast contains 5% Lidocaine and 5% Prilocaine.  It packs a double punch.  I do not use it for tattoo&#x27;s and such, but rather for occasional health conditions.  One good coat, lightly rubbed-in seems to totally deaden the surface skin.</li>
