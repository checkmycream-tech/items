            <li>I am sure others love it.</li>
            <li>This is a favorite for me</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing - just like fresh flowers, without being cloying!  </li>
            <li>I love the smooth and creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;monoi&amp;#34; products and would have to say this one is the best in body butter form.</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>the scent was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I love this creamy sweet smelling butter.</li>
            <li>Great scent, I further dilute with coconut oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just been using it as lotion, but I&#x27;m excited to try it on my hair too.  </li>
            <li>This butter not only smells good, it is very mosturizing!</li>
            <li>Also, very moisturizing!!</li>

            <li>I am currently using organic cold pressed coconut oil and sweet almond oil on my hair and body so, this CREME should turn out to be even more of a treat for my skin.!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and I am 62 spent my younger life in the sun, my skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>You only need a little because it spreads very well.</li>

            <li> I love this! It makes my skin so soft and I am 62 spent my younger life in the sun, my skin feels soft and hydrated. The smell is awesome.
