            <li>This is an amazing hair dryer!</li>
            <li>love how lightweight this blow dryer is but still does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>:) The diffuser is wonderful for curly hair!!!</li>
            <li>I thought it was supposed to be a good dryer?</li>
            <li>Good blowdryer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good hair dryer, nothing</li>
            <li>So, if a dryer has that equivalent, they&#x27;re in good shape.  </li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>Fits in your hand, good angle &amp; weight/size ratio &amp;</li>
            <li>The hair dryer works good and the adjustable heat control is nice.  </li>
            <li>This Good Heat Smart Temp is awesome</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, so much better than any blow dryer I&#x27;ve used before!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product, I received it as a sample from Goody!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The two attachments are great and easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li>The design is great, but the highest heat setting feels very very mild, which makes for a longer time drying.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to hold, great setting options!</li>
            <li>The loop at the end of the wand is handy if you want to hang the dryer up for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I received this hairdryer as a sample to test for Goody, my opinions are my own and not swayed in any way by the company.</li>
            <li>(While I received this product product as a sample, all opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li>My opinions are all my own and not that of Amazon or Goody.</li>
            <li>this dryer can make a teen girl have the best looking hair she has ever had happy</li>
            <li>Altogether an affordable and nice product</li>
            <li>I liked the numer of temperature settings.</li>

            <li>It is nice and easy to hold and has a swivel cord</li>
            <li>I love that I can set a nice, perfect temp to dry my hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li>AND one especially great feature is that on low speed, it doesn&#x27;t put out a lot of air.</li>
            <li>3 year warranty :)</li>
            <li>Love that I can control the temperature.  </li>

            <li>I received this dryer as a sample to review and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this dryer...</li>
            <li>I think it would have worked a lot better if they had numbered the settings.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect weight, not heavy by any means but not so light you wonder if anything is inside.  </li>
            <li>We enjoyed the diffuser for curly hair and the concentrator for aiming the heat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight not bulky, stylish, and the best part 10 different speed settings!</li>
            <li>Worked well until it didn&#x27;t Lasted a couple of years, many 3 or 4… On the generous side.</li>
            <li>Still using this hair dryer after more than a year</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that I can change the heat setting.  </li>
            <li>I like the possibility to choose appropriate temperature while drying my hair.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and i love that i can have 8 heat settings to choose from.</li>
            <li>Love it and it is medium size too.</li>
            <li>I do love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>This dryer has just so many optionsss..</li>
            <li>use the concentrator mostly</li>
            <li>and I love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are good for kids because if it gets too hot they wouldn&#x27;t be able to stand it or it may even burn their skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>a happy kitty and a happy customer, if you&#x27;re looking for a great hair-dryer, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>It do not get that hot and it dries your hair really good.</li>
            <li>I also love how this hair dryer came with a diffuser and a smoothing nozzle that snap in easily.  </li>
            <li>I am also in love with volume setting which is #5 and the smooth frizz free style setting which does what it says!</li>
            <li>I like the attachment for the blowing end that is more precise.</li>
            <li>The most fabulous thing about this dryer is without a doubt the temperature control dial.</li>
            <li>I love all the settings available to use.</li>
            <li>this dryer works great, lots of temp settings, nice long cord, and two attachments.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t frizz her hair,was a good price &amp; was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>The 2 awesome attachments: A Concentrator for when I want that super-sleek smooth look, and a volumizing Diffuser which is great for when I just want to dry my roots and let my natural waves go free!&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this dryer!</li>
            <li>the heat settings are easy to change with a turn of the dial.  </li>
            <li>With this hair dryer, I just twist off the air filter for easy cleaning!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and these were 3 easy to remove and change items with one motion.  </li>
            <li>I love the different heat settings in this which is really great to control while blow drying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hair is left without fried spots or fly away static.</li>
            <li>I can adjust easily to anything from 1-10</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and lets you have a variety of hairstyles in no time at all.  </li>
            <li>fine since we got it.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great feature is the multiple heat settings.</li>
            <li>you can take off and easily clean the filter/intake pad which is so easy to do.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good, being my first time using that or a diffuser</li>
            <li>would recommend this dryer to anyone that needs a new dryer and especially if you want to have the best hair you can have.  </li>
            <li>so I hope you don&#x27;t expect a review beyond saying (1) it works and (2) that it is unique in that it has 10 heat settings</li>
            <li>I have a cat that is special needs (she has cerebellar</li>
            <li>With the turn of a dial, I have full control over the heat and set it where I want-</li>
            <li>A true gem among the hair dryer rubble.</li>
            <li>I loved it from the second I turned it on!</li>
            <li>Also, it features a cool shot</li>
            <li>It worked great for 2 months with every other day use.</li>
            <li>The dryer heats up really quickly and before you know it you are done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, it wasn&#x27;t pointed at my head at the time.</li>
            <li>nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I love the cool shot button that just makes your hair look so professionally styled.  </li>
            <li>This is a strong blow dryer but it uses too much power.  </li>
            <li>Along with the revolutionary \\&quot;Fast Dry\\&quot; setting, this dryer has 9 other settings perfect for all hair types and styles making it easy to style your hair a different way every day of the week.</li>
            <li>but overall this is an amazing dryer.</li>
            <li>That alone makes this powerful dryer worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so powerful, 1875 watts of power,  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had my hair done professionally that looked better than this wonder.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a dryer with cool air as my hair has been damaged by highlighting and using hot appliances.</li>
            <li>I love switching-up my hairstyles (from big and curly to smooth</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to ruin the hairdryer, right?</li>
            <li>from low to hot, and the diffuser and concentrator is really nice.</li>
            <li>hair.&lt;br /&gt;The knob on the side for the different temperatures is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not this bad boy, it drys at perfect temps with many settings.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how easy it was to use.  </li>
            <li>I made sure everyone used this hairdryer at least 5 times and each time the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>I up it when I dry my own.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair super fast.</li>
            <li>I must say that before receiving the Goody Smart Temp Dryer to test, I honestly thought that most hair dryers are basically the same in function and merely different in outer appearance.  </li>
            <li>I love how quickly my hair gets dry.</li>
            <li>The low and high level heat are both effective.  </li>
            <li>This is my first blowdryer</li>
            <li>The extras stayed on pretty well and did not pop off.  </li>
            <li>I like my dryer to put out hot air but not so hot that it scalds my hand or scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using my cheap 15 year old blow dryer and it dries</li>
            <li>It worth the price, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like the temperature settings option, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Thanks Goody and Amazon!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it so much!</li>
            <li>Then yesterday it stopped blowing hot air.</li>
            <li>purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plugged in the hair dryer for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s powerful but not so much so that it makes puffs up</li>
            <li>I really like the design and love all the different heat settings.</li>
            <li>way an older kid can learn to blow dry their own hair.&lt;br /&gt;Worked</li>
            <li>it is too large, cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>I use it to dry my dogs and it really helps to have many temperature settings.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this dryer to anyone who needs a lot of heat and quick drying!</li>
            <li>The Goody Smart heat has infinite heat settings - and it really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pulling too much electricity in your home?</li>
            <li>I have very stick straight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going for, and how much time I have to get</li>
            <li>, you control how much heat you want.  </li>
            <li>but with this hairdryer it is so fast and leaves my hair so silky.</li>
            <li>but the concentrator works really well.</li>
            <li>It is light and it dries my  hair in a second.</li>
            <li>Finally, a hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t sound like a shrieking banshe in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>hypoplasia)and can&#x27;t bathe herself very well.</li>
            <li>A really quality dryer for the value.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t come close to drying fast with his dryer.</li>
            <li>And the concentrator part is really incommodious for anybody who need to fohn or straighten hair.</li>
            <li>We really like the variable heat</li>
            <li>It is nice to have several different heat settings to personalize my style.  </li>
            <li>Living next to a busy road, our home can get dusty pretty quickly so being able to keep my dryer vent clean and clear is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly in drying &amp; smoothing out my usual mop of hair in LESS than 5 minutes.    </li>
            <li>Unlike many other reviews, I did not receive this as a trial from Goody.  </li>
            <li>The high pitched whine was too much.  </li>
            <li>I leave it pretty much on the exact middle setting when I use it, but have tried it out on all the settings when I was playing around with it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>But really this is minor and something I am willing to overlook with it being so powerful and</li>
            <li>Lightweight dryer is nice my old dryer is heavy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to prevent frizz and want to keep those waves or curls, I highly recommend this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed (just right out of the box) was that the Goody Smart Temp Dryer was sooo much lighter than any of my previous dryers.</li>
            <li>I have never had a hair dryer dry my hair super fast like this does.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>dryer, also, comes with a removable air filter to keep it clean from all dust, usually a real problem for other dryers.  </li>
            <li>and before I tried the Goody Smart Temp Blow Dryer it would take me forever to dry my hair, but with the very convenient \\&quot;Fast Dry\\</li>
            <li>I have not bought a new hairdryer in years and was astonished at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>but i chose it, so I will live with it.</li>
            <li>However, the lights throughout the bathroom will flicker or strobe when the new hair dryer is running.  </li>
            <li>of note - the product packaging looked beat up and worn for a item sold as new.</li>
            <li>Granddaughter loves her new blow dryer.</li>
            <li>And if your hair or scalp does happen to get too hot, just turn the dial back.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>First the different heat settings are not labeled you just have to adjust it to dots on the dial and count.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>If it ever does die (which I can&#x27;t see happening) I will purchase another exactly the same model.</li>
            <li>Not sure why more dryers don&#x27;t offer this.</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer, it makes my hair really shiny ( especially compared with my old Revlon one).</li>
            <li>/&gt;7. Well-balanced design- some hair dryer designs make it awkward to hold, but this dryer seems to be weighted just right, and the handle is at just the right angle to make it very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>Most morning I don&#x27;t have time to spend very long drying my hair and this dryer gets my hair dry and out the door in under 5 minutes every time.</li>
            <li>Although  it has all of the temp levels, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that different than any other dryer, in that regard, as most people just go for a low, medium, or high heat when using their hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and it turns out very frizzy, but with the Heat Smart Temp Dryer my hair dried very fast and with no frizz</li>
            <li>I was able to dry my long hair quickly with absolutely no frizz!</li>
            <li>It only blows cool air (no matter what temperature setting) and I have only had it 4 months!</li>
            <li>Today I was in a rush and needed my hair dried quickly, so I put it on the highest setting, and it took no time at all!  </li>
            <li>When I received the Heat Smart Temp Blow Dryer as a sample from Goody, I was really expecting it to be the same ol&#x27;, same ol&#x27; with hair dryers.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>With the lower heat settings, this is gentle enough that I use it on my dog!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Temp control, not too loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months so far</li>
            <li>It is fast drying with 2 different fan speeds.  </li>
            <li>When I plug it into my bathroom outlet and turn it on its highest setting, the lights will dim.  </li>
            <li>She really likes the power and multiple temperature settings.  </li>
            <li>It does the job, not complaints so far.</li>
            <li>Does not mess up my curly hair.</li>
            <li>It helps straightens the hair so it doesn&#x27;t take much heat/time to finish the job with flat iron!</li>
            <li>I mean there are 10 different settings from warm to fast dry</li>
            <li>In addition, you can have it set to high or low.</li>
            <li>Even my mother (who has arthritis in her hands) had no problems drying her hair; whereas normally, she would stop several times midway through her blow out to let her hands rest.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I give the Goody Smart Temp Blow Dryer a big thumbs up and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>If I were in the market for a new hairdryer I would definitely buy this one!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Goody sent me a new dryer 1 week later.  </li>
            <li>I was really expecting this blow dryer to be much more expensive.</li>
            <li>No other dryer has given me 10 heat settings with just a turn of the dial.</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t still have the receipt, I&#x27;m not sure how old it really was, but even so, I can&#x27;t complain since the dryer itself is so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>No other hair dryer as ever done this before.  </li>
            <li>The slight awkwardness is made up by the benefits of low heat or cool air options though.</li>
            <li>i use it as does my girlfriend usually at the 3rd lowest setting, warm not hot air at that setting</li>
            <li>Was I wrong, this hairdryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The handle is angled just enough to make styling my hair a bit easier than my old dryer with a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s loud and hot and heavy.</li>
            <li>I also have very curly and frizzy hair and it straightened it out pretty well (with only little touch up with flat iron).  </li>
            <li>Most hair dryers are too hot or too cold, and only have 2 heat settings.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t have the high power I expected.</li>
            <li>Getting the air intake clogged with hair and dust is what always killed my past hair dryers, and no matter how hard I tried to clean the grills, I couldn&#x27;t get it clean!</li>
            <li>It is a little heavy and bigger than can fit in the hair supply drawer.  </li>
            <li>Too bad, it&#x27;s a good</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The dryer also came with a very nice diffuser attachment, that I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair dryer!</li>
            <li> love how lightweight this blow dryer is but still does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> :) The diffuser is wonderful for curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was supposed to be a good dryer?</li>
            <li> Good blowdryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good hair dryer, nothing</li>
            <li> So, if a dryer has that equivalent, they&#x27;re in good shape.  </li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> Fits in your hand, good angle &amp; weight/size ratio &amp;</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works good and the adjustable heat control is nice.  </li>
            <li> This Good Heat Smart Temp is awesome</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, so much better than any blow dryer I&#x27;ve used before!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, I received it as a sample from Goody!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> The two attachments are great and easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> The design is great, but the highest heat setting feels very very mild, which makes for a longer time drying.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to hold, great setting options!</li>
            <li> The loop at the end of the wand is handy if you want to hang the dryer up for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I received this hairdryer as a sample to test for Goody, my opinions are my own and not swayed in any way by the company.</li>
            <li> (While I received this product product as a sample, all opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li> My opinions are all my own and not that of Amazon or Goody.</li>
            <li> this dryer can make a teen girl have the best looking hair she has ever had happy</li>
            <li> Altogether an affordable and nice product</li>
            <li> I liked the numer of temperature settings.</li>
            <li> The Goody name, fast delivery, great price!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for quick blow outs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use-</li>
            <li> I own this hair dryer and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It is nice and easy to hold and has a swivel cord</li>
            <li> I love that I can set a nice, perfect temp to dry my hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> AND one especially great feature is that on low speed, it doesn&#x27;t put out a lot of air.</li>
            <li> 3 year warranty :)</li>
            <li> Love that I can control the temperature.  </li>
            <li> I love the many heat settings.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Love this Blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I received this dryer as a sample to review and I fell in love.</li>
            <li> favorite thing about this dryer...</li>
            <li> I think it would have worked a lot better if they had numbered the settings.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect weight, not heavy by any means but not so light you wonder if anything is inside.  </li>
            <li> We enjoyed the diffuser for curly hair and the concentrator for aiming the heat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight not bulky, stylish, and the best part 10 different speed settings!</li>
            <li> Worked well until it didn&#x27;t Lasted a couple of years, many 3 or 4… On the generous side.</li>
            <li> Still using this hair dryer after more than a year</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that I can change the heat setting.  </li>
            <li> I like the possibility to choose appropriate temperature while drying my hair.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and i love that i can have 8 heat settings to choose from.</li>
            <li> Love it and it is medium size too.</li>
            <li> I do love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This dryer has just so many optionsss..</li>
            <li> use the concentrator mostly</li>
            <li> and I love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are good for kids because if it gets too hot they wouldn&#x27;t be able to stand it or it may even burn their skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> a happy kitty and a happy customer, if you&#x27;re looking for a great hair-dryer, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It do not get that hot and it dries your hair really good.</li>
            <li> I also love how this hair dryer came with a diffuser and a smoothing nozzle that snap in easily.  </li>
            <li> I am also in love with volume setting which is #5 and the smooth frizz free style setting which does what it says!</li>
            <li> I like the attachment for the blowing end that is more precise.</li>
            <li> The most fabulous thing about this dryer is without a doubt the temperature control dial.</li>
            <li> I love all the settings available to use.</li>
            <li> this dryer works great, lots of temp settings, nice long cord, and two attachments.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t frizz her hair,was a good price &amp; was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> The 2 awesome attachments: A Concentrator for when I want that super-sleek smooth look, and a volumizing Diffuser which is great for when I just want to dry my roots and let my natural waves go free!&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this dryer!</li>
            <li> the heat settings are easy to change with a turn of the dial.  </li>
            <li> With this hair dryer, I just twist off the air filter for easy cleaning!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and these were 3 easy to remove and change items with one motion.  </li>
            <li> I love the different heat settings in this which is really great to control while blow drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hair is left without fried spots or fly away static.</li>
            <li> I can adjust easily to anything from 1-10</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and lets you have a variety of hairstyles in no time at all.  </li>
            <li> fine since we got it.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great feature is the multiple heat settings.</li>
            <li> you can take off and easily clean the filter/intake pad which is so easy to do.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty good, being my first time using that or a diffuser</li>
            <li> would recommend this dryer to anyone that needs a new dryer and especially if you want to have the best hair you can have.  </li>
            <li> so I hope you don&#x27;t expect a review beyond saying (1) it works and (2) that it is unique in that it has 10 heat settings</li>
            <li> I have a cat that is special needs (she has cerebellar</li>
            <li> With the turn of a dial, I have full control over the heat and set it where I want-</li>
            <li> A true gem among the hair dryer rubble.</li>
            <li> I loved it from the second I turned it on!</li>
            <li> Also, it features a cool shot</li>
            <li> It worked great for 2 months with every other day use.</li>
            <li> The dryer heats up really quickly and before you know it you are done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily, it wasn&#x27;t pointed at my head at the time.</li>
            <li> nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I love the cool shot button that just makes your hair look so professionally styled.  </li>
            <li> This is a strong blow dryer but it uses too much power.  </li>
            <li> Along with the revolutionary \\&quot;Fast Dry\\&quot; setting, this dryer has 9 other settings perfect for all hair types and styles making it easy to style your hair a different way every day of the week.</li>
            <li> but overall this is an amazing dryer.</li>
            <li> That alone makes this powerful dryer worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so powerful, 1875 watts of power,  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had my hair done professionally that looked better than this wonder.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer with cool air as my hair has been damaged by highlighting and using hot appliances.</li>
            <li> I love switching-up my hairstyles (from big and curly to smooth</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to ruin the hairdryer, right?</li>
            <li> from low to hot, and the diffuser and concentrator is really nice.</li>
            <li> hair.&lt;br /&gt;The knob on the side for the different temperatures is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not this bad boy, it drys at perfect temps with many settings.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how easy it was to use.  </li>
            <li> I made sure everyone used this hairdryer at least 5 times and each time the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> I up it when I dry my own.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair super fast.</li>
            <li> I must say that before receiving the Goody Smart Temp Dryer to test, I honestly thought that most hair dryers are basically the same in function and merely different in outer appearance.  </li>
            <li> I love how quickly my hair gets dry.</li>
            <li> The low and high level heat are both effective.  </li>
            <li> This is my first blowdryer</li>
            <li> The extras stayed on pretty well and did not pop off.  </li>
            <li> I like my dryer to put out hot air but not so hot that it scalds my hand or scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using my cheap 15 year old blow dryer and it dries</li>
            <li> It worth the price, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like the temperature settings option, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Thanks Goody and Amazon!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it so much!</li>
            <li> Then yesterday it stopped blowing hot air.</li>
            <li> purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plugged in the hair dryer for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s powerful but not so much so that it makes puffs up</li>
            <li> I really like the design and love all the different heat settings.</li>
            <li> way an older kid can learn to blow dry their own hair.&lt;br /&gt;Worked</li>
            <li> it is too large, cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> I use it to dry my dogs and it really helps to have many temperature settings.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this dryer to anyone who needs a lot of heat and quick drying!</li>
            <li> The Goody Smart heat has infinite heat settings - and it really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pulling too much electricity in your home?</li>
            <li> I have very stick straight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going for, and how much time I have to get</li>
            <li> , you control how much heat you want.  </li>
            <li> but with this hairdryer it is so fast and leaves my hair so silky.</li>
            <li> but the concentrator works really well.</li>
            <li> It is light and it dries my  hair in a second.</li>
            <li> Finally, a hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t sound like a shrieking banshe in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> hypoplasia)and can&#x27;t bathe herself very well.</li>
            <li> A really quality dryer for the value.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t come close to drying fast with his dryer.</li>
            <li> And the concentrator part is really incommodious for anybody who need to fohn or straighten hair.</li>
            <li> We really like the variable heat</li>
            <li> It is nice to have several different heat settings to personalize my style.  </li>
            <li> Living next to a busy road, our home can get dusty pretty quickly so being able to keep my dryer vent clean and clear is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly in drying &amp; smoothing out my usual mop of hair in LESS than 5 minutes.    </li>
            <li> Unlike many other reviews, I did not receive this as a trial from Goody.  </li>
            <li> The high pitched whine was too much.  </li>
            <li> I leave it pretty much on the exact middle setting when I use it, but have tried it out on all the settings when I was playing around with it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> But really this is minor and something I am willing to overlook with it being so powerful and</li>
            <li> Lightweight dryer is nice my old dryer is heavy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to prevent frizz and want to keep those waves or curls, I highly recommend this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed (just right out of the box) was that the Goody Smart Temp Dryer was sooo much lighter than any of my previous dryers.</li>
            <li> I have never had a hair dryer dry my hair super fast like this does.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> dryer, also, comes with a removable air filter to keep it clean from all dust, usually a real problem for other dryers.  </li>
            <li> and before I tried the Goody Smart Temp Blow Dryer it would take me forever to dry my hair, but with the very convenient \\&quot;Fast Dry\\</li>
            <li> I have not bought a new hairdryer in years and was astonished at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> but i chose it, so I will live with it.</li>
            <li> However, the lights throughout the bathroom will flicker or strobe when the new hair dryer is running.  </li>
            <li> of note - the product packaging looked beat up and worn for a item sold as new.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves her new blow dryer.</li>
            <li> And if your hair or scalp does happen to get too hot, just turn the dial back.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> First the different heat settings are not labeled you just have to adjust it to dots on the dial and count.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> If it ever does die (which I can&#x27;t see happening) I will purchase another exactly the same model.</li>
            <li> Not sure why more dryers don&#x27;t offer this.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer, it makes my hair really shiny ( especially compared with my old Revlon one).</li>
            <li> /&gt;7. Well-balanced design- some hair dryer designs make it awkward to hold, but this dryer seems to be weighted just right, and the handle is at just the right angle to make it very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> Most morning I don&#x27;t have time to spend very long drying my hair and this dryer gets my hair dry and out the door in under 5 minutes every time.</li>
            <li> Although  it has all of the temp levels, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that different than any other dryer, in that regard, as most people just go for a low, medium, or high heat when using their hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and it turns out very frizzy, but with the Heat Smart Temp Dryer my hair dried very fast and with no frizz</li>
            <li> I was able to dry my long hair quickly with absolutely no frizz!</li>
            <li> It only blows cool air (no matter what temperature setting) and I have only had it 4 months!</li>
            <li> Today I was in a rush and needed my hair dried quickly, so I put it on the highest setting, and it took no time at all!  </li>
            <li> When I received the Heat Smart Temp Blow Dryer as a sample from Goody, I was really expecting it to be the same ol&#x27;, same ol&#x27; with hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> With the lower heat settings, this is gentle enough that I use it on my dog!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Temp control, not too loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months so far</li>
            <li> It is fast drying with 2 different fan speeds.  </li>
            <li> When I plug it into my bathroom outlet and turn it on its highest setting, the lights will dim.  </li>
            <li> She really likes the power and multiple temperature settings.  </li>
            <li> It does the job, not complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Does not mess up my curly hair.</li>
            <li> It helps straightens the hair so it doesn&#x27;t take much heat/time to finish the job with flat iron!</li>
            <li> I mean there are 10 different settings from warm to fast dry</li>
            <li> In addition, you can have it set to high or low.</li>
            <li> Even my mother (who has arthritis in her hands) had no problems drying her hair; whereas normally, she would stop several times midway through her blow out to let her hands rest.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I give the Goody Smart Temp Blow Dryer a big thumbs up and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> If I were in the market for a new hairdryer I would definitely buy this one!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Goody sent me a new dryer 1 week later.  </li>
            <li> I was really expecting this blow dryer to be much more expensive.</li>
            <li> No other dryer has given me 10 heat settings with just a turn of the dial.</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t still have the receipt, I&#x27;m not sure how old it really was, but even so, I can&#x27;t complain since the dryer itself is so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> No other hair dryer as ever done this before.  </li>
            <li> The slight awkwardness is made up by the benefits of low heat or cool air options though.</li>
            <li> i use it as does my girlfriend usually at the 3rd lowest setting, warm not hot air at that setting</li>
            <li> Was I wrong, this hairdryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The handle is angled just enough to make styling my hair a bit easier than my old dryer with a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s loud and hot and heavy.</li>
            <li> I also have very curly and frizzy hair and it straightened it out pretty well (with only little touch up with flat iron).  </li>
            <li> Most hair dryers are too hot or too cold, and only have 2 heat settings.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t have the high power I expected.</li>
            <li> Getting the air intake clogged with hair and dust is what always killed my past hair dryers, and no matter how hard I tried to clean the grills, I couldn&#x27;t get it clean!</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy and bigger than can fit in the hair supply drawer.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, it&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li> Also the knob is just an indented circle that points at the setting you choose which can sometimes make it hard to tell exactly what setting you are turning it too.</li>
            <li> Well, because I can adjust the temp and speed, and because this is such a quiet machine, we can blow dry her now!&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> I never thought there was much difference between hairdryers and usually just picked a cheaper one</li>
            <li> Otherwise it was much like any other hair dryer--average size, average weight.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how long this dryer last.</li>
            <li> I have fine-thin straight long hair, and all the other blow dryers I&#x27;ev used in the past made my hair brittle due to high heat.</li>
            <li> Cool down button hard to use.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair daily.</li>
            <li> Most standard dryers come with 2-3 settings and that pesky \\&quot;COLD SHOT\\</li>
            <li> I dry on one of the middle temps, style and straighten on one of the hotter temps, and then set my style with the cooler temp.</li>
            <li> You can also hit the &#x27;cold shot&#x27; button on the back of the wand and the air is instantly cooled to a comfortable</li>
            <li> It has ten pink dots around a rotary dial - from coolest to hottest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive, Goody hair dryer... not a professional salon hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> eventually I spent the money only for 40 day usage.</li>
            <li> i have thin hair and blow dryers that are too powerful make my hair naught up.</li>
            <li> In less than one year, the dryer probably short circuited (a short popping sound) and now only blows out cold air.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I use this dryer with my 2-year-old daughter and lower the heat setting when I dry her hair.  </li>
            <li> Higher heat for the roots and bulk of my thick hair, then down to the lowest heat that is just like concentrated room air to dry the ends to protect against frying them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in a hurry and never have time to fully dry my hair but with the speed dry setting, my hair is dry within minutes!</li>
            <li> Hopefully mine was an exception, but the life of this blow dryer was less than one month under low use (one person in household).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the complaining is about with people saying the dryer is too heavy, too loud, odd location of the on/off switch, etc.    </li>
            <li> I do wish it was a little smaller</li>
            <li> just a little bigger than i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I really expected to see the dryer in the $40 to $50+</li>
            <li> The round thing above the handle is the heat setting.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li> : Big and heavy, awkard to hold.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> You also have to be careful when blow drying because you can get your hair stuck on the other end where the fan is and it WILL burn your hair off.</li>
            <li> First of all my hair is very thick and usually takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> &quot; setting my hair is completely dry in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair is much less dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I was given a dryer by Goody to test out, I was not compensated in any other way to provide this review.</li>
            <li> For the money I can&#x27;t say that about any other electronic item purchased.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair at a lighting speed yet all hair dryers seem to take forever to dry my thick hair</li>
            <li> only negative that I have is concerning the control knob to adjust the heat setting.</li>
            <li> Going to just go to the store and get another average blow dryer...</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and often times it takes forever to dryer my hair</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my hair naughty</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t have thick hair you should still buy it because it has all the different settings on the side for whatever matches up to what you want to do with your hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; button you have to keep pushing down while drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bad boy for the past week and a half after being lucky enough to be chosen to the review the product.</li>
            <li> The other feature is a removable round</li>
            <li> It is not super heavy</li>
            <li> Turned it on and it worked for 1 second and started weakly blowing out</li>
            <li> There are a few things I would change</li>
            <li> It has been a few years since I purchased a hair dryer</li>
            <li> My husband and I have to bathe her from time to time and then wrap her up in a towel till she had dried out.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy to hold which is why I rated it a 4.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t forsee using all 10 temp settings, but I use a lower one to diffuse my curly hair (I use another diffuser rather than the small one that came with the dryer), and I use the fast dry temp to straighten my hair (doesn&#x27;t seem to get too hot--good or bad?).  </li>
            <li> Without fail every time I would use my old dryer I would accidentally turn it off at least once during using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated how hair dryers give me the option of a VERY slow dry, or a fast dry that fries my hair!</li>
            <li> No more cleaning the air intake with a qtip or end of a rat tail comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say poor customer service, but really it&#x27;s NO Customer service.  </li>
            <li> you have thick hair like mine</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, while in use yesterday it shot out a small flame burst and now only blows cold air.</li>
            <li> but after about a month it short circuited :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man with below the shoulder length, very thick &amp; wavy hair, but my gf loves it when it&#x27;s straightened, hence my purchase.     </li>
            <li> Poor quality..</li>
            <li> I understand they&#x27;ve now discontinued, but the provided a warranty on this product and now will not stand behind it.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this dryer - or any dryer like it - anywhere else.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical of the claims that a hair dryer would improve the texture and shine of my hair.</li>
            <li> SCARY!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Impulse shopping online is dangerous!</li>
            <li> a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After a year of using this product, 3 to 4 times a week.  This brow dryer caught fire while blow drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend looking else where for a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Just happy, I wasn&#x27;t using hairspray at the time.</li>
            <li> This is my first blowdryer and I was surprised at how easy it was to use.  It is not super heavy so it did not hurt my already hurt shoulder.  I also have very curly and frizzy hair and it straightened it out pretty well (with only little touch up with flat iron).  The extras stayed on pretty well and did not pop off.  I do wish it was a little smaller, the size can make it a liitle akward to use.</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer as a test product from Goody and I have to say it&#x27;s a great product!  It&#x27;s very easy to use- the heat settings are easy to change with a turn of the dial.  I only wish that the settings were labeled.  I also love how this hair dryer came with a diffuser and a smoothing nozzle that snap in easily.  I was able to dry my long hair quickly with absolutely no frizz!</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this hair dryer. It&#x27;s lighter in weight than others I&#x27;ve owned. AND one especially great feature is that on low speed, it doesn&#x27;t put out a lot of air. If you&#x27;re looking to prevent frizz and want to keep those waves or curls, I highly recommend this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature is the multiple heat settings. I like my dryer to put out hot air but not so hot that it scalds my hand or scalp. And if your hair or scalp does happen to get too hot, just turn the dial back. You can also hit the &#x27;cold shot&#x27; button on the back of the wand and the air is instantly cooled to a comfortable temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The removable vent cover is an additional must for me. Living next to a busy road, our home can get dusty pretty quickly so being able to keep my dryer vent clean and clear is a huge plus! The loop at the end of the wand is handy if you want to hang the dryer up for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulling too much electricity in your home? This hairdryer comes with an ALCI (appliance leakage circuit interrupter), making the hair dryer shut off if for some reason an accidental immersion of water happens. Don&#x27;t want to ruin the hairdryer, right? Although I received this hairdryer as a sample to test for Goody, my opinions are my own and not swayed in any way by the company. If I were in the market for a new hairdryer I would definitely buy this one!</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair daily. I&#x27;d been using my cheap 15 year old blow dryer and it dries but it&#x27;s loud and hot and heavy. When I received the Heat Smart Temp Blow Dryer as a sample from Goody, I was really expecting it to be the same ol&#x27;, same ol&#x27; with hair dryers. Was I ever wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I love how lightweight this blow dryer is but still does an excellent job. The handle is angled just enough to make styling my hair a bit easier than my old dryer with a 90 degree angle. I like the attachment for the blowing end that is more precise. It&#x27;s great for quick blow outs. The dryer also came with a very nice diffuser attachment, that I don&#x27;t need. I have very stick straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;The knob on the side for the different temperatures is very easy to use. I leave it pretty much on the exact middle setting when I use it, but have tried it out on all the settings when I was playing around with it.&lt;br /&gt;For the quality of this blow dryer I was really expecting this blow dryer to be much more expensive. I was pleasantly surprised to see it is reasonably priced. I really expected to see the dryer in the $40 to $50+ price range.&lt;br /&gt;While I was given a dryer by Goody to test out, I was not compensated in any other way to provide this review.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample from Goody, and I&#x27;ve loved it! Here&#x27;s why-&lt;br /&gt;1. the TEN heat settings- WOW! I&#x27;ve always hated how hair dryers give me the option of a VERY slow dry, or a fast dry that fries my hair! Not a problem anymore! With the turn of a dial, I have full control over the heat and set it where I want- depending on the look I&#x27;m going for, and how much time I have to get ready.&lt;br /&gt;2. With the lower heat settings, this is gentle enough that I use it on my dog!&lt;br /&gt;3. Ionic + Tourmaline + Ceramic&#x3D; super-smooth hair. Good-bye Frizz!&lt;br /&gt;4.Cool Shot button, great to finish off and \\&quot;set\\&quot; my style.&lt;br /&gt;5. The 2 awesome attachments: A Concentrator for when I want that super-sleek smooth look, and a volumizing Diffuser which is great for when I just want to dry my roots and let my natural waves go free!&lt;br /&gt;6. Removable Air Filter- perfect. Getting the air intake clogged with hair and dust is what always killed my past hair dryers, and no matter how hard I tried to clean the grills, I couldn&#x27;t get it clean! With this hair dryer, I just twist off the air filter for easy cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;7. Well-balanced design- some hair dryer designs make it awkward to hold, but this dryer seems to be weighted just right, and the handle is at just the right angle to make it very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;8. 3 year warranty :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, so much better than any blow dryer I&#x27;ve used before!</li>
            <li> Love that I can control the temperature.  By that I mean there are 10 different settings from warm to fast dry, you control how much heat you want.  In addition, you can have it set to high or low.</li>
            <li> I received this hairdryer from Goody to sample and review. I have not bought a new hairdryer in years and was astonished at how well it worked. I never thought there was much difference between hairdryers and usually just picked a cheaper one but I have learned my lesson. I have thick coarse hair and often times it takes forever to dryer my hair but with this hairdryer it is so fast and leaves my hair so silky. I really like the design and love all the different heat settings. I have been telling everyone I know about this product.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and before I tried the Goody Smart Temp Blow Dryer it would take me forever to dry my hair, but with the very convenient \\&quot;Fast Dry\\&quot; setting my hair is completely dry in less than 5 minutes. Along with the revolutionary \\&quot;Fast Dry\\&quot; setting, this dryer has 9 other settings perfect for all hair types and styles making it easy to style your hair a different way every day of the week. Overall, I give the Goody Smart Temp Blow Dryer a big thumbs up and would recommend it to everyone! (While I received this product product as a sample, all opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li> It worth the price, highly recommend it! Temp control, not too loud. just a little bigger than i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I love the many heat settings. I use it to dry my dogs and it really helps to have many temperature settings. I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months so far and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> Most hair dryers are too hot or too cold, and only have 2 heat settings. The Goody Smart heat has infinite heat settings - and it really works. This is the hair dryer I have been looking for. The round thing above the handle is the heat setting. It has ten pink dots around a rotary dial - from coolest to hottest. It has a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button on the rear of the handle that turns off all the heat - in case you want room temperature hair drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this hair dryer a LOT, dropped it on a carpeted floor multiple times, and it still runs perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two from Amazon - just in case Goody ever decides to discontinue this wonderful product. I have been unable to find this dryer - or any dryer like it - anywhere else. A true gem among the hair dryer rubble.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, I received it as a sample from Goody!  It is nice to have several different heat settings to personalize my style.  Today I was in a rush and needed my hair dried quickly, so I put it on the highest setting, and it took no time at all!  LOVE IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> In less than one year, the dryer probably short circuited (a short popping sound) and now only blows out cold air.  Poor quality.. they already discontinued the product on Goody.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goody sent me a new dryer 1 week later.  Great customer service, but Let&#x27;s see how long this dryer last.</li>
            <li> Hair is frizzy after drying hair. Dryer has control knob for amount of heat you want but if I turn dial to low heat setting my lights flicker!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair dryer. I love that I can set a nice, perfect temp to dry my hair without damaging it. Most standard dryers come with 2-3 settings and that pesky \\&quot;COLD SHOT\\&quot; button you have to keep pushing down while drying. Not this bad boy, it drys at perfect temps with many settings. A must have!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a dryer by Goody to review and no compensation was received for my review.  My opinions are all my own and not that of Amazon or Goody.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer I am so glad I got it. :) The diffuser is wonderful for curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> Love this Blow dryer. I got it on time. It do not get that hot and it dries your hair really good.</li>
            <li> It was just as described.  It is a great dryer with adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li> I received this dryer as a sample to review and I fell in love. There are a few things I would change but overall this is an amazing dryer. Most morning I don&#x27;t have time to spend very long drying my hair and this dryer gets my hair dry and out the door in under 5 minutes every time. I crank up the dial all the way to the max and it dries faster than any dryer I have had before without making my hair feel fried and frizzy. I am also in love with volume setting which is #5 and the smooth frizz free style setting which does what it says! I haven&#x27;t played with the diffuser attachment yet but the concentrator works really well. The dryer heats up really quickly and before you know it you are done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this dryer...no accidental shut off! Without fail every time I would use my old dryer I would accidentally turn it off at least once during using it. I have been using this dryer for about two weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had that problem once! That alone makes this powerful dryer worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative that I have is concerning the control knob to adjust the heat setting. First the different heat settings are not labeled you just have to adjust it to dots on the dial and count. I think it would have worked a lot better if they had numbered the settings. Also the knob is just an indented circle that points at the setting you choose which can sometimes make it hard to tell exactly what setting you are turning it too. But really this is minor and something I am willing to overlook with it being so powerful and quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this dryer to anyone who needs a lot of heat and quick drying!</li>
            <li> Wow!  I am so impressed by this hair dryer.  It has been a few years since I purchased a hair dryer and I was skeptical of the claims that a hair dryer would improve the texture and shine of my hair. Was I wrong, this hairdryer is amazing.  It is a perfect weight, not heavy by any means but not so light you wonder if anything is inside.  It is nice and easy to hold and has a swivel cord so no cord tangling.  It is so powerful, 1875 watts of power,  It is the only dryer I saw with 10 (ten) different settings.  It is fast drying with 2 different fan speeds.  I love the cool shot button that just makes your hair look so professionally styled.  I made sure everyone used this hairdryer at least 5 times and each time the results were amazing.  I was asked to review this product and I wanted to make it thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this dryer can make a teen girl have the best looking hair she has ever had happy well there just is no words.  Everyone&#x27;s hair was sleek and shiny with no damage or tangles.  No one had their hair caught in an air vent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer, also, comes with a removable air filter to keep it clean from all dust, usually a real problem for other dryers.  We enjoyed the diffuser for curly hair and the concentrator for aiming the heat and these were 3 easy to remove and change items with one motion.  Of course, you do not need to use the diffuser or concentrator.  That is up to your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this dryer to anyone that needs a new dryer and especially if you want to have the best hair you can have.  I haven&#x27;t had my hair done professionally that looked better than this wonder.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair dryer! I loved it from the second I turned it on! It&#x27;s lightweight not bulky, stylish, and the best part 10 different speed settings! I&#x27;m always in a hurry and never have time to fully dry my hair but with the speed dry setting, my hair is dry within minutes! I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryerI have ever had. It is light and it dries my  hair in a second.</li>
            <li> I have fine-thin straight long hair, and all the other blow dryers I&#x27;ev used in the past made my hair brittle due to high heat. I love the different heat settings in this which is really great to control while blow drying. The only drawback I feel is its bulky size. It would be great to have this product in a travel size. But for the price its a very good buy!</li>
            <li> Worked well until it didn&#x27;t Lasted a couple of years, many 3 or 4… On the generous side.</li>
            <li> This is a strong blow dryer but it uses too much power.  When I plug it into my bathroom outlet and turn it on its highest setting, the lights will dim.  You also have to be careful when blow drying because you can get your hair stuck on the other end where the fan is and it WILL burn your hair off.</li>
            <li> Still using this hair dryer after more than a year and it&#x27;s running like a charm.  Great power and I love the fact that I can change the heat setting.  I use this dryer with my 2-year-old daughter and lower the heat setting when I dry her hair.  I up it when I dry my own.  It works great.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. I like the temperature settings option, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> excellent:  utility, performance, appearance,  best feature is the temperature control.  I have recommended it to friends and assume they will purchase it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happend, but it blew up while I was drying my hair! SCARY! I thought it was supposed to be a good dryer?</li>
            <li> I haved owned this hair dryer for over 7 years. No other dryer has given me 10 heat settings with just a turn of the dial. Higher heat for the roots and bulk of my thick hair, then down to the lowest heat that is just like concentrated room air to dry the ends to protect against frying them. The other feature is a removable round back intake you can take off and easily clean the filter/intake pad which is so easy to do. No more cleaning the air intake with a qtip or end of a rat tail comb. Also, it features a cool shot button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is left without fried spots or fly away static. I have had the same dryer for years; works every day without a glitch. For the money I can&#x27;t say that about any other electronic item purchased. If it ever does die (which I can&#x27;t see happening) I will purchase another exactly the same model. Excellent quality product. Thanks Goody and Amazon!</li>
            <li> I own this hair dryer and I love it.  My teen daughter asked for one for Christmas.  She really likes the power and multiple temperature settings.  The two attachments are great and easy to put on and take off.  Great, quality made hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Hopefully mine was an exception, but the life of this blow dryer was less than one month under low use (one person in household).  I cannot recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Good blowdryer but doesn&#x27;t have the high power I expected. Altogether an affordable and nice product</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to hold. I like the possibility to choose appropriate temperature while drying my hair. Works well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She had a heart attack! Loved it!  heat settings are great. I recommend to anyone who uses a heat tool daily. The lower temp settings are great as they won&#x27;t fry your hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, a hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t sound like a shrieking banshe in my bathroom.  I specifically went in search of a lower decibel hair dryer after my last conair.  The high pitched whine was too much.  I realize no hand held hair dryer will be quiet, but there&#x27;s a limit.  This one is not at all offensive and does a great job drying my hair.  I purchased this one after my last one quit after aprox  3 years.  Since I didn&#x27;t still have the receipt, I&#x27;m not sure how old it really was, but even so, I can&#x27;t complain since the dryer itself is so reasonably priced.  I think I noticed something about it being discontinued. Too bad, it&#x27;s a good product.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/2015: This had a 3 year warranty.  This month it started shooting out flaming chunks of something, probably the heating element. Luckily, it wasn&#x27;t pointed at my head at the time. Contacted Goody and 3weeks later have never gotten a response.  I&#x27;d say poor customer service, but really it&#x27;s NO Customer service.  I understand they&#x27;ve now discontinued, but the provided a warranty on this product and now will not stand behind it. Updating to one star based on short life and virtually no customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bad boy for the past week and a half after being lucky enough to be chosen to the review the product. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it so much! Once you get the ability to change the temperature of your hair dryer, you&#x27;ll wonder how you&#x27;ll ever got by without it. I dry on one of the middle temps, style and straighten on one of the hotter temps, and then set my style with the cooler temp. My hair comes out shiny and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve found another wonderful use. I have a cat that is special needs (she has cerebellar hypoplasia)and can&#x27;t bathe herself very well. My husband and I have to bathe her from time to time and then wrap her up in a towel till she had dried out. Well, because I can adjust the temp and speed, and because this is such a quiet machine, we can blow dry her now!&lt;br /&gt;From a happy kitty and a happy customer, if you&#x27;re looking for a great hair-dryer, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer so I hope you don&#x27;t expect a review beyond saying (1) it works and (2) that it is unique in that it has 10 heat settings</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer, after I had read all of the reviews on several websites.  For the price, it&#x27;s exactly as I expected.  It&#x27;s a good hair dryer, nothing earth-shattering.  Although  it has all of the temp levels, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that different than any other dryer, in that regard, as most people just go for a low, medium, or high heat when using their hair dryer.  So, if a dryer has that equivalent, they&#x27;re in good shape.  I&#x27;d recommend it, and buy it again (for the price), but just remember:  It&#x27;s an inexpensive, Goody hair dryer... not a professional salon hair dryer.  :)</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase. I would buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> i have thin hair and blow dryers that are too powerful make my hair naught up. this blow dryer is perfect for my hair. it doesn&#x27;t make my hair naughty and i love that i can have 8 heat settings to choose from.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy and bigger than can fit in the hair supply drawer.  The low and high level heat are both effective.  The hook on the handle is perfect for hanging on the towel rack.</li>
            <li> this dryer works great, lots of temp settings, nice long cord, and two attachments. i use it as does my girlfriend usually at the 3rd lowest setting, warm not hot air at that setting</li>
            <li> I have thin hair so I was looking for something that would not fry my hair and this was perfect.  I can adjust easily to anything from 1-10 and I can adjust to from low-medium-high also.  Love it and it is medium size too.</li>
            <li> It was great. I loved it and I thought it is a great purchase but after about a month it short circuited :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not return it because I missed the last day of return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So eventually I spent the money only for 40 day usage.</li>
            <li> it is too large, cumbersome.  but i chose it, so I will live with it. Impulse shopping online is dangerous!</li>
            <li> I do love this hair dryer. I was looking for a dryer with cool air as my hair has been damaged by highlighting and using hot appliances. I can already see a difference. My hair is much less dry.  I use it on the 2nd or 3rd heat setting. It is a bit heavy to hold which is why I rated it a 4.  The slight awkwardness is made up by the benefits of low heat or cool air options though. Not sure why more dryers don&#x27;t offer this.</li>
            <li> This dryer is wonderful! First of all my hair is very thick and usually takes forever to dry and it turns out very frizzy, but with the Heat Smart Temp Dryer my hair dried very fast and with no frizz I couldn&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair like mine I would recommend you give this blow dryer a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Even if you don&#x27;t have thick hair you should still buy it because it has all the different settings on the side for whatever matches up to what you want to do with your hair. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this dryer!</li>
            <li> I love how quickly my hair gets dry. Does not mess up my curly hair. Lightweight dryer is nice my old dryer is heavy. This product was given to me by goody and was not paid for opinion.</li>
            <li> I must say that before receiving the Goody Smart Temp Dryer to test, I honestly thought that most hair dryers are basically the same in function and merely different in outer appearance.  Boy was I wrong! The first thing that I noticed (just right out of the box) was that the Goody Smart Temp Dryer was sooo much lighter than any of my previous dryers. Even my mother (who has arthritis in her hands) had no problems drying her hair; whereas normally, she would stop several times midway through her blow out to let her hands rest.  The most fabulous thing about this dryer is without a doubt the temperature control dial. It&#x27;s easy to use and lets you have a variety of hairstyles in no time at all.  I love switching-up my hairstyles (from big and curly to smooth and straight)and this is the best hair dryer that I have found that lets me do that.  Simply a revolutionary hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Dries hair super fast. I love all the settings available to use. A really quality dryer for the value. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The adjustable heat setting of this unit is the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer...nothing extraordinary. I liked the numer of temperature settings. Otherwise it was much like any other hair dryer--average size, average weight. Then yesterday it stopped blowing hot air. It only blows cool air (no matter what temperature setting) and I have only had it 4 months! Going to just go to the store and get another average blow dryer...hopefully one that has a longer life!</li>
            <li> Very good product, as described in the publication.</li>
            <li> I have never had a hair dryer dry my hair super fast like this does. I accidently left my hair dryer back at my mom&#x27;s house, and tried using my husband&#x27;s. My hair didn&#x27;t come close to drying fast with his dryer. This Good Heat Smart Temp is awesome and I MISS IT. I need to get it back from my mom&#x27;s house. I never ever had a dryer as awesome as this one.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works good and the adjustable heat control is nice.  However, the lights throughout the bathroom will flicker or strobe when the new hair dryer is running.  No other hair dryer as ever done this before.  Don&#x27;t plan on returning it but if I had know this would happen I would have selected a different model.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other reviews, I did not receive this as a trial from Goody.  For the price, it is what you would expect.  It is a hair dryer, not salon-grade by any means.  I don&#x27;t forsee using all 10 temp settings, but I use a lower one to diffuse my curly hair (I use another diffuser rather than the small one that came with the dryer), and I use the fast dry temp to straighten my hair (doesn&#x27;t seem to get too hot--good or bad?).  It does the job, not complaints so far.</li>
            <li> The 10 heat level is not practical as explained. And the concentrator part is really incommodious for anybody who need to fohn or straighten hair.</li>
            <li> Pros: Dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Big and heavy, awkard to hold. Cool down button hard to use. Basically only use the fast-dry setting.</li>
            <li> This dryer has just so many optionsss..from low to hot, and the diffuser and concentrator is really nice. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair at a lighting speed yet all hair dryers seem to take forever to dry my thick hair&lt;br /&gt;I use the concentrator mostly and it&#x27;s pretty good, being my first time using that or a diffuser</li>
            <li> Never had this happen before with anything I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plugged in the hair dryer for the first time.  Turned it on and it worked for 1 second and started weakly blowing out gray smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning immediately.  Not going to be purchasing electric Goody products anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also of note - the product packaging looked beat up and worn for a item sold as new.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves her new blow dryer. Doesn&#x27;t frizz her hair,was a good price &amp; was shipped fast.Don&#x27;t have regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the complaining is about with people saying the dryer is too heavy, too loud, odd location of the on/off switch, etc.    It&#x27;s a hair dryer. It&#x27;s going to make noise &amp; if you want one that dries fast, it might also be heavy to accommodate the motor.    I used it and I love. It works just great.    Fits in your hand, good angle &amp; weight/size ratio &amp; the attachments are just a bonus.    I&#x27;m a man with below the shoulder length, very thick &amp; wavy hair, but my gf loves it when it&#x27;s straightened, hence my purchase.     I&#x27;m a guy who \\&quot;hates\\&quot; having to fuss.  It worked perfectly in drying &amp; smoothing out my usual mop of hair in LESS than 5 minutes.    I received great results with this blow dryer, &amp; best of all?  The Goody name, fast delivery, great price!  Happy girlfriend &#x3D; happy me.</li>
            <li> We really like the variable heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;They are good for kids because if it gets too hot they wouldn&#x27;t be able to stand it or it may even burn their skin.&lt;br /&gt;This way an older kid can learn to blow dry their own hair.&lt;br /&gt;Worked fine since we got it.&lt;br /&gt;Good price too. I think we took a chance on this and we&#x27;re happy that it worked out well!</li>
            <li> The design is great, but the highest heat setting feels very very mild, which makes for a longer time drying.</li>
            <li> It helps straightens the hair so it doesn&#x27;t take much heat/time to finish the job with flat iron! No frizz</li>
            <li> It worked great for 2 months with every other day use. Unfortunately, while in use yesterday it shot out a small flame burst and now only blows cold air.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to hold, great setting options!</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer, it makes my hair really shiny ( especially compared with my old Revlon one). I like that it&#x27;s powerful but not so much so that it makes puffs up hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love that it has adjustable temperature control.</li>
