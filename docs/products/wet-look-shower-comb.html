            <li>Perfect for my daughter!</li>
            <li>Works great when combing tangled hair out in the shower!  </li>
            <li>What a great comb!  </li>
            <li>the best part of this comb is I no longer have to worry about trying to find a spot for this in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the shower.</li>
            <li>Awesome for curly hair.</li>

            <li>oh boy, this comb worked GREAT.  </li>
            <li>Great for the shower.</li>
            <li>And the product works great</li>
            <li>This is a great comb.</li>
            <li>But when I read the good reviews I figured I try it</li>
            <li>Good comb for shower.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good it is.  </li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>I love this comb!</li>
            <li>Love this comb!</li>
            <li>These combs are handy and are being used in a &amp;#34;Cosmetology&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it does what it is supposed to do and it hangs nicely in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I love this comb and it&#x27;s by far the best detangling comb that I have used.</li>
            <li>Ok, it&#x27;s just a comb</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more than that.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am sure I will be buying more as the class goes on.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>i love this comb.</li>
            <li>as soon as i received it I automatically decided to test it out and as reported it didnt stress my hair whatsoever. :)</li>
            <li>I love the curved handle which makes it easy for me to use while detangling in the shower.</li>
            <li>Its oh so gentle and does a good job of getting my knots untangled without tugging and ripping my hair.  </li>
            <li>last rule is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;ve discovered that I can use this comb to loosen up my style after my hair has dried, and I don&#x27;t get the frizzies and (best of all</li>
            <li>I was hoping that after using a couple of weeks, it will eventually smooth out.  </li>
            <li>Handy and quite reasonably priced</li>
            <li>fantastic idea...</li>
            <li>So far so good....  </li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace one I lost, then found the original, but I like this one a lot.</li>
            <li>There is another seller that is selling the exact comb in 3-pack for about a dollar more.  </li>
            <li>Works great in my long curly hair for detangling without pulling a bunch out.</li>
            <li>i love this comb so much i  bought three.  </li>
            <li>Oh and even better its very affordable</li>
            <li>and I can tell that it&#x27;s a lot more gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li>and I just might buy another, just in case I loose it (how many combs have we lost in our own house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I went to my local drugstore and got another one for a dollar more and a lot better quality plastic.</li>
            <li>I specifically asked for a certain color (which should have indicated to the seller to contact me if it wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>comb was worth every penny</li>
            <li>right.  </li>
            <li>/curly and this glides right on through with conditioner in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I already hair this comb and love how easily it glides through my coily wet hair.</li>
            <li>I thought the little balls at the end would make it less effective with detangling at the root, but it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>There is a also a pretty strict rule that you don&#x27;t brush your hair once it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>They are great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>its so much work.  </li>
            <li>It really detangled my hair and it lasted even when I got out of the shower and comb through my damp hair, it was so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure that that is what the description stated, So much that I even put in the details to ensure I get a pink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what more to say about a comb, other than, &amp;#34;It works!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, wavy, colored (henna), and about shoulder length long.</li>
            <li>Ironically, it is exactly the same one that I have in my shower right now.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is what held me back at first</li>
            <li>While I was in the shower washing my hair I reached for my normal waide tooth comb and remembered, &amp;#34;wait</li>
            <li>I am not satisfied as I find this too pricey for ONE comb and the service could have been better..</li>
            <li>great comb for long wet hair !!!!!!</li>
            <li>I am natural</li>
            <li>(Hint, I&#x27;m too old to play Gretel, and I&#x27;m not a boy, so I can&#x27;t play</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and my hair is getting thicker and if it keeps growing I can see where this comb will become obsolete for me because the teeth are not that far apart</li>
            <li>Use on my shoulder-length naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have long wavy hair that gets very tangled</li>
            <li>I use this comb before I shampoo to clear all the knots and then again when I deep condition.  </li>
            <li>definitely recommend this comb for all my fellow natural ladies.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far and felt compelled to write a review after just one use.  </li>
            <li>I recently decided to wear my hari natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible but not great either.  </li>

            <li> Overall money well spent.  </li>

            <li> (My fault for not reading it all, but deceiving none the less.)</li>
            <li> A little flimsier than I was hoping for.  </li>

            <li> *Way to expensive for just one comb!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i love this comb so much i  bought three.  i have one upstairs, one downstairs, one in my purse.  i have red hair and it is course.  this comb no breakage, no damage.  i love it!</li>
            <li> Ok, it&#x27;s just a comb right.  NO it&#x27;s more than that.  I am natural my hair texture is a 4b/4c and I HATE combing, detangling, brushing, etc my hair.  its so much work.  I&#x27;ve used other wide tooth combs (in the shower) but this one really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is what held me back at first, b/c I can go to my local bss and buy a comb for less than $2.  But when I read the good reviews I figured I try it but I was still skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my comb arrived I still had my protective style in.  While I was in the shower washing my hair I reached for my normal waide tooth comb and remembered, &amp;#34;wait I just spent $6 on a comb that&#x27;s supposed to work&amp;#34;  I jumped out of the shower grabbed my comb from my purse ( I hide a lot of my amazon purchases from my husband) jumped back in the shower and started to comb and detangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy oh boy, this comb worked GREAT.  I could not believe it.  It really detangled my hair and it lasted even when I got out of the shower and comb through my damp hair, it was so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb was worth every penny and I just might buy another, just in case I loose it (how many combs have we lost in our own house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this comb for all my fellow natural ladies.  It works.</li>
            <li> The description says \\&quot;ships in assorted colors\\&quot; but mine arrived the same color as in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this style of comb ever since a hairdresser told me they are less likely to contribute to split ends vs. a regular brush.</li>
            <li> great comb for long wet hair !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my daughter!</li>
            <li> I love this comb! I have relaxed hair and after a wash and adding in my leave ins my hair detangles so effortlessly with this comb. I even use it throughout the week when combing through my hair. No longer do I feel as if my hair is being ripped or broken off.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, wavy, colored (henna), and about shoulder length long. A few months ago, I started noticing that I was losing a lot of hair, and switched to the Curly Girl method to see if that would help. Part of the CG method involves combing through you hair in the shower (think Wen) with a wide tooth comb. There is a also a pretty strict rule that you don&#x27;t brush your hair once it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last rule is great. Any time I brush my hair when it&#x27;s dry, it turns frizzy and looks like I&#x27;m seeking a part in Hansel and Gretel. (Hint, I&#x27;m too old to play Gretel, and I&#x27;m not a boy, so I can&#x27;t play Hansel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve discovered that I can use this comb to loosen up my style after my hair has dried, and I don&#x27;t get the frizzies and (best of all) I don&#x27;t end up with half my hair on the comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I thought i was getting two combs. I am sure that that is what the description stated, So much that I even put in the details to ensure I get a pink. But I not only was it One comb i got it was purple. So even if this was the price for one and the details weren&#x27;t amended (questionable) as this would not be the first time this happened. I specifically asked for a certain color (which should have indicated to the seller to contact me if it wasn&#x27;t available. I am not satisfied as I find this too pricey for ONE comb and the service could have been better..</li>
            <li> Good comb for shower. You only get ONE, picture makes it seem like you are getting two.....</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  Works great when combing tangled hair out in the shower!  Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Quality sucks. Very rough edges, they hurt.  I was hoping that after using a couple of weeks, it will eventually smooth out.  NOPE! In addition to the poor quality, I was expecting to get 2 as pictured.  I guess it was just as well that I got just one since it&#x27;s like using a nail comb.</li>
            <li> What a great comb!  The paint on the tips feel like fingers, not scratchy in any way at all.  My hair is past the middle of my back and thick/curly and this glides right on through with conditioner in the shower.  I run my fingers through my hair before showering just to get some initial knots out.  I have only used it once so far and felt compelled to write a review after just one use.  That&#x27;s how good it is.  :)</li>
            <li> Handy and quite reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I recently decided to wear my hari natural.  I have what is categorized as tpe 4c hair, if not higher.  My hair is very course and hard.  I use this comb before I shampoo to clear all the knots and then again when I deep condition.  Its oh so gentle and does a good job of getting my knots untangled without tugging and ripping my hair.  I know some of my caucasian friends use this too so I guess it does the trick of detangling with minimal breakage.  the best part of this comb is I no longer have to worry about trying to find a spot for this in the shower.  the hook on the end allow me to hook the comb either on the shower curtain pole or on the shower head; fantastic idea...Oh and even better its very affordable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The hook seems to get in the way of combing depending on the angle that I need to use, but it can be worked around.  I&#x27;m natural and my hair is getting thicker and if it keeps growing I can see where this comb will become obsolete for me because the teeth are not that far apart --it&#x27;s already a struggle sometimes, but it&#x27;ll do for now.</li>
            <li> I probably have a dozen of these, spread all over the house. They are great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> These combs are handy and are being used in a &amp;#34;Cosmetology&amp;#34; class.  So far they seem durable, the handle could be a little longer.  Overall money well spent.  I am sure I will be buying more as the class goes on.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace one I lost, then found the original, but I like this one a lot. It&#x27;s perfect for the shower.</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY! I just received this comb.  It is not the one pictured.  Ironically, it is exactly the same one that I have in my shower right now.  I purchased that one for $2.49.  I got ripped off!  Very disappointed!!!  Would never purchase from this buyer again!</li>
            <li> So... the comb works. :)  it does what it is supposed to do and it hangs nicely in the shower.  So far so good....  I don&#x27;t really know what more to say about a comb, other than, &amp;#34;It works!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A little flimsier than I was hoping for.  I have long wavy hair that gets very tangled and I need a comb that can take a lot if pulling without bending.  It&#x27;s not terrible but not great either.  I went to my local drugstore and got another one for a dollar more and a lot better quality plastic.</li>
            <li> I already hair this comb and love how easily it glides through my coily wet hair. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like it! I am African American and I have 3c/4a hair and it helps me detangle and distribute product. I thought the little balls at the end would make it less effective with detangling at the root, but it&#x27;s great and I can tell that it&#x27;s a lot more gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression I was getting two combs but only one came.  The comb has a small cut in the top prong which I&#x27;m afraid will damage my fragile hair so I haven&#x27;t used it!</li>
            <li> Awesome for curly hair. I use this on my daughter, and we no longer go to war when coming her wet hair.</li>
            <li> I love this comb and it&#x27;s by far the best detangling comb that I have used. I love the curved handle which makes it easy for me to use while detangling in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. It looks like it&#x27;s been used for like 5 years.</li>
            <li> Great for the shower. Use on my shoulder-length naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I was purchasing two combs - per the picture and subsequent cost. You only get one comb. There is another seller that is selling the exact comb in 3-pack for about a dollar more.  *Way to expensive for just one comb!</li>
            <li> The comb itself deserves five stars. Works great in my long curly hair for detangling without pulling a bunch out. I thought, however, because of the picture and the price, I would be receiving two combs. (My fault for not reading it all, but deceiving none the less.)</li>
            <li> i love this comb. as soon as i received it I automatically decided to test it out and as reported it didnt stress my hair whatsoever. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the shipping!! And the product works great</li>
            <li> Love this comb! I have curly hair so it works well. It is similar to one I used to have from Avon.</li>
            <li> This is a great comb. I use it every morning in the shower to brush out conditioner. Highly recommend this product</li>
