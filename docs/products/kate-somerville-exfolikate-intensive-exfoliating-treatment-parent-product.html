            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Iam very happy with the product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great treatment for your face.</li>
            <li>My skin did look great after I washed it off</li>
            <li>NY state is attempting to ban products with microbeads and hopefully they will be successful.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product but have just discovered it contains plastic microbeads (listed as Polyethylene) which are polluting our water supply and food chain.  </li>
            <li>I have good skin, and I try just about every skin treatment product to keep it that way.</li>
            <li>I thought I was using a good product, but when I was given the chance to try ExfoliKate at a reduced price, I thought, why not?  </li>
            <li>There are so many amazing ingredients in it that work together to make your skin gorgeous!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>was weighing buying a Clarisonic, but after this treatment, I can&#x27;t see how my skin could better!</li>
            <li>I love this exfolikate!  </li>
            <li>Got this as a sample when ordering some stuff from sephora and after just one use my face felt amazing.  </li>
            <li>ExfoliKate is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I kind of like the smell of it</li>
            <li>It feels like it is working, meaning it gets warm (burns),</li>
            <li>But worth it to me!!!</li>
            <li>This is a quick and painless exfoliator that smells great and doesn&#x27;t cause any burning or severe redness.</li>
            <li>I am well aware of the necessity of good exfoliation when taking good care of your skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing, worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>And after I&#x27;ve finished the process, my skin not only feels great, but looks great too.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>My face is in much better condition</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>This has to be the fastest and most potent skin care product I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>I love Kate Somerville &amp; Kate Spade.</li>
            <li>However, I talked with others who used it all the time, and they convinced me that with continued use, I wouldn&#x27;t notice the burning, but I would notice a better job of exfoliation with each use.  </li>
            <li>I am still using it once a week even though it costs more than most people want to pay.  </li>
            <li>My skin has a healthy glow afterward.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it feels  </li>
            <li>Upon trying it the first time, I experienced what I called a burning sensation that was quite strong.  </li>
            <li>I wrote a review on my blog about this product with more details about what it does and how it helps :) Feel free to read and comment!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>My skin looks phenomenal, and it feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Listen to what people are telling you; this really is THAT good.</li>
            <li>I am very fair (blonde) but it is not too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>I became hooked on [[ASIN:B001ZT7ZEE Exfolikate]] when I received a free sample through a Sephora purchase.</li>
            <li>The results are well worth it!</li>
            <li>I guess I must have an addiction to exfoliators because there are so many that I really like.  </li>
            <li>This product really felt like it was working (tingly) and my face was very smooth after my first use.</li>
            <li>THIS product is great if you have combination skin, uneven skin tone and discoloration, is intensive</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>They were right.  </li>
            <li>You can see a glow on my right hand from the ExfoliKate.</li>
            <li>it feels very soft and smooth like a babies face.  </li>
            <li>My face was soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>There are many equivalent alternatives such as walnut shell, salt and sugar.  </li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>product comes out as a pretty malachite green, with a nice, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I work for a different high end cosmetic line and after many of my coworkers said to try it</li>
            <li>This ExfoliKate was one of the first ones that I really liked back when it was actually called Kate in a Jar.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very tolerable.  </li>
            <li>Exfolikate works very well for me.</li>
            <li>You just feel like it is really working</li>
            <li>I really wish I knew what others were seeing</li>
            <li>This does a great job, although it is pricey, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little warm, but not unduly so; there are those little microbeads so many skin treatments have nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by a glowing older women in the skin stuff store.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have leather for skin already I highly recommend you DON&#x27;T even try this product.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey in my opinion but the performance is top of the line.  </li>
            <li>i get all my beauty products at the drug store, not a big spender, but this product is worth the price tag, I put it once</li>
            <li>The hand on the left is without ExfoliKate and the hand on the right</li>
            <li>You massage it onto clean, wet skin, and the directions said to let it sit for up to two minutes.</li>
            <li>I bought it and was wowed by the results, no scrubbing needed, it quickly disolved all the dead skin leaving skin as smooth as the the back of my forearm.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t use it if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>just wow!</li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate, and I&#x27;m 40, but think I have the skin of a 30 year old (or thereabouts)</li>
            <li>I now easily fork out the $85 every few months for a full-size tube.</li>
            <li>There is also a gentle version of this product for those with extra sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider my skin sensitive but this stuff felt like sulfuric acid immediately after putting it on.</li>
            <li>Even the samples aren&#x27;t cheap on ebay (cheaper than on Amazon for the .25 ounce sampler size if you want to give this a whirl before you make a heavy investment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Upon rinsing it off my skin is pink, but a healthy pink and not red.  </li>
            <li>My skin is definitely MUCH clearer, my pores are smaller looking, and I can wear no or little makeup with confidence for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>This stuff rocks, it works like no other and makes your skin glowy and dewy, like peaches and cream.</li>
            <li>Exfolikate performs like no other product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and silky, and pores are smaller after every application.</li>
            <li>I washed it off as soon as I applied it all over, and I still have an inflamed burn mark on my chin the next morning as well as a slightly sensitive feeling, sore face.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s safer for the environment and safer for us - especially as they are a company that seems to pride itself on its use of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I barely have any breakouts anymore, so I will stick with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I do agree with other reviewers and think that $85 is a bit much for any exfoliator.</li>
            <li>First of all, you only need a tiny bit of the product for each use, so one tube will last a VERY long time.</li>

            <li> and i live it on for 5 minutes or less</li>
            <li> I definitely hesitated to buy this because of the price, but you honestly do not have to use very much at all, so it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> what a clean face afterwards, I mean just takes the dead skin off</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time at once per week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with skin issues like adult acne, uneven skin, and a touch of redness on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I have MILDLY sensitive skin and this product is too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin and it makes the flakes vanish.</li>
            <li> You only need a little to do the treatment</li>
            <li> Judging by the chemical burn on my chin, I can&#x27;t even imagine the damage that would have been done if I&#x27;d left it on my face for longer than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is green and gritty in texture.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot leave it on for very long, usually for about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> It uses fruit enzymes to remove the dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> And I have sensitive skin so typically am unable to use these types of products.</li>
            <li> I was just a little astonished at the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several samples of this over the last year or two, and always was disappointed when it was gone.  </li>
            <li> I like scrubs, things that exfoilate ( I am in my late 50&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> I use a much less expensive exfoliation cream during the week, but on Saturday night, it&#x27;s all up to Kate!  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m shocked this is even on the market.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am a bit disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great treatment for your face. I use it once a week (instead of 2-3 as directed). My skin is soft and silky, and pores are smaller after every application. Love the product. Been using it for 1-1/2 yrs.</li>
            <li> Got this as a sample when ordering some stuff from sephora and after just one use my face felt amazing.  My face was soft and smooth.  A bit pricey. But worth it to me!!!</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully!  My face is in much better condition and it&#x27;s softer than a baby&#x27;s butt!  The cost is an issue, but if you buy four .5 ounces bottles (2 ounces total)at $19 ($76 total) versus the $85 for the 2 ounce bottle - you get the same quantity but save yourself $9.  It doesn&#x27;t work if you try to buy the largest quantity though.  Buy the smallest bottle and give it a try!  It burns for a short while but you only keep it on thirty seconds so it&#x27;s very tolerable.  The results are well worth it!</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is on of the best I have ever used. There are so many amazing ingredients in it that work together to make your skin gorgeous! Each time I use it, I can both see the difference and feel this difference. It is like waxing and polishing for your skin! I wrote a review on my blog about this product with more details about what it does and how it helps :) Feel free to read and comment!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I became hooked on [[ASIN:B001ZT7ZEE Exfolikate]] when I received a free sample through a Sephora purchase. I now easily fork out the $85 every few months for a full-size tube. It smells heavenly, and my skin has never looked better. I live in a desert climate, and I&#x27;m 40, but think I have the skin of a 30 year old (or thereabouts).... I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this product. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I work for a different high end cosmetic line and after many of my coworkers said to try it I did and I love it! I recommend Exfolikate over everything else! You have to use it in the shower or with steam and it helps activate it! WOW what a clean face afterwards, I mean just takes the dead skin off it&#x27;s amazing, worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers and think that $85 is a bit much for any exfoliator. Hovever, if you have the money, I definitely suggest splurging on this product. ExfoliKate is amazing. First of all, you only need a tiny bit of the product for each use, so one tube will last a VERY long time. This is a quick and painless exfoliator that smells great and doesn&#x27;t cause any burning or severe redness. My face looks fresher after every use. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider my skin sensitive but this stuff felt like sulfuric acid immediately after putting it on. Massage for 30 seconds? I washed it off as soon as I applied it all over, and I still have an inflamed burn mark on my chin the next morning as well as a slightly sensitive feeling, sore face. Judging by the chemical burn on my chin, I can&#x27;t even imagine the damage that would have been done if I&#x27;d left it on my face for longer than a few seconds. There&#x27;s no way in he-l-l I&#x27;d put this on my face again. And - in the morning, my face was oilier than it&#x27;s ever been in my life, even when i was a teenager; and I applied moisturizer as soon as it was rinsed off. Back this goes. If you don&#x27;t have leather for skin already I highly recommend you DON&#x27;T even try this product.  Seriously, I&#x27;m shocked this is even on the market.</li>
            <li> I loved this product but have just discovered it contains plastic microbeads (listed as Polyethylene) which are polluting our water supply and food chain.  NY state is attempting to ban products with microbeads and hopefully they will be successful.  There are many equivalent alternatives such as walnut shell, salt and sugar.  I hope that KS will reformulate the product so it&#x27;s safer for the environment and safer for us - especially as they are a company that seems to pride itself on its use of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have good skin, and I try just about every skin treatment product to keep it that way. A friend suggested I give Kate Someville&#x27;s ExfoliKate a try...I was just a little astonished at the price! Even the samples aren&#x27;t cheap on ebay (cheaper than on Amazon for the .25 ounce sampler size if you want to give this a whirl before you make a heavy investment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can see why! This has to be the fastest and most potent skin care product I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes out as a pretty malachite green, with a nice, fresh smell. You massage it onto clean, wet skin, and the directions said to let it sit for up to two minutes. It feels a little warm, but not unduly so; there are those little microbeads so many skin treatments have nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is hardy, so I let it stay on my skin for five minutes before I rinsed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow...just wow! My skin looks phenomenal, and it feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was weighing buying a Clarisonic, but after this treatment, I can&#x27;t see how my skin could better! I&#x27;m going to invest in the big tube - I can see ExfoliKate has earned a permanent place on my beauty treatment shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen to what people are telling you; this really is THAT good.</li>
            <li> THIS product is great if you have combination skin, uneven skin tone and discoloration, is intensive so don&#x27;t use it if you have very sensitive skin. i get all my beauty products at the drug store, not a big spender, but this product is worth the price tag, I put it once I week, my skin is soft,even and glowing I look rested and relaxed, give it a try it might work for you.</li>
            <li> I love this exfolikate!  It works well everytime.  The best I have ever used.  Worth the price.  You only need a little to do the treatment so it lasts a long time at once per week.</li>
            <li> Exfolikate works very well for me. I have dry flaky skin and it makes the flakes vanish. just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricy.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a glowing older women in the skin stuff store.  I bought it and was wowed by the results, no scrubbing needed, it quickly disolved all the dead skin leaving skin as smooth as the the back of my forearm.  But, for $85 plus 10% sales tax in SCamafornia, I returned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several samples of this over the last year or two, and always was disappointed when it was gone.  I definitely hesitated to buy this because of the price, but you honestly do not have to use very much at all, so it lasts a very long time.  I&#x27;ve struggled with skin issues like adult acne, uneven skin, and a touch of redness on my cheeks.  After years of experimenting, I&#x27;ve finally found the regimen that works for me: Philosophy Purity w/ Clarisonic brush every night, Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash in the morning, and this once a week.  My skin is definitely MUCH clearer, my pores are smaller looking, and I can wear no or little makeup with confidence for the first time in my life.  I barely have any breakouts anymore, so I will stick with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving a review for this product even though I purchased it on Sephora (however Sephora will NOT publish my 1 star review).  I received a sample of this product and gave it a try.  I have MILDLY sensitive skin and this product is too harsh.  It literally burns.  I couldn&#x27;t even leave it on for the recommended amount of time for this reason.  My skin did look great after I washed it off, however I can&#x27;t justify the price or the pain to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks, it works like no other and makes your skin glowy and dewy, like peaches and cream. I love Kate Somerville &amp; Kate Spade. I think it&#x27;s the Kate Season.</li>
            <li> I am well aware of the necessity of good exfoliation when taking good care of your skin.  I thought I was using a good product, but when I was given the chance to try ExfoliKate at a reduced price, I thought, why not?  One try was all I needed to experience the difference.  Exfolikate performs like no other product.  It uses a 2-pronged technology.  It is both a chemical exfoliation as well as using tiny solid beads for topical exfoliation.  Upon trying it the first time, I experienced what I called a burning sensation that was quite strong.  I felt that it might be prohibitive for that reason. However, I talked with others who used it all the time, and they convinced me that with continued use, I wouldn&#x27;t notice the burning, but I would notice a better job of exfoliation with each use.  They were right.  I am still using it once a week even though it costs more than most people want to pay.  That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t use it daily.  I use a much less expensive exfoliation cream during the week, but on Saturday night, it&#x27;s all up to Kate!  And after I&#x27;ve finished the process, my skin not only feels great, but looks great too.</li>
            <li> I just had to try this, I kept buying the 0.5 size and finally decided to go for the bigger one.  I like scrubs, things that exfoilate ( I am in my late 50&#x27;s).  This does a great job, although it is pricey, a little goes a long way.  You just feel like it is really working and I kind of like the smell of it (some people objected to it).  I am very fair (blonde) but it is not too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> I guess I must have an addiction to exfoliators because there are so many that I really like.  This ExfoliKate was one of the first ones that I really liked back when it was actually called Kate in a Jar.  This exfoliator is green and gritty in texture.  It is both a chemical and manual peel exfoliator.  It uses fruit enzymes to remove the dead skin cells.  It is a little pricey in my opinion but the performance is top of the line.  I do have sensitive skin so I cannot leave it on for very long, usually for about 30 seconds.  Upon rinsing it off my skin is pink, but a healthy pink and not red.  My skin has a healthy glow afterward.  There is also a gentle version of this product for those with extra sensitive skin.  I am including a photo of ExfoliKate on the back of my hand so you can see what it looks like.  The second photo is sort of a before and after.  The hand on the left is without ExfoliKate and the hand on the right is the one I put ExfoliKate on.  You can see a glow on my right hand from the ExfoliKate.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this forever and I am a beauty junkie.  I have to say I am a bit disappointed.  It feels like it is working, meaning it gets warm (burns), but after 3 weeks I do not notice any difference.  I am in my 30s and have combination skin.  I really wish I knew what others were seeing, I don&#x27;t even feel my face is smoother.  I thought this would be perfect for me but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This product really felt like it was working (tingly) and my face was very smooth after my first use. I am acne prone and this product did not have an adverse affect on my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Really works! And I have sensitive skin so typically am unable to use these types of products. Great!</li>
            <li> My skin feels alot softer. I love the way it feels  it feels very soft and smooth like a babies face.  and i live it on for 5 minutes or less&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iam very happy with the product</li>
