            <li>Axe Waterless Foam Shampoo keeps your hair looking good and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Sure, a shower is the best option, of course, but if you can&#x27;t have one of those then this will do fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fallen in love!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s appropriate for both genders!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, lifts the dirt and oils out and leaves my hair with that great Axe smell.</li>
            <li>Plus it also acts as a kind of styling mousse too.  </li>
            <li>No need to wash or re-shower in the am, (which to be honest</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and manly though.</li>
            <li>I got this for my son, and he liked it.  </li>
            <li>To each his own.  </li>
            <li>I think it does a nice job.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, but noticeable.</li>
            <li>The foam has a pleasant smell and is easily applied, but still leaves your hair feeling more greasy than clean.</li>
            <li>It smell ok</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Meh I could&#x27;ve been better</li>
            <li>It does kind of leave a light, sticky feeling residue too on you hands and in your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not overly impressed, but considering how short I tend to keep my hair</li>
            <li>It not only smells wonderful</li>
            <li>I love most, if not all,</li>
            <li>What I like the most is the fragrance that it leaves.  </li>
            <li>If you love the Ax smell</li>
            <li>When I can&#x27;t make it to a shower, it&#x27;s a much better option than throwing on a baseball cap.  </li>
            <li>Ok so i have to admit I did not think this would work.</li>
            <li>I love an AM shower to wake up but don&#x27;t always have time).</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>So, this may work okay for one day, but even then, my hair did not look like I had washed it, so your friends or colleagues will probably be able to tell.  </li>
            <li>most people, though, the product will be just what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>The smell is to potent to be pleasing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a guy scent</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is kind of slimy and the results do not appear to be clean</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo works wonderfully to get your hair as close to out of the shower as you can get without taking one.</li>
            <li>I have found that Axe waterless dry shampoo is the perfect alternative.</li>
            <li>Once I did it made my hair look better and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>A very good product to take camping, if short on water for some reason, or just a refresh between shampoos.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t quite as good as a shampoo, but it&#x27;s really close.  </li>
            <li>I loved the idea of of Waterless Shampoo but the smell was too much</li>
            <li>The foam stays in the hand and goes in easily along the roots.</li>
            <li>The product comes out as a foam and goes into the hair easily.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say for sure that my hair isn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li>Axe products on people even though they tend to be a bit on the strong side.  </li>
            <li>It might be good in a pinch, but not a regular kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice, I remember when Axe first came out and the smell was so strong it was obnoxious.</li>
            <li>It works fine as a waterless shampoo but does not come close to shampooing ones hair in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also though acts like a light styling mousse as well.</li>
            <li>because the smell does, fortunately, reduce as it dries.  </li>
            <li>The product works great, the issue with this is that when it was sent the pump didn&#x27;t work properly.  </li>
            <li>So it spreads through my hair and dissolves quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a unique product that does what it advertises.</li>
            <li>Other Axe hair products have a more pleasant level of smell, in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it seems to clean your hair just by rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>A million years ago there was a product called \\&quot;Psssst\\&quot; (hence the title) which was supposed to do what this product does - clean your hair in between shampoos.</li>
            <li>Works in well and doesn&#x27;t feel oily but it just doesnt give me that clean feeling..</li>
            <li>Not as well as taking a shower and washing my hair does, but good enough to go out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are one of the cool dudes who dyes their hair all of those funky colors it should help with preserving those</li>
            <li>I figured this would be good if I was in a hurry and did not have a chance to wash my hair or if I wanted to put something on my hair in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>used it couple of time when I did&#x27;nt have the time for a shower/hairwash, and it seemed to work pretty good, but it&#x27;s no substitute for the real thing (a real shower and hairwash).</li>
            <li>I have oily hair and it can get oily looking really quickly.  </li>
            <li>&quot; my hair, eliminating bedhead, and lets me quickly get out the door.</li>
            <li>This has a mild scent which I</li>
            <li>The product is ok, it made my hair look and smell clean, my hair also felt really soft too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a surprise meeting, quick date night, or just feeling less grody when you have to run into the shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rated Axe Waterless dry shampoo foam reset 3 stars because it does smell good but the hair doesn&#x27;t look like you just washed it.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a foam not the spray on powder, it dries better without the powdery residue so many of the dry shampoos have.</li>
            <li>product is a nice soft foam that goes on damp and then dries up fast as you run a brush or your hands through it.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, he did say it made his hair smell good.  </li>
            <li>I know all Axe products contain scent, but most are less overwhelming than this item.  </li>
            <li>My hair did start to clump up around 2 hours after first using it.</li>
            <li>and it worked until he was able get back in the shower.</li>
            <li>Thanks Axe!</li>
            <li>Simply apply the foam to your hand, rub it through your hair, and it will make your hair smell better and look cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>And no weird residue on my hands when I touched it.  </li>
            <li>But I wouldnt suggest more than one day of use before your next shampoo.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair sticky and groty which isnt exactly what i want.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I figured this would be a messy foam, but surprisingly it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>this is a foam/mousse \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shampoo for a quick touch up when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full shampoo, or don&#x27;t have access to a shower right then, or have a specific style you keep.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice product to keep around if you want to freshen up and look sharp.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair (and me) feel fresh when don&#x27;t have time for a shower and the fragrance is ok although I wish it had no fragrance so that it wouldn&#x27;t compete with all of the other fragrances in products</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Dry Shampoo - and to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It has the same consistency as mousse and a rather strong scent.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not saying much, though.</li>
            <li>It does let you \\&quot;reset\\&quot; your hair to a degree, depending on how much stuff you put beforehand.  </li>
            <li>you really don&#x27;t want on your head anyways</li>
            <li>I tried it and it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i know people who regularly use dry shampoos on clean hair, just to have more body and texture.  </li>
            <li>but this seems like a reasonable alternative if you don&#x27;t have the time to do so.</li>
            <li>unlike most powder-based dry shampoos, however, it does not dull your hair or leave a lot of residue.</li>
            <li>I mean sure it smells clean</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this is a fault of the actual product though because it&#x27;s probably just my preference of what is clean and what isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like it does when I just get out of the shower with a normal shampoo...</li>
            <li>As a last resort after a rough night, I could see this coming in handy.</li>
            <li>Luckily I still had my last bottle and just swapped the pumps</li>
            <li>particular bottle was broken&lt;br /&gt;could</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel like real shower clean but does the job for limited time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had roommates and friends with long hair, so I am somewhat familiar with the greasy look it can get over time.  </li>
            <li>Overall, not bad it does work in a pinch, I personally like better over dry shampoo spray.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to replace your normal shampooing</li>
            <li>Overall, I don&#x27;t think this waterless shampoo useful at all.</li>
            <li>My hair didnt look greasy or sticky, just normal.</li>
            <li>think it works better than the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shampoos that are all sprays like hairspray and make my hair heavy with buildup</li>
            <li>It will probably suit most people; however, if you were looking into dry shampoos for the sole purpose of taking care of extra oily hair, a stronger dry shampoo would be a better</li>
            <li>The Axe worked fine on both, making his hair look less oily and just making mine look pretty much the same as always.</li>
            <li>Though it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a wash, it&#x27;s infinitely better than the standard compressed powder dry shampoos!</li>
            <li>I am new to waterless shampoos.  </li>
            <li>It only seemed useful if my hair was \\&quot;naturally dirty\\</li>
            <li>but I assume this was geared more towards people with short hair with the wet style.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not really sure this is any better than applying baby powder to your hands, spreading it and rubbing it over your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of waterless \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shampoos in general, but I have to say this Axe foam is a little better than the others I&#x27;ve had the misfortune of trying.</li>
            <li>if you use dry shampoos at all, this is definitely worth trying-</li>
            <li>If I did three pumps or more, that was too much, with my entire head getting a flat, wet look that made me look</li>
            <li>what this does do, is give your hair a quick lift, fresh scent, and a non-greasy appearance, like other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>Pure and simple.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your hair look almost as clean as if you did, without weighing it down or looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Even that isn&#x27;t really for my hair, it&#x27;s mainly for dry skin</li>
            <li>Also, since it it so short I don&#x27;t really use any sort of styling products.  </li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t completely remove all the oil and it also made my hair sticky (like a hair gel).</li>
            <li>product promises to \\&quot;refresh hair by eliminating oil between regular washes,\\&quot; and depending on your needs the product works very well.</li>
            <li>I guess if you don&#x27;t have time for a traditional shower and hairwash, this product give it a  gentle cleaning without one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work as well as any old shampoo</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously nothing can beat shampooing with real water and regular shampoo</li>
            <li>My hair definitely felt heavier after the application and my hair looked unwashed for sure (clumpy and heavy).  </li>
            <li>This is the first dry foam shampoo I have, others I tried are \\&quot;spray\\&quot; version which seem to work</li>
            <li>It takes very little for my hair to start to look like it needs some upkeep, and although I know most people say you shouldn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ve found I have to wash it nearly daily</li>
            <li>My son has long hair and sometimes after a long day he wants his hair clean but doesn&#x27;t want to have to take forever to dry it before bed.</li>
            <li>He has long hair, and instead of keeping it clean between washes, which is what he expected, it made it gunky and oilier.  </li>
            <li>and even then I&#x27;m not sure exactly how much it helped.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to say exactly how useful it is since it doesn&#x27;t do any heavy-duty cleaning like regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Take a shower if at all possible to avoid the horrors of dealing with dry shampoos--but if you absolutely positively need one for emergencies, this will work.</li>
            <li>His hair type is normal, with dry ends, so</li>
            <li>So at least you would smell clean.</li>
            <li>This stuff seams to not work very well for me, When used it leaves my hair with a wet style look to it afterwards even several hours after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset is for those days when you can&#x27;t hit the shower before heading out the door for another busy day.</li>

            <li> Axe products on people even though they tend to be a bit on the strong side.  </li>
            <li> It might be good in a pinch, but not a regular kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice, I remember when Axe first came out and the smell was so strong it was obnoxious.</li>
            <li> It works fine as a waterless shampoo but does not come close to shampooing ones hair in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also though acts like a light styling mousse as well.</li>
            <li> because the smell does, fortunately, reduce as it dries.  </li>
            <li> The product works great, the issue with this is that when it was sent the pump didn&#x27;t work properly.  </li>
            <li> So it spreads through my hair and dissolves quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a unique product that does what it advertises.</li>
            <li> Other Axe hair products have a more pleasant level of smell, in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it seems to clean your hair just by rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> A million years ago there was a product called \\&quot;Psssst\\&quot; (hence the title) which was supposed to do what this product does - clean your hair in between shampoos.</li>
            <li> Works in well and doesn&#x27;t feel oily but it just doesnt give me that clean feeling..</li>
            <li> Not as well as taking a shower and washing my hair does, but good enough to go out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are one of the cool dudes who dyes their hair all of those funky colors it should help with preserving those</li>
            <li> I figured this would be good if I was in a hurry and did not have a chance to wash my hair or if I wanted to put something on my hair in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> used it couple of time when I did&#x27;nt have the time for a shower/hairwash, and it seemed to work pretty good, but it&#x27;s no substitute for the real thing (a real shower and hairwash).</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and it can get oily looking really quickly.  </li>
            <li> &quot; my hair, eliminating bedhead, and lets me quickly get out the door.</li>
            <li> This has a mild scent which I</li>
            <li> The product is ok, it made my hair look and smell clean, my hair also felt really soft too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a surprise meeting, quick date night, or just feeling less grody when you have to run into the shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rated Axe Waterless dry shampoo foam reset 3 stars because it does smell good but the hair doesn&#x27;t look like you just washed it.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a foam not the spray on powder, it dries better without the powdery residue so many of the dry shampoos have.</li>
            <li> product is a nice soft foam that goes on damp and then dries up fast as you run a brush or your hands through it.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, he did say it made his hair smell good.  </li>
            <li> I know all Axe products contain scent, but most are less overwhelming than this item.  </li>
            <li> My hair did start to clump up around 2 hours after first using it.</li>
            <li> and it worked until he was able get back in the shower.</li>
            <li> Thanks Axe!</li>
            <li> Simply apply the foam to your hand, rub it through your hair, and it will make your hair smell better and look cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> And no weird residue on my hands when I touched it.  </li>
            <li> But I wouldnt suggest more than one day of use before your next shampoo.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair sticky and groty which isnt exactly what i want.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I figured this would be a messy foam, but surprisingly it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> this is a foam/mousse \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shampoo for a quick touch up when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full shampoo, or don&#x27;t have access to a shower right then, or have a specific style you keep.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice product to keep around if you want to freshen up and look sharp.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair (and me) feel fresh when don&#x27;t have time for a shower and the fragrance is ok although I wish it had no fragrance so that it wouldn&#x27;t compete with all of the other fragrances in products</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Dry Shampoo - and to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> It has the same consistency as mousse and a rather strong scent.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not saying much, though.</li>
            <li> It does let you \\&quot;reset\\&quot; your hair to a degree, depending on how much stuff you put beforehand.  </li>
            <li> you really don&#x27;t want on your head anyways</li>
            <li> I tried it and it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i know people who regularly use dry shampoos on clean hair, just to have more body and texture.  </li>
            <li> but this seems like a reasonable alternative if you don&#x27;t have the time to do so.</li>
            <li> unlike most powder-based dry shampoos, however, it does not dull your hair or leave a lot of residue.</li>
            <li> I mean sure it smells clean</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is a fault of the actual product though because it&#x27;s probably just my preference of what is clean and what isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like it does when I just get out of the shower with a normal shampoo...</li>
            <li> As a last resort after a rough night, I could see this coming in handy.</li>
            <li> Luckily I still had my last bottle and just swapped the pumps</li>
            <li> particular bottle was broken&lt;br /&gt;could</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like real shower clean but does the job for limited time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had roommates and friends with long hair, so I am somewhat familiar with the greasy look it can get over time.  </li>
            <li> Overall, not bad it does work in a pinch, I personally like better over dry shampoo spray.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to replace your normal shampooing</li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t think this waterless shampoo useful at all.</li>
            <li> My hair didnt look greasy or sticky, just normal.</li>
            <li> think it works better than the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shampoos that are all sprays like hairspray and make my hair heavy with buildup</li>
            <li> It will probably suit most people; however, if you were looking into dry shampoos for the sole purpose of taking care of extra oily hair, a stronger dry shampoo would be a better</li>
            <li> The Axe worked fine on both, making his hair look less oily and just making mine look pretty much the same as always.</li>
            <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a wash, it&#x27;s infinitely better than the standard compressed powder dry shampoos!</li>
            <li> I am new to waterless shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It only seemed useful if my hair was \\&quot;naturally dirty\\</li>
            <li> but I assume this was geared more towards people with short hair with the wet style.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not really sure this is any better than applying baby powder to your hands, spreading it and rubbing it over your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of waterless \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shampoos in general, but I have to say this Axe foam is a little better than the others I&#x27;ve had the misfortune of trying.</li>
            <li> if you use dry shampoos at all, this is definitely worth trying-</li>
            <li> If I did three pumps or more, that was too much, with my entire head getting a flat, wet look that made me look</li>
            <li> what this does do, is give your hair a quick lift, fresh scent, and a non-greasy appearance, like other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Pure and simple.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair look almost as clean as if you did, without weighing it down or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Even that isn&#x27;t really for my hair, it&#x27;s mainly for dry skin</li>
            <li> Also, since it it so short I don&#x27;t really use any sort of styling products.  </li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t completely remove all the oil and it also made my hair sticky (like a hair gel).</li>
            <li> product promises to \\&quot;refresh hair by eliminating oil between regular washes,\\&quot; and depending on your needs the product works very well.</li>
            <li> I guess if you don&#x27;t have time for a traditional shower and hairwash, this product give it a  gentle cleaning without one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work as well as any old shampoo</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously nothing can beat shampooing with real water and regular shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair definitely felt heavier after the application and my hair looked unwashed for sure (clumpy and heavy).  </li>
            <li> This is the first dry foam shampoo I have, others I tried are \\&quot;spray\\&quot; version which seem to work</li>
            <li> It takes very little for my hair to start to look like it needs some upkeep, and although I know most people say you shouldn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ve found I have to wash it nearly daily</li>
            <li> My son has long hair and sometimes after a long day he wants his hair clean but doesn&#x27;t want to have to take forever to dry it before bed.</li>
            <li> He has long hair, and instead of keeping it clean between washes, which is what he expected, it made it gunky and oilier.  </li>
            <li> and even then I&#x27;m not sure exactly how much it helped.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to say exactly how useful it is since it doesn&#x27;t do any heavy-duty cleaning like regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Take a shower if at all possible to avoid the horrors of dealing with dry shampoos--but if you absolutely positively need one for emergencies, this will work.</li>
            <li> His hair type is normal, with dry ends, so</li>
            <li> So at least you would smell clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff seams to not work very well for me, When used it leaves my hair with a wet style look to it afterwards even several hours after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset is for those days when you can&#x27;t hit the shower before heading out the door for another busy day.</li>
            <li> You end up being left with a subtle, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> The foam goes on wet and made my hair look really wet, but once it dries, quickly, and you style your hair as usual</li>
            <li> my hair starts getting long (for me), I start getting bed head; flat spots and spots that stick up.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s now just a little masculine, spicy, and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Son</li>
            <li> long</li>
            <li> It breaks down not only the greasiness from a long day in a hot room, and salt spray that I use to get it some semblance of style, but it also returns the shine and smoothness that my hair loses around the chemicals in my studio (spray-based fixative, adhesives, paints, etc).</li>
            <li> I applied one to each side of my head and a third down the middle and bingo...</li>
            <li> For those who like to shower at night and don&#x27;t want to wet your hair (or reshower) in the morning, Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset is definitely something you should try.</li>
            <li> / dry</li>
            <li> tends to have oily hair, mine is dry.</li>
            <li> After brushing it out neither of us had a residue feeling or that dander dry shampoos sometimes produce.</li>
            <li> I had heard of dry shampoos before.</li>
            <li> This Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset is not your grandma&#x27;s waterless shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you want a dry shampoo, get batiste instead of this.</li>
            <li> This waterless dry shampoo claims it can remove the oil on the hair without water.</li>
            <li> like the Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter that I&#x27;m a woman because the scent does die down after a short time.  </li>
            <li> Dry Shampoo for when you just can&#x27;t wash!</li>
            <li> When I saw this come up on Vine, I was curious.  </li>
            <li> product never really cut it for me.</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t want to walk around looking like I just wrestled someone in a wet McDonald&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li> Whatever the case, this product was not very helpful at all.</li>
            <li> A bit greasy or wet looking.</li>
            <li> so you can skip a few proper washes.</li>
            <li> I have found that two pumps were never enough, leaving part of my hair with a slick, matted appearance, while the rest seemed dry and stuck out.</li>
            <li> I do not notice the greasiness that some other reviewers have reported.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for regular use, but it works as an emergency measure when you need a shampoo but don&#x27;t have access to the usual facilities.</li>
            <li> the average guy</li>
            <li> Odd stuff this is.  </li>
            <li> It is typically about .5 inch or less.  </li>
            <li> I usually then cup some water in my hands, wet my hair, and try to put it in position.</li>
            <li> ; not clean, but under control.  </li>
            <li> Maybe you flew in on a red eye, or partied too hard and slept in and need to go to work late, or who knows what, we&#x27;ve all had days like that.</li>
            <li> If you apple too much, it looks dirty.</li>
            <li> Not terribly strong, but it is persistent.  </li>
            <li> When I tried it in the morning after sleeping on my hair with gel in it, my hair still had normal body and shine and didn&#x27;t feel dirty or greasy.</li>
            <li> The Axe waterless dry shampoo is a life saver on those mornings when we are running behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure  how this works</li>
            <li> I found I needed usually three tabs of this.</li>
            <li> Not sure that this product is intended to help you through two days, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This might mean my thin, unruly locks will never be suited to a \\&quot;waterless dry shampoo foam.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> If you have teens you know that getting them out of bed and to school in the morning can be hard.</li>
            <li> It seems to mask the dirty hair look with a bit of shine and some extra control.  </li>
            <li> If your afican ammerican with a thick hair type, this my not work so well.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is often oily.</li>
            <li> Simply put, I hate it.  </li>
            <li> This leaves me with really bad bed head in the morning and usually requires another shower to \\&quot;control\\&quot; my hair.</li>
            <li> The results are mediocre.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought it for himself when his work schedule gets crazy, but I find myself addicted to it!</li>
            <li> I used to think about using one as a way to get some of the road dust and \\&quot;shumtz\\&quot; out of my hair during periods that washing my hair was difficult or just impossible.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d say this is a temporary solution, since your hair is still going to be dirty.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel dirty, or like it harms the hair</li>
            <li> and you need a product to cover up a bad body odor</li>
            <li> I hate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It has the same consistency as mousse and a rather strong scent.  So it spreads through my hair and dissolves quickly and easily.  It wasn&#x27;t helpful if I had gel or hairspray in my hair because it doesn&#x27;t get those chemicals out.  It only seemed useful if my hair was \\&quot;naturally dirty\\&quot; and even then I&#x27;m not sure exactly how much it helped.  It smell ok but it&#x27;s hard to say exactly how useful it is since it doesn&#x27;t do any heavy-duty cleaning like regular shampoo.  I guess in a pinch it&#x27;s ok but I still prefer a regular shampoo any day.</li>
            <li> Odd stuff this is.  Good in a pinch, or in a hurry.  Plus it also acts as a kind of styling mousse too.  Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> If your afican ammerican with a thick hair type, this my not work so well.</li>
            <li> Meh I could&#x27;ve been better</li>
            <li> The product is ok, it made my hair look and smell clean, my hair also felt really soft too. It also though acts like a light styling mousse as well. I massaged the foam on my head for about 45 seconds before the foam starts to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;. You might need to wash you hands after wards too. It does kind of leave a light, sticky feeling residue too on you hands and in your hair. I&#x27;m not a fan of that part. My hair did start to clump up around 2 hours after first using it. Another 2 pumps did the trick again until I could traditionally wash my hair with water and shampoo. Overall, not bad it does work in a pinch, I personally like better over dry shampoo spray.</li>
            <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a wash, it&#x27;s infinitely better than the standard compressed powder dry shampoos! My boyfriend bought it for himself when his work schedule gets crazy, but I find myself addicted to it! It breaks down not only the greasiness from a long day in a hot room, and salt spray that I use to get it some semblance of style, but it also returns the shine and smoothness that my hair loses around the chemicals in my studio (spray-based fixative, adhesives, paints, etc). It&#x27;s great for a surprise meeting, quick date night, or just feeling less grody when you have to run into the shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus-it smells AMAZING! It has a very light scent, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> Bought it before eye surgery, came in very handy after eye operation where you are not allowed to go into a shower.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like real shower clean but does the job for limited time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure  how this works but it seems to clean your hair just by rubbing it in. It is a foam that is supposed to help remove grease and oil without a shower. My hair did feel cleaner after using it. I think this would be great for camping where you don&#x27;t have access to a shower. A great product but would only use occasionally I&#x27;ve still got to take a shower but it would be great if rushed. Nice clean smell also. So at least you would smell clean.</li>
            <li> I rated Axe Waterless dry shampoo foam reset 3 stars because it does smell good but the hair doesn&#x27;t look like you just washed it. If you apple too much, it looks dirty. This is the first dry foam shampoo I have, others I tried are \\&quot;spray\\&quot; version which seem to work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not really sure this is any better than applying baby powder to your hands, spreading it and rubbing it over your hair.</li>
            <li> When I saw this come up on Vine, I was curious.  How in the heck does waterless shampoo work?  Does it work?  So, I asked to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying I keep my hair very short.  It is typically about .5 inch or less.  I&#x27;ve had roommates and friends with long hair, so I am somewhat familiar with the greasy look it can get over time.  My hair never gets to that level.  Also, since it it so short I don&#x27;t really use any sort of styling products.  The closest thing to a styling product I use is a leave-in conditioner periodically.  Even that isn&#x27;t really for my hair, it&#x27;s mainly for dry skin / dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I gave it a shot.  It comes out as a white foam very similar to mousse.  Same application method too: rub it together in your hands then rub it through your hair.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel crunchy after using this though, unlike when using some styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair starts getting long (for me), I start getting bed head; flat spots and spots that stick up.  Using this did help deal with bed head.  Not as well as taking a shower and washing my hair does, but good enough to go out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a scent.  Not terribly strong, but it is persistent.  It lasts almost the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does appear to do what it says it should.  I&#x27;m not overly impressed, but considering how short I tend to keep my hair I don&#x27;t think I am the target.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is often oily. If you have a different set of follicles, you might want to read a different review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product never really cut it for me. It recommends using two pumps of the foam, which you are supposed to work through your hair before \\&quot;styling\\&quot; it. I have found that two pumps were never enough, leaving part of my hair with a slick, matted appearance, while the rest seemed dry and stuck out. If I did three pumps or more, that was too much, with my entire head getting a flat, wet look that made me look I&#x27;d just exited a swimming pool without bothering to run a towel over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I have fickle hair. It takes very little for my hair to start to look like it needs some upkeep, and although I know most people say you shouldn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ve found I have to wash it nearly daily if I don&#x27;t want to walk around looking like I just wrestled someone in a wet McDonald&#x27;s bathroom. This might mean my thin, unruly locks will never be suited to a \\&quot;waterless dry shampoo foam.\\&quot; Whatever the case, this product was not very helpful at all.</li>
            <li> Dry Shampoo for when you just can&#x27;t wash! This stuff makes your hair look almost as clean as if you did, without weighing it down or looking greasy. Definitely recommended for when you just can&#x27;t wash your hair!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset. I ordered it for my son who had knee surgery and it worked until he was able get back in the shower. I&#x27;ve read all the reviews and think this: Maybe those who are criticizing this product do not have the hair type it is made for and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to replace your normal shampooing, just get you through a bind. If you have had some sort of surgery or condition that is keeping you from dunking your head in a basin or taking a shower, this product is a Life-Saver! Pure and simple.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need to freshen my hair but don&#x27;t have time for a shampoo in the middle of the day.  I have oily hair and it can get oily looking really quickly.  This is a great product in between shampoos.  The foam goes on wet and made my hair look really wet, but once it dries, quickly, and you style your hair as usual it looks great.  It isn&#x27;t quite as good as a shampoo, but it&#x27;s really close.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of taking showers and washing my hair 100 times a week.  Simply put, I hate it.  I know Axe products are for me.  Oh well!  I thought I&#x27;d try this anyway.  I&#x27;ve fallen in love!  It not only smells wonderful it works well.  I love most, if not all, Axe products on people even though they tend to be a bit on the strong side.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that I&#x27;m a woman because the scent does die down after a short time.  You end up being left with a subtle, fresh scent.  Buy it for a man or a woman...it&#x27;s appropriate for both genders!</li>
            <li> If you have teens you know that getting them out of bed and to school in the morning can be hard. The Axe waterless dry shampoo is a life saver on those mornings when we are running behind. It is quick and easy to use. It does give the hair a washed look. I would not recommend using it 2 days in a row (you need to shower at some point) but in an \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of waterless \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shampoos in general, but I have to say this Axe foam is a little better than the others I&#x27;ve had the misfortune of trying. That&#x27;s not saying much, though. The foam has a pleasant smell and is easily applied, but still leaves your hair feeling more greasy than clean. As a last resort after a rough night, I could see this coming in handy. For regular use, I would definitely not recommend it. Take a shower if at all possible to avoid the horrors of dealing with dry shampoos--but if you absolutely positively need one for emergencies, this will work.</li>
            <li> My son has long hair and sometimes after a long day he wants his hair clean but doesn&#x27;t want to have to take forever to dry it before bed. We both tried this product. The foam stays in the hand and goes in easily along the roots. The smell is nice, I remember when Axe first came out and the smell was so strong it was obnoxious. The manufacturer seems to have cut back on the strength of the scent so it&#x27;s now just a little masculine, spicy, and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Son tends to have oily hair, mine is dry. The Axe worked fine on both, making his hair look less oily and just making mine look pretty much the same as always. After brushing it out neither of us had a residue feeling or that dander dry shampoos sometimes produce. A very good product to take camping, if short on water for some reason, or just a refresh between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I figured this would be a messy foam, but surprisingly it isn&#x27;t.  The texture is very similar to mousse.  It goes into your hair and disappears as you massage it into your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t even leave your hands that sticky as it wears out.  What I like the most is the fragrance that it leaves.  It is very pleasant smell that reminds you of a shampoo.  It does let you \\&quot;reset\\&quot; your hair to a degree, depending on how much stuff you put beforehand.  Make no mistake--this is not a replacement for hair washing, but it will let you avoid water when you can&#x27;t shower/wash hair at that moment.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of of Waterless Shampoo but the smell was too much and I had wash it out after about hour. If you love the Axe smell this would be perfect.  If you love the Ax smell and you need a product to cover up a bad body odor this would be the perfect item.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t take a shower for whatever reason? No worries! This dry shampoo works wonderfully to get your hair as close to out of the shower as you can get without taking one.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Dry Shampoo - and to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.  This works perfectly in a pinch - refreshing my hair and taking out some of the grease.  When I can&#x27;t make it to a shower, it&#x27;s a much better option than throwing on a baseball cap.  Thanks Axe!</li>
            <li> I had heard of dry shampoos before. I used to think about using one as a way to get some of the road dust and \\&quot;shumtz\\&quot; out of my hair during periods that washing my hair was difficult or just impossible. The problem was they all seemed to be made for a clinical environment and from what I heard, they smelled like it too. This Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset is not your grandma&#x27;s waterless shampoo. It goes on easy, lifts the dirt and oils out and leaves my hair with that great Axe smell. This is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Some people may have a use for this. But me? It irritates the heck out of my scalp to start, and it has a bunch of stuff you really don&#x27;t want on your head anyways (sodium lauryl sulfate, etc). Additionally, my hair didn&#x27;t feel any cleaner afterwards; it felt as though the shampoo left a sticky residue. If you want a dry shampoo, get batiste instead of this.</li>
            <li> Ok so i have to admit I did not think this would work. I have curly hair and prefer to shower at night. This leaves me with really bad bed head in the morning and usually requires another shower to \\&quot;control\\&quot; my hair. Regular gel does work but leaves you with GEL hair. A bit greasy or wet looking. I hate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So enter this product. I found I needed usually three tabs of this. I applied one to each side of my head and a third down the middle and bingo...bed head under control. No need to wash or re-shower in the am, (which to be honest I love an AM shower to wake up but don&#x27;t always have time). I found it did take about 15-20 minutes to fully dissipate (ie: gel look to go away) But after that my hair looked styled but NOT gel&#x27;d.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 5 stars ...love it...</li>
            <li> This waterless dry shampoo claims it can remove the oil on the hair without water. I tried it and it didn&#x27;t work very well. I sweated a lot after the morning exercise and I applied this waterless shampoo on my hair 5 hours later. The results are mediocre. The shampoo did remove some oil on my hair. However, it didn&#x27;t completely remove all the oil and it also made my hair sticky (like a hair gel). The smell is nice and manly though. And the waterless shampoo didn&#x27;t have any effect on my scalp so I still felt itchy after using this. Overall, I don&#x27;t think this waterless shampoo useful at all. If you on the move and your itchy scalp bothers you, find some water and wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the guy who needs to comb through and go. Because it&#x27;s a foam not the spray on powder, it dries better without the powdery residue so many of the dry shampoos have.</li>
            <li> I used this waterless shampoo for a couple of days when camping in an RV. The product comes out as a foam and goes into the hair easily.  I had to do some extra brushing to get things under control, but it did leave my hair looking okay; not clean, but under control.  It seems to mask the dirty hair look with a bit of shine and some extra control.  Not sure that this product is intended to help you through two days, but I decided to give it a try.  The second day, things didn&#x27;t go so well.  My hair definitely felt heavier after the application and my hair looked unwashed for sure (clumpy and heavy).  So, this may work okay for one day, but even then, my hair did not look like I had washed it, so your friends or colleagues will probably be able to tell.  It might be good in a pinch, but not a regular kind of thing.  There is no rinsing, so whatever this product puts in your hair stays there.</li>
            <li> I like to take showers at night before bed. This means I often wake up with bedhead. I usually then cup some water in my hands, wet my hair, and try to put it in position. I have found that Axe waterless dry shampoo is the perfect alternative. It \\&quot;wets\\&quot; my hair, eliminating bedhead, and lets me quickly get out the door. I do not notice the greasiness that some other reviewers have reported. For those who like to shower at night and don&#x27;t want to wet your hair (or reshower) in the morning, Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset is definitely something you should try.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son, and he liked it.  Here is his review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product promises to \\&quot;refresh hair by eliminating oil between regular washes,\\&quot; and depending on your needs the product works very well. Simply apply the foam to your hand, rub it through your hair, and it will make your hair smell better and look cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the average guy it&#x27;s a nice product to keep around if you want to freshen up and look sharp. It will probably suit most people; however, if you were looking into dry shampoos for the sole purpose of taking care of extra oily hair, a stronger dry shampoo would be a better option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most people, though, the product will be just what you&#x27;re looking for. Axe Waterless Foam Shampoo keeps your hair looking good and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product. I think it kind of stinks.  I know all Axe products contain scent, but most are less overwhelming than this item.  The smell is to potent to be pleasing.  Other Axe hair products have a more pleasant level of smell, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is kind of slimy and the results do not appear to be clean hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it three stars because the smell does, fortunately, reduce as it dries.  And I realize that the resulting look may suit some styles.  To each his own.  However, I remain unimpressed.</li>
            <li> This stuff seams to not work very well for me, When used it leaves my hair with a wet style look to it afterwards even several hours after I&#x27;ve used it. My hair is about 3&amp;#34; long but I assume this was geared more towards people with short hair with the wet style.</li>
            <li> I guess if you don&#x27;t have time for a traditional shower and hairwash, this product give it a  gentle cleaning without one.&lt;br /&gt;I used it couple of time when I did&#x27;nt have the time for a shower/hairwash, and it seemed to work pretty good, but it&#x27;s no substitute for the real thing (a real shower and hairwash).</li>
            <li> A million years ago there was a product called \\&quot;Psssst\\&quot; (hence the title) which was supposed to do what this product does - clean your hair in between shampoos. It didnt work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a nice soft foam that goes on damp and then dries up fast as you run a brush or your hands through it.  I&#x27;ve used it twice (on my weekends) and am extremely happy with the results. My hair didnt look greasy or sticky, just normal. And no weird residue on my hands when I touched it.  But I wouldnt suggest more than one day of use before your next shampoo. On day 3 I didnt feel my hair looked or felt very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for 4 stars was the smell. It&#x27;s more of a guy scent then a woman&#x27;s scent. However, on the plus side I only noticed it while I was initially applying it and never again after.</li>
            <li> this is a foam/mousse \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shampoo for a quick touch up when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full shampoo, or don&#x27;t have access to a shower right then, or have a specific style you keep.  i&#x27;d say this is a temporary solution, since your hair is still going to be dirty.  what this does do, is give your hair a quick lift, fresh scent, and a non-greasy appearance, like other dry shampoos. unlike most powder-based dry shampoos, however, it does not dull your hair or leave a lot of residue. if you use dry shampoos at all, this is definitely worth trying- it&#x27;s a unique product that does what it advertises. i know people who regularly use dry shampoos on clean hair, just to have more body and texture.  this also works well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> No-rinse/waterless shampoos are what you use to wash your hair in space. It&#x27;s also sold for use on infants and in hospitals and nursing homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam. It makes my hair (and me) feel fresh when don&#x27;t have time for a shower and the fragrance is ok although I wish it had no fragrance so that it wouldn&#x27;t compete with all of the other fragrances in products I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work as well as any old shampoo but then that&#x27;s the price to pay for convenience. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and gets rid of the hair and scalp oil buildup.</li>
            <li> Works in well and doesn&#x27;t feel oily but it just doesnt give me that clean feeling.. I mean sure it smells clean but I can&#x27;t say for sure that my hair isn&#x27;t clean. It doesn&#x27;t feel dirty, or like it harms the hair but it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like it does when I just get out of the shower with a normal shampoo... I can&#x27;t say this is a fault of the actual product though because it&#x27;s probably just my preference of what is clean and what isn&#x27;t. If you are one of the cool dudes who dyes their hair all of those funky colors it should help with preserving those so you can skip a few proper washes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for regular use, but it works as an emergency measure when you need a shampoo but don&#x27;t have access to the usual facilities.</li>
            <li> The product works great, the issue with this is that when it was sent the pump didn&#x27;t work properly.  Luckily I still had my last bottle and just swapped the pumps and now it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros with product:&lt;br /&gt;I can use this in lieu of showering, which is great if I showered before bed and my hair now looks a bit dirty.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;I think it works better than the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shampoos that are all sprays like hairspray and make my hair heavy with buildup&lt;br /&gt;bottle lasts a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;this particular bottle was broken&lt;br /&gt;could only find it on Amazon, Target doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore</li>
            <li> Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset is for those days when you can&#x27;t hit the shower before heading out the door for another busy day. Maybe you flew in on a red eye, or partied too hard and slept in and need to go to work late, or who knows what, we&#x27;ve all had days like that. You put a couple pumps of this stuff on your hair, which goes on like mousse, rub it in, then comb it. When I tried it in the morning after sleeping on my hair with gel in it, my hair still had normal body and shine and didn&#x27;t feel dirty or greasy. Sure, a shower is the best option, of course, but if you can&#x27;t have one of those then this will do fine.</li>
            <li> I am new to waterless shampoos.  I figured this would be good if I was in a hurry and did not have a chance to wash my hair or if I wanted to put something on my hair in the middle of the day. It works fine as a waterless shampoo but does not come close to shampooing ones hair in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to pump foam 1-2 times into hands and spread through the hair. I had to pump about five times before I got enough foam to go through my hair. Once I did it made my hair look better and easy to comb. I did not notice any sensation on my scalp that regular shampoo causes. This has a mild scent which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously nothing can beat shampooing with real water and regular shampoo but this seems like a reasonable alternative if you don&#x27;t have the time to do so. Considering it is a waterless shampoo I think it does a nice job.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair sticky and groty which isnt exactly what i want.&lt;br /&gt;Does the same thing as a pump of Dawn* hand soap</li>
            <li> I had my fiance test this out for me.  He used it and didn&#x27;t care for it at all.  He has long hair, and instead of keeping it clean between washes, which is what he expected, it made it gunky and oilier.  On the other hand, he did say it made his hair smell good.  After he used it, though, he had to take a shower to get it out of his hair.  His hair type is normal, with dry ends, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because of his hair type.  He just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
