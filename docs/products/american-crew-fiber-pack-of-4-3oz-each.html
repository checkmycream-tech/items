            <li>it was good for the first hour</li>

            <li>Very quick and easy.</li>

            <li>This is the best paste I&#x27;ve used for my unruly hair - easy to apply if you&#x27;re clumsy like me.</li>
            <li>Prime shipping makes it 100% worth it!</li>
            <li>It has  a new label on the top but still the same great product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and much cheaper than purchasing when I get my haircut.  </li>

            <li>I have used many products in my hair over the years and have never been completely satisfied until I tried American Crew fiber.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended. :-)</li>
            <li>Great stuff to add a little shape to my hair without being greasy, goopy, crusty, or shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Fiber just about every day for a few years and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Then comb it through to make sure it&#x27;s even and there are not little clumps anywhere.</li>
            <li>Was originally getting it at the hair salon and just received the four jars for about the same price, with free shipping!</li>
            <li>came quickly and it was exactly what we wanted</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>will melt if leaves in hot car in gym bag.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li>It normally costs about $18.00 and even at that it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>I use about a pea sized amount, like a large pea.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping,love the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I understand you can rub the product in your hand to help with the application, but it shouldn&#x27;t require that much rubbing to get the product ready for use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what people are on about here.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH CHEAPER</li>
            <li>It could hold for two days straight if you wanted.</li>
            <li>Works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky after feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy for me to apply the product to my hair, and usually my hair stay where I want them whole day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly highly recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a be some type of like other type of mixture that made it so cheap for all four, but no</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>then got very greasy and flatten my hair right down on my head...</li>
            <li>Maybe a tiny bit more at the tips if they&#x27;re still a little frizzy.</li>
            <li>however will have a white residue on your hair if gets wet in light rain.  </li>
            <li>This product has gone up in price since I purchased it, but it&#x27;s still the cheapest you can find this stuff online as far as I know.</li>
            <li>Some products make your hair look too greasy or shiny, others make your hair far too unnatural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong hold, doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily or slick.</li>
            <li>I have short coarse hair and works very well.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have a heavy build up too quickly necessitating washing your hair every day.</li>
            <li>In fact, you do not have to use a lot of this product depending on how much hair you have making it last a long time.</li>
            <li>In fact, you do not have to use a lot of this product depending on how much hair you have making it last a long time.</li>

            <li> Not great price but better than you&#x27;ll find at a salon.</li>
            <li> With my very thick hair I realized that less is more.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is the cheapest you can buy this product anywhere, and for a guy who needs to add a little thickness to his thinning hair, this product does wonders.</li>
            <li> But yet keeps its hold all day long.</li>
            <li> Dry hold.</li>
            <li> take a small amount and rub it in my hands to make it soft (or heat it with a hair dryer) and spread it evenly through my hair.</li>
            <li> It gives a thick full feeling without leaving it hard or greasy.</li>
            <li> that even with long hair, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you use too much it makes your hair thick, heavy and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and intended; takes very little product (relative to the amount of hair you have) and should be used on wet (but not dripping) hair immediately after a shower.</li>
            <li> Dropping $40+ on hair product might seem pretty absurd</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight hair and the majority of other similar styling products are unable to hold my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this stuff will hold and last all day.</li>
            <li> I know it seems expensive per ounce, but if you have shorter hair, you only use a little.</li>
            <li> Very stiff product.</li>
            <li> not good...:(</li>

            <li> Only stuff my husband will use!</li>
            <li> Great price buying this way! My husband uses this everyday and it&#x27;s so much cheaper in this four pack. It&#x27;s close to $18 each in stores.</li>
            <li> Only use this stuff, so it makes sense to buy in bulk. This is almost a 40% discount.</li>
            <li> The company sent the item as specified and I received the item on time. As far as I can tell, this is the cheapest you can buy this product anywhere, and for a guy who needs to add a little thickness to his thinning hair, this product does wonders.</li>
            <li> Been using American Crew Fiber for years. It rinses out fairly well with just water so you don&#x27;t have a heavy build up too quickly necessitating washing your hair every day.</li>
            <li> Great product- much better price in the four pack !!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping,love the product.Thanks</li>
            <li> Great stuff to add a little shape to my hair without being greasy, goopy, crusty, or shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for over a decade now and it works. Strong hold, doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily or slick. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Very stiff product. This stuff needs to be more watery (or whatever term you want to use), so that the product can be spread in your hair more easily. I understand you can rub the product in your hand to help with the application, but it shouldn&#x27;t require that much rubbing to get the product ready for use. I should not have bought four of these. Wish I could return..</li>
            <li> Strong but not sticky</li>
            <li> I thought it was a be some type of like other type of mixture that made it so cheap for all four, but no it&#x27;s the real deal! Will recommend for anyone that likes their products.</li>

            <li> This stuff really holds and smells nice as well. I found this to be the best price anywhere. Best hair product for men. Not greasy and holds all day. What else can you ask for? Great price too buying the 4 pack!&lt;br /&gt;I take a small amount and rub it in my hands to make it soft (or heat it with a hair dryer) and spread it evenly through my hair.

No need to worry about focusing on the roots since it&#x27;s just for frizz control.&lt;br /&gt;Note that even with long hair, a little bit goes a long way. I use about a pea sized amount, like a large pea. Maybe a tiny bit more at the tips if they&#x27;re still a little frizzy. If you use too much it makes your hair thick, heavy and greasy looking. A 3 oz tub lasts me 6-9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiber provides the perfect look and feel in my opinion because you really can&#x27;t tell there is any product in your hair if applied sparingly. In fact, you do not have to use a lot of this product depending on how much hair you have making it last a long time. Overall, I&#x27;ve been hooked on this product for years now and have used nothing else.</li>
            <li> Great price for a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Nothing keeps my faux hawk erect like Fiber.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve been able to find on this particular product.  I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with it and it&#x27;s timely arrival.</li>
            <li> works great, cheaper than the retailers.  great holds, and last all day.  works great with short hair and have a shine to it.  however will have a white residue on your hair if gets wet in light rain.  will melt if leaves in hot car in gym bag.  Last about 6 months for each container.  Update: Just purchased 4 more It has  a new label on the top but still the same great product.  Works great.  I have short coarse hair and works very well.  But probably won&#x27;t work as well for longer hair.  Would need to use the pomade instead</li>
            <li> Great deal! Awesome product.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, great proce</li>
            <li> This product has gone up in price since I purchased it, but it&#x27;s still the cheapest you can find this stuff online as far as I know. Dropping $40+ on hair product might seem pretty absurd but it&#x27;s totally worth it. One tin of this stuff can last you for months! Highly recommended. :-)</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this stuff will hold and last all day. Also works for mustaches and beards. Easy to use, nice odor.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and intended; takes very little product (relative to the amount of hair you have) and should be used on wet (but not dripping) hair immediately after a shower.</li>
            <li> Crew Fiber works great if your hair goes &amp;quot;limp&amp;quot; in high humidity. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found to keep a hold without my hair looking too brittle in the high Texas heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> Very quick and easy. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this product and much cheaper than purchasing when I get my haircut.  Prime shipping makes it 100% worth it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really holds and smells nice as well. I found this to be the best price anywhere. It normally costs about $18.00 and even at that it would be worth it. You don&#x27;t need a lot. Go to the internet to find out how to use it economically and it will also help you to use it to the best advantage.</li>
            <li> This the 2nd time I ordered the same product. It&#x27;s very easy for me to apply the product to my hair, and usually my hair stay where I want them whole day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what people are on about here. it was good for the first hour then got very greasy and flatten my hair right down on my head... not good...:(</li>
            <li> A good product that has a good enough hold, it does not hold all day though. With my very thick hair I realized that less is more.</li>
            <li> Great product and great prize!</li>
            <li> Matte finish is great. This is the cheapest way to get this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great in keeping your hair in place without the super shine look.  Been using this product for years.  Now my son uses it as well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff love it!!</li>
            <li> Second time I have order and the quality is still great and ships fast with Prime.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH CHEAPER ON AMAZON! I use this daily and I can go through each one in around 2 months so this pack can last forever.  You cant beat the price.  It looks great and doesn&#x27;t leave any shine or residue and holds all day.  It could hold for two days straight if you wanted.</li>
            <li> Best hair product for men.  Not greasy and holds all day.  What else can you ask for?  Great price too buying the 4 pack!</li>
            <li> Great price! Fast delivery! Iwas paying $17.00 for one bottle at the local salon.</li>
            <li> Husband and son both use and love this product.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Dry hold.</li>
            <li> Perfectly packed, happy purchase</li>
            <li> Great stuff, good price.</li>
            <li> Always loved this stuff. Works amazingly and was shipped and received as described.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only thing I use</li>
            <li> Best value and product I have found. Buying in packs of 4 drops price to ~$11 each a steal compared to $18 in stores. Been using this product for over 3 years and there isnt a better option.</li>
            <li> Not great price but better than you&#x27;ll find at a salon. Works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky after feel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else. I know it seems expensive per ounce, but if you have shorter hair, you only use a little. I&#x27;d highly highly recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product.  This is a great price and it is delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> American Crew Fiber works great for my hair. I have thick, straight hair and the majority of other similar styling products are unable to hold my hair in place. However, this product holds my hair in place all day without any issues.</li>
            <li> I have used many products in my hair over the years and have never been completely satisfied until I tried American Crew fiber. Some products make your hair look too greasy or shiny, others make your hair far too unnatural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiber provides the perfect look and feel in my opinion because you really can&#x27;t tell there is any product in your hair if applied sparingly. In fact, you do not have to use a lot of this product depending on how much hair you have making it last a long time. Overall, I&#x27;ve been hooked on this product for years now and have used nothing else.</li>
            <li> Love the medium hold and the matte finish. This product is great for those who do not like the greasy shiny hair look. I have been using this product for 3 years and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fiber just about every day for a few years and have always been happy with it. Low shine, unlike gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real product and at a great price in a 4-pack.  This is the best paste I&#x27;ve used for my unruly hair - easy to apply if you&#x27;re clumsy like me.</li>
            <li> came quickly and it was exactly what we wanted</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price.  Was originally getting it at the hair salon and just received the four jars for about the same price, with free shipping!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> This ismthe only stuff I use for my hair. It gives a thick full feeling without leaving it hard or greasy. But yet keeps its hold all day long. Great price. Get the blue colored Crew instead of the others because of the extra hold! Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Stuff is great, no shine, natural look, good hold, the bomb I use it all the time so I guess I say buy it!</li>
