            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Works well, but kind of pricey.</li>
            <li>The part I received comparable to the original cap and appears to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Better this plastic than the shaver heads which maids do when they drop them onto the counter in hotel rooms.</li>
            <li>Works just like the original!</li>
            <li>These are cheaply made and break easily, and they are pricey for what they are.  </li>
            <li>Seems fine--</li>
            <li>The vendor shaveroutlet.com was prompt and accommodating in getting the rma # to me, as of 1/14/2015 they do not have a protective cap to fit.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but replaces the original perfectly.</li>
            <li>I sure hope it lasts longer than either of the first two i have owned.</li>
            <li>Fits like the original.  </li>
            <li>It fits just like the original.</li>
            <li>Over priced but just like the original</li>
            <li>I dropped the original and ended up cracking it so needed a replacement for the Philips Norelco 1290X/40.  </li>
            <li>but It was just like the original.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li>this is worth it.</li>
            <li>It certainly does not look like it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is the exact replacement part that I needed.</li>
            <li>Perfect, but too expensive.</li>
            <li>Great but too expensive given its a piece of plastic that breaks easy.  </li>
            <li>At first I looked on all the normal Phillips Norelco sites &amp; couldn&#x27;t find any in stock.</li>
            <li>the profile/face is more curved than the old replacement head I had purchased the year prior (2013).  </li>
            <li>This protective cover works with the older RQ12 heads but does not work with the RQ12</li>
            <li>I ordered a new replacement head for my 1250x in August 2014 from Amazon (Philips Norelco RQ12+ Replacement Head for Series 8000 (SensoTouch 3D) and Arcitec).  </li>
            <li>This is a new version of the replacement head and</li>
            <li>I have dropped it a few times and it is strong.</li>
            <li>Very durable if this is made the same as the Ebay type, made for the Arcitec model.</li>

            <li> Perfect fit, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> This protective cover works with the older RQ12 heads but does not work with the RQ12+  replacement heads for the 1200 series razors.</li>
            <li> Just like the one that came with it.  Last one broke after dropping it - not the razor, just the cap.</li>
            <li> Fits like the original.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> The cover on my Norelco shaver simply broke from use.  I was very happy to find this item and it worked perfectly as a replacement.  I thought the price was a little high but the product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but replaces the original perfectly.</li>
            <li> Broke down after 5 days.</li>
            <li> It works for us.  Think they are not made to last, but that is Norelco&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> Part was a little expensive for a piece of plastic, but required to help protect your expensive electric razor.  It was delivered quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Works just like the original!</li>
            <li> Great but too expensive given its a piece of plastic that breaks easy.  Better this plastic than the shaver heads which maids do when they drop them onto the counter in hotel rooms.</li>
            <li> It fits just like the original.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I picked up my electric razor &amp; broke the cover. At first I looked on all the normal Phillips Norelco sites &amp; couldn&#x27;t find any in stock. You have got to be kidding did everyone brake them the same week. I purchased this one from Amazon. It&#x27;s the perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> Very durable if this is made the same as the Ebay type, made for the Arcitec model. It was $9 on Ebay. I have dropped it a few times and it is strong. The shaver should come with one of these instead of a fragile type. What ever price you pay this is worth it. I think it is made in China. Fits perfect.I recommend it, would buy again, and I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Works well, but kind of pricey.</li>
            <li> These are cheaply made and break easily, and they are pricey for what they are.  I&#x27;ll take the chance in the future that I can store and transport my razor without damage to the heads.</li>
            <li> Over priced but just like the original</li>
            <li> Seems fine--no complaints from my husband, who asked me to order it for him.</li>
            <li> This a must to protect your razor head. Too bad they do not last and they are way to expensive for a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> Let me qualify this.  I ordered a new replacement head for my 1250x in August 2014 from Amazon (Philips Norelco RQ12+ Replacement Head for Series 8000 (SensoTouch 3D) and Arcitec).  This is a new version of the replacement head and the profile/face is more curved than the old replacement head I had purchased the year prior (2013).  As a result of this change the protective cap would not fit.  See photo.  The part I received comparable to the original cap and appears to be of good quality.  My one star review is because this potential issue was not mentioned in the part description and now I have to go through the hassle of returning it.  The vendor shaveroutlet.com was prompt and accommodating in getting the rma # to me, as of 1/14/2015 they do not have a protective cap to fit.</li>
            <li> I dropped the original and ended up cracking it so needed a replacement for the Philips Norelco 1290X/40.  I came across this one it&#x27;s expensive for a such a small piece of plastic but It was just like the original.</li>
            <li> It is the exact replacement part that I needed.Fits perfectly</li>
            <li> Perfect, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the price is outrageous! Add insult to injury, there was a charge for shipping.</li>
