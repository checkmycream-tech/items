            <li>Very comfortable and handy.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; razor, and has been a great little tool.</li>

            <li>if very cheap.</li>
            <li>Very cheap construction</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>It Works perfectly and i like that it comes with extra razors.</li>
            <li>I would love to have it made of metal or thicker plastic</li>
            <li>Cheap!  </li>
            <li>THIS AND THE PET ONE AND LOVE THESE</li>
            <li>It works better than ansome of the electric snippers.</li>
            <li>Meets better expectations than I thought.</li>
            <li>It working ok, but</li>
            <li>So glad you had it.  </li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t ask for more for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>and it does the job for me ilost my top hair</li>
            <li>i was quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>And when i did I was quite pleased..</li>
            <li>Perfect for short hair</li>
            <li>I like this one because when he moves around during the combing process he doesn&#x27;t get nicked by the raoz, nor do I....:)</li>
            <li>This should be two bucks at most.  </li>
            <li>I used the comb on my bangs, and it got the job done for the most part.</li>
            <li>My hair never looked better</li>
            <li>OTHERWISE IT SEEMS TO CUT OK</li>
            <li>Very handy to have it come with a normal comb, makes it faster and easier.</li>
            <li>very usable, good blades</li>
            <li>Easy to change the blades, durable,</li>
            <li>However, I really only wanted the razor side which works great :-)</li>
            <li>This razor comb, in my opinion, seems to be made very cheap and it&#x27;s super flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li>BUT IT IS FINE FOR WHAT I PAID FOR IT.</li>
            <li>It is cheap material.</li>
            <li>I&#x27; don&#x27;t wanta sound cheap</li>
            <li>My dog seems to enjoy the comb through, doesn&#x27;t hurts him at all.</li>
            <li>it is cheaply made and would probably snap at the comb.</li>
            <li>this razor comb took almost 3 weeks to be delivered, there was also no tracking information available.</li>
            <li>The cost is cheap and the quality of the product is cheap.</li>
            <li>at 65, not much left on top any more!</li>
            <li>It was one of the original silver metal ones.  </li>
            <li>This item is quite user friendly.</li>
            <li>It is difficult at best to cut your own hair with electric clippers.  </li>
            <li>Fair price, almost instant delivery.</li>
            <li>think it will accomplish purpose for which I purchased it--will help between professional hair cuts will take practice but handy</li>
            <li>Great for my little maltese who get tangles easily under legs.</li>
            <li>A QUICK TOUCH UP</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife, and she hasn&#x27;t had opportunity to use it much, but believes it will works fine.</li>
            <li>Cheap, flimsy, feels like it&#x27;s about ready to fall apart.  </li>
            <li>Truly worth its weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;Top seller, fast and secure.</li>
            <li>Had to wait for this but was worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$ if you need one.</li>
            <li>I bought this to trim my Shih Tzu&#x27;s hair as I read a review from someone who had success in doing this.</li>
            <li>Clogs up pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use...almost as simple as combing my hair.</li>
            <li>Will work great on any dog&#x27;s without super thick hair like mine has.</li>
            <li>then keep it trimmed all year long with this amazing tool.  </li>
            <li>This thing broke during the first use...</li>
            <li>Pretty neat idea.  </li>
            <li>the handle broke the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Pleased to find a bunch of extra blades are included.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty flimsy</li>
            <li>AS I SAID WHEN FIRST PURCHASED, THE COMB SEEMED</li>
            <li>I HAVE A DISPOSIBLE ONE THAT ACTUALLY CUTS BETTER, UNFORTUNELY  </li>
            <li>In the long run, with time involved, its cheaper to go to the barber, and she&#x27;s better looking.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well on my first try, may need to practice with it</li>
            <li>easy to use and wonderfully low tech.</li>
            <li>Handy little hair trimmer that works well.</li>
            <li>This tool seems like a good idea but is hard to use and not made very well.</li>
            <li>With wet &amp; dry hair, I could comb for a full munite and still be able to count the number of hairs cut!  </li>
            <li>WORKS BETTER ON WET HAIR ON BOTH PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it.</li>
            <li>Also very flimsy</li>
            <li>Pulls hair to much.</li>
            <li>This razor comb works real well.</li>
            <li>it was bought so that i could cut out excess hair off of my cat and doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li>The plastic handle does worry me if I use it too much.</li>
            <li>works ok ,  for the money its  about as expected</li>
            <li>It works really well though.</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist but haven&#x27;t worked a whole lot with razors.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this purchase because of the advertisement but I should have known better due to the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>I would spend extra money and get something better for the future</li>
            <li>I bought it based on the decent reviews</li>
            <li>He just combs his hair as usual and it takes just enough off; then the other side shaves his neck perfectly!</li>
            <li>I wear my hair short so this clever gadget allows me to give myself a nice neat little trim between cuts.</li>
            <li>Set up to use with right hand only.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know whether the blades are sharp, they&#x27;re cheap, but it pulls hair out rather than cuts it.</li>
            <li>Have always been looking for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I had similar device 30 years ago, this new version has 4 options and they are both unique &amp; effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better to have your wife or husband do the back</li>
            <li>Razor end of the comb worked ok, but the ordinary comb on one end is superfluous.</li>
            <li>Got mine followed the instructions and first use it ripped out a big chunk of hair.</li>
            <li>Used once so far.</li>
            <li>It really helps get rid of tangles if used regularly.  </li>
            <li>Have your kids hair cut by a professional</li>
            <li>A little tough to clean when clogged, but it works just fine!</li>
            <li>Not the right one ,use less</li>
            <li>It does more to thin my hair, which is good for me because I generally have thick hair, on the sides at least...</li>
            <li>Since I am now cutting my own hair, this little tool has helped to provide a reasonable trim, if used properly, and not take too much hair with each swipe through my hair.  </li>
            <li>When switching from right side to left you get a different length setting unless you turn the comb upside down..........</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t just brush straight down, by at an angle</li>
            <li>BUT BLADES DULL QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>i was very surprised that this razor comb can give me 18 haircuts as it is, saving me alot of money in the long run!!!</li>

            <li> This tool seems like a good idea but is hard to use and not made very well.</li>
            <li> With wet &amp; dry hair, I could comb for a full munite and still be able to count the number of hairs cut!  </li>
            <li> WORKS BETTER ON WET HAIR ON BOTH PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Thanks for having it.</li>
            <li> Also very flimsy</li>
            <li> Pulls hair to much.</li>
            <li> This razor comb works real well.</li>
            <li> it was bought so that i could cut out excess hair off of my cat and doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle does worry me if I use it too much.</li>
            <li> works ok ,  for the money its  about as expected</li>
            <li> It works really well though.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist but haven&#x27;t worked a whole lot with razors.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this purchase because of the advertisement but I should have known better due to the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> I would spend extra money and get something better for the future</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the decent reviews</li>
            <li> He just combs his hair as usual and it takes just enough off; then the other side shaves his neck perfectly!</li>
            <li> I wear my hair short so this clever gadget allows me to give myself a nice neat little trim between cuts.</li>
            <li> Set up to use with right hand only.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know whether the blades are sharp, they&#x27;re cheap, but it pulls hair out rather than cuts it.</li>
            <li> Have always been looking for a new one.  </li>
            <li> I had similar device 30 years ago, this new version has 4 options and they are both unique &amp; effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better to have your wife or husband do the back</li>
            <li> Razor end of the comb worked ok, but the ordinary comb on one end is superfluous.</li>
            <li> Got mine followed the instructions and first use it ripped out a big chunk of hair.</li>
            <li> Used once so far.</li>
            <li> It really helps get rid of tangles if used regularly.  </li>
            <li> Have your kids hair cut by a professional</li>
            <li> A little tough to clean when clogged, but it works just fine!</li>
            <li> Not the right one ,use less</li>
            <li> It does more to thin my hair, which is good for me because I generally have thick hair, on the sides at least...</li>
            <li> Since I am now cutting my own hair, this little tool has helped to provide a reasonable trim, if used properly, and not take too much hair with each swipe through my hair.  </li>
            <li> When switching from right side to left you get a different length setting unless you turn the comb upside down..........</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just brush straight down, by at an angle</li>
            <li> BUT BLADES DULL QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> i was very surprised that this razor comb can give me 18 haircuts as it is, saving me alot of money in the long run!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very practical and inexpensive item every parent of a small child should have.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t thing this is the long lasting razor comb.</li>
            <li> I dont expect this product to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for the long hair on the legs and chest of my mini-schnauzer.  </li>
            <li> It was to be used on my cat who has long hair.</li>
            <li> This is a smaller comb than expected but it still worlds</li>
            <li> All in all, I suggest to buy a different razor comb other than this.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS VERY THICK, SO I USE THIS TO THIN IT ON MY OWN.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work - tugged on the hair no mater if it was wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> The length of 2 razor blades is longer than my previous razor comb with only 1 razor and thus, it &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; a wider band of hair and reduces the time.</li>
            <li> It will probably work fine when I get around cutting off that part and the connecting section.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful-</li>
            <li> Not as durable as I expected.</li>
            <li> worked very well to thin out hair on my cocker spaniel&#x27;s ears and body between groomer&#x27;s apointments.</li>
            <li> Mine was baby pink and didn&#x27;t come with replacement razors like it said.</li>
            <li> Not very durable</li>
            <li> Did not work like I expected</li>
            <li> THOUGH IT WOULD BE MADE OF HARDER PLASTIC.</li>
            <li> color was to be purple got pink but other than that</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but it works!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what else to say other than I still can use it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!</li>
            <li> no good.you can do one side of your head, if you change hands it is upside down</li>
            <li> so it glides down the side of your hair.</li>
            <li> Very sharp</li>
            <li> but it helps a little</li>
            <li> well when I wanna straighten my hair and cut a little here and there</li>
            <li> Used every few days this razor comb will keep you neat and trimmed.</li>
            <li> I got my hair wet and combed it all out before so no knots or anything but thanks to this stupid thing I had to shave my head.</li>
            <li> And I am not sure how durable it is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a small FOB in Afghanistan.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say no longer a customer of Universal Tool.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to use this razor to see how it would cut my hair.</li>
            <li> and it was useless and didn&#x27;t give you extra blades,</li>
            <li> No more trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do much trimming on his hair at all, so I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> think this is hand for hard to reach places while grooming.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, horrible quality.</li>
            <li> Mega thick hair</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT GETS THICK AND BUSHY</li>
            <li> Idea what the heck your missing out on!!</li>
            <li> ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Comb part broke off when used in tough hair.  </li>
            <li> I have to keep putting it back together which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to thin her hair out.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it as intended for a child afraid of haircuts.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting it for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> Cutting my hair myself, saves the trip to the beauty parlor, can&#x27;t stand smell of the place loool</li>
            <li> Which could be dangerous considering there are razor blades.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with any of my orders.</li>
            <li> I hated it!</li>
            <li> Bad prouduct!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This tool seems like a good idea but is hard to use and not made very well.</li>
            <li> Yes, excellent product.</li>
            <li> I could not find any way to adjust the settings as outlined in the instructions.  So I just used it as delivered.  I worked okay but did not cut as deep as I anticipated and as well as I anticipated but it did work.</li>
            <li> It is probably a good tool.  It was delivered to me and then disappeared so that I have never had an opportunity to use it.  I hope I will find it.</li>
            <li> Very good...I like it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to keep my shih-tzu trimmed. So it&#x27;s doing the job. It came well packaged, on time &amp; no hassles to set up. I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Sly</li>
            <li> nice quality and works well for my bangs I need taken care of between haircuts</li>
            <li> I BRING THIS WITH ME WHEN I GET A HAIRCUT. A LOT OF STYLISTS DO NOT HAVE ONE. SINCE I HAVE SHORT HAIR, I PREFER THIS OVER THE ELECTRIC RAZOR THEY USE.</li>
            <li> It is cheap material.</li>
            <li> Handy little hair trimmer that works well.</li>
            <li> It Works perfectly and i like that it comes with extra razors. I use it to cut my bangs manly so if that is what you are looking to do or give some shape to your hair. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Nice item. Works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;We use it to trim a Jack Russell Terrier.</li>
            <li> it works...... but comes apart often.  And I am not sure how durable it is.  I would love to have it made of metal or thicker plastic</li>
            <li> Cheap!  This thing broke during the first use...ridiculous.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work out for  why i bought it.</li>
            <li> Pretty neat idea.  I&#x27;m on a small FOB in Afghanistan.  No barber.  It is difficult at best to cut your own hair with electric clippers.  Used every few days this razor comb will keep you neat and trimmed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work - tugged on the hair no mater if it was wet or dry.  Can&#x27;t use it as intended for a child afraid of haircuts.</li>
            <li> really great can again  cut hair at home</li>
            <li> Works well used in combination w/thinning comb to keep cat&#x27;s &amp;#34;lion&amp;#34; cut updated</li>
            <li> With wet &amp; dry hair, I could comb for a full munite and still be able to count the number of hairs cut!  Plastic if very cheap.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but it works! Don&#x27;t know what else to say other than I still can use it.</li>
            <li> excellent pair of shears for the homebound.  Does a great job!!!!</li>
            <li> exactly as described...works great</li>
            <li> It works, but it fell apart. You can put it back together, but now it falls apart every time I use it. I have to keep putting it back together which is annoying.</li>
            <li> does what it says great for in between haircuts</li>
            <li> BOUT THIS AND THE PET ONE AND LOVE THESE, THEY WORK GREAT FIOR A QUICK TOUCH UP AND THE PET ONE IS USE ON MY DOG ALL THE TIME, HE IS 2 AND LOVES TO GET COMB SO THIS WAS GREAT FOR HIM, 1 THING TO REMBER IS IT WORKS BETTER ON WET HAIR ON BOTH PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Great serviceand delivery. Goods arrived as described and undamaged</li>
            <li> It works better than ansome of the electric snippers. Inexpensive. Blades replacable 2@ (They send a couple of extras). Great inexpensive product. Meets better expectations than I thought.</li>
            <li> This helps with trimming our dogs.</li>
            <li> Razor end of the comb worked ok, but the ordinary comb on one end is superfluous. It gets in the way when trying to work around the ears. It will probably work fine when I get around cutting off that part and the connecting section.</li>
            <li> It working ok, but i don&#x27;t thing this is the long lasting razor comb.</li>
            <li> Not the right one ,use less</li>
            <li> great razor comb for a push-back haircut or a push-forward hair cut! i was very surprised that this razor comb can give me 18 haircuts as it is, saving me alot of money in the long run!!! A+ and expert shipping!</li>
            <li> Havent had a chance to use this yet but I&#x27;m sure it will be great. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with any of my orders.</li>
            <li> Since I am now cutting my own hair, this little tool has helped to provide a reasonable trim, if used properly, and not take too much hair with each swipe through my hair.  It does more to thin my hair, which is good for me because I generally have thick hair, on the sides at least...at 65, not much left on top any more!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, and she hasn&#x27;t had opportunity to use it much, but believes it will works fine.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be but it helps a little</li>
            <li> If your a stylist and don&#x27;t own one of these you have no... Idea what the heck your missing out on!! Great thing ever invented. Easy to change the blades, durable, and my clients can&#x27;t get enough of it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent tool-- saving money trimming my own hair</li>
            <li> So glad you had it.  Been looking for years.  My mother had one years ago.  It was one of the original silver metal ones.  Have always been looking for a new one.  Thanks for having it.</li>
            <li> Universal Unisex Razor Comb Home Hair Cut Scissor (w/ 6 Bonus Replacement... Universal Unisex Razor Comb Home Hair Cut Scissor (w/ 6 Bonus Replacement...</li>
            <li> Set up to use with right hand only.  Clogs up pretty quick.  In the long run, with time involved, its cheaper to go to the barber, and she&#x27;s better looking.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this purchase because of the advertisement but I should have known better due to the price I paid.  Not the best for my kind of hair, cheap material but you can&#x27;t ask for more for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> very usable, good blades</li>
            <li> Does not cut, de-bulk, or piece out well at all. Also very flimsy</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t handle a cocker spaniels hair without mats</li>
            <li> I use these to cut and blend my hair. I have been cutting it for about 5 years. I keep it short and at times shorter..real short. This works great for me and no one ever believes I cut my hair......:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27; don&#x27;t wanta sound cheap but I can&#x27;t see spending $15.00 for a hair cut so I purchased this Razor comb and it does the job for me ilost my top hair so I use it on the sides and back of my head.</li>
            <li> Bought this even reading reviews, seemed like it would work. Got mine followed the instructions and first use it ripped out a big chunk of hair. I got my hair wet and combed it all out before so no knots or anything but thanks to this stupid thing I had to shave my head. Needless to say no longer a customer of Universal Tool.</li>
            <li> I hated it! Pulls hair to much.It is not a comb.I would not buy another one!Leave it alone! Bad prouduct!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does as the description states</li>
            <li> Used once so far. Works well. Very sharp</li>
            <li> This is great.  Just what I needed for the long hair on the legs and chest of my mini-schnauzer.  It really helps get rid of tangles if used regularly.  You do have to be careful-the plastic is bendable and might break if held at the end.</li>
            <li> Razors don&#x27;t cut hair. I had one that was similar to this and it did well. Don&#x27;t understand what the difference is since design is the same on both combs.</li>
            <li> A little tough to clean when clogged, but it works just fine! Gives a nice, textured look to the side of my hair.</li>
            <li> this thing is awesome, I just need to learn how to cut hair better</li>
            <li> think this is hand for hard to reach places while grooming.  My dog seems to enjoy the comb through, doesn&#x27;t hurts him at all.</li>
            <li> Fair price, almost instant delivery. I recommend this company and the product.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair short so this clever gadget allows me to give myself a nice neat little trim between cuts. It&#x27;s very easy to use...almost as simple as combing my hair.</li>
            <li> the handle broke the first time I used it</li>
            <li> This razor comb works real well. The length of 2 razor blades is longer than my previous razor comb with only 1 razor and thus, it &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; a wider band of hair and reduces the time. The only problem I have is that there are no instructions on how to replace the razor blade.</li>
            <li> This is a very practical and inexpensive item every parent of a small child should have. It helps me trim my kids&#x27; hair and you don&#x27;t have to be an expert to do a good job. This item is quite user friendly.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and handy. Cutting my hair myself, saves the trip to the beauty parlor, can&#x27;t stand smell of the place loool</li>
            <li> i was quite pleased with this item.I was anxious to use this razor to see how it would cut my hair. And when i did I was quite pleased..</li>
            <li> This is awesome! Cuts great!</li>
            <li> this thing is not work 2 dollars. it is cheaply made and would probably snap at the comb. it was bought so that i could cut out excess hair off of my cat and doesn&#x27;t work very well at all. i don&#x27;t know whether the blades are sharp, they&#x27;re cheap, but it pulls hair out rather than cuts it. JUNK JUNK JUNK  and definitely NOT work 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> Have your kids hair cut by a professional then keep it trimmed all year long with this amazing tool.  Save thousands of dollars a year and your time and gas too.  Truly worth its weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;Top seller, fast and secure.</li>
            <li> When I bought it and used it, it didn&#x27;t cut very short so then when I switched the blades, I didn&#x27;t expect it to take off a lot, but I ended up making a patch and got a buzz cut to fix it.</li>
            <li> no good.you can do one side of your head, if you change hands it is upside down and you can;t make it work</li>
            <li> Perfect for short hair</li>
            <li> Cheap, horrible quality. I would spend extra money and get something better for the future</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. It takes some getting used to. I think once I get the hang of it I will use it all the time. I use it to trim my hair between haircuts.</li>
            <li> Got this item to trim my dog&#x27;s hair, and it actually works.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my husband and he says it works great and that&#x27;s enough for him.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this!!!  He just combs his hair as usual and it takes just enough off; then the other side shaves his neck perfectly!</li>
            <li> I had similar device 30 years ago, this new version has 4 options and they are both unique &amp; effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better to have your wife or husband do the back</li>
            <li> My dog has fur and hair..I know, but it grows in different areas. I ordered another&lt;br /&gt;comb and it was useless and didn&#x27;t give you extra blades, Had to wait for this but was worth it. It does just what I want, cuts as you comb the hair, perfect.</li>
            <li> It was to be used on my cat who has long hair. Didn&#x27;t really do the job. I just wanted to thin her hair out.</li>
            <li> I like this one because when he moves around during the combing process he doesn&#x27;t get nicked by the raoz, nor do I....:)</li>
            <li> works great but just not 4 my dog which most stuff does not. Mega thick hair so i am still looking. Thank you for the good try. Will work great on any dog&#x27;s without super thick hair like mine has. Worth the $$ if you need one.</li>
            <li> They get the job done and that&#x27;s all I care  About</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my Shih Tzu&#x27;s hair as I read a review from someone who had success in doing this. It doesn&#x27;t really do much trimming on his hair at all, so I&#x27;m disappointed. I works great on mine but that&#x27;s not why I got it.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my husband who likes to keep his own hair trimmed. If you like to be clean-shaven this is the thing for you.</li>
            <li> think it will accomplish purpose for which I purchased it--will help between professional hair cuts will take practice but handy</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well on my first try, may need to practice with it</li>
            <li> Great for my little maltese who get tangles easily under legs.</li>
            <li> This should be two bucks at most.  There is a reason they don&#x27;t show you a picture of the packaging.  I bought it based on the decent reviews and I feel like I was taken a bit.</li>
            <li> Cheap, flimsy, feels like it&#x27;s about ready to fall apart.  Which could be dangerous considering there are razor blades.</li>
            <li> For home use a good buy.  The plastic handle does worry me if I use it too much. But, Im happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Handle broke off the second time I used it. When switching from right side to left you get a different length setting unless you turn the comb upside down..........but then you don&#x27;t have a handle to hold because it is then pointed up. Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Very cheap construction but it works. Pleased to find a bunch of extra blades are included.</li>
            <li> works ok ,  for the money its  about as expected</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a 5 star only because the plastic is a bit flimsy.  Comb part broke off when used in tough hair.  However, I really only wanted the razor side which works great :-)</li>
            <li> this razor comb took almost 3 weeks to be delivered, there was also no tracking information available. When I received the package, everything was included: the razor comb and the replacement blades. I used the comb on my bangs, and it got the job done for the most part. This razor comb, in my opinion, seems to be made very cheap and it&#x27;s super flimsy plastic. Not as durable as I expected. All in all, I suggest to buy a different razor comb other than this. The cost is cheap and the quality of the product is cheap. I dont expect this product to last a long time.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS VERY THICK, SO I USE THIS TO THIN IT ON MY OWN.  tHIS WAY I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO GO FOR A HAIRCUT CONSTANTLY BECAUSE IT GETS THICK AND BUSHY</li>
            <li> This is a handy tool for hair, beard and moustache trimming. easy to use and wonderfully low tech. I bought two because someone always swipes mine so I like to have a spare.</li>
            <li> saves me money and time. No more trips to the salon. Can only blame myself now if I don&#x27;t like the cut.</li>
            <li> worked very well to thin out hair on my cocker spaniel&#x27;s ears and body between groomer&#x27;s apointments.</li>
            <li> Mine was baby pink and didn&#x27;t come with replacement razors like it said. It works really well though. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> it works great. I would have liked it better if it had ajustable blades, but it works great for hair trimming</li>
            <li> My hair never looked better</li>
            <li> Broke within 5 minutes of usage.  Plastic does not hold up. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist but haven&#x27;t worked a whole lot with razors. This is a perfect &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; razor, and has been a great little tool.</li>
            <li> Not very durable it&#x27;s pretty flimsy</li>
            <li> This product, if you know how to use it is very good, totally worth the money. Clean it out with a toothbrush after use and it&#x27;s good. :D Don&#x27;t just brush straight down, by at an angle so it glides down the side of your hair. Very handy to have it come with a normal comb, makes it faster and easier. I would totally recommend this product. Gives great haircuts!!!! Great job!!!!</li>
            <li> Did not work like I expected</li>
            <li> This is a smaller comb than expected but it still worlds well when I wanna straighten my hair and cut a little here and there</li>
            <li> color was to be purple got pink but other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> 6/16/2013 &#x3D; EDIT: THE COMB PART BROKE OFF OF THE RAZOR PART TODAY. AS I SAID WHEN FIRST PURCHASED, THE COMB SEEMED FLIMSY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;THE COMB SEEMS A BIT FLIMZY. THOUGH IT WOULD BE MADE OF HARDER PLASTIC. OTHERWISE IT SEEMS TO CUT OK BUT BLADES DULL QUICKLY. I HAVE A DISPOSIBLE ONE THAT ACTUALLY CUTS BETTER, UNFORTUNELY  ITS BLADE CANNOT BE CHANGED. I FIND IT A BIT OVER PRICED BUT IT IS FINE FOR WHAT I PAID FOR IT.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected! I&#x27;ll try and find me something else.</li>
            <li> Works great for getting knots and burrs out of my dogs coats.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I like it.</li>
