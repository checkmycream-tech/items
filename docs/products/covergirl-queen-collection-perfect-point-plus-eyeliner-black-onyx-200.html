            <li>Amazing product!!</li>
            <li>artist.&lt;br /&gt;Credits to the beautiful design</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful and I&#x27;ve fallen asleep with it on.</li>
            <li>this is just as good and at a great price!</li>
            <li>Very pleased by the product and price!</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that it smudges, it&#x27;s great if you want to have a smokey look.</li>
            <li>The smudger is a great shape too.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend as a great inexpensive eyeliner option.</li>
            <li>THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>works great every time.  </li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, and I love it!</li>
            <li>It glides on well and is of good quality.</li>
            <li>still really good though</li>
            <li>after trying it from Walmart (... I know, right?)&lt;br /&gt;It was $8, a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>eyeliner is self-sharpening, which is good.</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>penciled her own eye, and I&#x27;m a makeup</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is very easy to put on.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve used better pencils for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>These perfect point eyeliners sharpen perfectly by twisting and the eyeliner is a dark rich black that goes on very smoothly and always in a perfect line.</li>
            <li>Within 1-2 hrs it will be noticeable that the eye liner is all over your eyes, top and bottom.</li>
            <li>I had never done eye liner before and do love this one.</li>
            <li>Glad i bought it</li>
            <li>and I love the way the tip dispenses.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this would work either if you want a smokey eye. :))</li>
            <li>I helped :)</li>
            <li>We love this product.  </li>
            <li>Saved about $1 each (maybe a bit more) on the eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>double pack came in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite pencil eyeliner.</li>
            <li>until i found this, for this low price and being a pack of two, this was AWESOME!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot think of anything that works better...</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Better price than retail stores.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, and love, love, love the self sharpening end.  </li>
            <li>Love this eye liner pencil because it is so easy to apply and has a smudge tip on the end.</li>
            <li>Its easy to put on eyelids</li>
            <li>This is so easy to apply a child could do it.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner smudges really easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These arrived and are so extremely smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive eyeliner pencil, this works fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I use it on my water line and it&#x27;s really smooth.</li>
            <li>I like the sponge thing on the bottom to help smooth it out</li>
            <li>It slides smoothly on to the eyelids and stays on for quite a while</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, stays on for hours and keeps well, too.</li>
            <li>It looks good though, but up close it does look like a 3 year old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>I keep one in my handbag and one in my makeup case and after several weeks now, they are both as smooth and beautiful when I apply them as they were when they first arrived.</li>
            <li>Good product - same as what you&#x27;d find in the store.  </li>
            <li>A+ product shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>very easy to apply, downfalls are that it breaks kind of easily and needs to be applied more than once in a day (only about one or two other times, though, not bad at all)</li>
            <li>This super convenient eyeliner has become my personal favorite!</li>
            <li>Long lasting its awesome.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer a fine marker-type eyeliner which goes on more evenly and quicker and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>This works really well in terms of a smooth glide on your lid/eye.</li>
            <li>Overall i liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying this rather than a cheapie one u have to sharpen</li>
            <li>its nice while it last...</li>
            <li>It goes on solid, is easy to control, and blends smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I also like the midnight blue, but the black are the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you have kids or a small dog</li>
            <li>I find this product works better than many because you get the black liner without much effort.</li>
            <li>This was one of the first eyeliners that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love it, now only if it didn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Great long lasting eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner never fails me.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, but was getting discouraged at the cost at the local store.  </li>
            <li>Glad to order and have an extra on hand!</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, but with that comes a little more smearing.</li>
            <li>Love that it goes on smooth, and has a little sponge on the end for blending.  </li>
            <li>I like much better than the liquid eyeliner - it does not run as quickly as some other eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many black eyeliners and this is the best for my asian complexion and black eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This type is easier if you want to smudge for a smokey eye type of look but beware it will not last the whole day, like most pencil liners.</li>
            <li>One quick wipe to get rid of Alice Cooper, and it nearly lasted all day</li>
            <li>It is the twist type that always has a point ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is always ready and works fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth lines that last awhile.</li>
            <li>i dnt wesr THAT much eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It does smudge easy when exposed to heat or a long day.</li>
            <li>It lasts long and it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>You push the plastic applicator tip down &amp; twist it to produce more eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more in the future!  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find the black in the stores, as it is the most popular color in this line.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have previously purchased the Perfect Point from a local retailer in the past</li>
            <li>but I imagine that offers a little more versatility with application.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS EYELINER~!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, not sure why the description mentions \\&quot;1</li>
            <li>decided to order this liner because it seemed like a great price, and the pencil liner that requires sharpening that I usually buy seems to get harder to apply after initial use -</li>
            <li>In addition, I have mild CP that comes with shaking hands, and it is a lot easier to apply than a lot of other eyeliners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dark and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>and I have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s darkness hue is nearly like liquid liner.</li>
            <li>I came online just to order more (what a fabulous price for 2 at a mere $5!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no mess sharpening it.</li>
            <li>The pencil is not too soft and not too hard, it just fine.</li>
            <li>I have used this eye liner for many years and hate to pay full price at CVS!  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not the best with make-up, usually i just wear a thin sheer of lip-gloss and if i&#x27;m feeling bold eyeliner (very subtle).</li>

            <li> smudges and doesn&#x27;t last long, give it an hour and it looks \\&quot;blotchy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smudge slightly if you sweat a lot, but most do, and this isn&#x27;t as bad as a normal pencil, especially since there&#x27;s no wood to accidentally scratch</li>
            <li> Certainly much easier than the pencils which have to be clumsily sharpened.</li>
            <li> It is self-sharpening and lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> However, you should be careful and store it properly, because the liner can break on the inside...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain whether it simply gets old and hard or what, but it&#x27;s a pain to apply</li>
            <li> but that isnt very long!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t melt off of your face or anything, but it definitely smears a little easier than other eyeliners.</li>
            <li> It takes a few swipes to get it dark, and thats the only thing I found</li>
            <li> Bottle\\&quot;... there is no bottle, this is a stick liner, with a cover on one end and the blending tip on the other.</li>
            <li> I also like that it has a smudger on the other side.</li>
            <li> the only reason why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it&#x27;s just a little hard to get off.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d often leave half made up to avoid the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very dark and creamy application.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner that my stepdaughters will use and they are serious about their eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> No more looking for a sharpener or dealing with the mess they make.  </li>
            <li> and I end up with a broken half-used pencil that scratches my eyes with the sharp wood.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s a little cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> THOSE HARD PENCILS THAT YOU HAVE TO JAB IN UR EYE</li>

            <li> Very dark and creamy application.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it smudges ALOT. Within 1-2 hrs it will be noticeable that the eye liner is all over your eyes, top and bottom. Besides the fact that it smudges, it&#x27;s great if you want to have a smokey look.</li>
            <li> This works really well in terms of a smooth glide on your lid/eye. It does smudge easy when exposed to heat or a long day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS EYELINER~!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, not sure why the description mentions \\&quot;1 Bottle\\&quot;... there is no bottle, this is a stick liner, with a cover on one end and the blending tip on the other. It is the twist type that always has a point ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to order this liner because it seemed like a great price, and the pencil liner that requires sharpening that I usually buy seems to get harder to apply after initial use - I&#x27;m not certain whether it simply gets old and hard or what, but it&#x27;s a pain to apply so I&#x27;d often leave half made up to avoid the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrived and are so extremely smooth and easy to apply. I don&#x27;t use the blending tip but I imagine that offers a little more versatility with application. I keep one in my handbag and one in my makeup case and after several weeks now, they are both as smooth and beautiful when I apply them as they were when they first arrived.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Queen Collection Eyeliner. I have previously purchased the Perfect Point from a local retailer in the past and i could never find a 2 pack. I will definitely purchase more in the future!  Ms. W.  Maryland</li>
            <li> This was one of the first eyeliners that I&#x27;ve ever used. I didn&#x27;t want to try and start with a pencil liner. I gave this one a shot. Overall i liked it. It takes a few swipes to get it dark, and thats the only thing I found I didn&#x27;t like. Very easy to use. I had never done eye liner before and do love this one. I also like that it has a smudger on the other side. Was and awesome buy and would recommend this anyday!</li>
            <li> I personally prefer a fine marker-type eyeliner which goes on more evenly and quicker and lasts longer.  This type is easier if you want to smudge for a smokey eye type of look but beware it will not last the whole day, like most pencil liners.</li>
            <li> Certainly much easier than the pencils which have to be clumsily sharpened. It glides on well and is of good quality. Glad i bought it</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive eyeliner pencil, this works fabulous.  It goes on solid, is easy to control, and blends smoothly.  I haven&#x27;t had the tip break at all on this pencil like I have some others.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this as a staple in the makeup case.</li>
            <li> I ordered the two pack and when I opened it in the mail I only had a one pack of eyeliner</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve used better pencils for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;This smudges and doesn&#x27;t last long, give it an hour and it looks \\&quot;blotchy\\&quot;. It looks good though, but up close it does look like a 3 year old penciled her own eye, and I&#x27;m a makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;Credits to the beautiful design and I love the way the tip dispenses. It&#x27;s also super easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;However I want something that doesn&#x27;t run and is blacker. I don&#x27;t think this would work either if you want a smokey eye. :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I helped :)</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very easy to put on. It feels smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, but with that comes a little more smearing. It doesn&#x27;t melt off of your face or anything, but it definitely smears a little easier than other eyeliners. Simple fix would be to go with the water proof.</li>
            <li> I love it, now only if it didn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, and love, love, love the self sharpening end.  The smudger is a great shape too.  Would recommend as a great inexpensive eyeliner option.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE EST YOUR GONNA GET IN EYELINER   IT&#x27;S NOT LIKE THOSE HARD PENCILS THAT YOU HAVE TO JAB IN UR EYE TO GET THE SHADE YOU WANT  THIS PENCIL GLIDES ON LIKE BUTTER AND STAYS ON FOR ABOUT 4 TO 6 HOURS BEFORE A TOUCH UP IS NEEDED    PLUS THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS IS, NO PENCIL SHARPENERS IT&#x27;S AUTOMATIC    I&#x27;LL NEVER GO BACK TO A PENCIL LINER AGAIN</li>
            <li> We love this product.  It is hard to find the black in the stores, as it is the most popular color in this line.  Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li> Saved about $1 each (maybe a bit more) on the eyeliner.  Good product - same as what you&#x27;d find in the store.  I like it that there&#x27;s no sharpener/shavings to deal with and that the \\&quot;blender\\&quot; is attached with a cap at the opposite end.</li>
            <li> These are my HG eyeliner. Everytime I buy a pencil I need to sharpen, it gets mutilated or the eyeliner portion breaks and I end up with a broken half-used pencil that scratches my eyes with the sharp wood. These perfect point eyeliners sharpen perfectly by twisting and the eyeliner is a dark rich black that goes on very smoothly and always in a perfect line. I also like the midnight blue, but the black are the best. I&#x27;ve tried many black eyeliners and this is the best for my asian complexion and black eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The pencil is not too soft and not too hard, it just fine. Its easy to put on eyelids and I have no complaints so far. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this!  Love that it goes on smooth, and has a little sponge on the end for blending.  Good color, and it stays on all day!!!  And it has a built in sharpener -- just twist and go! I have ordered this for several years and will continue to use only this.  Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> my go-to eyeliner! very easy to apply, downfalls are that it breaks kind of easily and needs to be applied more than once in a day (only about one or two other times, though, not bad at all)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time with eyeliner.  This is so easy to apply a child could do it.  There&#x27;s no sharpening the tip or refills.&lt;br /&gt;It works great every time.  Any mistakes can be corrected with a Qtip.</li>
            <li> Great long lasting eyeliner.  No more looking for a sharpener or dealing with the mess they make.  This eyeliner is always ready and works fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The double pack came in perfect condition.  Very pleased by the product and price!</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner I use. It is self-sharpening and lasts a long time too. It&#x27;s worth buying this rather than a cheapie one u have to sharpen</li>
            <li> This eyeliner never fails me. My go to product I only have to apply once a day. Long lasting its awesome.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite pencil eyeliner. It goes on smoothly. However, you should be careful and store it properly, because the liner can break on the inside...</li>
            <li> I use it on my water line and it&#x27;s really smooth. i had one before so i bought this one. it stays on forever. i will probably buy it forever</li>
            <li> I like the sponge thing on the bottom to help smooth it out and I like the eyeliner- it&#x27;s very easy to use. Just kinda expensive, that was it.</li>
            <li> glides on with ease.  for some reason I feel you can control the use of the eyeliner because it being like a pencil.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner smudges really easily. I continue to use it because I bought a 2-pack, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not the best with make-up, usually i just wear a thin sheer of lip-gloss and if i&#x27;m feeling bold eyeliner (very subtle). but when ever i put on eyeliner i tear so i have to wipe it off and put it on again and again so i tried all these water-proof eye-liners. until i found this, for this low price and being a pack of two, this was AWESOME! highly recommend. the only reason why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it&#x27;s just a little hard to get off. still really good though</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  I hate that it is so expensive!  It seems crazy that something so simple is so pricey!  At least it&#x27;s a little cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I use this pencil for skin markings in my office.  It works great and I cannot think of anything that works better...</li>
            <li> This was a repeat order. I love the product. It slides smoothly on to the eyelids and stays on for quite a while</li>
            <li> Love this eye liner pencil because it is so easy to apply and has a smudge tip on the end.</li>
            <li> This super convenient eyeliner has become my personal favorite! I came online just to order more (what a fabulous price for 2 at a mere $5!) after trying it from Walmart (... I know, right?)&lt;br /&gt;It was $8, a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no mess sharpening it. You push the plastic applicator tip down &amp; twist it to produce more eyeliner. It&#x27;s great if you have kids or a small dog (It would be hard to ruin it and a child probably couldn&#x27;t figure it out to draw on the wall).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smudge slightly if you sweat a lot, but most do, and this isn&#x27;t as bad as a normal pencil, especially since there&#x27;s no wood to accidentally scratch you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s darkness hue is nearly like liquid liner. It looks beautiful and I&#x27;ve fallen asleep with it on. One quick wipe to get rid of Alice Cooper, and it nearly lasted all day the next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must have for your purse when on-the-go or in a rush!</li>
            <li> Smooth lines that last awhile. I like much better than the liquid eyeliner - it does not run as quickly as some other eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner that I&#x27;ve used for years! I couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal! Goes on smooth, stays on for hours and keeps well, too.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, but was getting discouraged at the cost at the local store.  This stuff works great, and I love it!</li>
            <li> bought it. used it. went through both stick within s month. i dnt wesr THAT much eyeliner. Certainly not enough to go through 2 sticks in a month! its nice while it last... but that isnt very long!</li>
            <li> A+ product shipped quickly.  I find this product works better than many because you get the black liner without much effort.</li>
            <li> the blender tip is great.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner is self-sharpening, which is good. but it lasts for really short time, like 3-4hrs.&lt;br /&gt;The cannot screw back the pencil or replace it, which is not so convenient.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner that my stepdaughters will use and they are serious about their eyeliner!  Better price than retail stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for years now.  Probably 5-6 years.  It lasts long and it is easy to apply.  In addition, I have mild CP that comes with shaking hands, and it is a lot easier to apply than a lot of other eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye liner for many years and hate to pay full price at CVS!  Glad to order and have an extra on hand!</li>
            <li> This is probably the third time we got this eyeliner. My wife loves it. We will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! I have used chanel and clinique for years this is just as good and at a great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark and goes on smooth. It&#x27;s a relatively creamy eyeliner, but it smudges if I use it on my waterline. I can&#x27;t use this to make wings, either.. it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold that wing-tip shape and smudges.</li>
