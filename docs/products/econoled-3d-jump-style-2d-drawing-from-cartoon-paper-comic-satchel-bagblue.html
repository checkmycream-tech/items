            <li>Great for the price.</li>
            <li>Although, it does have a lot more room than you&#x27;d think, so it&#x27;s perfect as a day bag</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy I was finally able to buy one!</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>

            <li>nice comments on it from her co-workers...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like...chemicals and plastic.</li>
            <li>Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li>But my daughter paid for it with her own money.</li>
            <li>Good price, speedy delivery and cute.</li>
            <li>Cute bag, nice design, and my sister loved it</li>
            <li>Has a very strong &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell to it, assuming from manufacturing process.  </li>
            <li>looks great but the magnetic closure doesnt seem to line up right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably overuse anyway because it&#x27;s just that cute, but definitely very cheap.</li>
            <li>Well okay condition,</li>

            <li>I wish I could use it more often</li>
            <li>Love the bag.</li>
            <li>It folds out on the bottom to make more room.</li>
            <li>for the price it does the job of looking nice and original</li>
            <li>This is cute but had an extremely strong chemical smell that would not go away.</li>
            <li>The fabric is quite durable and is very easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li>This bag is great and cute but is more of a purse the zipper fell off the bottom and the top by the strap is coming undone great bag for small things but not a school bag!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s same picture and very good quality</li>
            <li>I was worried about the size from the other reviews, but it&#x27;s perfect to use as a purse.</li>
            <li>A hell of a lot cheaper than other bags of this nature, so the price is perfect for how underwhelmed I was by the dimensions.</li>
            <li>my daughter specifically requested this bag for a birthday present as trendy and was absolutely delighted with the quality.</li>
            <li>Super cute bag, looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li>My shipment came quickly, and I was very excited about receiving this bag.</li>
            <li>and I had plenty of room to fit all of my purse stuff.</li>
            <li>not a lot else will fit in here.</li>
            <li>, Maybe a notebook and some pencils, my phone can fit in there.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this bag is great.  </li>
            <li>the inside pocket also stained my light colored phone case</li>
            <li>Looks good, not too much space for storage, good as a local commuter for laptop</li>
            <li>My teen girls LOVE their bags!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received my bag in the mail.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than I though it would be but can fit a lot into it surprisingly</li>
            <li>I dont carry alot of stuff in my purse but when switching my things from my old purse to this one i couldnt fit eventhing and when taking some stuff out its still packed!!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be sacrificing carrying capacity for sweet style with this item, but it&#x27;s still an alright bag.</li>
            <li>I thought it was super cool..</li>
            <li>Super cool.</li>
            <li>A quick tip for people who purchase this:&lt;br /&gt;*The</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The stars are mostly for the cuteness, but it&#x27;s definitely cheap and cheaply made, only had it for about three weeks and the materiel between the two sections has torn.</li>
            <li>, the picture isn&#x27;t as accurate as the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s super-cute and fun.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast came a lot sooner than expected which is great.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool looking bag, trips people out every time my girlfriend goes out with.</li>
            <li>It does have a chemical smell right out of the package</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend it as a cool present.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It looked great but smelled like plastic and was very stiff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to buy gifts for her, so I&#x27;m happy too.</li>
            <li>Exactly the quality, color, and size as pictured.</li>
            <li>It really gets people&#x27;s attention!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind spending extra money, just spring for the authentic bags from the Jump From Paper website</li>
            <li>The bag looks exactly as the picture portrays.  </li>
            <li>but it looks exactly like the photos</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Still pretty cute but really can only hold a notebook or tablet.</li>
            <li>you put too much weight in it</li>
            <li>You can fit your laptop or tablet, a phone, maybe a couple pens, possibly a notepad...but</li>
            <li>(I could only really fit some folders and spiral notebooks in it without stretching).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It did smell like similar cheap nylon products.</li>
            <li>; effect as much in person.</li>
            <li>I really like how it is made and how it looks.</li>
            <li>This is very well made for the money.</li>
            <li>An IPad and a small wallet fit just fine.</li>
            <li>your strap will start to come apart from the main bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for the price it is decent</li>
            <li>High quality</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t high quality - but didn&#x27;t expect it to be (price).</li>
            <li>Step daughter loves her new satchel...  </li>
            <li>my 5yr old daughter loves it!</li>
            <li>I saw the exact same bag for $88 dollars at the mall.</li>
            <li>Arrived early, about 2 weeks after I placed my order!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Easy to fix with a little effort</li>
            <li>However, it is a bit small and doesn&#x27;t fit much.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold much, but is a visual bombshell.</li>
            <li>But 14 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>I left it out on my balcony for a few days and it still had a really strong smell.</li>
            <li>But then againâ€¦it&#x27;s a cheap knock-off of a bag thats usually around $100, so</li>
            <li>If you want a cute bag to wear a few hours out of the house, only using it to carry your phone, wallet, and other small things, then it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the company to complain of this and they told me that airing it out in an open room would get rid of the offensive odor completely.</li>
            <li>The bad arrived much more quickly than estimated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really stiff and does not expand far enough to be useful except for carrying letters or something similar.  </li>
            <li>Not enough room for much more than a notebook or two or a thin tablet and/or laptop.  </li>
            <li>It is an eye catcher for sure but the flap that opens its a little stiff (since it is made to look 2D. One of the button fell off.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>I washed it with hot water in the shower for about ten minutes and the nylon smell went down to a tolerable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very cool but only has space for a note book, and smell like cigarette smoke very hard</li>
            <li>This item has very little room in it, so it is not ideal for a lot of things, such as text books and such, but is great for smaller items like notebooks, folders, and such.</li>
            <li>The quality is fine and what i expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have complained about the smell.</li>

            <li> The quality is fine and what i expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have complained about the smell.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this gift for anyone you know who is into anime cartoons, loves bags or is just a little bit quirky (like me!!)</li>
            <li> you are gentle or at least not rough with this bag</li>
            <li> It is kinda small, but I don&#x27;t carry much and it has a lot of pockets.</li>
            <li> Separately, the snaps have black rubber parts and that smell dissipated naturally after about a week.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> The side of the bag in the picture appears to be grey, while on my bag it appears to be tan.  </li>
            <li> or if you want to keep your wallet and other daily necessities in it.</li>
            <li> has limited functional use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing, because the bag itself is really cool and totally looks 2D</li>
            <li> clasps will fall off if you&#x27;re rough with them like I</li>
            <li> Not much space inside, but</li>
            <li> I get A LOT of looks with this bag, but it&#x27;s really not made for every day use.</li>
            <li> I honestly expected this to be junk.</li>
            <li> The fastest way to look like a despicable hipster weeaboo who is still mentally 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected from the dye.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*The small pocket on back might have a hole in it</li>
            <li> the hole will get bigger and you won&#x27;t understand where all those small things are going.</li>
            <li> and I still like the way it looks, but other people might not like this.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, the buttoned straps started to curl, and a few days later the lining holding the buttons started to fray.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very practical for everyday use.</li>
            <li> If I had to choose a negative, the only thing that I think could be improved is the magnet buckles could be a little stronger.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s been well noted by previous reviewers.</li>
            <li> The bag had black smudges/scuffs on some parts of it, making it look used.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal: while the bag does look really cool, MINE came with a REALLY BAD SMELL.</li>
            <li> She looks like a little anime character.</li>
            <li> Nothing that a little febreeze won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> uses it everyday going to and from work...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made for tons of heavy junk.</li>
            <li> Had a heavy gasoline like smell when I pulled it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> After I left it sitting out in my open bedroom in a feeble attempt to expunge the stink, it still smells!</li>
            <li> I get lots of looks because its kinda trippy..my only real complaint is that its fairly small and stiff!</li>
            <li> It IS small on the inside, but even the Jump From Paper bags these are replicating are small on the inside, it&#x27;s not a design flaw of specifically these.</li>
            <li> Way too small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather small inside</li>
            <li> Hoping it will be less stiff and losen up after awhile!!</li>
            <li> but The bag itself to carry things is very small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also bummed because this thing not only emanates this bad smell, but contaminates the surfaces it sits on. :</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use it for school, but it&#x27;s just too thin</li>
            <li> Very small!</li>
            <li> THIS HOLE save yourself the time of tediously shaking coins and your keys out of it because it leads to under the lining.&lt;br /&gt;*don&#x27;t</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Exactly the quality, color, and size as pictured. I am very happy with this bag. It IS small on the inside, but even the Jump From Paper bags these are replicating are small on the inside, it&#x27;s not a design flaw of specifically these.</li>
            <li> This bag is awesome in so many ways!! I love it and would recommend it as a cool present. There is just this smell that hasn&#x27;t gone away. Oh well!</li>
            <li> Purchased at begining of the school year. This bag is great and cute but is more of a purse the zipper fell off the bottom and the top by the strap is coming undone great bag for small things but not a school bag!  Easy to fix with a little effort I&#x27;ll still use it but not in school.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a year and I&#x27;m glad to say that this bag is still in good condition! Well okay condition, but that&#x27;s my fault. A quick tip for people who purchase this:&lt;br /&gt;*The clasps will fall off if you&#x27;re rough with them like I was.&lt;br /&gt;*If you put too much weight in it your strap will start to come apart from the main bag.&lt;br /&gt;*The small pocket on back might have a hole in it FIX THIS HOLE save yourself the time of tediously shaking coins and your keys out of it because it leads to under the lining.&lt;br /&gt;*don&#x27;t bend the latches they will never be the same if you do.&lt;br /&gt;*seriously the hole will get bigger and you won&#x27;t understand where all those small things are going. Fix the hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are gentle or at least not rough with this bag it will serve you well.</li>
            <li> I got this bag at a local buffalo exchange for $16.. I thought it was super cool..my 5yr old daughter loves it! I get lots of looks because its kinda trippy..my only real complaint is that its fairly small and stiff! I dont carry alot of stuff in my purse but when switching my things from my old purse to this one i couldnt fit eventhing and when taking some stuff out its still packed!! Hoping it will be less stiff and losen up after awhile!!</li>
            <li> Works great!  High quality and I had plenty of room to fit all of my purse stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this bag. It really gets people&#x27;s attention! It&#x27;s quite a bit more roomy than it looks as well.</li>
            <li> This bag smells like it was dipped in creasote.</li>
            <li> Nice novelty item but has limited functional use.  Not enough room for much more than a notebook or two or a thin tablet and/or laptop.  Has a very strong &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell to it, assuming from manufacturing process.  Seems to be dissipating over time.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it and thinks it&#x27;s perfect for going to class (when she doesn&#x27;t need books, makeup or lunch). You can fit your laptop or tablet, a phone, maybe a couple pens, possibly a notepad...but not a lot else will fit in here. Still, it&#x27;s super-cute and fun. She looks like a little anime character. Adorable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s same picture and very good quality</li>
            <li> Great quality, looks even better than in picture.</li>
            <li> Looks good, not too much space for storage, good as a local commuter for laptop only or just a notebook w/ some paperwork.</li>
            <li> Way too small. Stitching started unraveling. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Super cool. Looks even better in person.</li>
            <li> Got it for my daughter and she love it</li>
            <li> This item has very little room in it, so it is not ideal for a lot of things, such as text books and such, but is great for smaller items like notebooks, folders, and such.</li>
            <li> It is an eye catcher for sure but the flap that opens its a little stiff (since it is made to look 2D. One of the button fell off.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that for the price it does the job of looking nice and original</li>
            <li> Bought for my kids...They LOVE the bag!</li>
            <li> It is awesome but The bag itself to carry things is very small, Maybe a notebook and some pencils, my phone can fit in there.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> This is cute but had an extremely strong chemical smell that would not go away. I left it out on my balcony for a few days and it still had a really strong smell.</li>
            <li> I loved it. I saw the exact same bag for $88 dollars at the mall. This one was a fraction of the price and surprisingly good quality. An IPad and a small wallet fit just fine. It does have a smell when you open the package initially. Nothing that a little febreeze won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Step daughter loves her new satchel...  uses it everyday going to and from work...&lt;br /&gt;several nice comments on it from her co-workers...</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this bag is great.  However, it is a bit small and doesn&#x27;t fit much.  If you want a cute bag to wear a few hours out of the house, only using it to carry your phone, wallet, and other small things, then it&#x27;s fine.  I was hoping to use it for school, but it&#x27;s just too thin (I could only really fit some folders and spiral notebooks in it without stretching).&lt;br /&gt;Also, the picture isn&#x27;t as accurate as the real thing.  The side of the bag in the picture appears to be grey, while on my bag it appears to be tan.  It&#x27;s not that big of a deal and I still like the way it looks, but other people might not like this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not an official Jump From Paper bag, but it was close enough for the kid I got it for. The quality is fine and what i expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have complained about the smell. It did smell like similar cheap nylon products. Separately, the snaps have black rubber parts and that smell dissipated naturally after about a week. I washed it with hot water in the shower for about ten minutes and the nylon smell went down to a tolerable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and cute</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal: while the bag does look really cool, MINE came with a REALLY BAD SMELL. I contacted the company to complain of this and they told me that airing it out in an open room would get rid of the offensive odor completely. Well, it&#x27;s months later and guess what? After I left it sitting out in my open bedroom in a feeble attempt to expunge the stink, it still smells! I&#x27;m trying to get some use out of the bag now, but every time I carry it, I can sense this unholy fragrance. It&#x27;s kind of like...chemicals and plastic. I don&#x27;t want to risk washing it, so I may try to Febreze it. It&#x27;s disappointing, because the bag itself is really cool and totally looks 2D (I can&#x27;t comment on the durability yet, because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a day now - it did have a stray thread, but I snipped that). I&#x27;m also bummed because this thing not only emanates this bad smell, but contaminates the surfaces it sits on. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update when I&#x27;ve Febrezed. This may take care of the problem. Purchase at your own risk. If you don&#x27;t mind spending extra money, just spring for the authentic bags from the Jump From Paper website (these are knockoffs). After all, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my bag in the mail. I immediately traded out purses!!  I have gotten so many compliments.  The fabric is quite durable and is very easy to clean up.  I also love that it has an adjustable shoulder strap.  The bag looks exactly as the picture portrays.  If I had to choose a negative, the only thing that I think could be improved is the magnet buckles could be a little stronger.  Otherwise, this bag is everything I hoped it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this gift for anyone you know who is into anime cartoons, loves bags or is just a little bit quirky (like me!!)</li>
            <li> Looks just like in the picture - very cute! Not much space inside, but that&#x27;s been well noted by previous reviewers.</li>
            <li> very cool but only has space for a note book, and smell like cigarette smoke very hard</li>
            <li> looks great but the magnetic closure doesnt seem to line up right. the inside pocket also stained my light colored phone case</li>
            <li> This is a great bag but it&#x27;s not very practical for everyday use. I wish I could use it more often but it&#x27;s not roomy enough for school supplies. Although, it does have a lot more room than you&#x27;d think, so it&#x27;s perfect as a day bag or if you want to keep your wallet and other daily necessities in it.</li>
            <li> Bought for niece&#x27;s birthday.  It is cartoonish looking.  It isn&#x27;t high quality - but didn&#x27;t expect it to be (price).</li>
            <li> I thought it would have been 3d. I cant put anything in there.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;cartoon-ish&amp;#34; effect as much in person. Still pretty cute but really can only hold a notebook or tablet. Very small!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. The bag was everything we anticipated.  My teen girls LOVE their bags!! My daughter in college saw the bag and no I am ordering more!</li>
            <li> I get A LOT of looks with this bag, but it&#x27;s really not made for every day use. After a few hours, the buttoned straps started to curl, and a few days later the lining holding the buttons started to fray.</li>
            <li> I really like how it is made and how it looks. Shipping was really fast came a lot sooner than expected which is great. It is smaller than I though it would be but can fit a lot into it surprisingly which is amazing.</li>
            <li> Arrived early, about 2 weeks after I placed my order! Not a purse for someone who carries a lot, can probably fit a tablet, phone &amp; thin wallet.</li>
            <li> Love the bag. It&#x27;s a knock off of an expensive design but oh the great comments I get when I use it!!! It&#x27;s not made for tons of heavy junk. Perfect for the essentials</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold much, but is a visual bombshell.</li>
            <li> Very cute bag. My daughter loves it. I was worried about the size from the other reviews, but it&#x27;s perfect to use as a purse. It folds out on the bottom to make more room.</li>
            <li> It is very cute but the lining in the inside already started coming unraveled.</li>
            <li> The stars are mostly for the cuteness, but it&#x27;s definitely cheap and cheaply made, only had it for about three weeks and the materiel between the two sections has torn. I&#x27;ll probably overuse anyway because it&#x27;s just that cute, but definitely very cheap.</li>
            <li> I honestly expected this to be junk. But my daughter paid for it with her own money. I was pleasantly surprised! This is very well made for the money. She&#x27;s carried it every day for over a month. It actually looks 3-d!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be sacrificing carrying capacity for sweet style with this item, but it&#x27;s still an alright bag. A hell of a lot cheaper than other bags of this nature, so the price is perfect for how underwhelmed I was by the dimensions.</li>
            <li> The bad arrived much more quickly than estimated. Had a heavy gasoline like smell when I pulled it out of the packaging. The sad part was that it was dirty when it arrived. The bag had black smudges/scuffs on some parts of it, making it look used. But then againâ€¦it&#x27;s a cheap knock-off of a bag thats usually around $100, so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Color good. Arrived quickly. It&#x27;s really stiff and does not expand far enough to be useful except for carrying letters or something similar.  Purchased it for teenage girl - she hasn&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> I personally thought the bag looks smaller in person than what I was expecting.  But 14 year old daughter loves it. Good price, speedy delivery and cute.</li>
            <li> my daughter specifically requested this bag for a birthday present as trendy and was absolutely delighted with the quality. It&#x27;s hard to buy gifts for her, so I&#x27;m happy too.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool looking bag, trips people out every time my girlfriend goes out with.</li>
            <li> The fastest way to look like a despicable hipster weeaboo who is still mentally 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather small inside but it looks exactly like the photos and I really like it! Great for the price. I&#x27;ve been seeing these bags advertised for awhile and I&#x27;m happy I was finally able to buy one!</li>
            <li> My shipment came quickly, and I was very excited about receiving this bag. It looked great but smelled like plastic and was very stiff. Within a week the threading on the closures was coming undone and yesterday the snaps fell off entirely. But for the price it is decent</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! If you can be patient enough for it to get to you (it took about 3 weeks) it&#x27;s great! It does have a chemical smell right out of the package but that&#x27;s to be expected from the dye.</li>
            <li> Love the look of the purse! Yet, the purse smells like oil.</li>
            <li> Cute bag, nice design, and my sister loved it</li>
            <li> Super cute bag, looks just like the picture. It is kinda small, but I don&#x27;t carry much and it has a lot of pockets.</li>
