    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but if you want flawless skin and aren&#x27;t worried about side effect or expense see your dermatologist and get a prescription.</li>
            <li>There is a lot on the Web, but they ALL say that it is best to use them separately --</li>
            <li>That impressed me so that I purchased one for myself.  </li>
            <li>good luck to you all!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to see something working for her after all her frustration.  </li>
            <li>They were very nice about it.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>and already we can see a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li>A good alternative to accutane.</li>
            <li>I had good result with Blue-U offered by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much perfect for both of us.      </li>
            <li>The results were simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be great that I can do this routine at home comfortably while my dogs playing around</li>
            <li>The combination does seem to be more effective than either by themselves.    </li>
            <li>I would give it a good two months for full benefit.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I stuck with it</li>
            <li>After just using it three times my acne became more out of control than it had in years</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the results we are experiencing.</li>
            <li>Much better results than benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products alone have had.  </li>
            <li>If he misses more than a day a week he starts to break out again.    </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t experience any more sunburn symptoms after that.  </li>
            <li>I use my clearwave for fifteen minutes a day, making sure that the front of my face gets five minutes, and then the two sides get five minutes.</li>
            <li>I give it a 5-star rating because I believe every acne treatment with satisfying result deserves a 5-star.  </li>
            <li>I love how users share experiences with others so consumers are able to make better decisions.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny to me!!</li>
            <li>Acne are gone completely and my skin feeling great now.</li>
            <li>The product does a good job on acne when you can sit around waiting for it to get ready again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick with this light rather than use harmful drugs.</li>
            <li>otherwise you get purple light, which doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>also, light therapy doesnt ever &#x27;end&#x27;-</li>
            <li>anyways, light therapy worked for me when NOTHING-</li>
            <li>But for what it&#x27;s worth, what is most noticeable when you have acne is the zits, and when those are gone make up or a good facial product can take care of anything else.</li>
            <li>I really wish this company would make a dedicated, full-strength acne light as I was satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>my GUESS is that these at-home light therapy treatments are not quite as strong as the treatments you get at a dermotologist, which is why you have to do them more frequently.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fall for these phony, sales-agent-written positive reviews!!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for this light I decided to spend the money (worth EVERY penny) and try it out.</li>
            <li>He has been able to stop using all prescription creams because this blue light system works!  </li>
            <li>I have seen pregnant women receiving Blue-U at the doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of buying this light to treat my acne without first talking to my dermatologist about it.  </li>
            <li>It prevents new acnes from forming and makes the existing ones go away more quickly.    </li>
            <li>The reasons to choose this product over others are mainly Amazon&#x27;s great feedback rating and my personal experience with this technology.  </li>
            <li>I took the new one home and charged it and have had better luck</li>
            <li>Less than 5 products are listed as my favorite and being kept handy all the time today.  </li>
            <li>(they are smart enough to keep safe distance), listening to my favorite music, and even talking to someone on the phone.  </li>
            <li>A few of my friends told me how great the ClearWave was, so i decided to give it a trial.</li>
            <li>It is definately worth a try</li>
            <li>However, we continued to use the light and after about 4 weeks of daily use everything cleared up to a condition which is better than one could imagine.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the sub-$200 price tag.</li>
            <li>, its worth the self confidence i&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>It had been many years since I had acne-free skin, and I had nearly forgotten what it was like.</li>
            <li>I started using the light box less than a week ago and the results have been amazing.  </li>
            <li>I got the light because I had noticed that she did not break out during the summmer months, and hoped that using this light would have a similar effect, and it does.  </li>
            <li>The lamp has greatly improved my teen sons&#x27; skin, especially cystic lesions.  </li>
            <li>but I still can&#x27;t use it very much.  </li>
            <li>The first week of use</li>
            <li>We were at first hesitant to try, but the money-back guarantee made that decision easier.  </li>
            <li>I need to say upfront that I haven&#x27;t tried this EXACT product</li>
            <li>That stat seems consistent with what people are finding here.</li>
            <li>We are very encouraged!    </li>
            <li>This light helped me have clear skin once again.</li>
            <li>To be more specific, what this product did was prevent me from getting any zits, pimples, bumps, etc.</li>
            <li>I purchased Verilux ClearWave last year because my then most favorite treatment Ziana Gel (tretinoin/ clindamycin) started losing its effectiveness after two years of daily application.   </li>
            <li>I find myself most relaxed when I lie in the bed, with the lamp sitting on my chest, facing toward my face, supported by a yoga block strategically placed in between the pillow above my head and the edge of the lamp.</li>
            <li>I have tried more than couple dozens since I was a teen.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product review I write in my life.  </li>
            <li>In just a few weeks I have already experienced significant results on my face and back.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my skin tone after the first time I used it, but the real results came after a couple of weeks of continued use.</li>
            <li>and then it has to cool completely which takes time.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most other acne treatments, this method is very gentle on your skin with zero side effect.  </li>
            <li>If you notice, maybe one or two of the positive reviews may be genuine, but the rest are so similar and LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE BE WRITTEN BY THE MANUFACTURER!!</li>
            <li>The whole thing looks like a medical equipment with smooth plastic molding/ ejection line and durable power supply.  </li>
            <li>and it went away much quicker.</li>
            <li>light did help me and although it does not work as well as the prescriptions I mentioned earlier</li>
            <li>I tried everything from Walmart to Whole Foods (creams, gels etc.)  </li>
            <li>but I thought people checking it out might want to know about light therapy effectiveness overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done lots of research on this, as I used to have really persistent acne that didnt respond to any treatments, whether it was a change in diet, medicine, or face cleansers.</li>
            <li>( i just lay under a blue light with goggles).</li>
            <li>--my face broke out in places it had never broken out before.  </li>
            <li>and his skin is much clearer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I had acne for eight years and had used many different facial products and seen many different dermatologists that just didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>As for acne control not so much.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion I believe the hybrid light may not be concentrated enough to zap problematic acne.  </li>
            <li>What I can tell you is that this light definitely has reduced inflammed blemishes to almost zero.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this light for three months and it is the ONLY thing that has worked for my acne (23 years of it!).  </li>
            <li>Verilux is a pricy lamp for almost $200, but I have to admit it is very well-built.  </li>
            <li>After these last couple of weeks of using it myself, it has cleared significantly.</li>
            <li>I use Verilux ClearWave in combination with good skin care products, prescription gels (such as Ziana, Benzaclin etc), prescription oral antibiotics (such as Doxycycline) and smart spot treatment device such as Zeno.   </li>
            <li>First, there has been a marked improvement in my skins smoothness and youthfulness.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any new pimples and my skin is healing much faster than ever before in my life.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>When used at least 6 days per week for 15 minutes it does a great job at nearly eliminating breakouts and keeping skin clear for my 14 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>This light is not cheap and I can only assume that replacement bulbs will not be cheap either, that being said it is still cheaper than a prescription if your insurance will not cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The light indicators are not very helpful.  </li>
            <li>but all the reviews I found suggested there&#x27;s at least some kind of difference within a month.  </li>
            <li>and I normally have 2 to 5 inflammatory acne lesions every month when my hormone peaks.   </li>
            <li>I do not wake up or end the day with a new lump somewhere on my face.  </li>
            <li>The light definitely appears effective in turning back the clock and beats topical creams hands down!    </li>
            <li>My theory, the light has to pull out the bad stuff before you can see the good.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of reading about using red and blue light to help acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy this product or something similar pretty soon, as it seems like a cheaper alternative than my doctor&#x27;s office every month.</li>
            <li>In other words, you cannot rely on it solely without any other effective remedy.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Verilux ClearWave because I researched the available lit from medical journals etc, and the science behind it actually seems pretty sound.  </li>
            <li>Verilux has been selling these for years and have NO clinical data on this particular product - according to their customer service people - they only refer to some old research that was NOT done with their product -- DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!</li>
            <li>After using this light for 20 minutes daily now for over two months I have both good and bad to report.    </li>
            <li>I would have given this product five stars if I had become completely clear skinned but the closest I came was one week</li>
            <li>I have tried every over the counter product and prescription to get rid of my adult acne.</li>
            <li>but my skin tone has improved a lot and all of the old scars have faded.</li>
            <li>you have to keep getting it until you get old</li>
            <li>In addition, though my acne cleared in my 30&#x27;s, I have been suffering from Rosacea as an adult.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 14 year old son.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to make their skin pimple-free.</li>
            <li>I tried various products over the years and really didn&#x27;t want to use prescription-strength meds.  </li>
            <li>My daughter got this item and it cleared her persistent acne completely.  </li>
            <li>I still get breakouts everyday and the ones that I have the light does not seem to calm them down or take the reddness away.</li>
            <li>And very importantly, it costs very little for the long run.  </li>
            <li>Besides, it costs me about $300 only to enjoy clear complexion for as short as one and half month.</li>
            <li>I used it consistently every day for over a month with zero results, positive or negative.  </li>
            <li>The only products that have proven to keep my skin clear were antibiotics and the pill form of acutane.</li>
            <li>It cleared 90% in just two weeks (I also use MyChelle&#x27;s Clear Skin Serum once daily).  </li>
            <li>I searched and eventually found one site stating this happens very occasionally to people with particularly sensitive skin (me)</li>
            <li>I am a thirty something who developed acne for the first time in my life just a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>I have mild acne, and i usually get my acne for about a week once a month.</li>
            <li>I have discovered that I can cool off the unit quickly by using a cold pack like those used for your injured knee.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this light for three months and it is the ONLY thing that has worked for my acne (23 years of it!).  </li>
            <li> Verilux is a pricy lamp for almost $200, but I have to admit it is very well-built.  </li>
            <li> After these last couple of weeks of using it myself, it has cleared significantly.</li>
            <li> I use Verilux ClearWave in combination with good skin care products, prescription gels (such as Ziana, Benzaclin etc), prescription oral antibiotics (such as Doxycycline) and smart spot treatment device such as Zeno.   </li>
            <li> First, there has been a marked improvement in my skins smoothness and youthfulness.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any new pimples and my skin is healing much faster than ever before in my life.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When used at least 6 days per week for 15 minutes it does a great job at nearly eliminating breakouts and keeping skin clear for my 14 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> This light is not cheap and I can only assume that replacement bulbs will not be cheap either, that being said it is still cheaper than a prescription if your insurance will not cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The light indicators are not very helpful.  </li>
            <li> but all the reviews I found suggested there&#x27;s at least some kind of difference within a month.  </li>
            <li> and I normally have 2 to 5 inflammatory acne lesions every month when my hormone peaks.   </li>
            <li> I do not wake up or end the day with a new lump somewhere on my face.  </li>
            <li> The light definitely appears effective in turning back the clock and beats topical creams hands down!    </li>
            <li> My theory, the light has to pull out the bad stuff before you can see the good.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of reading about using red and blue light to help acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy this product or something similar pretty soon, as it seems like a cheaper alternative than my doctor&#x27;s office every month.</li>
            <li> In other words, you cannot rely on it solely without any other effective remedy.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Verilux ClearWave because I researched the available lit from medical journals etc, and the science behind it actually seems pretty sound.  </li>
            <li> Verilux has been selling these for years and have NO clinical data on this particular product - according to their customer service people - they only refer to some old research that was NOT done with their product -- DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> After using this light for 20 minutes daily now for over two months I have both good and bad to report.    </li>
            <li> I would have given this product five stars if I had become completely clear skinned but the closest I came was one week</li>
            <li> I have tried every over the counter product and prescription to get rid of my adult acne.</li>
            <li> but my skin tone has improved a lot and all of the old scars have faded.</li>
            <li> you have to keep getting it until you get old</li>
            <li> In addition, though my acne cleared in my 30&#x27;s, I have been suffering from Rosacea as an adult.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 14 year old son.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to make their skin pimple-free.</li>
            <li> I tried various products over the years and really didn&#x27;t want to use prescription-strength meds.  </li>
            <li> My daughter got this item and it cleared her persistent acne completely.  </li>
            <li> I still get breakouts everyday and the ones that I have the light does not seem to calm them down or take the reddness away.</li>
            <li> And very importantly, it costs very little for the long run.  </li>
            <li> Besides, it costs me about $300 only to enjoy clear complexion for as short as one and half month.</li>
            <li> I used it consistently every day for over a month with zero results, positive or negative.  </li>
            <li> The only products that have proven to keep my skin clear were antibiotics and the pill form of acutane.</li>
            <li> It cleared 90% in just two weeks (I also use MyChelle&#x27;s Clear Skin Serum once daily).  </li>
            <li> I searched and eventually found one site stating this happens very occasionally to people with particularly sensitive skin (me)</li>
            <li> I am a thirty something who developed acne for the first time in my life just a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I have mild acne, and i usually get my acne for about a week once a month.</li>
            <li> I have discovered that I can cool off the unit quickly by using a cold pack like those used for your injured knee.  </li>
            <li> In between uses pop it into the cold pack for half a minute and it&#x27;s good to go.  </li>
            <li> for my experience: The first few days I used it I looked and felt like my face was slightly sunburned, which makes no sense.  </li>
            <li> My face becomes less oily even after the first few sessions.  </li>
            <li> Being teens, they don&#x27;t always use it daily, but have still seen significant but not perfect results.</li>
            <li> When I looked in the mirror after those two weeks, I could hardly recognize myself because I didn&#x27;t think that clearing up my skin would make me so much prettier.     </li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me is little red marks after acne.</li>
            <li> it also has no negative side effects unlike the meds that are hard on your liver.</li>
            <li> I have done this every single day for 15-20 min each time.</li>
            <li> I still get an occasional breakout but they have all been smaller, less inflamed, and in locations other than my chin.  </li>
            <li> and then even though it was not very warm it would quit in the middle of the next 3 minute treatment.  </li>
            <li> I notice a change in skin tone and some slight peeling especially around my lips.</li>
            <li> A previous reviewer had noted doing it this way and it definitely worked for me as well.    </li>
            <li> However, sitting in the doctor&#x27;s office alone so frequently (3 to 4 times a week) and for so long (30-minute each time) is not a pleasant thing for me.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple, this thing works!    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an infomercial product right down to the fake \\&quot;Money</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because I think it could work for other people even though it did NOT work for me</li>
            <li> Other thoughts:  1.</li>
            <li> It is different from an ordinary cosmetic tool.  </li>
            <li> and I will report back if I ever get completely clear or if it ever fails to help.</li>
            <li> They are deep under the skin and hard to get rid of, even though Verilux does improve the appearance and makes it less visible.</li>
            <li> Soon I noticed my acne was much less severe</li>
            <li> and when I did break out it was much less noticeable</li>
            <li> and you should do less than the recommended 15 minutes per day.  </li>
            <li> I would say I have noticed a slight improvement in the number and redness of my breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The second week of use I broke out like crazy so following the directions I reduced usage to every other day for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It did not clean out my pores or get rid of my blackheads.</li>
            <li> I can use it 5 or 6 times before it needs recharging and much less wasted time.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I started going to my dermatologist for clearlight therapy, which i now continue to do once a month for 15-20 minutes</li>
            <li> I started to use this product 3 weeks ago, everyday, and already see improvements on my face and body.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of use my skin (not hers) became much worse and similar to what others have noted in past reviews.  </li>
            <li> I started using it a few days before my breakouts usually pop up</li>
            <li> and I have seen very little difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> After twelve weeks I still have two or three small blemishes</li>
            <li> The fact is that there are not many out there.  </li>
            <li> You are not able to use it for 15 minutes as some reviews have indicated.  </li>
            <li> I think that over time it will pay for itself when considering what I have spent on expensive over-the-counter acne treatments.  </li>
            <li> I mean common sense should have told me that this product over-promises and can&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> i mean NOTHING- else did, and even though i pay $90 a treatment (and i work for a nonprofit</li>
            <li> It is a scam and waste of money!!    </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, but his condition became so bad I was willing to spend the additional $200.</li>
            <li> Verilux is a giant thing which makes it impossible to travel with.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time consuming which is frustrating.  </li>
            <li> its really expensive, but OH MY GOSH it worked.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I guess I&#x27;ll toss it up on craigslist or make a really expensive planter out of it or something.</li>
            <li> It makes it inconvenient.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I bought this product for my sister who has struggled with acne for years.  She started to use it and noticed a difference after about a week.  You have to continue using it to maintian the results.  It&#x27;s great to see something working for her after all her frustration.  a</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne with a constant quota of four or five medium sized breakouts on my face.I have tried every over the counter product and prescription to get rid of my adult acne. The only products that have proven to keep my skin clear were antibiotics and the pill form of acutane. This light is not cheap and I can only assume that replacement bulbs will not be cheap either, that being said it is still cheaper than a prescription if your insurance will not cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just completeted the twelve week regiment recommended for maximum results. The first week of use I notice a change in skin tone and some slight peeling especially around my lips. The second week of use I broke out like crazy so following the directions I reduced usage to every other day for a couple of weeks. Soon I noticed my acne was much less severe and when I did break out it was much less noticeable and it went away much quicker. After twelve weeks I still have two or three small blemishes but my skin tone has improved a lot and all of the old scars have faded. I would have given this product five stars if I had become completely clear skinned but the closest I came was one week I only had one breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This light did help me and although it does not work as well as the prescriptions I mentioned earlier it also has no negative side effects unlike the meds that are hard on your liver. When I was on acutane I also noticed my gums started to receed which is another side effect. I think I&#x27;ll stick with this light rather than use harmful drugs. If you are uncertain this will work for you you can always return it but it did take time to work for me. I am glad I stuck with it and I will report back if I ever get completely clear or if it ever fails to help. It is definately worth a try but if you want flawless skin and aren&#x27;t worried about side effect or expense see your dermatologist and get a prescription. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of reading about using red and blue light to help acne.  There is a lot on the Web, but they ALL say that it is best to use them separately -- otherwise you get purple light, which doesn&#x27;t do anything. Verilux has been selling these for years and have NO clinical data on this particular product - according to their customer service people - they only refer to some old research that was NOT done with their product -- DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> I looked at a lot of different products before choosing this one.  I am a thirty something who developed acne for the first time in my life just a few months ago.  I tried everything from Walmart to Whole Foods (creams, gels etc.)  Nothing worked and the acne kept coming.  I started using the light box less than a week ago and the results have been amazing.  I haven&#x27;t had any new pimples and my skin is healing much faster than ever before in my life.  I use the box twice a day for about ten mins. each time.  Fewer zits and fewer wrinkles...what a combination!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Plain and simple, this thing works!    My girlfriend and I started using this product 6 weeks ago.  After about 2 weeks of use my skin (not hers) became much worse and similar to what others have noted in past reviews.  However, we continued to use the light and after about 4 weeks of daily use everything cleared up to a condition which is better than one could imagine.  Pretty much perfect for both of us.      My theory, the light has to pull out the bad stuff before you can see the good.  If you have any reservations about this product, dont.  We were at first hesitant to try, but the money-back guarantee made that decision easier.  Well worth the sub-$200 price tag.</li>
            <li> I need to say upfront that I haven&#x27;t tried this EXACT product but I thought people checking it out might want to know about light therapy effectiveness overall. I&#x27;ve done lots of research on this, as I used to have really persistent acne that didnt respond to any treatments, whether it was a change in diet, medicine, or face cleansers. A few years ago I started going to my dermatologist for clearlight therapy, which i now continue to do once a month for 15-20 minutes ( i just lay under a blue light with goggles). its really expensive, but OH MY GOSH it worked. and my doc told me it works on about 90% of patients. That stat seems consistent with what people are finding here. my GUESS is that these at-home light therapy treatments are not quite as strong as the treatments you get at a dermotologist, which is why you have to do them more frequently. also, light therapy doesnt ever &#x27;end&#x27;- you have to keep getting it until you get old (i&#x27;m only 27 so i guess i have a while to go!) anyways, light therapy worked for me when NOTHING- i mean NOTHING- else did, and even though i pay $90 a treatment (and i work for a nonprofit so thats a lot for me), its worth the self confidence i&#x27;ve gotten. I&#x27;ll probably buy this product or something similar pretty soon, as it seems like a cheaper alternative than my doctor&#x27;s office every month. good luck to you all!</li>
            <li> I have tried every product known to man to get rid of my acne to no avail.  In just a few weeks I have already experienced significant results on my face and back. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have to say I started this therapy on Oct. 20th this year and I have seen very little difference in my skin. I have done this every single day for 15-20 min each time. I still get breakouts everyday and the ones that I have the light does not seem to calm them down or take the reddness away. I am giving it a 3 star because I have still not given it the recommened 2 months so I guess I will pray for a miracle in the next month and see what happens. The plus to this is that it has the money back gaurantee and it is so quiet you don&#x27;t even know it is on. If this does not work then it is Accutane or Laser treatment for me.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne, and i usually get my acne for about a week once a month. A few of my friends told me how great the ClearWave was, so i decided to give it a trial. I started using it a few days before my breakouts usually pop up and I have noticed that the amount of pimples and blemishes i get during that time is reduced, to almost none on my face. I enjoy this product, and like that i don&#x27;t have to use harsh chemicals on my face everyday.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying this light to treat my acne without first talking to my dermatologist about it.  After just using it three times my acne became more out of control than it had in years--my face broke out in places it had never broken out before.  It took me two months of using medication from my doctor to get my acne under control. I would not recommend using this device unless a doctor says it would work for you.</li>
            <li> I started to use this product 3 weeks ago, everyday, and already see improvements on my face and body. Acne are gone completely and my skin feeling great now. The only thing that bothers me is little red marks after acne. They are deep under the skin and hard to get rid of, even though Verilux does improve the appearance and makes it less visible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working. My teenage son has been aggressively battling moderate to severe acne for a while, without any luck. After dozens of acne products, trips to a dermatologist, and prescription medications nothing had worked. I was skeptical of this product, but his condition became so bad I was willing to spend the additional $200. He has been using it daily for two weeks and already we can see a remarkable difference. We are very encouraged!    In addition, though my acne cleared in my 30&#x27;s, I have been suffering from Rosacea as an adult. I read that this could be used to treat Rosacea also. After these last couple of weeks of using it myself, it has cleared significantly. I am extremely pleased with the results we are experiencing.</li>
            <li> When used at least 6 days per week for 15 minutes it does a great job at nearly eliminating breakouts and keeping skin clear for my 14 year old daughter.  I got the light because I had noticed that she did not break out during the summmer months, and hoped that using this light would have a similar effect, and it does.  Much better results than benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products alone have had.  We have found that she can skip one day, but if 2 days are missed, breakouts reoccur. I think that over time it will pay for itself when considering what I have spent on expensive over-the-counter acne treatments.  We are now getting by with just an inexpensive Equate brand cleanser and a foundation for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 14 year old son.  He has been able to stop using all prescription creams because this blue light system works!  He uses it for 15 - 20 minutes a day, 6-7 days a week and his skin is much clearer.  If he misses more than a day a week he starts to break out again.    I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Verilux ClearWave because I researched the available lit from medical journals etc, and the science behind it actually seems pretty sound.  I gave it two stars because I think it could work for other people even though it did NOT work for me and I&#x27;m out $200.  All the info I found says it works for 3 of 4 people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my experience: The first few days I used it I looked and felt like my face was slightly sunburned, which makes no sense.  There&#x27;s no UV rays, no heat.  I searched and eventually found one site stating this happens very occasionally to people with particularly sensitive skin (me) and you should do less than the recommended 15 minutes per day.  I don&#x27;t know if this was reliable info but I went with that advice and only sat in front of the Verilux between 10 and 13 min per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any more sunburn symptoms after that.  In fact, I didn&#x27;t experience anything at all.  I used it consistently every day for over a month with zero results, positive or negative.  Maybe I should have stuck with it longer but all the reviews I found suggested there&#x27;s at least some kind of difference within a month.  Anyway, I guess I&#x27;ll toss it up on craigslist or make a really expensive planter out of it or something.</li>
            <li> This light helped me have clear skin once again. I had acne for eight years and had used many different facial products and seen many different dermatologists that just didn&#x27;t help. After reading the reviews for this light I decided to spend the money (worth EVERY penny) and try it out. The results were simply amazing. I saw a difference in my skin tone after the first time I used it, but the real results came after a couple of weeks of continued use. It had been many years since I had acne-free skin, and I had nearly forgotten what it was like. When I looked in the mirror after those two weeks, I could hardly recognize myself because I didn&#x27;t think that clearing up my skin would make me so much prettier.     I use my clearwave for fifteen minutes a day, making sure that the front of my face gets five minutes, and then the two sides get five minutes. A previous reviewer had noted doing it this way and it definitely worked for me as well.    To be more specific, what this product did was prevent me from getting any zits, pimples, bumps, etc. It did not clean out my pores or get rid of my blackheads. But for what it&#x27;s worth, what is most noticeable when you have acne is the zits, and when those are gone make up or a good facial product can take care of anything else. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to make their skin pimple-free.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for these phony, sales-agent-written positive reviews!! It does not work!! It is a scam and waste of money!!    Check Ance.org and the majority of actual users agree and give this a 1-Star on Acne.org and say it \\&quot;worthless\\&quot; or \\&quot;useless.\\&quot;    I mean common sense should have told me that this product over-promises and can&#x27;t deliver. Plus it costs a fortune for a two lamps in a plastic housing. It&#x27;s an infomercial product right down to the fake \\&quot;Money Back Guarantee\\&quot; which they won&#x27;t honor.    If you notice, maybe one or two of the positive reviews may be genuine, but the rest are so similar and LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE BE WRITTEN BY THE MANUFACTURER!! It&#x27;s either someone \\&quot;in their 20s\\&quot; or a \\&quot;concern parent\\&quot; who found this miracle solution.    AVOID!!! Don&#x27;t hand over your money to these crooks!!!</li>
            <li> After using this light for 20 minutes daily now for over two months I have both good and bad to report.    First, there has been a marked improvement in my skins smoothness and youthfulness.  The light definitely appears effective in turning back the clock and beats topical creams hands down!    As for acne control not so much.  I would say I have noticed a slight improvement in the number and redness of my breakouts.  I was hopeful that this would do the trick by itself but after using it exclusively for over 6 weeks I have had to resume my former regimen of 2.5% BP cream.  The combination does seem to be more effective than either by themselves.    In conclusion I believe the hybrid light may not be concentrated enough to zap problematic acne.  I really wish this company would make a dedicated, full-strength acne light as I was satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> I have had breakout&#x27;s since my teen years and I am now 26.  What I can tell you is that this light definitely has reduced inflammed blemishes to almost zero.  I do not wake up or end the day with a new lump somewhere on my face.  It definitely has a calming effect.  One thing to note though is that it will not treat blackheads, but will reduce unsightly bump numbers and severity. I would give it a good two months for full benefit.  A good alternative to accutane.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this light for three months and it is the ONLY thing that has worked for my acne (23 years of it!).  I tried various products over the years and really didn&#x27;t want to use prescription-strength meds.  My acne has been on my chin and never responded well to anything. It cleared 90% in just two weeks (I also use MyChelle&#x27;s Clear Skin Serum once daily).  I still get an occasional breakout but they have all been smaller, less inflamed, and in locations other than my chin.  Worth every penny to me!!</li>
            <li> The lamp has greatly improved my teen sons&#x27; skin, especially cystic lesions.  They had no side effects.  Being teens, they don&#x27;t always use it daily, but have still seen significant but not perfect results.</li>
            <li> Background:   I am 39 and I normally have 2 to 5 inflammatory acne lesions every month when my hormone peaks.   I purchased Verilux ClearWave last year because my then most favorite treatment Ziana Gel (tretinoin/ clindamycin) started losing its effectiveness after two years of daily application.   The reasons to choose this product over others are mainly Amazon&#x27;s great feedback rating and my personal experience with this technology.  I had good result with Blue-U offered by my dermatologist.  However, sitting in the doctor&#x27;s office alone so frequently (3 to 4 times a week) and for so long (30-minute each time) is not a pleasant thing for me.  Besides, it costs me about $300 only to enjoy clear complexion for as short as one and half month. I thought it would be great that I can do this routine at home comfortably while my dogs playing around (they are smart enough to keep safe distance), listening to my favorite music, and even talking to someone on the phone.  And very importantly, it costs very little for the long run.  How do I use it:  I use Verilux ClearWave in combination with good skin care products, prescription gels (such as Ziana, Benzaclin etc), prescription oral antibiotics (such as Doxycycline) and smart spot treatment device such as Zeno.   I spend 15 to 20 minutes on the lamp every night before I sleep.  I find myself most relaxed when I lie in the bed, with the lamp sitting on my chest, facing toward my face, supported by a yoga block strategically placed in between the pillow above my head and the edge of the lamp. (By doing this, the lamp is just 1 or 2 inches away from my nose).     The results:   1. It works.  My face becomes less oily even after the first few sessions.  It prevents new acnes from forming and makes the existing ones go away more quickly.    2. Unlike most other acne treatments, this method is very gentle on your skin with zero side effect.  I have seen pregnant women receiving Blue-U at the doctor&#x27;s office.  No burning, no peeling, no irritation.  Other thoughts:  1. Verilux is a pricy lamp for almost $200, but I have to admit it is very well-built.  The whole thing looks like a medical equipment with smooth plastic molding/ ejection line and durable power supply.  It is different from an ordinary cosmetic tool.  2. Verilux is a giant thing which makes it impossible to travel with.  In other words, you cannot rely on it solely without any other effective remedy.  3. I give it a 5-star rating because I believe every acne treatment with satisfying result deserves a 5-star.  The fact is that there are not many out there.  I have tried more than couple dozens since I was a teen.  Less than 5 products are listed as my favorite and being kept handy all the time today.  Verilux ClearWave is one of them!  4. I love how users share experiences with others so consumers are able to make better decisions.  This is the first product review I write in my life.  I hope it will help!</li>
            <li> My daughter got this item and it cleared her persistent acne completely.  That impressed me so that I purchased one for myself.  I charged it and tried to use it but had difficulty.  It would work once and then even though it was not very warm it would quit in the middle of the next 3 minute treatment.  The light indicators are not very helpful.  It would display numbers that were not explained in the manual and just beep constantly.  After waiting for a prolonged time it would work once and then quit again.  Finally it just did nothing but beep and not work at all.  I took it back to the store and they exchanged it.  They were very nice about it.  I took the new one home and charged it and have had better luck but I still can&#x27;t use it very much.  I can use it twice and then it has to cool completely which takes time.  It makes it inconvenient.  You are not able to use it for 15 minutes as some reviews have indicated.  It&#x27;s time consuming which is frustrating.  The product does a good job on acne when you can sit around waiting for it to get ready again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An update:  I have discovered that I can cool off the unit quickly by using a cold pack like those used for your injured knee.  In between uses pop it into the cold pack for half a minute and it&#x27;s good to go.  I can use it 5 or 6 times before it needs recharging and much less wasted time.</li>
