            <li>This is the best whitening cream out there I have tried them all</li>
            <li>This cream is excellent for controlling sebum, it has not caused a breakout, and it does indeed whiten..</li>
            <li>Excellent stuff!</li>
            <li>It is also excellent to use under areas you are going to apply highlighter to.</li>
            <li>It is suppose to be whitening but because I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a working aesthetician for years, and this product is great if you know how to use it.</li>
            <li>very good , I love it</li>
            <li>which is good and has really good effect on my face</li>
            <li>nice when just applied to the skin.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks really nice when applies on top on this.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product and would repurchase again.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this cream and how rapidly it absorbs.</li>
            <li>As well as sunscreen :) :)</li>
            <li>This product I love it</li>
            <li>I use it on my lids up to my brows, on the undereye over and under my Stila illuminating concealer to make me look more awake.</li>
            <li>Altogether a lovely product.</li>
            <li>a word of warning: Korean beauty products contain ingredients not used in most US brands, so</li>
            <li>It sort of makes me break out very mildly, or</li>
            <li>A transparent BB Cream, I love it because i dont like heavy makeup, is the best!</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t thrown it away because I do very much like the product</li>
            <li>It has an elegant blend of titanium dioxide that does not leave a white cast - like a Kabuki doll.  </li>
            <li>: Smells like paper mache, doesnt really moisturize skin if that is what you want.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t know what the hype is all about.</li>
            <li>I like it so much  thanks</li>
            <li>and I did not notice much change, if any.</li>
            <li>I did not see much of a difference, which is an observation not a complaint!</li>
            <li>This cream is amazingly light on the skin, not too heavy or oily feeling and is absorbed into the skin fast.</li>
            <li>This will forever become a new part of my makeup routine.</li>
            <li>I use this cream for a everyday and natural look and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I look completely matte!</li>
            <li>I order already second time..;)</li>
            <li>I have naturally, snow white skin without any undertones.</li>

            <li> Well, that and non-Koreans having no clue and being too lazy to look up the pigmentation of a specific REAL BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> In my case, the cream circles my eyes already illuminating them, and then I put some down the bridge of my nose and on my forehead and let it dry COMPLETELY before I apply cream, pressed, or loose highlighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and using this cream makes it appear as if I have on a sheer foundation!</li>
            <li> Great base for makeup!</li>
            <li> (See my other reviews).</li>
            <li> When washing my face, this cream and my Shu Uemura waterproof mascara are usually the last to come off, even with the 2-4-2 method</li>
            <li> This was not worth a penny of my money.</li>
            <li> It has a slight odor I would consider a &amp;#34;fresh and clean&amp;#34; smell, but it&#x27;s not very strong and doesn&#x27;t linger once applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> It develops an odd, cakey texture in some spots no matter</li>
            <li> My skin has been itching for a little over a month now, with a scaly patch.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wear this primarily around my eyes and as a highlighter base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> if you break out of have a bad reaction, it was probably due to an ingredient.</li>
            <li> but the whitening effect is just a few hours:(</li>
            <li> Sadly the percent of niacinamide is not stated in the ingredients</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t blame the product or say that it&#x27;s a bad product because it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working. I have been using  it for a month now and I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and using this cream makes it appear as if I have on a sheer foundation! I look completely matte! It makes your skin look great in pictures!</li>
            <li> very good , I love it</li>
            <li> This cream is amazingly light on the skin, not too heavy or oily feeling and is absorbed into the skin fast. I&#x27;ve used it as both a day and night cream and it works perfectly under foundation as well as by itself! It has a slight odor I would consider a &amp;#34;fresh and clean&amp;#34; smell, but it&#x27;s not very strong and doesn&#x27;t linger once applied to the skin. It is suppose to be whitening but because I have very fair skin I did not see much of a difference, which is an observation not a complaint! Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product and would repurchase again.</li>
            <li> One thing I can say..I love it..the smell, the texture and I don&#x27;t need to put a lot of this cream on my face just to take the dryness of my skin..its not oily which is good and has really good effect on my face</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t do it.  My skin has been itching for a little over a month now, with a scaly patch.</li>
            <li> Pros: whitens/brightens temporarily, alright amount for the price, came with a scooper thingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Smells like paper mache, doesnt really moisturize skin if that is what you want. It sort of makes me break out very mildly, or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know what the hype is all about.</li>
            <li> I like it so much  thanks</li>
            <li> This is the best whitening cream out there I have tried them all</li>
            <li> I use this cream for a everyday and natural look and I really love it. My skin looks healthy and soft when I apply it. It may take some time to get used to the smell. I&#x27;m rebuying this.</li>
            <li> I have naturally, snow white skin without any undertones. I&#x27;m combination oily and only get one or two pimples per month around the time of my monthly. This cream is excellent for controlling sebum, it has not caused a breakout, and it does indeed whiten.. However, the biggest drawback for me is that it tends not to absorb properly. It develops an odd, cakey texture in some spots no matter how well you pat or rub and seems prone to flaking off of your face around the chin and nose areas. I haven&#x27;t thrown it away because I do very much like the product and I&#x27;m trying to find ways around the consistency.</li>
            <li> This is a silicon-based mattifying cream that has moisturizing properties as well. It has an elegant blend of titanium dioxide that does not leave a white cast - like a Kabuki doll.  I love the texture of this cream and how rapidly it absorbs. Sadly the percent of niacinamide is not stated in the ingredients so I personally would only recommend this cream as a possible addition to an existing whitening/brightening regimen. As well as sunscreen :) :)</li>
            <li> This will forever become a new part of my makeup routine. My makeup looks really nice when applies on top on this. Great base for makeup! And even using the cream alone gives an appearance as if you have makeup on. And it lightens your skin a shade or two. Excellent stuff! I just wish the whittening effect was permanant but it&#x27;s only a temporary and washes off when you wash the skin.</li>
            <li> nice when just applied to the skin. but the whitening effect is just a few hours:(</li>
            <li> This product I love it I order already second time..;)</li>
            <li> Its only been a week that i been using this product, and i been loving it. It totally moisturizes my skin and brighten it.</li>
            <li> A transparent BB Cream, I love it because i dont like heavy makeup, is the best! And suitable for very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of whitening/brightening products. (See my other reviews). This was not worth a penny of my money. It made my skin feel gross and I did not notice much change, if any.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This cream did nothing for my complexion. Cream is very similar to creams you find at the dollar store. Very bad quality.</li>
            <li> I wear this primarily around my eyes and as a highlighter base. I&#x27;ve been a working aesthetician for years, and this product is great if you know how to use it. Reading a lot of low ratings on Korean cosmetics, it&#x27;s either whiny people who didn&#x27;t get what they imagined in their head or people who aren&#x27;t applying the products correctly. Well, that and non-Koreans having no clue and being too lazy to look up the pigmentation of a specific REAL BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;For my eyes (I too have had some problems with a bit of caking, but that means I didn&#x27;t apply it correctly) I use it on my lids up to my brows, on the undereye over and under my Stila illuminating concealer to make me look more awake. It is also excellent to use under areas you are going to apply highlighter to. In my case, the cream circles my eyes already illuminating them, and then I put some down the bridge of my nose and on my forehead and let it dry COMPLETELY before I apply cream, pressed, or loose highlighter. Altogether a lovely product. When washing my face, this cream and my Shu Uemura waterproof mascara are usually the last to come off, even with the 2-4-2 method lol&lt;br /&gt;And a word of warning: Korean beauty products contain ingredients not used in most US brands, so if you break out of have a bad reaction, it was probably due to an ingredient. Don&#x27;t blame the product or say that it&#x27;s a bad product because it doesn&#x27;t work for you. The BB Balm Beblesh has caviar in it, which would turn my face into Freddie Kruger&#x27;s, and I was heartbroken when I found out. It&#x27;s about knowing what you&#x27;re putting on your face.</li>
