            <li>They are much better now, he even will touch my feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that AmLactin has a strong scent - it&#x27;s fairly mild but it just isn&#x27;t pleasant at all.  </li>
            <li>And I have tried many brands over the years.  </li>
            <li>I love that AmLactin is not greasy and leaves no scent.  </li>

            <li>It has made a huge difference in treating the psoriasis on the bottoms of my feet, even more so than the prescriptions I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>I had first  bought AmLactin body lotion and was very pleased with how my skin felt and looked,  </li>
            <li>This foot cream is wonderful for my rough heels.  </li>
            <li>love that it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>AmLactin and are far more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the best foot product I&#x27;ve used, it gets rid of cracked heels, calluses, thick skin, whatever and leaves nice smooth feet.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t come in huge containers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>My feet are as smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>My feet are smooth without cracks.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for softening ashy callused feet when used daily!  </li>
            <li>Want smooth, crack and scaly free feet?</li>
            <li>Babies would be envious if they could see my feet, which I swear are almost as nice and soft and smooth as theirs are!  </li>
            <li>Was very happy with my first single product order.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry, cracked heels,  this product is absolutely the best You can buy.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was excited to see a foot creme therapy product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for someone who has dry feet or who likes to run around barefoot in the summer.</li>
            <li>It massages in nicely and gives me soft heels and toes.</li>
            <li>AmLactin is the most effective product I have found for dry, cracked feet.  </li>
            <li>However, a friend of mine suggested that AmLactin cream might be even more effective at treating the dry skin on my feet</li>
            <li>It dries quickly so I can put on my socks.</li>
            <li>Which in the past had been very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different kinds of lotions for my feet, but I&#x27;m in love with the AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy!  </li>
            <li>Good stuff for rough feet.</li>
            <li>course if the AmLactin works for someone while others don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s certainly worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>so I figured it was worth</li>
            <li>Can irritate other skin (like touching your face after touching it).  </li>
            <li>Plus it works pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Starts to work right away and is oderless.</li>
            <li>but this vendor ships right away.</li>
            <li>I have been plagued by dry skin on the heels of my feet for quite some while now; and I recently tried Eucerin Moisturizing Cream in a plastic tub with very good results.</li>
            <li>It probably does not cure the condition but it certainly improved mine 100%!  </li>
            <li>Keeps the calluses soft and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>Fantastic foot cream, I feel that they do a much better job than any of the other foot creams that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>This makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li>Now they are soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I noticed improvement in the first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not that consistent using it.</li>
            <li>My feet are as soft and smooth as they have been in 40 years.  </li>
            <li>What I found interesting is now that itâ€™s an over the counter cream, the price jumped and you now get smaller sized bottles.  </li>
            <li>This cream is wonderfully moisturizing and smoothes the harsh, dry skin on my feet without being sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, there is no need for other products.  </li>
            <li>It works great on dry rough skin.</li>
            <li>The AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy works great for my rough dry feet.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well, leaving his feet less greasy than other creams, and resolving the cracking more effectively than anything else.  </li>
            <li>I do wish there were a larger size available.  </li>
            <li>At 3 ounces, it goes fast and I am always working with the end of the tube.  </li>
            <li>but this makes it go fast.</li>
            <li>While it seems to work about as fast as Eucerin, AmLactin is not quite so greasy</li>
            <li>Like Eucerin, AmLactin does not have any real scent to it</li>
            <li>product really helps mine a lot.</li>
            <li>Seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very creamy.</li>
            <li>looked for years to find a product that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and really worked until this.</li>
            <li>After using this about once a day, before putting on socks on, it has really helped my feet.  </li>
            <li>Another reviewer writes that \\&quot;a pea size for each foot is plenty;\\&quot; and they are definitely right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while Eucerin moisturizing cream is a very good product, even for dry skin on feet, this is the product of choice for treating dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li>I ordered this hoping it would be a thicker version of the regular AmLactin lotion and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I guess if your heels don&#x27;t crack and your feet are just dry, this might work fine, but not for the tougher cases of heel cracking.</li>
            <li>Well, Amlactin is expensive, more so than the foot lotion, so when I ran out of lotion and saw foot creme was available, I said &amp;#34;cool, this should work even better&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical and small enough to carry around with you; and unlike Eucerin a very tiny bit each day does a very effective job.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried some other AmLactin lotions but the foot cream is the only kind that will work for me.  </li>
            <li>Works ok if you can get just a little bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it in stores locally, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Then i ordered the three-pack, and didn&#x27;t open them right away, and when i did, found that the cream has a very watery consistency (maybe old stock?)  </li>
            <li>I use it regularly to prevent heel cracks in dry weather (which is most of the time where I live).  </li>
            <li>The mornings after I pumice, I use a diamond file to smooth areas left coarse by the pumice.  </li>
            <li>this product seems to be the only one I have found that keeps my feet smooth, I use it on a daily basis</li>
            <li>The foot cream is exactly like the body cream that I can buy locally.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend completely!</li>
            <li>We use only once a day at night and wear clean white socks.</li>
            <li>Also it has a sort of sticky feel to it that I do not enjoy at all, whereas the other brands seem to be absorbed more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>we have not had it long enough to make an accurate assment at this point</li>
            <li>AmLactin is just as effective as the more expensive Origin cream, and it&#x27;s probably half the price.</li>
            <li>Rather than filing away the skin on your heel, this cream will clear up the cracks in a week or two.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need to use much to get the same effect.</li>
            <li>a tiny bit at a time is all you&#x27;ll ever really need.</li>
            <li>but since using this product my feet stay stay soft and suple.</li>
            <li>After a week of 2xdaily use my feet had the look of a young mans&#x27; feet.</li>
            <li>am 58 year old male.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will smooth your feet in a few overnight uses.  </li>
            <li>This is the only cream that really helped.</li>
            <li>I noticed that as I continued to apply this cream to my feet my psoriasis markedly improved, as well.  </li>
            <li>Like the old Brylcream ads used to say...</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using it twice a day my feet are soft.</li>
            <li>I had tried just about every dry skin cream available for my dry, cracked heels and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>This has done for me what no other foot cream has done - made my feet soft, even my heels.  </li>
            <li>Within a matter of days the heels of our feet were not only healed, they were soft and supple!  </li>
            <li>A great product, and too bad</li>
            <li>Used regularly, it keeps heels soft and prevents splitting callouses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Amlactin is the only product that fixed my problem.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my dermatologist&#x27;s office and I couldn&#x27;t find it locally so this is the best and least expensive way I have found to purchase it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find but worth the work - littleguysgal for Laurie&#x27;s Likes</li>
            <li>I normally have very dry, cracked heels but this cured me.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the Amlactin Foot Cream a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>I used to get 2 large units for a copay â€“ which was less.  </li>
            <li>It was a little pricey, but it worked really well.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This cream is wonderfully moisturizing and smoothes the harsh, dry skin on my feet without being sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, there is no need for other products.  </li>
            <li> It works great on dry rough skin.</li>
            <li> The AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy works great for my rough dry feet.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well, leaving his feet less greasy than other creams, and resolving the cracking more effectively than anything else.  </li>
            <li> I do wish there were a larger size available.  </li>
            <li> At 3 ounces, it goes fast and I am always working with the end of the tube.  </li>
            <li> but this makes it go fast.</li>
            <li> While it seems to work about as fast as Eucerin, AmLactin is not quite so greasy</li>
            <li> Like Eucerin, AmLactin does not have any real scent to it</li>
            <li> product really helps mine a lot.</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very creamy.</li>
            <li> looked for years to find a product that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and really worked until this.</li>
            <li> After using this about once a day, before putting on socks on, it has really helped my feet.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer writes that \\&quot;a pea size for each foot is plenty;\\&quot; and they are definitely right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while Eucerin moisturizing cream is a very good product, even for dry skin on feet, this is the product of choice for treating dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it would be a thicker version of the regular AmLactin lotion and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I guess if your heels don&#x27;t crack and your feet are just dry, this might work fine, but not for the tougher cases of heel cracking.</li>
            <li> Well, Amlactin is expensive, more so than the foot lotion, so when I ran out of lotion and saw foot creme was available, I said &amp;#34;cool, this should work even better&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical and small enough to carry around with you; and unlike Eucerin a very tiny bit each day does a very effective job.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried some other AmLactin lotions but the foot cream is the only kind that will work for me.  </li>
            <li> Works ok if you can get just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it in stores locally, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Then i ordered the three-pack, and didn&#x27;t open them right away, and when i did, found that the cream has a very watery consistency (maybe old stock?)  </li>
            <li> I use it regularly to prevent heel cracks in dry weather (which is most of the time where I live).  </li>
            <li> The mornings after I pumice, I use a diamond file to smooth areas left coarse by the pumice.  </li>
            <li> this product seems to be the only one I have found that keeps my feet smooth, I use it on a daily basis</li>
            <li> The foot cream is exactly like the body cream that I can buy locally.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend completely!</li>
            <li> We use only once a day at night and wear clean white socks.</li>
            <li> Also it has a sort of sticky feel to it that I do not enjoy at all, whereas the other brands seem to be absorbed more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> we have not had it long enough to make an accurate assment at this point</li>
            <li> AmLactin is just as effective as the more expensive Origin cream, and it&#x27;s probably half the price.</li>
            <li> Rather than filing away the skin on your heel, this cream will clear up the cracks in a week or two.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need to use much to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> a tiny bit at a time is all you&#x27;ll ever really need.</li>
            <li> but since using this product my feet stay stay soft and suple.</li>
            <li> After a week of 2xdaily use my feet had the look of a young mans&#x27; feet.</li>
            <li> am 58 year old male.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will smooth your feet in a few overnight uses.  </li>
            <li> This is the only cream that really helped.</li>
            <li> I noticed that as I continued to apply this cream to my feet my psoriasis markedly improved, as well.  </li>
            <li> Like the old Brylcream ads used to say...</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using it twice a day my feet are soft.</li>
            <li> I had tried just about every dry skin cream available for my dry, cracked heels and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> This has done for me what no other foot cream has done - made my feet soft, even my heels.  </li>
            <li> Within a matter of days the heels of our feet were not only healed, they were soft and supple!  </li>
            <li> A great product, and too bad</li>
            <li> Used regularly, it keeps heels soft and prevents splitting callouses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Amlactin is the only product that fixed my problem.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist&#x27;s office and I couldn&#x27;t find it locally so this is the best and least expensive way I have found to purchase it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find but worth the work - littleguysgal for Laurie&#x27;s Likes</li>
            <li> I normally have very dry, cracked heels but this cured me.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Amlactin Foot Cream a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I used to get 2 large units for a copay â€“ which was less.  </li>
            <li> It was a little pricey, but it worked really well.  </li>
            <li> The cream is thick and works quickly to moisturize dry feet.  </li>
            <li> This cream really softens and soothes dry and irritated feet without any greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> This product has finally ended my life long quest for a product that helped my dry, cracked feet!</li>
            <li> Seemed as though it sat on a shelf for long time before it was shipped.</li>
            <li> My 58 year old feet were a dried, cracked, scaly disaster area.</li>
            <li> Amlactin hand lotion and creme worked real well, the dry skin after a couple applications sloughs off, you can actually peel it off, very unsettling at first, but works</li>
            <li> Meanwhile I have purchased several other brands of foot creme at drug stores.</li>
            <li> For my dry, cracked feet, I have tried all types of stuff, cremes and lotions made specifically for feet and hand/body.</li>
            <li> Helps ongoing dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li> my feet dry and crack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> use Amlactin 3 to 4 times a week during the dry season and my skin&lt;</li>
            <li> Helps with dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has problems with dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Been looking and trying foot creams to use on dry, cracked and peeling feet.  </li>
            <li> I am also using on my feet once a day and have had no problems with dry skin on them.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dry itchy feet for years.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m diabetic and one of the issues I had was really dry feet.  </li>
            <li> Iâ€™d recommend this to diabetics with dry feet problems.</li>
            <li> Have been using Amlactin for years and it helps with all scaling and dry conditions of the feet.  </li>
            <li> When he is down to his last tube, he is there to remind me to reorder.</li>
            <li> If yours is dry, rough and itches you should try AmLactin.</li>
            <li> I was using something else to get rid of the rough dry edges on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps my rough, dry feet</li>
            <li> The Dr recommended it to me for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for me to help heal my feet (they were very dry and cracked).  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to treat persistent rough skin on my elbows.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding it locally</li>
            <li> I picked up a few samples at the Foot MD and was shocked after only  a couple of uses my feet started a transformation from dry, cracked and peel y to smooth and touchable.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> again AmLactin scores a few extra points for being less expensive--true</li>
            <li> I use it on my elbows and other problem areas...</li>
            <li> Now i use it every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Also some of the other brands of foot cream do not work since they do not contain the active ingredient in</li>
            <li> My heels were so dry that they were beginning to crack and hurt, within a few days of using twice a day</li>
            <li> I used it twice daily and the calloused thick skin on my feet began to improve.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my foot calluses down.</li>
            <li> , you get less cream but</li>
            <li> The foot creme works no better than all of the other zillions of products on the market.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;A little dab will do you!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My wife has trouble with her feet and callouses.</li>
            <li> I saw results within a few days.</li>
            <li> This is working well to eliminate the hard flaky skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> No more itching, no more ugly, gross overgrown thick skin.</li>
            <li> Thick and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> No more tough skin, no more calluses, no more need to beg forgiveness for not having the smoothest feet on the planet!  </li>
            <li> I suggest that any one with this irritating skin disease use this cream to help keep it in check.  </li>
            <li> my heals are like a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> My wife has always been troubled with callouses on her feet.  </li>
            <li> My husband suffered from super-dry heels that cracked, making walking uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The creme was very thick and is making it very difficult to squeeze it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> My feet were horrible, the heels were so tough that my husband complained that they scratched his legs.</li>
            <li> but because I find it so unpleasant that I avoid using it.</li>
            <li> Really, really bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has done for me what no other foot cream has done - made my feet soft, even my heels.  It is AMAZING and worth a try!</li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked heels,  this product is absolutely the best You can buy.  My dermatologist recommended when I did not like the prescription med he prescribed.  It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Was very happy with my first single product order.  Then i ordered the three-pack, and didn&#x27;t open them right away, and when i did, found that the cream has a very watery consistency (maybe old stock?)  Since i waited a month to open them, i didn&#x27;t bother to hassle with a return, and will use the product, hopefully the texture will not negate the effectiveness of the product.  Which in the past had been very good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for rough feet. My feet were horrible, the heels were so tough that my husband complained that they scratched his legs. They are much better now, he even will touch my feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of years ago and realize I have not yet used it up, not because it doesn&#x27;t work but because I find it so unpleasant that I avoid using it. I dislike both the way it smells and the way it feels on my skin.  Meanwhile I have purchased several other brands of foot creme at drug stores. Currently I have Gold Bond Ultimate Healing foot creme. I&#x27;ve also used foot cremes by Eucerin and Curel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of those I have tried seem to work as well as (or just about as well as) AmLactin and are far more pleasant.  It&#x27;s not that AmLactin has a strong scent - it&#x27;s fairly mild but it just isn&#x27;t pleasant at all.  Maybe it&#x27;s urea that I&#x27;m smelling.  I just don&#x27;t like it.  Also it has a sort of sticky feel to it that I do not enjoy at all, whereas the other brands seem to be absorbed more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course if the AmLactin works for someone while others don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s certainly worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Rather than filing away the skin on your heel, this cream will clear up the cracks in a week or two.  I use it regularly to prevent heel cracks in dry weather (which is most of the time where I live).  This makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Can&#x27;t find it locally. Used regularly, it keeps heels soft and prevents splitting callouses.  Without it, my husband&#x27;s feet bleed all over the floor.</li>
            <li> I have ben using Amlactin for over 10 years. It works great on dry rough skin. If yours is dry, rough and itches you should try AmLactin.</li>
            <li> Only product that works for me.</li>
            <li> AmLactin is the most effective product I have found for dry, cracked feet.  And I have tried many brands over the years.  My feet used to crack and bleed.  Now they are soft and smooth.  Every night before bed I apply AmLactin Foot Cream to my feet, then put socks on.  To make it even more effective, twice weekly I use a pumice in the shower.  The mornings after I pumice, I use a diamond file to smooth areas left coarse by the pumice.  I love that AmLactin is not greasy and leaves no scent.  I do wish there were a larger size available.  At 3 ounces, it goes fast and I am always working with the end of the tube.  It is so effective I use it on my elbows and other problem areas...but this makes it go fast.</li>
            <li> So much more effective than the lotion Amlactin. It has made a huge difference in treating the psoriasis on the bottoms of my feet, even more so than the prescriptions I&#x27;ve been using. A great product, and too bad it doesn&#x27;t come in huge containers.</li>
            <li> The foot cream is exactly like the body cream that I can buy locally.  Had to get this so I could compare the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The creme was very thick and is making it very difficult to squeeze it out of the tube. Seemed as though it sat on a shelf for long time before it was shipped.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued by dry skin on the heels of my feet for quite some while now; and I recently tried Eucerin Moisturizing Cream in a plastic tub with very good results. However, a friend of mine suggested that AmLactin cream might be even more effective at treating the dry skin on my feet so I figured it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I am quite pleased with this product. While it seems to work about as fast as Eucerin, AmLactin is not quite so greasy and I didn&#x27;t need to use much to get the same effect. Like Eucerin, AmLactin does not have any real scent to it and I like that; but again AmLactin scores a few extra points for being less expensive--true, you get less cream but a tiny bit at a time is all you&#x27;ll ever really need. Another reviewer writes that \\&quot;a pea size for each foot is plenty;\\&quot; and they are definitely right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while Eucerin moisturizing cream is a very good product, even for dry skin on feet, this is the product of choice for treating dry skin on feet. It&#x27;s economical and small enough to carry around with you; and unlike Eucerin a very tiny bit each day does a very effective job. Moreover, AmLactin is not as greasy as Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I used to use Origin&#x27;s Reinventing the Heel.  It was a little pricey, but it worked really well.  It kept my heels and feet very smooth.  For some reason, they quit making it and I was left looking for something that worked as well.  I found it in AmLactin Foot Cream.  My feet are as smooth as silk.  AmLactin is just as effective as the more expensive Origin cream, and it&#x27;s probably half the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it would be a thicker version of the regular AmLactin lotion and am not disappointed. It massages in nicely and gives me soft heels and toes.</li>
            <li> For my dry, cracked feet, I have tried all types of stuff, cremes and lotions made specifically for feet and hand/body. Amlactin hand lotion and creme worked real well, the dry skin after a couple applications sloughs off, you can actually peel it off, very unsettling at first, but works so well you get over it. Well, Amlactin is expensive, more so than the foot lotion, so when I ran out of lotion and saw foot creme was available, I said &amp;#34;cool, this should work even better&amp;#34;!  It  doesn&#x27;t!  When I run out of the foot creme, maybe before, I&#x27;ll be going back to the hand lotion/body creme, what ever it was in the pump bottle. The foot creme works no better than all of the other zillions of products on the market. I guess if your heels don&#x27;t crack and your feet are just dry, this might work fine, but not for the tougher cases of heel cracking.</li>
            <li> My wife has always been troubled with callouses on her feet.  This is the only product she ever tried that actually works at softening and reducing the callouses!  She&#x27;d love a lifetime supply!</li>
            <li> I order this for my husband and he loves it. When he is down to his last tube, he is there to remind me to reorder.</li>
            <li> we have not had it long enough to make an accurate assment at this point but my heels look better. and i have a bit of a scaly elbow and thats starting to look betteri just rub the excess on my hands there when i&#x27;m done with my feet.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My feet cracks and bleed but since using this product my feet stay stay soft and suple.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product.  I was using something else to get rid of the rough dry edges on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really helps mine a lot.</li>
            <li> Helps ongoing dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li> Best over the counter foot cream found.  We use only once a day at night and wear clean white socks. No cracks even in our heels all winter.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this foot cream to me a couple years back.  I&#x27;m diabetic and he wanted to make sure I don&#x27;t have cracked heels anything that could develop into a problem.  This is probably the best foot product I&#x27;ve used, it gets rid of cracked heels, calluses, thick skin, whatever and leaves nice smooth feet.  Plus it works pretty quickly.  I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it in stores locally, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy works great for my rough dry feet.  I had first  bought AmLactin body lotion and was very pleased with how my skin felt and looked,  so I decided to try their foot cream.  I think it&#x27;s the best foot cream for me.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by Pharmacist. I use it after showering when my feet are still damp. It dries quickly so I can put on my socks.</li>
            <li> Wife uses it daily&#x3D;loves it!</li>
            <li> My 58 year old feet were a dried, cracked, scaly disaster area. Really, really bad! I noticed improvement in the first application. After a week of 2xdaily use my feet had the look of a young mans&#x27; feet. It&#x27;s a shame it doesn&#x27;t help with &amp;#34;Uncle Arthur.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well. I&#x27;m just not that consistent using it.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my foot doctor as I have diabetes.  And I use every day.  My feet are smooth without cracks. I highly recommend this product.  It is all it is said to be.</li>
            <li> My wife has trouble with her feet and callouses. Untill the formula changes she is very glad to have this product.</li>
            <li> While I have used the lotion which is awesome I was excited to see a foot creme therapy product. I have to say they should call this foot cream oil as this is the runniest creme I have ever used. Works ok if you can get just a little bit. But because this is so runny you end up using more than you need or losing some do to spillage. I will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Keeps my foot calluses down.</li>
            <li> As advertised, fulfills all terms &amp; conditions set forth in its various  literature. Soothing, therapeutic &amp; safe. A Great product.</li>
            <li> Amlactin foot cream is the best !!!&lt;br /&gt;I am 58 year old male.&lt;br /&gt;I have foot drying problems in the winter every year.&lt;br /&gt;If I do not use some kind of lotion or cream my feet dry and crack.&lt;br /&gt;I use Amlactin 3 to 4 times a week during the dry season and my skin&lt;br /&gt;is crack fee.&lt;br /&gt;Amlactin is the only product that fixed my problem.</li>
            <li> Will smooth your feet in a few overnight uses.  Need to wear socks that won&#x27;t allow it to come out because you&#x27;re basically putting acid on your feet.  Can irritate other skin (like touching your face after touching it).  So, use with care.</li>
            <li> This foot cream was recommended by my podiatrist to help eliminate cracked heels. I found it to be very creamy. Helps with dry, cracked feet. A little goes a long way. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> No problems.  All was good.</li>
            <li> AmLactin Foot Cream is a very good cream to put on your feet after a bath.  Keeps the calluses soft and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference immediately.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders! I would recommend it to anyone who has problems with dry cracked heels. I saw results within a few days.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for softening ashy callused feet when used daily!  Thick and non-greasy.  Recommended by my podiatrist.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is wonderful for my rough heels.  Both my husband and I use it and love the results.</li>
            <li> Use it every day and am happy with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will like it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream I have used it for years.  The Dr recommended it to me for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good product. I had tried just about every dry skin cream available for my dry, cracked heels and nothing worked. This is the only cream that really helped.</li>
            <li> Want smooth, crack and scaly free feet? Then, this is what you want. looked for years to find a product that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and really worked until this. I picked up a few samples at the Foot MD and was shocked after only  a couple of uses my feet started a transformation from dry, cracked and peel y to smooth and touchable. They no longer scratched across the sheets when I got into bed,this cream was relief.</li>
            <li> AmLACTIN FOOT CREAM is  the best cream I have ever found for making my feet soft and smooth again.  I use this cream every night, every night, and cannot imagine my life without it.  No more tough skin, no more calluses, no more need to beg forgiveness for not having the smoothest feet on the planet!  Babies would be envious if they could see my feet, which I swear are almost as nice and soft and smooth as theirs are!  Wonderful stuff, this foot cream!</li>
            <li> Been looking and trying foot creams to use on dry, cracked and peeling feet.  AmLactin has done the trick.  I have been applying every night and covering with white cotton socks.  After about one week, there was a noticeable difference.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to treat persistent rough skin on my elbows. It works great! I am also using on my feet once a day and have had no problems with dry skin on them.</li>
            <li> My husband suffered from super-dry heels that cracked, making walking uncomfortable.  Standard creams like Eucerin were some help, but when our foot doctor recommended AmLactin, my husband started using it.  It worked very well, leaving his feet less greasy than other creams, and resolving the cracking more effectively than anything else.  I have started using it as well, with equally happy results.  Finally, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dry itchy feet for years. My dermatologist told me to use miconazole cream and AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy on on my feet.  After a couple of weeks, I went to using only the AmLactin Foot Cream though every month of two I use miconazole a day or two if my feet start to itch.  My feet are as soft and smooth as they have been in 40 years.  I have tried some other AmLactin lotions but the foot cream is the only kind that will work for me.  Also some of the other brands of foot cream do not work since they do not contain the active ingredient in AmLactin Foot Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I buy three tubes about twice a year. I have never been able to find it on the shelf of a drugstore and Amazon has the best price online if you have Amazon Prime free shipping.</li>
            <li> When I went to amazon.com to purchase AmLactin I didn&#x27;t realize they produced a cream - I had always used the lotion.  The cream is thick and works quickly to moisturize dry feet.  I use it every morning just before I put my socks on.  The cream does not make my socks sticky at all.  This is a great product for someone who has dry feet or who likes to run around barefoot in the summer.</li>
            <li> I love the Amlactin XL, and now I will add this to my foot care regamin. Great products! As a diabetic taking care of my feet is crucial. This is a God send.</li>
            <li> This cream works great on my feet.  I had suffered from psoriasis for a number of years on my left palm.  I noticed that as I continued to apply this cream to my feet my psoriasis markedly improved, as well.  I suggest that any one with this irritating skin disease use this cream to help keep it in check.  It probably does not cure the condition but it certainly improved mine 100%!  No more itching, no more ugly, gross overgrown thick skin.</li>
            <li> Does great on making my feed so smooth.</li>
            <li> Just what my podiatrist suggested.  This is working well to eliminate the hard flaky skin on my feet.  not greasy.  definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, there is no need for other products.  Within a matter of days the heels of our feet were not only healed, they were soft and supple!  I am no MD but I will never buy the garbage from the &#x27;premium&#x27; lotion brands!</li>
            <li> My podiatrist wrote a prescription, but it turns out that this is now over the counter.  AmLactin has done an amazing job softening my feet.  I apply it twice a day.  All calluses and even the corns are gone!</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m diabetic and one of the issues I had was really dry feet.  The podiatrist prescribed AmLactin foot cream (used to be by prescription only ) and I use it on my feet daily and now my feet feel like a babyâ€™s bottom.  What I found interesting is now that itâ€™s an over the counter cream, the price jumped and you now get smaller sized bottles.  I used to get 2 large units for a copay â€“ which was less.  Iâ€™d recommend this to diabetics with dry feet problems.</li>
            <li> This works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My heels were so dry that they were beginning to crack and hurt, within a few days of using twice a day my heals are like a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderfully moisturizing and smoothes the harsh, dry skin on my feet without being sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is fragrance free.  Like the old Brylcream ads used to say... \\&quot;A little dab will do you!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Have been using Amlactin for years and it helps with all scaling and dry conditions of the feet.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Amlactin Foot Cream a few months ago.  I used it twice daily and the calloused thick skin on my feet began to improve.  The calloused skin has not go away entirely, but there is improvement.  I purchased this item again and will continue to use it and hopefully see continued improvement.</li>
            <li> this product seems to be the only one I have found that keeps my feet smooth, I use it on a daily basis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different kinds of lotions for my feet, but I&#x27;m in love with the AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy!  It helps my rough, dry feet and it&#x27;s not greasy.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it had a minty smell instead of the blah, no perfume smell.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for me to help heal my feet (they were very dry and cracked).  After using this about once a day, before putting on socks on, it has really helped my feet.  I&#x27;m going to keep using this and I&#x27;m sure to see more improvements.</li>
            <li> Fantastic foot cream, I feel that they do a much better job than any of the other foot creams that I have ever bought. I would recommend completely!</li>
            <li> This cream has done wonders for my feet. I normally have very dry, cracked heels but this cured me. After two weeks of using it twice a day my feet are soft. Now i use it every other day or so.</li>
            <li> The absolute best foot cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s not easy to find but worth the work - littleguysgal for Laurie&#x27;s Likes</li>
            <li> The only stuff I use. It&#x27;s pricey, but makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This cream really softens and soothes dry and irritated feet without any greasy mess.  Starts to work right away and is oderless. I have had trouble finding it locally but this vendor ships right away.</li>
            <li> This product has finally ended my life long quest for a product that helped my dry, cracked feet! It was recommended by my dermatologist&#x27;s office and I couldn&#x27;t find it locally so this is the best and least expensive way I have found to purchase it.</li>
