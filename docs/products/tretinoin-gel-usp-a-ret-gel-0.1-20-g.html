            <li>This is the best Retin-A formulation I have ever used!</li>

            <li>I recommend a good moisturizing lotion every morning or whenever needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>also recommend purchasing a good moisturizer/sun screen product.</li>
            <li>feel that this product is what it is advertised to be and that it is of good quality.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get good service at this price anywhere else</li>
            <li>I have read also, that it works good on the turkey neck problem</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to use a moisturizer with this--</li>
            <li>I originally got retina micro which is an excellent product</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast, in great conditon, and this stuff is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Quite pleased and happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>product itself works amazing.</li>
            <li>I used to take isotretinoin pills which were absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Turns out this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin looked amazing after one application.</li>
            <li>But after applying this gel my skin looks amazing and all those acne bumps are gone.</li>
            <li>Experiment and the results will be amazing.</li>
            <li>then the prescription version I have used and has a more oily feel with and alcohol smell to it, however this stuff is legit, and is more effective then the prescription cream I&#x27;ve used for years at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more SATISFIED!</li>
            <li>The price is right and the gel works great.</li>
            <li>I should have known the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>This product has help maximize the results of having healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>Today is my fifth day and my skin is a lot better than it has been in years.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the gel though</li>
            <li>but then youll be okay</li>
            <li>so i stopped applying any more .</li>
            <li>The difference between this product and Johnson&amp;Johnson Retin A 0.1%(white cream) is that this is gel based(yellowish) and it dries your skin a lot more</li>
            <li>so you have to make sure to put on a moisturizer</li>
            <li>.025% is better for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason, this product is so outstanding</li>
            <li>advise everyone to make sure to research the reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li>and I love the sun in the spring/summer.</li>
            <li>Go sparingly, start on outer cheeks, working closer more tender skin (like around eyes)</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>so be sure to work your way up to it.  </li>
            <li>Since that means it is working, i was very excited.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal though so expect some very real effects, it&#x27;s the best thing you can do for your face.</li>
            <li>This gel is of a high concentration and is very potent!  </li>
            <li>love this product, but very strong stuff, but the results seem worth it!.  </li>
            <li>India is very famous for their technology and their drive for higher education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These Skinites were the most numerous, and were quite unsensitive and often made good use of oil for their own benefits.</li>
            <li>My order arrived promptly from the vendor, the product was packed well, factory sealed, not about to expire (as many are when you order online), and in original box with instructions.</li>
            <li>My skin peels quite a bit when I use Tretinoin, but it is easily exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, another race called the Acnites were not so easy.</li>
            <li>They easily took care of the oldest of the Acnites.</li>
            <li>I put on just a dab, so that I could test how strong it was.</li>
            <li>Please remember this is a strong strength.</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong</li>
            <li>the expiration date is fine.  </li>
            <li>I will have to give it a longer time period to review the fine line reduction aspect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also seen all kinds of age spots, fine lines, and roughness disappear in about 10 days.</li>
            <li>Use this witb the obagi blender and it has given fabulous results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Ok, I need to insert a WARNING here-this stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li>I found that .1 was far and away the most effective for me.  </li>
            <li>I was using obagi&#x27;s cream at first, and it was working pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eventually, the most talented of warriors banded together to form a war unit called the Salicypels.</li>
            <li>I really like it and will continue to use it until its all gone!!!</li>
            <li>I much preffer the consistancy of the gel over the lower dose, it does make for spreading even VERY easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very strong, I would not use this on my face unless I could tolerate .05% very well.</li>
            <li>most powerful warlocks raced up the stairs into the Treseus Temple, and as Catawba looked upon the destruction being laid outside the window of the Temple, a bright light surged through the city.</li>
            <li>This retin-A gel smooths on very nicely and is absorbed quickly and completely - so that I could apply a sunscreen over it.</li>
            <li>So anyways I hope this review was helpful to those who were interested:)</li>
            <li>and I received the product right away!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since Tretinoin is truely Rx-only, either this stuff is being stolen and sold here or it is just some cream that looks like a legitimate packaging.</li>
            <li>I think the exfoliation really made a difference in the product being able to do its job.</li>
            <li>But definitely  would not be good for acne because it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
            <li>I quickly learned to put a good moisturizer and extra vitamin E oil.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly, which is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>when I saw this deal of 20g of tretinoin gel for half the price of cream, I thought that it was a great deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pores has shrunk within just about a week of use and wrinkles are looking better not to mention acne is pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li>Although it took 3 weeks for it to come to me, it was all worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>So I was surprised to see they were able to sell this product online without</li>
            <li>More young looking skin, wrinkle repair,</li>
            <li>I will buy from Benjays again when I need a fresh tube.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Right after I turned 26 my skin started to break out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However... even a few of the Acnite lords were powerful enough to defeat a great many warriors.</li>
            <li>I think it is well worth having dry skin for those weeks because after that the skin looks amazing</li>
            <li>Also, I made sure to use Cetaphil or a mild facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>There is a slight stinging, and some redness, and at this time I am shedding pretty good.</li>
            <li>This gel however is very strong and only about a drop for the whole face should do.</li>
            <li>First consult your dermatologist before using this product.</li>
            <li>and yes its a real pharmaceutical manufacturer that is worth over $25 million and does business in the United States as well.&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I finally ordered Tretinoin Gel.</li>
            <li>You will peel the first week or so</li>
            <li>just be sure to use it only at night and use moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written about a product after hundreds of buys on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have formerly used Tretinoin Gel from Obagi and been satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to find the same product at a better price.  </li>
            <li>chose the higher strength as I knew my skin needed and could handle the higher strength.</li>
            <li>and it is ONLY AVAILABLE BY PERSCRIPTION!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would urge people to get an Rx from your doctor for Retin-A (there is generic versions available and it is even CHEAPER than this stuff!)</li>
            <li>Use that form first if you are a first time user.</li>
            <li>But for most it is a getting used to it, and easing back until you can use it.</li>
            <li>Soft , smooth, and even.  </li>
            <li>I got the Gel and decided to apply it after my \\&quot;Hot Yoga\\&quot; class.</li>
            <li>I will continue to apply it after my \\&quot;hot yoga\\&quot; classes.  </li>
            <li>I did experience peeling/redness the first week or so, but kept with it (I am used to the effects of retina products and knew it would subside)</li>
            <li>After the gel seemed to be dry, I felt my face really tightening, It had a really nice shine and glow.</li>
            <li>I use it in very small amounts because of its potency and got great results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if really works, because I used for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I used a little \\&quot;bare minerals\\&quot; and was really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The entire legion of Acnites was burned to a crisp, and the light bestowed its vibrance upon the scarred lands.</li>
            <li>And as for the people who are upset this comes from India, let me assure you that India has tons of smart people and there are no reasons why you should not trust their pharmaceutical companies.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing, and a pure form of Tretinoin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 34 years young, but already could see fine lines around my eyes, and smile lines forming.</li>
            <li>That is why there are bad reviews...but the good news is RetA is amazing and nothing you can buy will even come close to the results you get from it.</li>
            <li>but I also had a huge area of my skin turn very red and</li>
            <li>omg my face looks so much clearer</li>
            <li>(Althout the alcohol smell is a bit much)</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin that is very acne prone.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this product.</li>
            <li>Rx Retin-A really does work well on acne and winkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adapalene gel did cause some peeling, but not as much as Tretinoin.  </li>
            <li>That was a bit too much and my skin started peeling.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than Retin-A Micro.</li>
            <li>I felt that my skin on my face really looked great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know the benefits to this product</li>
            <li>bought this from Benjays, and it was delivered extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Some days later, the scarred lands would no longer harbor the marks of destruction, and would once again shine a glorious light of civilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I now use it every night without problem and it has really done wonders.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and you should be aware that if YOU do, start with the lower strength.</li>
            <li>The dermatologist gave me the Tretinoin gel for $5,with my dad&#x27;s insurance, now that I am older the place is now charging me $50.</li>
            <li>Keep out of the sun or use a high sunblock.</li>
            <li>if you find the product is too strong use every other day.</li>
            <li>I have already had very satisfactory results to clear acne and to achieve an over all chemical exfoliation of my face.</li>
            <li>, I had some scaling (which tretinoin normally does)</li>
            <li>Not only do I not get any acne, but my skin is softer, pores are smaller, and fine lines are noticeably softer as well</li>
            <li>I live in the Southeast</li>
            <li>Exfoliating also encourages blood-flow and new skin cell growth.  </li>
            <li>If your skin is very sensitive, I would not recommend doing this.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think i can put it on my face more than a couple of times a week because of the excessive peeling,renewal process.</li>
            <li>Use the lesser % for first time user, or \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it with something (face cream) if you bought it by mistake.</li>
            <li>There are a very low % of people with too tender of skin to use it, be aware of that.</li>
            <li>Warriors, that the Skinite race simply could not spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, unchallenged by any power, the Acnites marched to the last location of the Skinites civilization, where most of the remaining Skinite population had gathered to form one last stand.</li>
            <li>no matter what I tried, it was dull and blotchie with uneven tones, I have only been using the Tretinon Gel for about 2 weeks and so far my skin is looking radiant and almost flawless.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the oily texture, considering the lower concentrations are a much lighter gel, but some online research revealed that this is normal, that this strength just requires a different medium, basically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought my skin would remain clear after that, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Makeup/cover-up can only do so much for you but after a while you get depressed when you no longer can hide acne bumps and marks.</li>
            <li>This was available at such a low price and this stuff actually works.  </li>
            <li>You really should not need a stronger facial wash with this</li>
            <li>Although, Adapalene (Differin) gel didn&#x27;t clear up my acne completely it did noticeably improve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unexpectedly, this also seems to be lessening the appearance of my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I see my acne improving considerably.  </li>
            <li>I feel that it may even clear it up completely.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from really oily facial skin the so-called T-zone.</li>
            <li>I went on all day hikes with sunblock and had no trouble.</li>
            <li>I have used it with no problems so far.</li>
            <li>After 4 applications I saw a marked improvement in my skin, including the shrinking of my lake-size pores.</li>
            <li>Priestess Catawba prayed to the God of Peeling, Treseus, to save the Skinites race from complete destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a small cut on my finger and felt some chemical light burn.</li>
            <li>If drying/irritation occurs mix it or top the application off with your regular facial moisturizer and spread out the applications to every other night or every third night.</li>
            <li>It was not pleasant, but after about 10 days of peeling, my skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>This product is half the price of Obagi medical tretinoin cream USP 0.1%, but about 10 times less effective.</li>
            <li>This was much more reasonable for $80 but still on the expensive side.  </li>
            <li>It has also been almost a year since I used a prescription grade skin product, so I wanted something that could quickly cut through the dead layer</li>
            <li>The only product that works quickly to clear my skin!</li>
            <li>This Gel is clear and I use it with the Obaji Blender daily.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne, especially in my face and chest area.</li>
            <li>This product was sent with an expired date and is all yellow and old.  </li>
            <li>The key is really to stick it out the first couple weeks and only use no more than a PEA SIZED amount.</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant due to some of the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the nodules I am experiencing now are far smaller and fewer than when I went on Isotretinoin last</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see any changes for the first two nights(my face just broke out a little bit);that is</li>
            <li>when i washed my face on that night, my whole face was totally peeling and my skin was very very soft and a little red</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user, be careful; this cream is going to dry the skin for about 2 weeks.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The difference between this product and Johnson&amp;Johnson Retin A 0.1%(white cream) is that this is gel based(yellowish) and it dries your skin a lot more</li>
            <li> so you have to make sure to put on a moisturizer</li>
            <li> .025% is better for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason, this product is so outstanding</li>
            <li> advise everyone to make sure to research the reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> and I love the sun in the spring/summer.</li>
            <li> Go sparingly, start on outer cheeks, working closer more tender skin (like around eyes)</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> so be sure to work your way up to it.  </li>
            <li> Since that means it is working, i was very excited.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal though so expect some very real effects, it&#x27;s the best thing you can do for your face.</li>
            <li> This gel is of a high concentration and is very potent!  </li>
            <li> love this product, but very strong stuff, but the results seem worth it!.  </li>
            <li> India is very famous for their technology and their drive for higher education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These Skinites were the most numerous, and were quite unsensitive and often made good use of oil for their own benefits.</li>
            <li> My order arrived promptly from the vendor, the product was packed well, factory sealed, not about to expire (as many are when you order online), and in original box with instructions.</li>
            <li> My skin peels quite a bit when I use Tretinoin, but it is easily exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, another race called the Acnites were not so easy.</li>
            <li> They easily took care of the oldest of the Acnites.</li>
            <li> I put on just a dab, so that I could test how strong it was.</li>
            <li> Please remember this is a strong strength.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong</li>
            <li> the expiration date is fine.  </li>
            <li> I will have to give it a longer time period to review the fine line reduction aspect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also seen all kinds of age spots, fine lines, and roughness disappear in about 10 days.</li>
            <li> Use this witb the obagi blender and it has given fabulous results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: Ok, I need to insert a WARNING here-this stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li> I found that .1 was far and away the most effective for me.  </li>
            <li> I was using obagi&#x27;s cream at first, and it was working pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually, the most talented of warriors banded together to form a war unit called the Salicypels.</li>
            <li> I really like it and will continue to use it until its all gone!!!</li>
            <li> I much preffer the consistancy of the gel over the lower dose, it does make for spreading even VERY easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very strong, I would not use this on my face unless I could tolerate .05% very well.</li>
            <li> most powerful warlocks raced up the stairs into the Treseus Temple, and as Catawba looked upon the destruction being laid outside the window of the Temple, a bright light surged through the city.</li>
            <li> This retin-A gel smooths on very nicely and is absorbed quickly and completely - so that I could apply a sunscreen over it.</li>
            <li> So anyways I hope this review was helpful to those who were interested:)</li>
            <li> and I received the product right away!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since Tretinoin is truely Rx-only, either this stuff is being stolen and sold here or it is just some cream that looks like a legitimate packaging.</li>
            <li> I think the exfoliation really made a difference in the product being able to do its job.</li>
            <li> But definitely  would not be good for acne because it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
            <li> I quickly learned to put a good moisturizer and extra vitamin E oil.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, which is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> when I saw this deal of 20g of tretinoin gel for half the price of cream, I thought that it was a great deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pores has shrunk within just about a week of use and wrinkles are looking better not to mention acne is pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> Although it took 3 weeks for it to come to me, it was all worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> So I was surprised to see they were able to sell this product online without</li>
            <li> More young looking skin, wrinkle repair,</li>
            <li> I will buy from Benjays again when I need a fresh tube.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Right after I turned 26 my skin started to break out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However... even a few of the Acnite lords were powerful enough to defeat a great many warriors.</li>
            <li> I think it is well worth having dry skin for those weeks because after that the skin looks amazing</li>
            <li> Also, I made sure to use Cetaphil or a mild facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> There is a slight stinging, and some redness, and at this time I am shedding pretty good.</li>
            <li> This gel however is very strong and only about a drop for the whole face should do.</li>
            <li> First consult your dermatologist before using this product.</li>
            <li> and yes its a real pharmaceutical manufacturer that is worth over $25 million and does business in the United States as well.&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I finally ordered Tretinoin Gel.</li>
            <li> You will peel the first week or so</li>
            <li> just be sure to use it only at night and use moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written about a product after hundreds of buys on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have formerly used Tretinoin Gel from Obagi and been satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to find the same product at a better price.  </li>
            <li> chose the higher strength as I knew my skin needed and could handle the higher strength.</li>
            <li> and it is ONLY AVAILABLE BY PERSCRIPTION!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would urge people to get an Rx from your doctor for Retin-A (there is generic versions available and it is even CHEAPER than this stuff!)</li>
            <li> Use that form first if you are a first time user.</li>
            <li> But for most it is a getting used to it, and easing back until you can use it.</li>
            <li> Soft , smooth, and even.  </li>
            <li> I got the Gel and decided to apply it after my \\&quot;Hot Yoga\\&quot; class.</li>
            <li> I will continue to apply it after my \\&quot;hot yoga\\&quot; classes.  </li>
            <li> I did experience peeling/redness the first week or so, but kept with it (I am used to the effects of retina products and knew it would subside)</li>
            <li> After the gel seemed to be dry, I felt my face really tightening, It had a really nice shine and glow.</li>
            <li> I use it in very small amounts because of its potency and got great results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if really works, because I used for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I used a little \\&quot;bare minerals\\&quot; and was really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The entire legion of Acnites was burned to a crisp, and the light bestowed its vibrance upon the scarred lands.</li>
            <li> And as for the people who are upset this comes from India, let me assure you that India has tons of smart people and there are no reasons why you should not trust their pharmaceutical companies.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing, and a pure form of Tretinoin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 34 years young, but already could see fine lines around my eyes, and smile lines forming.</li>
            <li> That is why there are bad reviews...but the good news is RetA is amazing and nothing you can buy will even come close to the results you get from it.</li>
            <li> but I also had a huge area of my skin turn very red and</li>
            <li> omg my face looks so much clearer</li>
            <li> (Althout the alcohol smell is a bit much)</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin that is very acne prone.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product.</li>
            <li> Rx Retin-A really does work well on acne and winkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adapalene gel did cause some peeling, but not as much as Tretinoin.  </li>
            <li> That was a bit too much and my skin started peeling.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than Retin-A Micro.</li>
            <li> I felt that my skin on my face really looked great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know the benefits to this product</li>
            <li> bought this from Benjays, and it was delivered extremely fast.</li>
            <li> Some days later, the scarred lands would no longer harbor the marks of destruction, and would once again shine a glorious light of civilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I now use it every night without problem and it has really done wonders.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and you should be aware that if YOU do, start with the lower strength.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist gave me the Tretinoin gel for $5,with my dad&#x27;s insurance, now that I am older the place is now charging me $50.</li>
            <li> Keep out of the sun or use a high sunblock.</li>
            <li> if you find the product is too strong use every other day.</li>
            <li> I have already had very satisfactory results to clear acne and to achieve an over all chemical exfoliation of my face.</li>
            <li> , I had some scaling (which tretinoin normally does)</li>
            <li> Not only do I not get any acne, but my skin is softer, pores are smaller, and fine lines are noticeably softer as well</li>
            <li> I live in the Southeast</li>
            <li> Exfoliating also encourages blood-flow and new skin cell growth.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is very sensitive, I would not recommend doing this.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think i can put it on my face more than a couple of times a week because of the excessive peeling,renewal process.</li>
            <li> Use the lesser % for first time user, or \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it with something (face cream) if you bought it by mistake.</li>
            <li> There are a very low % of people with too tender of skin to use it, be aware of that.</li>
            <li> Warriors, that the Skinite race simply could not spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, unchallenged by any power, the Acnites marched to the last location of the Skinites civilization, where most of the remaining Skinite population had gathered to form one last stand.</li>
            <li> no matter what I tried, it was dull and blotchie with uneven tones, I have only been using the Tretinon Gel for about 2 weeks and so far my skin is looking radiant and almost flawless.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the oily texture, considering the lower concentrations are a much lighter gel, but some online research revealed that this is normal, that this strength just requires a different medium, basically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought my skin would remain clear after that, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Makeup/cover-up can only do so much for you but after a while you get depressed when you no longer can hide acne bumps and marks.</li>
            <li> This was available at such a low price and this stuff actually works.  </li>
            <li> You really should not need a stronger facial wash with this</li>
            <li> Although, Adapalene (Differin) gel didn&#x27;t clear up my acne completely it did noticeably improve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unexpectedly, this also seems to be lessening the appearance of my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I see my acne improving considerably.  </li>
            <li> I feel that it may even clear it up completely.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from really oily facial skin the so-called T-zone.</li>
            <li> I went on all day hikes with sunblock and had no trouble.</li>
            <li> I have used it with no problems so far.</li>
            <li> After 4 applications I saw a marked improvement in my skin, including the shrinking of my lake-size pores.</li>
            <li> Priestess Catawba prayed to the God of Peeling, Treseus, to save the Skinites race from complete destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a small cut on my finger and felt some chemical light burn.</li>
            <li> If drying/irritation occurs mix it or top the application off with your regular facial moisturizer and spread out the applications to every other night or every third night.</li>
            <li> It was not pleasant, but after about 10 days of peeling, my skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product is half the price of Obagi medical tretinoin cream USP 0.1%, but about 10 times less effective.</li>
            <li> This was much more reasonable for $80 but still on the expensive side.  </li>
            <li> It has also been almost a year since I used a prescription grade skin product, so I wanted something that could quickly cut through the dead layer</li>
            <li> The only product that works quickly to clear my skin!</li>
            <li> This Gel is clear and I use it with the Obaji Blender daily.  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne, especially in my face and chest area.</li>
            <li> This product was sent with an expired date and is all yellow and old.  </li>
            <li> The key is really to stick it out the first couple weeks and only use no more than a PEA SIZED amount.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant due to some of the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the nodules I am experiencing now are far smaller and fewer than when I went on Isotretinoin last</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see any changes for the first two nights(my face just broke out a little bit);that is</li>
            <li> when i washed my face on that night, my whole face was totally peeling and my skin was very very soft and a little red</li>
            <li> If you are a first time user, be careful; this cream is going to dry the skin for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m peeling gently but thoroughly, with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> On the way home, I gently rubbed in around on my face and felt a small amount of exfoliation taking place.</li>
            <li> My pores are greately reduced in size and my dark spots are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> It is true that is has an oily texture, but once you apply it on your face it vanishes within minutes and does not leave behind an oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over two Weeks, the first week my face was peeling, burned a little and my acne flair up.  </li>
            <li> One more thing...stay away from sun and do not go crazy applying the gel everywhere.</li>
            <li> when you get red and your face peels the first time, that&#x27;s normal (but I can&#x27;t stress enough to go slowly with this product, you could very seriously burn your face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was a little skeptical as to if it really has the same strength as the real one that i used about a year ago.</li>
            <li> The small 20g tube will last a LONG time because you only need a tiny dot for each boil/pimple/acne spot.</li>
            <li> other financial research etc.</li>
            <li> But the trick is to use it every other night or every third night when skin starts to peel.</li>
            <li> Also since it only requires such small amount per application, one tube will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> Also keep in mind this will dry out ur skin which means its working, so</li>
            <li> used a stronger product, only if I needed to remove make up.&lt;br /&gt;I am blessed with few wrinkles, but I am hoping with regular use, I will have no worries.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it has only been about 6 months since my last round.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because of the low price, but this is indeed .1% tretinoin and</li>
            <li> Start off every third night or so, and it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it with a little moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is peeling and a little red.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things, it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> , my face was not peeling as i had expected.</li>
            <li> but nothing seemed to work remotely as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Amazon allows the sale of foreign skincare medications on their web site.</li>
            <li> Use a pea sized amount or so every night or every other night depending on ur skins need.  </li>
            <li> I have used various dermatologist prescriptions in the past and was prepared for peeling.</li>
            <li> When I saw this, I thought-I have nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;Now, please note that I have used other retinol products and use 20% C-serum as well.</li>
            <li> Other races existed, but the Skinites were at peace with most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your skin gets too dry, try mixing the gel with a little bit of Vaseline.</li>
            <li> In future I will only apply a thin film once a week, that should suffice.</li>
            <li> If these gels ARE tretinoin, which I doubt, then they must be much stronger than Obagi&#x27;s tretinoin cream, because ALL night I was feeling an uncomfortable burning on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have to wait at least six months after my last dose of Isotretinoin to have any ablative laser resurfacing done.  </li>
            <li> But you people who left negative feedback about these issues should have read up before you ordered, because this is what is supposed to happen.</li>
            <li> Even with my thick, non-reactive skin, I&#x27;ve gotten massive shedding, peeling and some discomfort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t easy to get 4 1/2 stars out of 5 with all the crazy reviewers looking  to negatively review a product if it isn&#x27;t a miracle cure, so you know that says something about this product.</li>
            <li> The battle began, fire rained down from the skies, and arrows blocked the sun...</li>
            <li> but I went ahead and ordered A-Ret 0.1% which is slightly stronger.</li>
            <li> Tretinoin is not a quick solution.</li>
            <li> Half of the Skinite&#x27;s land was covered in these marks, the scars of the destruction laid by the Acnites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it starts irritating your skin beyond general discomfort, please see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> quickly washed off all the gel, but the skin felt like it suffered a painful sunburn.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin which gets a little oily in the summer.</li>
            <li> The cream version is a little gentler, and as I mentioned there are lower %.</li>
            <li> when that happenes i know i have to let my skin rest for a few days.</li>
            <li> The gray layer of dead skin and acne are gone.</li>
            <li> Then again, you may not have any trouble, I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> At 56, and with heavy, still greasy skin, I have a lot of issues to address.</li>
            <li> Remember to EXFOLIATE to remove the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually put the gel one night</li>
            <li> My cheeks turned red and everyone was asking what was wrong with my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe that this product is overdosed and not safe for use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless that law has changed within the past year, tretinoin in this strength is Rx only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From my experience it has help the age spots,freckles and dull look on my face go away.</li>
            <li> I have never had acne troubles till my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I felt it was the least I could do.</li>
            <li> For reasons unknown, they pillaged the Skinites land, leaving marks of their gory destruction.</li>
            <li> SLOW.</li>
            <li> skin is clearer than ever ( I have used anti biotic creams and a ton of other prescription and non prescription products as well as expensive anti aging</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the instructions-don&#x27;t be a moron and then leave the seller bad feedback.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a heck of a time trying to find something that gets rid of the painful acne I have that hides deep under your skin.  </li>
            <li> Ugly red boils that grow one after another.  </li>
            <li> Isotretinoin&#x27;s side affects (terrible joint pain, dry/bleeding lips, intestinal problems)  are harsh and last even after discontinuing the drug.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up irritating my skin to the point</li>
            <li> Although this product is different inasmuch as it has an alcohol base, I&#x27;ve found it to be excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I fear this product is fake.</li>
            <li> There is no reason to believe the drug is a fake.</li>

            <li> When I was teenager, I would get acne. For that reason I begged my parents to take me to a dermatologist. The dermatologist gave me the Tretinoin gel for $5,with my dad&#x27;s insurance, now that I am older the place is now charging me $50. I looked in amazon and it is way cheaper. This cream is the best; I was almost going to purchase the gel for $50.  This gel however is very strong and only about a drop for the whole face should do. I usually put the gel one night yes and one night no and so on. If you are a first time user, be careful; this cream is going to dry the skin for about 2 weeks. I think it is well worth having dry skin for those weeks because after that the skin looks amazing (: One more thing...stay away from sun and do not go crazy applying the gel everywhere. You will see results in about a month.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Especially for under eye treatment. I use it in very small amounts because of its potency and got great results. Quite pleased and happy with the outcome. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> My skin started to peel off after only two days of use. My cheeks turned red and everyone was asking what was wrong with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over two Weeks, the first week my face was peeling, burned a little and my acne flair up.  put I quickly learned to put a good moisturizer and extra vitamin E oil.  My 2nd week omg my face looks so much clearer, acne almost gone, pores are tinier..love this product, but very strong stuff, but the results seem worth it!.  Yes I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely shocked when I got this Retina A skin cream and saw on the package that it is a product of India that is meant to be sold in India where there is no quality assurance or control. I can&#x27;t believe Amazon allows the sale of foreign skincare medications on their web site. Just outrageous!</li>
            <li> Tretinoin is a miracle worker on my skin. I&#x27;m only 34 years young, but already could see fine lines around my eyes, and smile lines forming. Seven months ago I started with the .05 Tretinoin Gel (the mid potency) Looking back, I wish I had stated with the .025%.  START SLOW. when they say to use a pea size, use a pea size. Start off every third night or so, and it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it with a little moisturizer. Dont&#x27; be scared when you get red and your face peels the first time, that&#x27;s normal (but I can&#x27;t stress enough to go slowly with this product, you could very seriously burn your face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started this .1% gel. I much preffer the consistancy of the gel over the lower dose, it does make for spreading even VERY easy. (Althout the alcohol smell is a bit much)</li>
            <li> This product has help maximize the results of having healthy looking skin. I really like it and will continue to use it until its all gone!!! First consult your dermatologist before using this product. From my experience it has help the age spots,freckles and dull look on my face go away. This product I bought on Amazon from the seller Benjays and I received the product right away! Hope, it can help someone this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Sweetie</li>
            <li> Researched where the product came from prior to using, it comes from a bona fide manufacturer in India. (See Enclosed Link of Manufacturer Name)&lt;br /&gt;Did other financial research etc. and yes its a real pharmaceutical manufacturer that is worth over $25 million and does business in the United States as well.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works amazing. I did additional research and I mix it with StriVectin - SD so I am not experiencing any \\&quot;side effects\\&quot; whatsoever. (It&#x27;s an uptake thing, do research yourself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clearer than ever ( I have used anti biotic creams and a ton of other prescription and non prescription products as well as expensive anti aging products)&lt;br /&gt;my Pores has shrunk within just about a week of use and wrinkles are looking better not to mention acne is pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;now this is generic from india...but works PERFECT and I couldn&#x27;t be more SATISFIED!</li>
            <li> Although it took 3 weeks for it to come to me, it was all worth waiting for. Today is my fifth day and my skin is a lot better than it has been in years. I have a combination skin which gets a little oily in the summer. I have never had acne troubles till my late 20&#x27;s. Right after I turned 26 my skin started to break out. I&#x27;m 29 now and since then I&#x27;ve always had two or three pimples on my cheeks and afterward I would be left with blemishes. Makeup/cover-up can only do so much for you but after a while you get depressed when you no longer can hide acne bumps and marks. I have tried so many things, it&#x27;s painful. I used a sample of Tretinoin cream a couple years ago and it worked wonders. Unfortunately it only lasted a month. I thought my skin would remain clear after that, but it didn&#x27;t.  I am so glad that I finally ordered Tretinoin Gel. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the gel though but I went ahead and ordered A-Ret 0.1% which is slightly stronger. I have no regrets whatsoever. My skin is peeling and a little red. But the trick is to use it every other night or every third night when skin starts to peel. If your skin gets too dry, try mixing the gel with a little bit of Vaseline. Wear plenty of sun screen when going out during the day and avoid wearing any makeup when skin is peeling. Tretinoin is not a quick solution. You do need a lot of patience with this and also it&#x27;s not for everyone. If it starts irritating your skin beyond general discomfort, please see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This was available at such a low price and this stuff actually works.  You will peel the first week or so but then youll be okay just be sure to use it only at night and use moisturizer.  if you find the product is too strong use every other day.</li>
            <li> i was a little skeptical as to if it really has the same strength as the real one that i used about a year ago. I put it on for two days in a row at night and I didn&#x27;t see any changes for the first two nights(my face just broke out a little bit);that is, my face was not peeling as i had expected. so i was disappointed and went ahead with the return process. but on the third evening i noticed some peeling around my chin and nose area. Since that means it is working, i was very excited. when i washed my face on that night, my whole face was totally peeling and my skin was very very soft and a little red so i stopped applying any more . when that happenes i know i have to let my skin rest for a few days. So now even though the company offered a refund,i am not returning them(i bought 2). The difference between this product and Johnson&amp;Johnson Retin A 0.1%(white cream) is that this is gel based(yellowish) and it dries your skin a lot more so you have to make sure to put on a moisturizer but otherwise this product seems even stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think i can put it on my face more than a couple of times a week because of the excessive peeling,renewal process. I think I am going to try 0.05 % instead next time. or maybe even go lower.As for the people who complain that this makes their skin flaky and red and causes peeling, they do not realize that tretinoin is supposed to do that. And as for the people who are upset this comes from India, let me assure you that India has tons of smart people and there are no reasons why you should not trust their pharmaceutical companies.India is very famous for their technology and their drive for higher education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that i have found this that i can buy at a fration of the cost without a prescription and i will be using this product for a long,long time.&lt;br /&gt;thank you Amazon !!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because of the low price, but this is indeed .1% tretinoin and the expiration date is fine.  I was surprised by the oily texture, considering the lower concentrations are a much lighter gel, but some online research revealed that this is normal, that this strength just requires a different medium, basically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very strong, I would not use this on my face unless I could tolerate .05% very well. .025% is better for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not start a routine with this thinking that the highest concentration is best, you will burn yourself!</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written about a product after hundreds of buys on Amazon. The reason, this product is so outstanding I felt it was the least I could do. I&#x27;ve had issues with my skin since a teen and it has continued into my 20s. I originally got retina micro which is an excellent product however cost an absurd $180! So I looked  into a generic and for those of you who may not know  tretinoin is the medical generic for retina micro. This was much more reasonable for $80 but still on the expensive side.  FYI you need a prescription for both. So I was surprised to see they were able to sell this product online without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Retina micro(tretinoin) comes in 3 strengths .25, .05, and .1 with .1 being the strongest. I found that .1 was far and away the most effective for me.  Anyways after 3 days of using this product I can already tell a difference with regard to completion improvement and overall skin health.  I will have to give it a longer time period to review the fine line reduction aspect. There is a different consistency then the prescription version I have used and has a more oily feel with and alcohol smell to it, however this stuff is legit, and is more effective then the prescription cream I&#x27;ve used for years at a fraction of the price! Use a pea sized amount or so every night or every other night depending on ur skins need.  Also keep in mind this will dry out ur skin which means its working, so I recommend a good moisturizing lotion every morning or whenever needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t easy to get 4 1/2 stars out of 5 with all the crazy reviewers looking  to negatively review a product if it isn&#x27;t a miracle cure, so you know that says something about this product. So anyways I hope this review was helpful to those who were interested:)</li>
            <li> I have formerly used Tretinoin Gel from Obagi and been satisfied with it.  I was hoping to find the same product at a better price.  This Gel is clear and I use it with the Obaji Blender daily.  It has made a big overall difference in the overall appearance of the skin on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. I have used various dermatologist prescriptions in the past and was prepared for peeling. It was not pleasant, but after about 10 days of peeling, my skin looks fantastic! The gray layer of dead skin and acne are gone. I used my oil of olay facial brush to help buff away the peeling. I did this every 2 or 3 days to help my skin look presentable for work. If your skin is very sensitive, I would not recommend doing this. Also, I made sure to use Cetaphil or a mild facial cleaner. You really should not need a stronger facial wash with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I used a stronger product, only if I needed to remove make up.&lt;br /&gt;I am blessed with few wrinkles, but I am hoping with regular use, I will have no worries.&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone to make sure to research the reviews before purchasing. This strength is not for everyone. If you are not accustom to chemical peels or Retin A, I would definitely suggest the lower strength.&lt;br /&gt;I chose the higher strength as I knew my skin needed and could handle the higher strength. I have very oily skin that is very acne prone. It has also been almost a year since I used a prescription grade skin product, so I wanted something that could quickly cut through the dead layer and this was the answer.&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend purchasing a good moisturizer/sun screen product. I live in the Southeast and I love the sun in the spring/summer. I am taking extra precaution not to harm my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was just blaaahhhh! no matter what I tried, it was dull and blotchie with uneven tones, I have only been using the Tretinon Gel for about 2 weeks and so far my skin is looking radiant and almost flawless. I really, really like this product.</li>
            <li> I should have known the price was too good to be true. This product is half the price of Obagi medical tretinoin cream USP 0.1%, but about 10 times less effective. It is manufactured in India, so I do not know how it could be USP-grade.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways on to my experience with it:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Retin-a (tretinoin cream) on some stretch marks on my arms that I got from weight lifting. I was using obagi&#x27;s cream at first, and it was working pretty good. Eventually the cream ran out, and I went through it in about 2 months. That cream cost about $50, so when I saw this deal of 20g of tretinoin gel for half the price of cream, I thought that it was a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;MAN was i WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I recieved my order of 2x tretinoin gel usp, I decided to test it by putting some on at night before I went to bed. I put on just a dab, so that I could test how strong it was. If these gels ARE tretinoin, which I doubt, then they must be much stronger than Obagi&#x27;s tretinoin cream, because ALL night I was feeling an uncomfortable burning on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up, I had some scaling (which tretinoin normally does) but I also had a huge area of my skin turn very red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;I quickly washed off all the gel, but the skin felt like it suffered a painful sunburn. I believe that this product is overdosed and not safe for use.&lt;br /&gt;It has been over 4 days, I I still have not fully healed from using this tretinoin gel just one time.</li>
            <li> I fear this product is fake. I use Retin-A and it is ONLY AVAILABLE BY PERSCRIPTION! (especially at this strength!) Unless that law has changed within the past year, tretinoin in this strength is Rx only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would urge people to get an Rx from your doctor for Retin-A (there is generic versions available and it is even CHEAPER than this stuff!) Rx Retin-A really does work well on acne and winkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Tretinoin is truely Rx-only, either this stuff is being stolen and sold here or it is just some cream that looks like a legitimate packaging. Be cautious, this stuff could harm your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on Isotretinoin (Accutane and Clavaris) three times and it has only been about 6 months since my last round.  Already I began having nodules develop around the line of my jaw.  I&#x27;ve been on a different combinations of antibiotics and topical creams, but nothing helped - except for Adapalene (Differin) gel.  Although, Adapalene (Differin) gel didn&#x27;t clear up my acne completely it did noticeably improve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the nodules I am experiencing now are far smaller and fewer than when I went on Isotretinoin last I decided to try Adapalene (Differen) gel again.  Isotretinoin&#x27;s side affects (terrible joint pain, dry/bleeding lips, intestinal problems)  are harsh and last even after discontinuing the drug.  I am nearing a consultation for laser resurfacing to help diminish the appearance of some moderate acne scaring I have.  I would have to wait at least six months after my last dose of Isotretinoin to have any ablative laser resurfacing done.  This wouldn&#x27;t be the case for a topical gel like Adapalene.  I found that Adapalene (Differin) gel is a 3rd generation retinoid and that Tretinoin is a 1st generation retinoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews I found that they work equally well on acne, but that Tretinoin is harsher on the skin.  Adapalene gel did cause some peeling, but not as much as Tretinoin.  Please use Tretionoin sparingly.  I applied it as if it were Benzoyl Peroxide and I ended up irritating my skin to the point were my face looked red. This gel is of a high concentration and is very potent!  My skin peels quite a bit when I use Tretinoin, but it is easily exfoliated.  Unexpectedly, this also seems to be lessening the appearance of my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this product is what it is advertised to be and that it is of good quality.  It is working and I see my acne improving considerably.  I feel that it may even clear it up completely.  The product arrived quickly, which is an added bonus.  I will continue to purchase this product and from this seller.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the gel works great. I will buy again when i run out. I can&#x27;t get good service at this price anywhere else</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne, especially in my face and chest area. I used to take isotretinoin pills which were absolutely amazing. But I had to stop taking them because I do want children at some point and had to quit as a precaution.&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything on the face of the planet since then, acne antibiotics, Duac gel etc but nothing seemed to work remotely as well. Then I read about this Tretinoin Gel , which is a related chemical to the Isotretinoin I used to take. So I decided to give it a shot. I was really hesitant due to some of the reviews I read. Some people advised against this product because it is too oily or because it is a product of India. But in my desperation I decided to give it a shot anyway. Turns out this stuff is amazing. It is true that is has an oily texture, but once you apply it on your face it vanishes within minutes and does not leave behind an oily skin. My skin looked amazing after one application. I got carried away and applied it again the next day. That was a bit too much and my skin started peeling. In future I will only apply a thin film once a week, that should suffice. I suffer from really oily facial skin the so-called T-zone. But after applying this gel my skin looks amazing and all those acne bumps are gone. Also since it only requires such small amount per application, one tube will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> The only product that works quickly to clear my skin! I refuse to try anything else now, it has done in 1 month what multiple peels, ointments and soaps could not do.</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was perfectly what i ordered. Shipping was fast. Happy with the results. Use this witb the obagi blender and it has given fabulous results.</li>
            <li> Please remember this is a strong strength. Use the lesser % for first time user, or \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it with something (face cream) if you bought it by mistake. Also if you have used Obagi brand- this is a stronger version then that (that has blenders that add to the price.) That is why there are bad reviews...but the good news is RetA is amazing and nothing you can buy will even come close to the results you get from it. More young looking skin, wrinkle repair, all for the price that is cheaper then those fancy creams! Go sparingly, start on outer cheeks, working closer more tender skin (like around eyes) READ THE DIRECTIONS IN THE PAMPLET IN THE BOX. Ease back if you get irration a couple days, then ease back in again. Then again, you may not have any trouble, I didn&#x27;t. Keep out of the sun or use a high sunblock. I went on all day hikes with sunblock and had no trouble. Use vasaline on a Qtip to block out tender areas (like lips or creases around nose) This is the real thing, and a pure form of Tretinoin. The cream version is a little gentler, and as I mentioned there are lower %. Use that form first if you are a first time user. There are a very low % of people with too tender of skin to use it, be aware of that. But for most it is a getting used to it, and easing back until you can use it. Experiment and the results will be amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a legitimate company established in 1977 according to Bloomberg Businessweek.  There is no reason to believe the drug is a fake. I have used it with no problems so far.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.  Soft , smooth, and even.  People complement my complexion constantly. I would definitly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> My order arrived promptly from the vendor, the product was packed well, factory sealed, not about to expire (as many are when you order online), and in original box with instructions. This retin-A gel smooths on very nicely and is absorbed quickly and completely - so that I could apply a sunscreen over it. I have already had very satisfactory results to clear acne and to achieve an over all chemical exfoliation of my face. I&#x27;m peeling gently but thoroughly, with very little irritation. This is the best Retin-A formulation I have ever used! Much nicer than Retin-A Micro. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I got the Gel and decided to apply it after my \\&quot;Hot Yoga\\&quot; class. I sweat profusely and knew that my pores would be open and skin would be exfoliated. I used the gel and immediately disapointed that it was not a cream, but like an oil and not like a gel. I had a small cut on my finger and felt some chemical light burn. That made me feel that there was some ingredient in the gel. I went ahead and put this on my face and neck. It was \\&quot;oiley\\&quot; but what the heck, I would try it. On the way home, I gently rubbed in around on my face and felt a small amount of exfoliation taking place. I did not have any burning or redness.&lt;br /&gt;  After the gel seemed to be dry, I felt my face really tightening, It had a really nice shine and glow. I used a little \\&quot;bare minerals\\&quot; and was really happy with the results. I felt that my skin on my face really looked great.&lt;br /&gt;  I think the exfoliation really made a difference in the product being able to do its job. I will continue to apply it after my \\&quot;hot yoga\\&quot; classes.  I have read also, that it works good on the turkey neck problem and I have seen some results with applying the cream under the neck.&lt;br /&gt;  I was going to buy it from my Dermatologist for %58.00. I called her and set a time with the office worker to come in an pick it up. She had not returned from lunch, nor did she leave my product with the receptionist to sell to me when I arrived. I found this cream as the same ingredient and for a fraction of the price decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;  The also charged me over $300 for the OBagi products. I think I can shop smarter with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product was sent with an expired date and is all yellow and old.  I really don&#x27;t know the benefits to this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if really works, because I used for the first time today. But definitely  would not be good for acne because it&#x27;s too oily. There was not supposed to be oily since it&#x27;s gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong so be sure to work your way up to it.  Works great.  Expiration date months away.</li>
            <li> Although this product is different inasmuch as it has an alcohol base, I&#x27;ve found it to be excellent.&lt;br /&gt;  I recommend it with the precaution to start with minute amounts and stay away from the sun!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I use it for two consecutive days each week (I found that doing it this way enduces the peeling quicker for me then I have five days to heal before repeating my regimen). During the healing process I use meladerm twice a day (morning and at night before bed). I do a microdermabrasion each morning  followed by the meladerm and sunscreen. At night I cleanse then use the meladerm followed by neosporin cream. I find that the neosporin helps my skin heal faster and I have no sensitivity to the tretinoin. My skin looks great! My pores are greately reduced in size and my dark spots are almost completely gone. Before and after photos coming soon.  . . . . . .</li>
            <li> At 56, and with heavy, still greasy skin, I have a lot of issues to address. Especially the big pores. I had resisted the prescription Retin A because of cost of both an office visit and the product itself. When I saw this, I thought-I have nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;Now, please note that I have used other retinol products and use 20% C-serum as well. I do not have sensitive skin and you should be aware that if YOU do, start with the lower strength. After 4 applications I saw a marked improvement in my skin, including the shrinking of my lake-size pores. There is a slight stinging, and some redness, and at this time I am shedding pretty good. But you people who left negative feedback about these issues should have read up before you ordered, because this is what is supposed to happen. No shedding, no improvement!&lt;br /&gt;My sun-induced discolorations have already lightened some, and the skin has tightened a bit. This is after only four applications! I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after a month or so!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from Benjays, and it was delivered extremely fast. Make sure you read the instructions-don&#x27;t be a moron and then leave the seller bad feedback. I will buy from Benjays again when I need a fresh tube.&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Ok, I need to insert a WARNING here-this stuff is powerful. Know what your skin can handle. Even with my thick, non-reactive skin, I&#x27;ve gotten massive shedding, peeling and some discomfort. I&#x27;ve also seen all kinds of age spots, fine lines, and roughness disappear in about 10 days. Just be forewarned, and start with the lower strengths.</li>
            <li> There existed a kingdom named Myfacea. It was a beautiful land, teeming with civilization and advancement. Among its civilization was the human-like race, Skinites. These Skinites were the most numerous, and were quite unsensitive and often made good use of oil for their own benefits. Other races existed, but the Skinites were at peace with most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, another race called the Acnites were not so easy. They were a fierce primordial collection of war tribes. They would often conduct raids, but the Skinites had enough power to fend them off. Things went on like this for 21 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, at the turn of the 22nd century BC, the Acnites launched a massive attack. For reasons unknown, they pillaged the Skinites land, leaving marks of their gory destruction. Half of the Skinite&#x27;s land was covered in these marks, the scars of the destruction laid by the Acnites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, the most talented of warriors banded together to form a war unit called the Salicypels. They easily took care of the oldest of the Acnites. And fate led them to battle the Acnites, where they stood toe to toe against the menace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... even a few of the Acnite lords were powerful enough to defeat a great many warriors. Warriors, that the Skinite race simply could not spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, unchallenged by any power, the Acnites marched to the last location of the Skinites civilization, where most of the remaining Skinite population had gathered to form one last stand. The battle began, fire rained down from the skies, and arrows blocked the sun... the massacre began. Priestess Catawba prayed to the God of Peeling, Treseus, to save the Skinites race from complete destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Acnites most powerful warlocks raced up the stairs into the Treseus Temple, and as Catawba looked upon the destruction being laid outside the window of the Temple, a bright light surged through the city. The entire legion of Acnites was burned to a crisp, and the light bestowed its vibrance upon the scarred lands. Some days later, the scarred lands would no longer harbor the marks of destruction, and would once again shine a glorious light of civilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The End.</li>
            <li> Same quality you get from the pharmacy at a fraction of the cost. Shipped quickly. Will not hesitate to order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a heck of a time trying to find something that gets rid of the painful acne I have that hides deep under your skin.  Ugly red boils that grow one after another.  THIS WORKS.  (However, if you don&#x27;t have the type of acne I described, I recommend a weaker version.)  DON&#x27;T PUT THIS ALL OVER YOUR FACE!  Use a tiny bit applied with a q-tip (to avoid spreading bacteria) because the next day your skin will be peeling.  Another awesome thing is that is also FADES YOUR SCARS!  It&#x27;s a good idea to use a moisturizer with this--I use straight-up vitamin E oil, which also heals your scars.  Remember to EXFOLIATE to remove the dead skin.  Exfoliating also encourages blood-flow and new skin cell growth.  The small 20g tube will last a LONG time because you only need a tiny dot for each boil/pimple/acne spot.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast, in great conditon, and this stuff is wonderful. I did experience peeling/redness the first week or so, but kept with it (I am used to the effects of retina products and knew it would subside) and I now use it every night without problem and it has really done wonders. Not only do I not get any acne, but my skin is softer, pores are smaller, and fine lines are noticeably softer as well (I&#x27;m 26 so not a ton of wrinkles, but nonetheless). The key is really to stick it out the first couple weeks and only use no more than a PEA SIZED amount. If drying/irritation occurs mix it or top the application off with your regular facial moisturizer and spread out the applications to every other night or every third night. This stuff is the real deal though so expect some very real effects, it&#x27;s the best thing you can do for your face.</li>
