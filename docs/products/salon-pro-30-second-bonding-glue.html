            <li>Lol thanks a lot</li>
            <li>Great bargain and works really well.</li>
            <li>I really Love This Glue.</li>
            <li>I find this glue easy to use, just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It comes off skin and counters easy but stays in the hair.</li>
            <li>Strong bond.</li>
            <li>I was only able to clip like 3 weft but with a glue in I was able to put 15 tracks !!</li>
            <li>Then I wash, wash, wash with the shampoo, combing through with a fine tooth comb.  </li>
            <li>Tis glue makes it easy to apply the tracks, and is stress free to remove them.</li>
            <li>I love that it dries quickly and has no smell.</li>
            <li>I Have Been Looking For A Good Hair Extension Glue,By Far</li>
            <li>Works for extensions and wigs and eyelashes and eben special effects makeup.</li>
            <li>so it was full</li>
            <li>This stuff works so easy and drys fast!</li>
            <li>Other than that it was great.  </li>
            <li>I used Morning Glory Gro Protect Solution for a quick weave so removal was done without a glue remover and it came out without issue.  </li>
            <li>It dries quick.</li>
            <li>but I think they&#x27;ve done some improvements to this one because it&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>This came in a timely manor, was exactly what I expected and great quality.</li>
            <li>This item is worth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth in gold.</li>
            <li>and I can add so many tracks I have a half shave and a full hair on top with clips</li>
            <li>It rolls right off your fingers and doesn&#x27;t seem to stain your skin or clothes if you get it off before  </li>
            <li>hair glue is hair glue right???</li>
            <li>Its my experience and safe to say Please order the BIG bottle its worth it</li>
            <li>I wish the applicator tip were narrower because this glue is pretty liquid.  </li>
            <li>order\\&quot; next to the appropriate order.</li>
            <li>This is better than the regular bonding glue.</li>
            <li>Love the product only thing was the bottle was opened in the package</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much better then clips in its so flat</li>
            <li>After I get most of the glue out I allow my hair to dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough that if someone pulls the wig, it HURTS (I know because I tested the strength and it</li>
            <li>The glue initially has a fairly strong odor to it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well and buying unbound feathers is cheaper.</li>
            <li>but i really want to know if it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li>It is very workable and pliable.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again for shopping with us.</li>
            <li>but too much of a hassle</li>
            <li>It works very well...</li>
            <li>Came really fast....</li>
            <li>but you could really just buy liquid latex and smear it in your hair instead of waiting your time with this product</li>
            <li>Thanks Salon Pro for coming to my rescue</li>
            <li>This glue works very well.</li>
            <li>This glue last a very long time I love it!</li>
            <li>only last a max of 2 weeks on weft extensions, this has lasted 3 weeks and still holding strong!</li>
            <li>Right when I got it I started to glue in my Peruvian Deep Curl in and let me tell you this is my first time glueing in my hair</li>
            <li>It surprised me by how strong it actually</li>
            <li>so make sure you put it where it can be hidden</li>
            <li>Its a little better then the proclaim brand</li>
            <li>The glue doesn&#x27;t dry into a lump either, it&#x27;s more like a rubbery, flat</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to attach a full wig and even less for hair extensions.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>It only takes a little to work, and comes out beautifully (without damage to my hair/with a little baby oil).</li>
            <li>I just had new hair extensions professionally done for my daughter&#x27;s wedding which was out of state.  </li>
            <li>Get together the feathers and even the ends, dip it in about 1/2 inch and use your fingers to completely bond the feathers together.</li>
            <li>I would normally go to a beauty supply store myself, but since I was in a different state getting some training I decided to order the glue online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also try the clear version of this for future weave installations.</li>
            <li>I have no clue how well it will attach a wig/extension to bare skin</li>
            <li>IT IS A FABULOUS GLUE if you have the patience to remove it slowly and in steps.</li>
            <li>It works so much more poorly than the taped extensions I have.</li>

            <li> It last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, my extensions are blonde and the glue is black, which is a major problem for me.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that items in this order may be subject to California&#x27;s Electronic Waste Recycling Act.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I opened and smelled it, closed it back up.</li>
            <li> installation lasts a long time also.</li>
            <li> Dos&#x27;nt hold extensions in daughter hair for very long.</li>
            <li> the product doesn&#x27;t bond hair for very long.</li>
            <li> My only other gripe with this (and it&#x27;s not really the product&#x27;s fault) is this is latex based.  </li>
            <li> Really not worth waiting almost a month for, and only get a hold until she sweats</li>
            <li> A few days later I use the remover and shampoo again and this gets the rest out.  </li>
            <li> If you ever need to return an order, visit our Online Returns Center: www.amazon.com/returns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not bad but no better or worse than any other weave glue</li>
            <li> So half was spilled out and dried in the package i should have sent back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they will take it back or not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as noxiuos as the other glues can be.  </li>
            <li> A little will go a long way!  </li>
            <li> a hair dresser you put it on blow dry a little and use.</li>
            <li> Be very careful and take your time applying this to wefts.  </li>
            <li> If any items in this order are subject to that Act, the seller of that item has elected to pay any fees due on your behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when opened, the glue was solid and hard.</li>
            <li> This was watered down.</li>
            <li> I apply the remover and allow it to sit for about half an hour to an hour while I watch tv.  </li>
            <li> The glue itself is also jet black</li>
            <li> I like that it is black</li>
            <li> Sometimes I even throw a little isopropyl alcohol on the places where the glue is before I shampoo</li>
            <li> I have used other brands in the past which</li>
            <li> Waste of money...Will not stick.</li>
            <li> You have to let it set in for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> a couple of corners came loose and my hair would have looked awful if not for the easy fix provided by Salon Pro.  </li>
            <li> This is glue is hard to come by considering a lot of women is wearing lace frontal wigs and weaves</li>
            <li> Have used others that work at least a week or two.</li>
            <li> and when it did the glue stuck in my hair so I had a blog of glue in my hair which is not okay!  </li>
            <li> This product I have ordered in the past !</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on the remover !!</li>
            <li> Seriously OMG, it came off as I was going to work</li>
            <li> This glue is not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> but I have headaches from the tugging my hair &amp; needless to say I&#x27;ve lost a lot of hair,</li>
            <li> Unable to use this bottle at all.</li>
            <li> so on that note, it was nothing bad about it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get frustrated with it</li>
            <li> This stuff smells horrible!  </li>
            <li> Horrible bonding-- hair weft worked themselves out after 5 days.</li>
            <li> Disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Horrible,  came clumped together.</li>

            <li> Love this glue. Natty used to be my favorite but I think they&#x27;ve done some improvements to this one because it&#x27;s my new favorite. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This glue is fantastic!  It is the only one I will use. I can keep my wefts glued for 6-8 weeks before I need to remove and reinstall. It is a challenge to remove though.  I also purchased the remover and shampoo by the same company. I apply the remover and allow it to sit for about half an hour to an hour while I watch tv.  Then I wash, wash, wash with the shampoo, combing through with a fine tooth comb.  DO NOT try to just pull this out using the conditioner method.  IT WILL RIP YOUR HAIR OUT!  You must be patient.  You must use the remover.  I recommend the shampoo also since it softens the glue to a pliable material.  After I get most of the glue out I allow my hair to dry.  A few days later I use the remover and shampoo again and this gets the rest out.  Sometimes I even throw a little isopropyl alcohol on the places where the glue is before I shampoo and it helps ease the process along.  This glue is not for the faint of heart.  IT IS A FABULOUS GLUE if you have the patience to remove it slowly and in steps.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells horrible!  I&#x27;m not sure if they will take it back or not.  I opened and smelled it, closed it back up.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing that I could use this to bond a bunch of feather together to make it easier to put lots of feathers in my hair at once. Get together the feathers and even the ends, dip it in about 1/2 inch and use your fingers to completely bond the feathers together. It works really well and buying unbound feathers is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Its a little better then the proclaim brand</li>
            <li> Worked great and as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Horrible bonding-- hair weft worked themselves out after 5 days.</li>
            <li> This glue is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t take much to attach a full wig and even less for hair extensions.&lt;br /&gt;2) Once applied, the glue lasts all day with no problems. It&#x27;s strong enough that if someone pulls the wig, it HURTS (I know because I tested the strength and it hurt).&lt;br /&gt;3) The glue doesn&#x27;t dry into a lump either, it&#x27;s more like a rubbery, flat spot.&lt;br /&gt;4) In order to remove the glue, you MUST have the glue remover as you are not going to pull the wig/extension off that&#x27;s for sure. If you forgot the glue remover, you&#x27;re sol. You&#x27;re only option is to wear the wig/extension until the dissolver arrives or cut your hair. It surprised me by how strong it actually was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;1) The glue itself is also jet black so make sure you put it where it can be hidden easily.&lt;br /&gt;2) The glue initially has a fairly strong odor to it but it goes away after about 30 minutes. It&#x27;s strong enough to give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t know about it:&lt;br /&gt;1) I have yet to go longer than a day so I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll last before failing on its own.&lt;br /&gt;2) I have no clue how well it will attach a wig/extension to bare skin so I can&#x27;t help you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this glue is perfect for attaching wigs/extensions to your current hair and keeping them attached all day.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It works great on my hair but i really want to know if it&#x27;s waterproof. Does anyone know if its waterproof?</li>
            <li> I really do love this glue.  It&#x27;s not as noxiuos as the other glues can be.  It is very workable and pliable.  It rolls right off your fingers and doesn&#x27;t seem to stain your skin or clothes if you get it off before  it cures.  It&#x27;s 30 seconds as advertised so you should know what you are doing while using this product.  Once it cures it stays in place!  The weave  installation lasts a long time also. I wish the applicator tip were narrower because this glue is pretty liquid.  Be very careful and take your time applying this to wefts.  A little will go a long way!  My only other gripe with this (and it&#x27;s not really the product&#x27;s fault) is this is latex based.  Most glues are so if you have a reaction to latex DON&#x27;T use this product!  I have site reactions to latex so areas where the glue touched in the application process reacted. Other than that it was great.  I used Morning Glory Gro Protect Solution for a quick weave so removal was done without a glue remover and it came out without issue.  I would buy this again to do a client&#x27;s hair.  I&#x27;d also try the clear version of this for future weave installations.</li>

            <li> Seriously OMG, it came off as I was going to work and when it did the glue stuck in my hair so I had a blog of glue in my hair which is not okay!  Three days later I&#x27;m still working on taking it off,I&#x27;m using oil it kinda helps,  but I have headaches from the tugging my hair &amp; needless to say I&#x27;ve lost a lot of hair, omg I just want to cry, this glue is a nightmare, should have just stuck to the clips!!!!!!</li>
            <li> hair glue is hair glue right??? ( ouch)</li>
            <li> Dos&#x27;nt hold extensions in daughter hair for very long. Really not worth waiting almost a month for, and only get a hold until she sweats or it rains</li>
            <li> This is glue is hard to come by considering a lot of women is wearing lace frontal wigs and weaves</li>
            <li> Waste of money...Will not stick. Have used others that work at least a week or two. This was watered down. DO NOT RECOMMEND....</li>
            <li> This is better than the regular bonding glue. It glues and bands in more  like10 secs. Superb product worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used this product before, from a different retailer, so knew what to expect! It was on point and good to work with!</li>
            <li> This item is worth it&#x27;s worth in gold. Have been using it for many years and have no problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good product like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product before in my local hair stores and it&#x27;s no different then those so on that note, it was nothing bad about it but I can get it locally if I truly wanted to.  No problems with this shipper either.</li>
            <li> Disgusting.  Doesn&#x27;t work. Leaks.  Have to reapply daily.</li>
            <li> I recommend, Very NICE</li>
            <li> Love the product only thing was the bottle was opened in the package So half was spilled out and dried in the package i should have sent back but too much of a hassle</li>
            <li> This product I have ordered in the past ! and living here on maui products are at a limit This one is outstanding and I know it would weather under all conditions . Its my experience and safe to say Please order the BIG bottle its worth it and you don&#x27;t want to run out .</li>
            <li> It works very well... im a hair dresser you put it on blow dry a little and use. It dries quick. Very good.</li>
            <li> i would buy it over and over if i needed it. Works for extensions and wigs and eyelashes and eben special effects makeup. Literally had it for three years, going on four. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I brought this bonding glue like a couple of&lt;br /&gt; times already.</li>
            <li> This glue was a great price. It last me a long time. It doesnt have a fungal odor like some of the others and it holds well. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> not bad but no better or worse than any other weave glue</li>
            <li> Came really fast.... Love Love Love this glue.  Works great with morning glory hair protectant</li>
            <li> This is good and I got it earlier than I thought. Pron. Be buying again</li>
            <li> Unable to use this bottle at all. when opened, the glue was solid and hard. Will buy this product elsewhere from now on.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else!</li>
            <li> I find this glue easy to use, just what I was looking for.  I like that it is black so it blends into my hair color.</li>
            <li> This product is okay but you could really just buy liquid latex and smear it in your hair instead of waiting your time with this product</li>
            <li> I always buy this hair glue. I would normally go to a beauty supply store myself, but since I was in a different state getting some training I decided to order the glue online. It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It dries in 30 but don&#x27;t stick for weeks</li>
            <li> Horrible,  came clumped together.</li>
            <li> I have never bought this product before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It works so much more poorly than the taped extensions I have. It only lasts a couple of days. Also, my extensions are blonde and the glue is black, which is a major problem for me.</li>
            <li> the product doesn&#x27;t bond hair for very long. i used it to bond my hair extensions and it simply fell apart. Won&#x27;t order again,</li>
            <li> You have to let it set in for a few minutes.  Rubbing it in helps.  Don&#x27;t get frustrated with it just give it time to work and then it works great.</li>
            <li> I just had new hair extensions professionally done for my daughter&#x27;s wedding which was out of state.  While my hairdresser did her best I was not taking any chances and ordered Salon Pro before going out of town.  I was very happy I took this precaution as just before the wedding a couple of corners came loose and my hair would have looked awful if not for the easy fix provided by Salon Pro.  Thanks Salon Pro for coming to my rescue when I needed it the most!</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; the delivery was promt. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This glue works very well. It only takes a little to work, and comes out beautifully (without damage to my hair/with a little baby oil). Tis glue makes it easy to apply the tracks, and is stress free to remove them. I love that it dries quickly and has no smell. It holds beautifully, and is my preference glue to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this and on May 22 2015 Right when I got it I started to glue in my Peruvian Deep Curl in and let me tell you this is my first time glueing in my hair and it&#x27;s so much better then clips in its so flat and I can add so many tracks I have a half shave and a full hair on top with clips I was only able to clip like 3 weft but with a glue in I was able to put 15 tracks !! And they were double so it was full I still have it in my head no track are coming off so I&#x27;ll do an update but this glue is super super good !!!! Oh and if your scared the glue won&#x27;t come off just condition don&#x27;t waste your money on the remover !! Lol condition works good !! How I know because my sister is the one who inspired me to glue in my hair extensions !!! Lol thanks a lot sis but she&#x27;s been glueing her hair for about 3 years now and she uses this glue but I&#x27;m a person who don&#x27;t like to share hehe ! But buy this glue !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It actually works quite well through showering and everything. Quite happy with this, it&#x27;s the best glue I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li> Great bargain and works really well. Strong bond.</li>
            <li> I just got it today as expected , awesome :) thank you !!!</li>
            <li> This came in a timely manor, was exactly what I expected and great quality.</li>
            <li> Salon Pro bonding glue sticks to your hair and not on you</li>
            <li> This glue last a very long time I love it! I have used other brands in the past which only last a max of 2 weeks on weft extensions, this has lasted 3 weeks and still holding strong!</li>
            <li> This stuff works so easy and drys fast! It comes off skin and counters easy but stays in the hair. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Omg! I really Love This Glue.I Have Been Looking For A Good Hair Extension Glue,By Far This Is The Best One.</li>
