    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best brush I ever used.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my friends as any great discovery.</li>
            <li>You need great tools to protect your hair and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li>Very effectively detangles hair and feels great to use.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect replacement for my favorite brush that is falling apart.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Love this brush!</li>
            <li>i kind of wished i had gotten one of the oval brushes instead</li>
            <li>Use all the time and really like the way it makes my scalp tingle - feels really good and gets the blood moving!</li>
            <li>But I really love it just to brush my hair.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so soft, and it is good for the circulation in your head which causes your hair to grow!</li>
            <li>So far, it has been a great brush.</li>
            <li>One would think that an all-boar bristle brush would be perfect for a person whose hair is softer than an average child&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li>It does look quite unique though.</li>
            <li>I wanted a vented brush because I find them easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>The brush is not heavy which is nice for styling with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>This bamboo brush is very well made and feels even better each time I use it on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have several daughters with long hair so if it lasts, I will be impressed.</li>
            <li>I have mostly straight hair that is fine in texture and medium thickness.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good size for brushing my long hair but the appearance is more plastic than i expected.</li>
            <li>And pretty to look at too.</li>
            <li>I use with a detangling spray by unity, and in combo this easily and effectively combs through my wet, looooong blonde hair (that catches on EVERYTHING usually), and feels great in the process.</li>
            <li>Thr bristles of this brush are stiff enough to grab and brush my hair, and bristles feel very good on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>The bristles also do not do a good job of working through even small tangles in long (but relatively fine) hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I did not find it to be any better or worse than any other hair brush I own.</li>
            <li>This brush reaches down to the scalp and brushes through my fine hair.</li>
            <li>The bamboo is pretty, but the discomfort and capability are such that I won&#x27;t use it for styling, which is what a vented brush is meant to do.</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, long hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I tried several other brushes and none of them were satisfactory for varying reasons, but this one is just right.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush because my 18 year old daughter was purchasing a different wooden brush for herself</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this brush!  I don&#x27;t think I could ever use a regular hairbrush again.  I started using it on my dAughter&#x27;s hair as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because my 18 year old daughter was purchasing a different wooden brush for herself and I thought I would try it out. So far, it has been a great brush. I have several daughters with long hair so if it lasts, I will be impressed. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> When this arrived I thought it looked like it would hurt. The whole cushion thing seemed impossible. Then the bristles are plastic. I thought they would be bamboo so that was disappointing as the description was not clear. I am over that now. Just one brush had me hooked. There is this cushion feeling and it just glides through the hair. I actually look forward to brushing my hair now.  The brush is not heavy which is nice for styling with a blow dryer. I have mostly straight hair that is fine in texture and medium thickness.</li>
            <li> The handle is oddly shaped, making it difficult to hold while styling.  The bristles also do not do a good job of working through even small tangles in long (but relatively fine) hair.  The bamboo is pretty, but the discomfort and capability are such that I won&#x27;t use it for styling, which is what a vented brush is meant to do.</li>

            <li> This bamboo brush is very well made and feels even better each time I use it on my hair. I have to watch it so it does not \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; when others are around.</li>
            <li> You need great tools to protect your hair and this is one of them.  I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> Use all the time and really like the way it makes my scalp tingle - feels really good and gets the blood moving!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I couldn&#x27;t find if locally anywhere...</li>
            <li> The paddle is larger than I thought. But it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li> Bought this thinking it had wooden bristles, but they are plastic. The polish they use on the wooden handle also does not look well done.</li>
            <li> I like the weight and the vent design. The brush worked well for a few months but then began loosing the rubber tips from the bristles. I don&#x27;t carry the brush with me and use it all day.  I only use it at home 1-2 times per day. I would not recommend it to a friend.  I have now had it 8 months and it is in the trash with no rubber left and to uncomfortable to use.  I hated getting rid of it as the design was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good size for brushing my long hair but the appearance is more plastic than i expected. i kind of wished i had gotten one of the oval brushes instead</li>
            <li> Very effectively detangles hair and feels great to use. I use with a detangling spray by unity, and in combo this easily and effectively combs through my wet, looooong blonde hair (that catches on EVERYTHING usually), and feels great in the process. No ripping, no pulling, no nonsense. And pretty to look at too.</li>
            <li> The tips of the bristles all came off in a very short period of time. I would expect this to be a high quality product, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This brush reaches down to the scalp and brushes through my fine hair. One would think that an all-boar bristle brush would be perfect for a person whose hair is softer than an average child&#x27;s. But a boar bristle brush fails to even grab my baby-fine hair.  Thr bristles of this brush are stiff enough to grab and brush my hair, and bristles feel very good on the scalp.  It is NOT a styling brush,though.  But I really love it just to brush my hair.</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever used.</li>
