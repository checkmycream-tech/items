    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product came on time and was as advertised.  I&#x27;ve repurchased several other oils and love them all.  Their oils all seem highly refined with little or no odor.</li>
            <li> This the best stuff ever and I use it for so many things!</li>
            <li> I  just love this product for my hair and putting a little in a pan and soaking  my feet with it !!!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> This oil is very nice.  It really helps with dry skin and is gentle enough to even use on my face.</li>
            <li> Garbage smells and tastes like vegetable oil. Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The oil is nice but there has to be a better container.  Whether you want a small amount or a lot the oil comes out everywhere.  Constantly wiping off the bottle.  There are no storage instructions so I&#x27;m wondering if it will turn rancid.</li>
            <li> I never knew of Aloe Vera Oil til I saw it in my recommendation list on Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it because it is the lightest and the most moisturizing oil I have in my collection. Definitely my new favorite oil for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I do a 1:1 ratio mixture with this and almond oil.  It makes a special facial serum good for the skin.  you use it above the brows and over the cheek bones but away from the eyes.</li>
            <li> This first time ever that an oil is able to keep my skin hydrate for a longtime. The is absolutely no residue. I will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li> A simple oil that has multiple uses.</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty naked outside of the company information. On the labeling it says &amp;#34;100% pure organic&amp;#34; how ever this isn&#x27;t USDA organic which is more trusting. Any product that is truly organic has to have the USDA organic symbol some where on the product. As another reviewer stated aloe vera oil isn&#x27;t 100 percent so it is mixed in with a carrier oil which isn&#x27;t listed on the labeling. Because there is no information as to what is in this bottle outside of the aloe vera two stars. Here is a site that is selling USDA organic whole sale Aloe Vera oil http://www.essentialwholesale.com/product/1293/aloe-vera-oil-certified-organic- . On the site you can see that it is mixed in with a carrier oil and the ingredient list. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to another based on a lack of information about the oil on the bottle.</li>
            <li> not as big as it looks</li>
            <li> Works well for hydrating skin.</li>
            <li> This product was very light weight and goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  I love this product and will continue to use it daily.  Shipping and delivery was excellent.</li>
            <li> Really nice organic oil I can use on my entire body. I use this product from scalp to toes in lotions and creams I make at home. It&#x27;s been very good to moisturize, reduce the appearance of wrinkles and dark spots, rejuvenate my 50-ish very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered a number of oils and butters from this vendor and all my orders have been of very good quality product, very fresh and arrive promptly. I only wish they could come in glass v. plastic but that would also increase the price and shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I store my products in the refrigerator and because they arrive very fresh, they stay fresh until I use the last drop.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is of excellent quality but just way too expensive for my budget and i dont think i will be re-ordering this aloe vera oil again.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair and I have seen a huge difference since I started. My hair is moisturized, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;My hair and skin feel amazing!!!</li>
            <li> great stuff will be repurchasing</li>
            <li> Found out that 100% pure aloe vera oil is not possible so this is mostly a carrier oil. The carrier oil is not in the product listing or on the bottle. I read that the company told other customers it&#x27;s almond oil. Not happy. The listing and product is false. You should buy aloe vera juice or gel, or just get the plant and make it yourself. Don&#x27;t trust these private third party companies- you never know what you&#x27;re getting. It&#x27;s dangerous with all the allergies people have. This company should be ashamed.</li>
