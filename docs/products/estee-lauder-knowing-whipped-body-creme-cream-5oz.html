    <ol>
            <li>It was perfect!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going the way of another great product of theirs &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>It was great Knowing you though!!ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li>It is not &#x27;that&#x27; great.</li>
            <li>Estee Lauder has gotten too proud of their products for the price of a scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is great for daytime and nighttime wear.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to be able to get it through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Excellent transaction - Thank-you!!!!! :-)</li>
            <li>I am happy I was able to find it on-line at Amszon, because I cannot find it in the departments stores or on EstÃ©e Lauder&#x27;s website anymore.</li>
            <li>Honestly, there is no way to tell about the contents, until beginning to use the product for comparison to an unopened or unbroken sealed package.  </li>
            <li>The item I purchased is excellent and new as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency and scent of this body lotion, and always receive compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>their &amp;#34;Knowing Red&amp;#34; lipstick which was introduced when the Knowing brand arrived on the scene more than 25 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Too many competitors to pay 195.00 for one tube of body crÃ¨me.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this scent -</li>
            <li>I love this scent, I get lots of comments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Love it.......</li>
            <li>so many compliments</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to be able to order this discontinued product from Estee Lauder and this was my first time to purchase a beauty product online.  </li>
            <li>Though I had problems with delivery of this item, everyone here was courteous, and very helpful.</li>
            <li>It is a great item, but it seems now the price has doubled since my last order.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to buy it at the original price.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, I was able to find it here.  </li>
            <li>The product was delivered quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>The tube lasts about a year, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I wish that I would have been more aware of misleading online packaging descriptions, as I probably would not have paid over double the original manuracturer retail suggested price for this product.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately Estee Lauder has discontinued this wonderful body cream although you can still purchase the lotion and the cologne at department stores, etc.  </li>
            <li>We sincerely hope they bring it back!!!!</li>
            <li>t has been my favorite scent for a long time!!</li>
            <li>This aroma when worn can&#x27;t be noticed by the wearer, but everyone else you come in contact with is immersed in the smoothest, most subtle rich scent ever developed.  </li>
            <li>If you like this fragrance and this product, get it now, before they&#x27;re completely sold out.  </li>
            <li>Although the seller description noted that the product was NEW in the box, upon receipt, the box was slightly damaged and was NOT wrapped in the protective plastic seal wrap as if purchased NEW direct from the department store.  </li>
            <li>Too bad all the great products are given the boot.  </li>
            <li>This has apparently been discontinued in stores.</li>

            <li> Though I had problems with delivery of this item, everyone here was courteous, and very helpful. The item I purchased is excellent and new as advertised. I will definitely be purchasing again</li>
            <li> It was perfect!  I am happy I was able to find it on-line at Amszon, because I cannot find it in the departments stores or on EstÃ©e Lauder&#x27;s website anymore.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Estee Lauder has discontinued this wonderful body cream although you can still purchase the lotion and the cologne at department stores, etc.  So when my mother asked if I could find this product for her and I couldn&#x27;t get it the usual way, I came to Amazon.  Sure enough, I was able to find it here.  If you like this fragrance and this product, get it now, before they&#x27;re completely sold out.  Am thinking of getting another tube for myself and keeping it in the refrigerator until I need it!</li>

            <li> This has apparently been discontinued in stores. It is a great item, but it seems now the price has doubled since my last order. It is not &#x27;that&#x27; great. When it was in the stores, it was only 59.00. Estee Lauder has gotten too proud of their products for the price of a scent. Too many competitors to pay 195.00 for one tube of body crÃ¨me. I hope I am mistaken on this. If so, let me know and I will continue to buy it at the original price.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for many years. Recently I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding it in the stores. I was very happy to be able to get it through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Knowing met my requirement. Yeah!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction - Thank-you!!!!! :-) I LOVE this scent - they don&#x27;t make strong products like this anymore :-(</li>

I wish that I would have been more aware of misleading online packaging descriptions, as I probably would not have paid over double the original manuracturer retail suggested price for this product.  I would like to have confidence in the online sellers that the products are sold as described, despite inconsistent packaging. I hope my comments are helpful to online buyers.  Cheers!</li>
            <li> i bought this knowing body creme. I&#x27;ve been wearing &amp;#34;Knowing&amp;#34; for 28 years. It didn&#x27;t have one drop of &amp;#34;knowing&amp;#34; scent to it. Maybe a homemade experiment that didn&#x27;t pan out.  I&#x27;ll never buy &amp;#34;knowing&amp;#34; products from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Love it.......so many compliments</li>

            <li> I have been using this scent for yrs. I also use the perfume and layer with the cream. I get a lot of compliments about the scent.</li>
