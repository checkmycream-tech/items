            <li>Best black ink in the business!</li>
            <li>very black, and very happy</li>
            <li>this stuff is packed full of pigments  and will stain anything you spill it on  </li>
            <li>I will be back for more for sure.</li>
            <li>Super super black...great for outlining or coloring tribal.</li>
            <li>fun time.</li>
            <li>this black went in good the first time better second time used it on a light skin person and dam</li>
            <li>Dynamic&#x27;s black is the best I&#x27;ve used to this point...and who knows...</li>
            <li>only a few percentage of skin might come out great but for the most of society it is.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will never buy this type of ink again, it was a waste of good money...</li>
            <li>Best black hands down.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very particular about the products I use on my clients...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, the deep rich black Is one of a kind.</li>
            <li>i just wish it was a little bit thicker but overall its easy to put in and heals nicely after you use a s***load</li>
            <li>but it really is a gamble</li>
            <li>im not going to complian too much, i got what i paid for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very week.</li>
            <li>very inexpensive too.</li>
            <li>....I also noticed that upon inspection that this ink IS NOT in fact genuine Dynamic Tattoo ink.  </li>
            <li>fast shipper.</li>
            <li>It goes in super smooth and retains the black color</li>
            <li>Also there is other types of ink for sale, thats a lot better.</li>
            <li>I contacted Dynamic directly, and they confirmed that this is a counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li>i would recommend for any aspiring tattoo artist or professional..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional tattooer</li>
            <li>Whoever said this ink is so strong it will stain your floor was confusing this ink with some other probably.</li>

            <li> Whoever said this ink is so strong it will stain your floor was confusing this ink with some other probably.</li>
            <li> It really brings out the black in a tattoo and it also is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tattooing a long time and have used dynamic for years this stuff is way thicker and the labels are slightly different.</li>
            <li> Hmmm... several customers actually called Dynamic and confirmed this one is a fake.</li>
            <li> fast black fill and dark too.</li>
            <li> Really black and intense for tribal black work!</li>
            <li> I noticed the label looked &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; compared to other bottles of Dynamic that we have laying around the shop.  </li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product for tattoo artist doing a lot of black.</li>
            <li> I even received my ink way before expected..</li>
            <li> The only reason I ordered from this seller is to save a few bucks on shipping....</li>
            <li> but not sure if it will keep its color over time, real dynamic ink goes for about 40 bucks and this stuff is about half the price</li>
            <li> dark dark dark ink...sticks in the skin in one pass if you know what you are doing...</li>
            <li> I will never use another black.</li>
            <li> was this ink black on this person.i</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a serious tattoo artist, this is the only black ink you should ever use.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve read L. Martinez&#x27;s review before I ordered, and I hope I save someone else the trouble of ordering this.  </li>
            <li> This ink was watered down and was hard for the black to take to the skin.</li>
            <li> some ppl have complained about the bottle</li>
            <li> No lot number its fake</li>
            <li> it was fake trash.</li>
            <li> I can not speculate as to whether or not the seller is purposely selling a fake product or not...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> No joke it was totally what they said it was!  I&#x27;ve been using this ink for years and had no idea I could get it here!  I will be back for more for sure.</li>
            <li> No lot number its fake</li>
            <li> Best black ink around use it all da time it&#x27;s famous in Miami we love tats and ink come chek us out on Instagram @dhatslidanite</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> This is not real dynamic tattoo ink that being said it works ok it goes in well but not sure if it will keep its color over time, real dynamic ink goes for about 40 bucks and this stuff is about half the price but it really is a gamble</li>
            <li> This item was not real Dynamic it was fake trash. I&#x27;ve been tattooing a long time and have used dynamic for years this stuff is way thicker and the labels are slightly different. Don&#x27;t trust any knock off items like this. Please remember you are dealing with someone&#x27;s skin these knock off company&#x27;s don&#x27;t care about its use or how it will heal..trash...</li>
            <li> This ink was watered down and was hard for the black to take to the skin. I will never buy this type of ink again, it was a waste of good money...im not going to complian too much, i got what i paid for. Also there is other types of ink for sale, thats a lot better.</li>
            <li> Hmmm... several customers actually called Dynamic and confirmed this one is a fake. It&#x27;s reported to Amazon as well.I would expect this seller to be banned or something by now then.&lt;br /&gt; I bought this ink, and used it once. Didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s very week. Whoever said this ink is so strong it will stain your floor was confusing this ink with some other probably. I was trying to save some money on shipping as well and found this one. I will return this item as I will not jeopardize my clients with ink of a suspicious origin.</li>
            <li> this stuff is packed full of pigments  and will stain anything you spill it on  but it does a great job  in the skin</li>
            <li> Best black hands down. Even beats out eternal ink. I will never use another black. Totally blew my mind. Great buy!</li>
            <li> this black went in good the first time better second time used it on a light skin person and dam was this ink black on this person.i will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Super super black...great for outlining or coloring tribal. It goes in super smooth and retains the black color well instead of fading to gray like some inks.</li>
            <li> Best black ink in the business! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a serious tattoo artist, this is the only black ink you should ever use.  It never fades and drops like a dream.  I make my grey washes from this as well and my work blends beautifully.  Two thumbs way up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, the deep rich black Is one of a kind. I&#x27;ve tried others and dynamic is the best.</li>
            <li> dark dark dark ink...sticks in the skin in one pass if you know what you are doing...some ppl have complained about the bottle but I have no complaints here...everything was perfect ..I even received my ink way before expected..i would recommend for any aspiring tattoo artist or professional..</li>
            <li> great product. fast black fill and dark too. very inexpensive too. only a few percentage of skin might come out great but for the most of society it is.</li>
            <li> Really black and intense for tribal black work! I totally recommend this product for tattoo artist doing a lot of black.</li>
            <li> In addition to not receiving this ink until 2 1/2 weeks after my order (10 days after the max delivery date)....I also noticed that upon inspection that this ink IS NOT in fact genuine Dynamic Tattoo ink.  I noticed the label looked &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; compared to other bottles of Dynamic that we have laying around the shop.  I contacted Dynamic directly, and they confirmed that this is a counterfeit product.  I can not speculate as to whether or not the seller is purposely selling a fake product or not...but that&#x27;s of no consequence to me.  I&#x27;m a professional tattooer and I&#x27;m very particular about the products I use on my clients...and I have no idea what this stuff is.  The only reason I ordered from this seller is to save a few bucks on shipping....a mistake I WILL NOT make again.  I wish I would&#x27;ve read L. Martinez&#x27;s review before I ordered, and I hope I save someone else the trouble of ordering this.  I have reported this issue to both Dynamic and Amazon&#x27;s fraud department.  The one-star rating is strictly for this seller and this bogus product....Dynamic&#x27;s black is the best I&#x27;ve used to this point...and who knows...maybe whatever is in this bottle is &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;...but I won&#x27;t risk my client&#x27;s health and safety to find out.</li>
            <li> fast shipper. good product, easy to use. nice. a good buy. fun time. will buy again, got to love it.</li>
            <li> very black, and very happy</li>
            <li> This ink is pretty good i just wish it was a little bit thicker but overall its easy to put in and heals nicely after you use a s***load</li>
            <li> Had a close friend introduce me to this lining ink and I loved it ever since.  It really brings out the black in a tattoo and it also is long lasting.  Can&#x27;t wait to try your white dynamic ink.  Thanks!</li>
