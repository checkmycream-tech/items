            <li> Excellent product!  Quick attention very well packed and fast! - It is powerful to my wife loves</li>
            <li> I rarely write a review for products I purchase but for this one I had to do it. First, DON&#x27;T LET THE  &amp;#34;made in Italy&amp;#34; FOOL YOU. it&#x27;s one of the cheapest looking and feeling product that I&#x27;ve ever seen. Worst than a China made $10 blow dryer at Walmart. Second, &amp;#34;Mega Turbo&amp;#34;?? Hahaha. What a joke. This blow dryer was one of the weakest on the market. It really blows!! Pun intended. I returned an hour after I opened the box. Very disappointed. Sometimes I wonder how the seller end up having good reviews for such products. Oh well!!!  IN MY OPINION DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME NOR YOUR MONEY ON THIS.</li>
            <li> Long and heavy duty cord, powerful, great attachments, enough settings and the buttons are a little recessed so you can&#x27;t mistakenly hit them while you&#x27;re drying.  Fees sturdy but not too heavy.  Good product for the buck.</li>
            <li> nunca recibi el producto. me gustaria que me repusieran el dinero por favor</li>
            <li> Thanks successfully received good product, I hope very soon make a new purchase with you. ...... .... .... .. .</li>
            <li> El articulo llego en perfecto estado y exactamente como lo describió el vendedor.&lt;br /&gt;Cumplieron con hacer el envio rapido y seguro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOS CALIFICO EXCELENTE</li>
            <li> This is a bullit proof hair dryer.  Heavy duty cord and a good solid body make this dryer the best</li>
            <li> This item broke within 1 week of giving it to my wife for christmas. It has some kind of warranty, but we didn&#x27;t even bother with it. If you are willing to send it in everytime it breaks then go for it, but not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This dryer is great. I have very frizzes hair and its powerful enough to blow my hair smooth. The heat and power are really good.I&#x27;m a hairdresses and work with a lot of dryers. This one is really good!!!</li>
            <li> For such an amazing name and owning 2 prior turbo dryers...this dryer is poorly made. The buttons turn off easily as you are drying bc they are in the wrong place.  Disappointing. For the amount of money you spend, it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I used to have a turbo power hair dryer which is very powerful but the 3000 is little bit dissappointing because the dryer is not strong enough and bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> Excelente los tiempos de entrega, la ropa llego en buen estado. buenos vendedores, Excelente el producto los recomiendo para futuras compras</li>
