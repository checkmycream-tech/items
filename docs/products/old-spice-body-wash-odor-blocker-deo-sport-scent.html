            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s interesting about the Odor Blocker line of Old Spice body wash is how you feel after using it.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that I wish it was available in more scents.</li>
            <li>SO POWERFUL</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>Great scent and last a lot longer than other body washes that I have used(Axe, Gillette).</li>
            <li>but i still need to find the very thick sky blue soap, it smells the best.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that the scent of it has much to do with how it blocks odor.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well.</li>

            <li>Best body soap/shampoo for men who have body odor issues, mainly those who have stress jobs (manual labor) or those who hunt (and wear cold gear clothes).</li>
            <li>but this time it is not any better than any other body wash.</li>
            <li>Spice Body Wash did leave my skin feeling cleaner than a bar of soap normally does.</li>
            <li>My husband was not feeling clean with other body washes.</li>
            <li>Stays fresh throughout the day but make your skin dry so try using lotion after bath .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the other numerous old spice body washes, and this is the only one that actually keeps your smelling good for a looong time.</li>
            <li>but this DeoSport smells like the old school OS fragrance.</li>
            <li>OLD SPICE ODOR BLOCKER BLOCKS ODER</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost every scent of old spice body wash and this is the one.</li>
            <li>Old Spice hit the bull&#x27;s eye.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try out a gel form of soap and thought that I would give Old Spice Body Wash a try.</li>
            <li>the recurring orders... a subscription to Old Spice.  </li>

            <li> No other body wash has blocked odor so well.</li>
            <li> This has a long lasting scent and the smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering like with a lot of these liquid soaps.  </li>
            <li> I have the tendency to develop crack, dried skin in the winter that many soaps make worse.  </li>
            <li> it cleans well and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Although for some reason it didn&#x27;t last that long as other body wash products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy that is fairly active.</li>
            <li> IT CAN KEEP YOU FROM SMELLING LIKE A CESSPOOL AFTER EXCESSIVE DRINKING AND PLAYING DANCE CENTRAL.  </li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t as harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li> No strong smell and does the job.</li>
            <li> I usually get the DeoFresh</li>
            <li> I bought this product through the subscribe and save and it was cheaper than what I usually pay at Target.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s coming hard to come by nowadays.</li>
            <li> We quit using bar soap because it leaves scum on the glass.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a flood of advertisements lately.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all.  </li>
            <li> It sounds weird, but seriously...give it a try and feel your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I picked a scent that I was not fond of and am now stuck using two bottles until I can achieve the scent</li>

            <li> The name says it all! This body wash is the best odor blocker I have ever used. Added it to my Subscribe and Save list.</li>
            <li> My favorite shower gel/wash. I usually get the DeoFresh but this DeoSport smells like the old school OS fragrance.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this it last all day and the price is great. This would be a great stocking stuffer or a just casue gift.</li>
            <li> This is the only and best body wash ever! I used to buy it at wal-mart but it&#x27;s coming hard to come by nowadays. I ordered 6 bottles so im fully stocked up and no need to worry about running around looking for it. I&#x27;ve tried the other numerous old spice body washes, and this is the only one that actually keeps your smelling good for a looong time.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I was under the impression that Old Spice no longer made it, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. What&#x27;s interesting about the Odor Blocker line of Old Spice body wash is how you feel after using it. I don&#x27;t believe that the scent of it has much to do with how it blocks odor. Based on how it makes my skin feel, I daresay that it leaves a coating of sorts on your skin that traps odors inside while still allowing your skin to breathe. It sounds weird, but seriously...give it a try and feel your skin afterwards. This stuff works really well. My only gripe is that I wish it was available in more scents.</li>
            <li> I bought this product through the subscribe and save and it was cheaper than what I usually pay at Target.  Item smells great and my husband really likes this soap.</li>
            <li> OLD SPICE ODOR BLOCKER BLOCKS ODER FOR UP TO 7+ HOURS.  ITS SO POWERFUL IT CAN KEEP YOU FROM SMELLING LIKE A CESSPOOL AFTER EXCESSIVE DRINKING AND PLAYING DANCE CENTRAL.  POTATO CHIPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bodywash and my girlfriend loves it when I use it as well. The sent is nice and does not have a strong fragrance of cologne like many of their other products. I had to settle for their &amp;#34;Deo Fresh&amp;#34; since no one in my area seems to carry this one anymore. Yet I was happy to see that amazon was carrying it now and made sure to buy a couple of these 2-packs.</li>
            <li> Good one. No strong smell and does the job. Although for some reason it didn&#x27;t last that long as other body wash products. Nice price with S&amp;S.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every scent of old spice body wash and this is the one. Smells good and it lasts all day long on you and in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> When I shower with this, I smell the same at the end of the day. No other body wash has blocked odor so well. The scent is a simple, pleasant clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy that is fairly active. Big guys can generate a funk in a hurry, but this stuff keeps me fesh all day. I use to buy it locally but i can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore, Amazon to the rescue.</li>
            <li> This body wash has worked great.  It leaves my husband feeling clean and smelling great.  He works outside a lot and it keeps the body odor away</li>
            <li> i like it ok but i still need to find the very thick sky blue soap, it smells the best.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite body wash. We quit using bar soap because it leaves scum on the glass. My husband was not feeling clean with other body washes. This one is the closest to bar soap we can find.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE the odor blocker and the scent lasted all day but this time it is not any better than any other body wash. It cleans and smells good but doesn&#x27;t last like it used to</li>
            <li> It is really work nicely for men at work :) Stays fresh throughout the day but make your skin dry so try using lotion after bath .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years now, it&#x27;s a great smell.  it cleans well and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of all of the different aroma choices of Old Spice body wash, but my wife believes this one is her favorite.  It does last throughout a 10 hour work day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the blue version and they both smell really good. My sons like them both and I have placed a second order. Old Spice hit the bull&#x27;s eye.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> BACKGROUND&lt;br /&gt;I have been using soap in the form of bars for years. I wanted to try out a gel form of soap and thought that I would give Old Spice Body Wash a try. It is a name brand and I have seen a flood of advertisements lately. How could I go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USEAGE&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice Body Wash did leave my skin feeling cleaner than a bar of soap normally does. The scent is strong and lasts a long time. Unfortunately, I picked a scent that I was not fond of and am now stuck using two bottles until I can achieve the scent I desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you are applying the gel with a wash cloth, bath sponge, or pouf. if you do not, you are not lathering the soap up to do a proper job of cleansing the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;++ Leaves the skin clean&lt;br /&gt;++ Body Wash scent lasts lengthy amount of time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;++ Body wash scent lasts lengthy amount of time (if you dislike scent, this will leave you unhappy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice Body Wash has convinced me to switch from soap in the form of bars. Just make sure you purchase a scent that you are happy with as this product is strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Best body soap/shampoo for men who have body odor issues, mainly those who have stress jobs (manual labor) or those who hunt (and wear cold gear clothes).</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all.  I purchased this 2 pack, used the product once and the \\&quot;sport scent\\&quot; is way overpowering.  I guess it will block odor, but at what cost?  I showered and could&#x27;t put up with the \\&quot;sport scent\\&quot;.  I ended up showering 2 hours later with my regular bar of soap to get the scent off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this body wash!</li>
            <li> Great scent and last a lot longer than other body washes that I have used(Axe, Gillette). I picked this up when they had the Subscribe and Save deal.</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash for a productive man. It&#x27;s great for those who do physical labor and or just want to keep themselves fresh. This is a certified chick magnet! Nice longevity even while you&#x27;re sweating!</li>
            <li> This has a long lasting scent and the smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering like with a lot of these liquid soaps.  It also isn&#x27;t as harsh on the skin.  I have the tendency to develop crack, dried skin in the winter that many soaps make worse.  This one, however, doesn&#x27;t seem to bother it.</li>
            <li> For reasons beyond my comprehension, this item has disappeared from every convenience store in America.  This is the most wonderfully scented male body wash on the market, and really does keep it up all day.  After a while of using it, it just soaked into my skin and I could go a day or two without showering.  I always got compliments on how good I smelled!!!</li>
            <li> I am stationed overseas, and for some reason, the BX does not carry this, nor does the commissary.  I was wondering what I was going to do.  Then I saw this on Amazon... the recurring orders... a subscription to Old Spice.  I took the opportunity to use it.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about not smelling good, ever again.  I&#x27;ll just have this shipped to my place, wherever I go!  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love the scent. I love that it smells fresh all day. I love everything about it!</li>
