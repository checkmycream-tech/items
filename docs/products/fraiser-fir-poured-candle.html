            <li>I was given one of these candles as a hostess gift - which is a great idea- and just fell in love with the scent!  </li>
            <li>My mother-in-law loved the smell of the scented oil we had over Christmas.  </li>
            <li>But to me, it&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>These candles smell so good.  </li>
            <li>It was good to try once, but I won&#x27;t buy one again.</li>
            <li>Burns clean and smells awesome....</li>
            <li>Christmas tree is easily in my top 5 favorite smells, and the Thymes Frasier Fir line provides that scent perfectly.</li>

            <li>These candles smell more like a Fir tree than some Fir trees!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and ads to the Christmas feeling.</li>
            <li>the scent is amazing and reminds me of Christmas.</li>
            <li>This candle tidily fills that gap.</li>
            <li>It lingers nicely but doesn&#x27;t overpower a room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but also wonderful to burn through the whole winter.</li>
            <li>WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD IN HERE; I LOVE THAT SCENT.  </li>
            <li>The Candle has a nice look and a nice scent but</li>
            <li>this is a one of a kind product</li>
            <li>is very decorate and a delightful addition to any room.  </li>
            <li>Yes its the best and strongest candle I know of, but not by much.  </li>
            <li>these burn clean and smell great even when not burning and look nice too.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for a more intense scent, but what there was, was delicious.</li>
            <li>love, love, love!</li>
            <li>Perfect smell of a Christmas tree, especially if you do not have room for a tree in your own home.</li>
            <li>The box smells wonderful, but when burning the candle itself, I can barely smell any pine scent, even after burning for two hours.</li>
            <li>I love this candle.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite candle -- brand and scent.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite candle.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite candle.</li>
            <li>This is probably the most natural-smelling candle I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Best scent for the holidays, instant cheer.</li>
            <li>The Thymes poured candle in Frasier fir fragrance is the perfect finishing touch for a winter decor and especially so for a home decked out for the holidays.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a treat for the senses, including the eyes, in its handsomely designed glass jar.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Christmas candle of all time....</li>

            <li>I love the Thymes Frasier Fir scent.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>ANY MORE  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many fir/pine/evergreen candles and none compare to this one.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite is the Frasier Fir hand soaps.  </li>
            <li>The Frasier Fir scent of the Thymes candles is the most authentic ever.</li>
            <li>Most evergreen scented candles smell like bathroom air freshener.</li>
            <li>Especially during the Christmas season, it is the best ever and yearly tradition!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the way it makes our home smell.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s not an overwhelming or intrusive smell at all.</li>
            <li>This long-lasting candle smells like the most fragrant frasier fir.  </li>
            <li>I love pine scented anything and this fills the bill.  </li>
            <li>I love these candles.</li>
            <li>Should not be more than $16.00.</li>
            <li>Got two; will buy more.  </li>
            <li>how the wax in the glass be comes translucent with the top 1/2 inch of the wax, after it&#x27;s been burning for a while.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy it!</li>
            <li>Love these candles.</li>
            <li>This is one of my three favorite candles in the world.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten a better smell for fir scent.</li>
            <li>it is not the elegant gift i wanted to give...</li>
            <li>absolutely love this candle.</li>
            <li>I love this scent from Thymes.  </li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>I love that it gives my home a winter smell even after Christmas.</li>
            <li>I just love the scent that this candle gives off.  </li>

            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>This candle is ok.</li>

            <li>Great natural scent.</li>
            <li>I could not be any happier with this candle; incredible, real pine smell and VERY fragrant without being overwhelming or headache producing.</li>
            <li>I leave in the closed bedroom for the day and when I get home the room smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>but I loved it so much</li>
            <li>it makes a lovely gift and is packaged beautifully in a festive box and nice green colored glass.</li>
            <li>This is a true fir scent, and it&#x27;s not flowery or perfumed smelling, just smells like a walk in a forest!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re ok with a sweet pine scent, you may like this product.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s got a great, rich, complex beautiful smell - worth every penny.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t stop picking it up and sniffing it - hope I don&#x27;t light my eyebrows on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>A very complimentary winter scent to your home.</li>
            <li>Definitely more economical than buying cheap candles that burn too quickly.</li>
            <li>She likes the fresh, clean pine scent!</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I buy the lotion as well, but the candle is the original.</li>
            <li>but it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Beyond that, I have nothing negative to say about this delightful candle.</li>

            <li>the votives are perfect for christmas parties, and the larger candle for infusing a larger space.  </li>
            <li>wonderful winter scent, long lasting and not over powering</li>
            <li>I light this candle in the evenings and in about 5 minutes my whole house smells like a Frasier Fir.</li>

            <li>Lovely natural scent.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>If i could complain, it&#x27;d probably be about the price, but it&#x27;s easily worth it</li>
            <li>Smells like a fresh christmas tree.</li>
            <li>But to me this is worth it.</li>

            <li>I prefer the old packaging better</li>

            <li>It will last me forever because I enjoy the smell without even having to light it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t hear anything negative from my brother so she must have liked it. :)</li>
            <li>It is rare that I pay so much for a candle</li>
            <li>BE THE FIRST IN LINE TO FILL UP MY CAR, AND THAT&#x27;S THE TRUTH....</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law bought me my first Thymes candle about 3 years ago</li>
            <li>My friend called the smell more &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; than the Frasier Fir soap which I actually have to agree with.</li>
            <li>The fact that people are still willing to pay for them speaks to their quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to keep using it because I love the smell, but I&#x27;ve packed it away to use again next year.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that smells exactly like a pine tree, this is not it.</li>
            <li>Burning these candles brings out the fresh scent of a real pine tree in your home.</li>
            <li>This is pretty expensive for the size of candle but it absolutely has the best fragrence ever!  </li>
            <li>Smells exactly like a Christmas tree and really brings the spirit of the holidays</li>
            <li>I keep it in its box (with the top open) and take out only when I want to light it.</li>
            <li>We have used this candle previously, purchased elsewhere, and that candle provided a strong scent that filled the house.</li>
            <li>Smells just like a real tree.  </li>
            <li>Very fragrant but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T REALLY CARE WHAT IT COSTS</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hooked on the whole line.  </li>
            <li>They really smell like a fir tree.  </li>
            <li>The price is very steep though.</li>
            <li>This candle is very aromatic and the glass is comes in</li>
            <li>Very realy piny scent that fills the room.  </li>
            <li>I really like this candle and would it again.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really invigorating.  </li>
            <li>We caved and purchased a faux christmas tree this year, and this candle made it seem like we had a real tree in our living room.  </li>
            <li>I find them very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first look, the price seems high, but they&#x27;re well-priced fro their high quality.</li>
            <li>Adds the perfect touch to our fake Christmas tree!</li>
            <li>You can blow out the candle and still smell the crisp, wintery scent for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Consider purchasing two, if only to give one to a special person on your gift</li>
            <li>I love them so much that I use them year round though not as often as I do during the holidays.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Pricing is too high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s as pure and natural as a fir tree</li>
            <li>A little more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I buy this candle only once a year at Christmas time because it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more, with whatever glass design, but I&#x27;m hoping that Thymes will stick with these and dump the green glass that they offer with this scented wax candle.  </li>
            <li>What is the point of buying inexpensive candles that don&#x27;t live up to expectations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it certainly smells reminiscent of pine, it is also very sweet smelling, which makes the whole aroma a little nauseating for me.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best fir tree fragrances out there and does not smell artificial at all.</li>
            <li>This candle is long lasting and strong smelling.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a very sweet and smells just like the sap that comes out of a real fir tree after trimming branches, but extremely strong.&lt;br /&gt;It lasted about as long as burning it as any other cheap candle that size</li>
            <li>My significant other cannot smell the scent at all.</li>
            <li>I love the Frasier Fir scent, and I have purchased this item in the past.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this before and it looked exactly like the current picture.</li>
            <li>The scent is super strong, and the candle lasts a long long long time!  </li>
            <li>i look forward picking one of these up every year and my honey can&#x27;t say enough positive things about it as well.  </li>
            <li>like a very green tree such as a pine tree...very nice scent..</li>
            <li>EVERY FIVE STAR REVIEW CLEARLY STATES</li>
            <li>Smells natural and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Pretty and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The only candle I&#x27;ve ever come across that smells like real pine.</li>
            <li>They permeate the house with a soft scent of winter without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a Christmas gift and was surprised to already smell it before I even opened the box, the amazon cardboard one it came in that is.  </li>
            <li>a big smile will cross your face.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying a few of the cheaper 4-5$ bigger candles with the lid at walmart.</li>
            <li>As more of us turn to artificial Christmas trees we feel the lack of the crisp and invigorating scent a live tree brings with it.</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey compared to the other pine candles for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of scented candles in general, but I make an exception for Thymes Frasier Fir.  </li>
            <li>This candle really has a long lasting scent wherever you have it burning.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look like this, didn&#x27;t smell like much, and didn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>This seems like a fairly long lasting candle compared to most, so I can take this scent well past the holiday and through the winter.</li>
            <li>While this may be an expensive candle, it is totally worth it if you want a candle that smells like a TRUE Christmas Tree.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t like to see the tree dead and sagging before Christmas, I usually put off getting our tree till mid December, and this candle will fill the gap nicely in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other candle can compare to actual pine trees.</li>
            <li>package was slightly damaged, very dissapointed.</li>

            <li> I keep this by the bed, and it gives me a pleasant smell while I&#x27;m going to sleep.</li>
            <li> I was given one of these candles as a hostess gift - which is a great idea- and just fell in love with the scent!  </li>
            <li> My mother-in-law loved the smell of the scented oil we had over Christmas.  </li>
            <li> But to me, it&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> These candles smell so good.  </li>
            <li> It was good to try once, but I won&#x27;t buy one again.</li>
            <li> Burns clean and smells awesome....</li>
            <li> Christmas tree is easily in my top 5 favorite smells, and the Thymes Frasier Fir line provides that scent perfectly.</li>

            <li> These candles smell more like a Fir tree than some Fir trees!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing and ads to the Christmas feeling.</li>
            <li> the scent is amazing and reminds me of Christmas.</li>
            <li> This candle tidily fills that gap.</li>
            <li> It lingers nicely but doesn&#x27;t overpower a room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but also wonderful to burn through the whole winter.</li>
            <li> WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD IN HERE; I LOVE THAT SCENT.  </li>
            <li> The Candle has a nice look and a nice scent but</li>
            <li> this is a one of a kind product</li>
            <li> is very decorate and a delightful addition to any room.  </li>
            <li> Yes its the best and strongest candle I know of, but not by much.  </li>
            <li> these burn clean and smell great even when not burning and look nice too.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a more intense scent, but what there was, was delicious.</li>
            <li> love, love, love!</li>
            <li> Perfect smell of a Christmas tree, especially if you do not have room for a tree in your own home.</li>
            <li> The box smells wonderful, but when burning the candle itself, I can barely smell any pine scent, even after burning for two hours.</li>
            <li> I love this candle.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite candle -- brand and scent.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite candle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite candle.</li>
            <li> This is probably the most natural-smelling candle I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Best scent for the holidays, instant cheer.</li>
            <li> The Thymes poured candle in Frasier fir fragrance is the perfect finishing touch for a winter decor and especially so for a home decked out for the holidays.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a treat for the senses, including the eyes, in its handsomely designed glass jar.  </li>
            <li> My favorite Christmas candle of all time....</li>

            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> ANY MORE  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many fir/pine/evergreen candles and none compare to this one.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite is the Frasier Fir hand soaps.  </li>
            <li> The Frasier Fir scent of the Thymes candles is the most authentic ever.</li>
            <li> Most evergreen scented candles smell like bathroom air freshener.</li>
            <li> Especially during the Christmas season, it is the best ever and yearly tradition!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the way it makes our home smell.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s not an overwhelming or intrusive smell at all.</li>
            <li> This long-lasting candle smells like the most fragrant frasier fir.  </li>
            <li> I love pine scented anything and this fills the bill.  </li>
            <li> I love these candles.</li>
            <li> Should not be more than $16.00.</li>
            <li> Got two; will buy more.  </li>
            <li> how the wax in the glass be comes translucent with the top 1/2 inch of the wax, after it&#x27;s been burning for a while.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy it!</li>
            <li> Love these candles.</li>
            <li> This is one of my three favorite candles in the world.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten a better smell for fir scent.</li>
            <li> it is not the elegant gift i wanted to give...</li>
            <li> absolutely love this candle.</li>
            <li> I love this scent from Thymes.  </li>
            <li> but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I love that it gives my home a winter smell even after Christmas.</li>
            <li> I just love the scent that this candle gives off.  </li>

            <li> Great natural scent.</li>
            <li> I could not be any happier with this candle; incredible, real pine smell and VERY fragrant without being overwhelming or headache producing.</li>
            <li> I leave in the closed bedroom for the day and when I get home the room smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> but I loved it so much</li>
            <li> it makes a lovely gift and is packaged beautifully in a festive box and nice green colored glass.</li>
            <li> This is a true fir scent, and it&#x27;s not flowery or perfumed smelling, just smells like a walk in a forest!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re ok with a sweet pine scent, you may like this product.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s got a great, rich, complex beautiful smell - worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great graphic on the glass.  </li>
            <li> Smells like your In a Colorado forrest every time you light it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop picking it up and sniffing it - hope I don&#x27;t light my eyebrows on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> A very complimentary winter scent to your home.</li>
            <li> Definitely more economical than buying cheap candles that burn too quickly.</li>
            <li> She likes the fresh, clean pine scent!</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I buy the lotion as well, but the candle is the original.</li>
            <li> but it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Beyond that, I have nothing negative to say about this delightful candle.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> really hae to say it wish they were more accessable everywhere</li>
            <li> Everyone comments on how much they love the smell of this candle.</li>
            <li> the votives are perfect for christmas parties, and the larger candle for infusing a larger space.  </li>
            <li> wonderful winter scent, long lasting and not over powering</li>

            <li> The Thymes Frasier Fir candle makes your house smell like a fresh evergreen forest.</li>
            <li> It is super-aromatic, filling the room with that fresh</li>
            <li> Lovely natural scent.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> If i could complain, it&#x27;d probably be about the price, but it&#x27;s easily worth it</li>
            <li> Smells like a fresh christmas tree.</li>
            <li> But to me this is worth it.</li>
            <li> Candle is pricey but you get what you pay for and this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I prefer the old packaging better</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s the simplest things about Christmas that are the bast, like Christmas carols and the smell of a fresh cut tree.</li>
            <li> The candle doesn&#x27;t burn down quickly, giving buyers more time to enjoy the light and atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These candles last for a long time, burn very well, and have a wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other fir smelling candles because the reviews for this one are so good.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful to have a few extra on hand for seasonal gifts.</li>
            <li> The Wax is a fast melting wax so the candle finishes quickly.</li>
            <li> It will last me forever because I enjoy the smell without even having to light it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hear anything negative from my brother so she must have liked it. :)</li>
            <li> It is rare that I pay so much for a candle</li>
            <li> BE THE FIRST IN LINE TO FILL UP MY CAR, AND THAT&#x27;S THE TRUTH....</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law bought me my first Thymes candle about 3 years ago</li>
            <li> My friend called the smell more &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; than the Frasier Fir soap which I actually have to agree with.</li>
            <li> The fact that people are still willing to pay for them speaks to their quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to keep using it because I love the smell, but I&#x27;ve packed it away to use again next year.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that smells exactly like a pine tree, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Burning these candles brings out the fresh scent of a real pine tree in your home.</li>
            <li> This is pretty expensive for the size of candle but it absolutely has the best fragrence ever!  </li>
            <li> Smells exactly like a Christmas tree and really brings the spirit of the holidays</li>
            <li> I keep it in its box (with the top open) and take out only when I want to light it.</li>
            <li> We have used this candle previously, purchased elsewhere, and that candle provided a strong scent that filled the house.</li>
            <li> Smells just like a real tree.  </li>
            <li> Very fragrant but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T REALLY CARE WHAT IT COSTS</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hooked on the whole line.  </li>
            <li> They really smell like a fir tree.  </li>
            <li> The price is very steep though.</li>
            <li> This candle is very aromatic and the glass is comes in</li>
            <li> Very realy piny scent that fills the room.  </li>
            <li> I really like this candle and would it again.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really invigorating.  </li>
            <li> We caved and purchased a faux christmas tree this year, and this candle made it seem like we had a real tree in our living room.  </li>
            <li> I find them very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first look, the price seems high, but they&#x27;re well-priced fro their high quality.</li>
            <li> Adds the perfect touch to our fake Christmas tree!</li>
            <li> You can blow out the candle and still smell the crisp, wintery scent for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Consider purchasing two, if only to give one to a special person on your gift</li>
            <li> I love them so much that I use them year round though not as often as I do during the holidays.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Pricing is too high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as pure and natural as a fir tree</li>
            <li> A little more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I buy this candle only once a year at Christmas time because it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying more, with whatever glass design, but I&#x27;m hoping that Thymes will stick with these and dump the green glass that they offer with this scented wax candle.  </li>
            <li> What is the point of buying inexpensive candles that don&#x27;t live up to expectations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it certainly smells reminiscent of pine, it is also very sweet smelling, which makes the whole aroma a little nauseating for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best fir tree fragrances out there and does not smell artificial at all.</li>
            <li> This candle is long lasting and strong smelling.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a very sweet and smells just like the sap that comes out of a real fir tree after trimming branches, but extremely strong.&lt;br /&gt;It lasted about as long as burning it as any other cheap candle that size</li>
            <li> My significant other cannot smell the scent at all.</li>
            <li> I love the Frasier Fir scent, and I have purchased this item in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this before and it looked exactly like the current picture.</li>
            <li> The scent is super strong, and the candle lasts a long long long time!  </li>
            <li> i look forward picking one of these up every year and my honey can&#x27;t say enough positive things about it as well.  </li>
            <li> like a very green tree such as a pine tree...very nice scent..</li>
            <li> EVERY FIVE STAR REVIEW CLEARLY STATES</li>
            <li> Smells natural and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Pretty and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The only candle I&#x27;ve ever come across that smells like real pine.</li>
            <li> They permeate the house with a soft scent of winter without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift and was surprised to already smell it before I even opened the box, the amazon cardboard one it came in that is.  </li>
            <li> a big smile will cross your face.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying a few of the cheaper 4-5$ bigger candles with the lid at walmart.</li>
            <li> As more of us turn to artificial Christmas trees we feel the lack of the crisp and invigorating scent a live tree brings with it.</li>
            <li> Pretty pricey compared to the other pine candles for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of scented candles in general, but I make an exception for Thymes Frasier Fir.  </li>
            <li> This candle really has a long lasting scent wherever you have it burning.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look like this, didn&#x27;t smell like much, and didn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> This seems like a fairly long lasting candle compared to most, so I can take this scent well past the holiday and through the winter.</li>
            <li> While this may be an expensive candle, it is totally worth it if you want a candle that smells like a TRUE Christmas Tree.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t like to see the tree dead and sagging before Christmas, I usually put off getting our tree till mid December, and this candle will fill the gap nicely in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No other candle can compare to actual pine trees.</li>
            <li> package was slightly damaged, very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Not a sweet syrupy smell but a very natural pine scent.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t necessary to burn it for long.</li>
            <li> Also, very long lasting.</li>
            <li> While the outside box is accurate the candle inside was a plain glass container with an unattractive dark green color.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really looking for a strong X-mas tree scent though, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This will be a staple for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you long for the smell of Christmas when it is not Christmas this is the candle for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried candles from numerous companies (yankee candle, bath and body works, etc) but after trying Thymes candles, I will not go back to any other candle company!</li>
            <li> If you are unable or don&#x27;t have time to support a live Christmas tree, this candle is the closest you will get to a real tree smell and it has become a staple in my house around Christmas.</li>
            <li> There is no better aroma other than a real tree for the winter season and holidays.</li>
            <li> I bought an artificial tree this year but really missed the \\&quot;real tree\\&quot; smell around the house.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive, but since I only buy it around the holidays, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Either the smell is unappealing or the wax burns down too quickly.</li>
            <li> Smelled this in a small gift store and has amazed by the natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> the only thing was a little on the expensive side but worth the splurge!  </li>
            <li> it gets only 3 for the value, over 20$ for a little 1 wick candle?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to save these for the next winter holidays by sealing with heavy plastic wrap, not that it arrived with this as a needed handling.  </li>
            <li> They are expensive, but worth every penny for a candle lover</li>
            <li> it came in the same green tinted glass container as advertised, which I guess it didn&#x27;t for some people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never had such a strong opinion about a mere candle, and it seems quite silly actually.  </li>
            <li> My only critique would be that I wish it cost a little less.</li>
            <li> The only fault I find with the product is its price, which I feel is excessive.</li>
            <li> Not one company in the world, other than Trapps, can beat these candles.  </li>
            <li> The candle is a little expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased my fair share of candles listed as \\&quot;pine\\&quot; or \\&quot;fir\\&quot; and been very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The scent is NOT like pine sol, or some fake smelling artifical \\&quot;tree\\&quot; scent, this smells like the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually purchase expensive candles, but this one is worth the price.</li>
            <li> the bang for your buck is not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> just cut down from the forest, there is something about burning this and curling up with your sweetie in front of the christmas tree and just soaking it all in.  </li>
            <li> I had bought it previously in the votive size</li>
            <li> It was in a plain dark green glass container, no stenciling and the wax was also dark green.  </li>
            <li> These candles are expensive but are long lasting and fragrant to the end.</li>
            <li> I like my candle to smell a little sweeter.</li>
            <li> The candle provides little to no scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little overpowering in this size.  </li>
            <li> Makes the room so cozy.</li>
            <li> The one I received is green.</li>
            <li> it came in just a green glass, wax is also green.</li>
            <li> Waste, waste, waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Smells just like a Christmas tree but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Actually smells like a Christmas tree without that fake smell others have</li>
            <li> The problem is that usually by Christmas there isn&#x27;t a store that still has any in stock.</li>
            <li> There is no better product out on the market.</li>
            <li> For the past 3 years they have gone up in price about $5 each Holiday season.</li>
            <li> Its expensive, but when you get the package and open it up</li>
            <li> I go through at least one every Christmas season.  </li>
            <li> everyone, and i mean everyone loves this scent.  </li>
            <li> No better line of candles, soaps, potpourri, oils and scents!  </li>
            <li> all scented candles I have purchased in the past do not have any type of fragrance when lit unless you are standing within a foot of it !  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is THAT expensive for the product as some of the other reviewers have thought.  </li>
            <li> This candle  is so expensive that it would be cheaper to hire someone to stand in your house all day holding a limb from a pine tree that you cut down in your neighbors backyard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that the candle and the glass that holds it  are dark green and not the white shown.  </li>
            <li> , Douglas Pine scent some of us grew up with in the days before \\&quot;fake trees\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not to fake or over powering.</li>
            <li> I hate to recommend it because it may become hard to get.</li>
            <li> Since we have an artificial tree I wanted something to fill my house with the scent of pine.  </li>
            <li> It was so ugly that I would not even use myself.  </li>

            <li> Superb - the fragrance is wonderful. I use these candles throughout the year.</li>
            <li> I love this candle.  My only critique would be that I wish it cost a little less. I bought one for myself and my mother for xmas.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite candle -- brand and scent. It arrived on time for my sister&#x27;s birthday. Good job!</li>
            <li> Best fragrance for a candle in a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this candle every year, it&#x27;s the best smelling Christmas candle out there. Smells exactly like a Christmas tree and really brings the spirit of the holidays</li>
            <li> My all time favorite candle. Smells just like a Christmas tree but not overwhelming. I give these as gifts and everyone loves them.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite candle. Smells natural and not overpowering. Especially great around the holidays. Pretty and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This candle  is so expensive that it would be cheaper to hire someone to stand in your house all day holding a limb from a pine tree that you cut down in your neighbors backyard. Try cleaning your house and you won&#x27;t need this thing to cover up the stank. Not to mention that its a fire hazzard!</li>
            <li> Great natural scent. Not overpowering. Wonderful to have a few extra on hand for seasonal gifts.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these candles from a store nearby but I do shop Amazon constantly.  These candles are the best I&#x27;ve tried.  The scent is NOT like pine sol, or some fake smelling artifical \\&quot;tree\\&quot; scent, this smells like the real deal.  The scent is super strong, and the candle lasts a long long long time!  I have tried candles from numerous companies (yankee candle, bath and body works, etc) but after trying Thymes candles, I will not go back to any other candle company!</li>
            <li> This is probably the most natural-smelling candle I&#x27;ve ever used. If you are unable or don&#x27;t have time to support a live Christmas tree, this candle is the closest you will get to a real tree smell and it has become a staple in my house around Christmas.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a more intense scent, but what there was, was delicious.</li>
            <li> Best scent for the holidays, instant cheer. I don&#x27;t usually purchase expensive candles, but this one is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I could not be any happier with this candle; incredible, real pine smell and VERY fragrant without being overwhelming or headache producing. Also, very long lasting.</li>
            <li> There is no better aroma other than a real tree for the winter season and holidays.</li>
            <li> everyone, and i mean everyone loves this scent.  it&#x27;s as pure and natural as a fir tree just cut down from the forest, there is something about burning this and curling up with your sweetie in front of the christmas tree and just soaking it all in.  the votives are perfect for christmas parties, and the larger candle for infusing a larger space.  i look forward picking one of these up every year and my honey can&#x27;t say enough positive things about it as well.  well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The Thymes poured candle in Frasier fir fragrance is the perfect finishing touch for a winter decor and especially so for a home decked out for the holidays. As more of us turn to artificial Christmas trees we feel the lack of the crisp and invigorating scent a live tree brings with it. This candle tidily fills that gap. It&#x27;s a treat for the senses, including the eyes, in its handsomely designed glass jar.  The only fault I find with the product is its price, which I feel is excessive. Beyond that, I have nothing negative to say about this delightful candle. Treat yourself!</li>
            <li> Actually smells like a Christmas tree without that fake smell others have</li>
            <li> I get these candles every year. I&#x27;ve purchased my fair share of candles listed as \\&quot;pine\\&quot; or \\&quot;fir\\&quot; and been very disappointed. Either the smell is unappealing or the wax burns down too quickly. What is the point of buying inexpensive candles that don&#x27;t live up to expectations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I gasped at the price for the Thyme brand. But after trying the candles, I realized I was coming out ahead. Why? Some reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The aroma is perfect, with that freshly cut fir smell that goes with the holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The candle doesn&#x27;t burn down quickly, giving buyers more time to enjoy the light and atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You can blow out the candle and still smell the crisp, wintery scent for more than a few minutes. It lingers nicely but doesn&#x27;t overpower a room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It isn&#x27;t necessary to burn it for long. This allows the candle - and scent - to last for the entire season. Consider purchasing two, if only to give one to a special person on your gift list).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The design is both tasteful and attractive, perfect for nearly any room.</li>
            <li> My favorite Christmas candle of all time....but also wonderful to burn through the whole winter. The problem is that usually by Christmas there isn&#x27;t a store that still has any in stock. So nice to know that I can now get my Frasier Fir candles any time with Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> Look no further.  If you want a great smelling christmas candle, this is it.  Nobody doesn&#x27;t love how this candle smells.</li>
            <li> It is rare that I pay so much for a candle but we wanted the evergeen scent in the house throughout the Christmas season. This candle was remarkably fragrant, very attractive, and long-lasting. Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I love the Thymes Frasier Fir scent. I buy the lotion as well, but the candle is the original. I go through at least one every Christmas season.  It has the best scent!</li>
            <li> wonderful winter scent, long lasting and not over powering</li>
            <li> Smells just like a real tree.  Very fragrant but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these candles! The scent is light and fresh. love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I buy this candle only once a year at Christmas time because it is worth it.  This candle makes the entire house smell like Christmas.  I absolutely love it.  There is no better product out on the market. Period.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent!  This candle really has a long lasting scent wherever you have it burning.  Makes the room so cozy.</li>
            <li> While the outside box is accurate the candle inside was a plain glass container with an unattractive dark green color.  I purchased to give as a gift.  It was so ugly that I would not even use myself.  Awful</li>
            <li> These candles are wonderful.  They are the closest thing to the actual smell of Frasier Fir I&#x27;ve ever had.  No other candle can compare to actual pine trees.</li>
            <li> EVERY FIVE STAR REVIEW CLEARLY STATES HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS SCENT.  THIS IS THE ONLY CANDLE I BURN IN THE WINTER, AND I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING BUT THE FRASIER FIR.  I DON&#x27;T REALLY CARE WHAT IT COSTS ANY MORE  BECAUSE  IT IS SO  INTOXICATING ONCE IT BEGINS TO MOVE ABOUT FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER.  EVERYONE WHO COMES IN SAYS THE SAME THING....WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD IN HERE; I LOVE THAT SCENT.  IF I HEAR THAT THE COMPANY IS ABOUT TO FOLD, I&#x27;LL BE THE FIRST IN LINE TO FILL UP MY CAR, AND THAT&#x27;S THE TRUTH....</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law loved the smell of the scented oil we had over Christmas.  So we bought this for her.  She likes the fresh, clean pine scent!</li>
            <li> Perfect smell of a Christmas tree, especially if you do not have room for a tree in your own home.</li>
            <li> If you want a candle that smells like a Christmas tree, this is the one you want.  It has a strong, authentic scent.  I have bought it several times, both for myself and as gifts.  I&#x27;ve tried many fir/pine/evergreen candles and none compare to this one.</li>
            <li> No better line of candles, soaps, potpourri, oils and scents!  My sister-in-law bought me my first Thymes candle about 3 years ago and I&#x27;m hooked on the whole line.  People always comment on how wonderful my house smells (even when I&#x27;m not baking/cooking!)  My husband&#x27;s favorite is the Frasier Fir hand soaps.  I keep them out all winter.</li>
            <li> The Frasier Fir scent of the Thymes candles is the most authentic ever. Most evergreen scented candles smell like bathroom air freshener. The Thymes Frasier Fir candle makes your house smell like a fresh evergreen forest. Especially during the Christmas season, it is the best ever and yearly tradition!</li>
            <li> I keep this by the bed, and it gives me a pleasant smell while I&#x27;m going to sleep. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best scented fir/balsam candle out there, but a bit pricey for the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have to say about that.</li>
            <li> The Candle has a nice look and a nice scent but the bang for your buck is not worth it at all. The Wax is a fast melting wax so the candle finishes quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this candle for Christmas. I  have already ordered another one and it&#x27;s only February 19. It is strong and makes the entire house smell wonderful. This will be a staple for a long time.</li>
            <li> The picture here is not the candle I received. The one I received is green. I would have preferred the while one pictured.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look like this, didn&#x27;t smell like much, and didn&#x27;t last long at all.  Waste, waste, waste of money.  Pass on this one.</li>
            <li> great smell this is a one of a kind product really hae to say it wish they were more accessable everywhere</li>
            <li> While this may be an expensive candle, it is totally worth it if you want a candle that smells like a TRUE Christmas Tree. I burn this constantly through Christmas season and it&#x27;s always on my Christmas list.</li>
            <li> The scent is absolutely perfect for the holiday season. Bought this as a thank you present but I loved it so much, I got myself two to take home. I love, love, love the way it makes our home smell. Will rebuy for sure!</li>
            <li> My friend called the smell more &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; than the Frasier Fir soap which I actually have to agree with. But to me, it&#x27;s a good thing. I like my candle to smell a little sweeter. I leave in the closed bedroom for the day and when I get home the room smells wonderful. Otherwise it&#x27;s not an overwhelming or intrusive smell at all. I keep it in its box (with the top open) and take out only when I want to light it. That&#x27;s the best part of it. It will last me forever because I enjoy the smell without even having to light it.</li>
            <li> We were given this candle at Christmas (6.5 oz) and we burned it periodically throughout the holidays.  It is super-aromatic, filling the room with that fresh, Douglas Pine scent some of us grew up with in the days before \\&quot;fake trees\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This long-lasting candle smells like the most fragrant frasier fir.  It&#x27;s the perfect balance between pine and roses.  I have never had such a strong opinion about a mere candle, and it seems quite silly actually.  This candle is just that awesome.  Will be ordering year after year.</li>
            <li> I love pine scented anything and this fills the bill.  Burns clean and smells awesome....the only thing was a little on the expensive side but worth the splurge!  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this candle---or this brand!  The scent is amazing and ads to the Christmas feeling. Love it!</li>
            <li> this candle does smell wonderful....like a very green tree such as a pine tree...very nice scent..</li>
            <li> The candle provides little to no scent. The box smells wonderful, but when burning the candle itself, I can barely smell any pine scent, even after burning for two hours. My significant other cannot smell the scent at all. We have used this candle previously, purchased elsewhere, and that candle provided a strong scent that filled the house. This time around, we did not get the same experience from this candle.</li>
            <li> Not a sweet syrupy smell but a very natural pine scent. These candles are expensive but are long lasting and fragrant to the end.</li>
            <li> I love these candles. They smell wonderful. I buy them in bulk every year.Everyone appreciates them.A great gift. Try them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that the candle and the glass that holds it  are dark green and not the white shown.  It smells the same but it is NOT what I intended to buy.</li>
            <li> Pricing is too high. Should not be more than $16.00. I would recommend Bath and Body Works Balsam with 3 wicks for $20.00. Smells just the same.  Much better value!</li>
            <li> This one is a staple in our house.  These candles last for a long time, burn very well, and have a wonderful fragrance.  At first look, the price seems high, but they&#x27;re well-priced fro their high quality. Definitely more economical than buying cheap candles that burn too quickly. Great as a gift too.</li>
            <li> Lovely natural scent.  Great graphic on the glass.  Got two; will buy more.  I like how the wax in the glass be comes translucent with the top 1/2 inch of the wax, after it&#x27;s been burning for a while.  I&#x27;m going to save these for the next winter holidays by sealing with heavy plastic wrap, not that it arrived with this as a needed handling.  Will be buying more, with whatever glass design, but I&#x27;m hoping that Thymes will stick with these and dump the green glass that they offer with this scented wax candle.  Enjoy it!</li>
            <li> Love these candles. The only candle I&#x27;ve ever come across that smells like real pine. When we have it burning, nobody can believe our Christmas tree is faux. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is one of my three favorite candles in the world. I&#x27;ve never gotten a better smell for fir scent. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m up in the  sierras in the winter with the snow (truth is i&amp;#34;m on the couch doing nothing). All of the Thymes products are great that I&#x27;ve used. I discovered this at a fancy hotel and now buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> Christmas tree is easily in my top 5 favorite smells, and the Thymes Frasier Fir line provides that scent perfectly. I light this candle in the evenings and in about 5 minutes my whole house smells like a Frasier Fir. This seems like a fairly long lasting candle compared to most, so I can take this scent well past the holiday and through the winter. If i could complain, it&#x27;d probably be about the price, but it&#x27;s easily worth it to get that great rich amazing smell in the house without purchasing a $50 plus tree that will die in a month and drop needles all over your carpet!</li>
            <li> These candles smell so good.  They really smell like a fir tree.  I love them so much that I use them year round though not as often as I do during the holidays.</li>
            <li> it came in just a green glass, wax is also green. package was slightly damaged, very dissapointed. it is not the elegant gift i wanted to give...</li>
            <li> Not one company in the world, other than Trapps, can beat these candles.  They are expensive, but worth every penny for a candle lover</li>
            <li> These candles smell more like a Fir tree than some Fir trees! They permeate the house with a soft scent of winter without being overpowering. For the past 3 years they have gone up in price about $5 each Holiday season. The fact that people are still willing to pay for them speaks to their quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of scented candles in general, but I make an exception for Thymes Frasier Fir.  I buy these every year and have come to associate the scent with Christmas cheer.</li>
            <li> Trust my your house will smell like you just cut a pine tree and put it in your living room. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Beautiful holder and great fresh smell.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of fir trees, this candle is for you. Smells like your In a Colorado forrest every time you light it</li>
            <li> Best Christmas candle for the price! I would highly recommend this product. Smells like a fresh christmas tree. En joy.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. Not to fake or over powering. Only downside is the price. Pretty pricey compared to the other pine candles for 10 bucks. But to me this is worth it.</li>
            <li> Everyone comments on how much they love the smell of this candle.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this candle. the scent is amazing and reminds me of Christmas. it makes a lovely gift and is packaged beautifully in a festive box and nice green colored glass.</li>
            <li> I love this scent from Thymes.  The smell is a little overpowering in this size.  I had bought it previously in the votive size but I still love it.</li>
            <li> This candle is as advertised...it smell like a Fir tree...awesome.  I love that it gives my home a winter smell even after Christmas.</li>
            <li> This candle smells amazing! The price is very steep though. If you&#x27;re really looking for a strong X-mas tree scent though, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just love the scent that this candle gives off.  Definitely one of the best fir tree fragrances out there and does not smell artificial at all.</li>
            <li> OK at best.  way overpriced</li>
            <li> Smells just like Christmas!  I have asthma and cannot tolerate most candle scents.  Smelled this in a small gift store and has amazed by the natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seldom that you find a candle that actually burns a scent that permeates the room.....all scented candles I have purchased in the past do not have any type of fragrance when lit unless you are standing within a foot of it !  This candle is very aromatic and the glass is comes in is very decorate and a delightful addition to any room.  Candle is pricey but you get what you pay for and this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have gone through three of these candle this season already.  I don&#x27;t think this is THAT expensive for the product as some of the other reviewers have thought.  I have discovered over the years you do get what you pay for. Very realy piny scent that fills the room.  I really like this candle and would it again.</li>
            <li> I bought an artificial tree this year but really missed the \\&quot;real tree\\&quot; smell around the house. This candle totally does the trick. I&#x27;ve only burned it once or twice and already the fir tree scent fills my home. It&#x27;s just what I needed. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this candle. It is a bit expensive, but since I only buy it around the holidays, it is worth it. Adds the perfect touch to our fake Christmas tree!</li>
            <li> I was given one of these candles as a hostess gift - which is a great idea- and just fell in love with the scent!  I don&#x27;t burn these candles, I have them in my bathroom and bedroom where I can smell them and it&#x27;s really invigorating.  This is a true fir scent, and it&#x27;s not flowery or perfumed smelling, just smells like a walk in a forest!</li>
            <li> It is the best.  Have used it for years and will continue to do so. I hate to recommend it because it may become hard to get.</li>
            <li> We caved and purchased a faux christmas tree this year, and this candle made it seem like we had a real tree in our living room.  It has a beautiful scent, just like a christmas tree lot!  I purchased several of these and gave them as gifts to friends and family as well.  It&#x27;s a great gift to give before or doing the holiday season.  I&#x27;m tempted to keep using it because I love the smell, but I&#x27;ve packed it away to use again next year.</li>
            <li> I love the Frasier Fir scent, and I have purchased this item in the past.  I prefer the old packaging better</li>
            <li> This is pretty expensive for the size of candle but it absolutely has the best fragrence ever!  We buy one every year.</li>
            <li> This candle did not look at all like what was on the Amazon site.  It was in a plain dark green glass container, no stenciling and the wax was also dark green.  How dare Amazon do this!!  Very disappointed in Amazon because this was fulfilled by them!  I have bought this before and it looked exactly like the current picture.</li>
            <li> Smells like you have a Christmas tree in your home....even when you don&#x27;t!!  A must have if you love pine!!</li>
            <li> Since we have an artificial tree I wanted something to fill my house with the scent of pine.  This did the trick.  Great smell.  A little more than I wanted to spend but it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This candle is long lasting and strong smelling.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s the simplest things about Christmas that are the bast, like Christmas carols and the smell of a fresh cut tree. Since I don&#x27;t like to see the tree dead and sagging before Christmas, I usually put off getting our tree till mid December, and this candle will fill the gap nicely in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a great, rich, complex beautiful smell - worth every penny. I can&#x27;t stop picking it up and sniffing it - hope I don&#x27;t light my eyebrows on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001LF4DYW Thymes Poured Candle, Frasier Fir, 6.5-Ounce Jar]]</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister in-law for Christmas. I didn&#x27;t hear anything negative from my brother so she must have liked it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have ordered the product for my home any day.</li>
            <li> these burn clean and smell great even when not burning and look nice too. got one for my Mom and she said they smelled like camping. LOL</li>
            <li> This candle has the best Christmas tree smell - ever!</li>
            <li> This is the best pine candle I have ever smelled! The candle is a little expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other fir smelling candles because the reviews for this one are so good.  Its expensive, but when you get the package and open it up and it just reeks of christmas tree and a big smile will cross your face.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift and was surprised to already smell it before I even opened the box, the amazon cardboard one it came in that is.  This is the strongest smelling candle for its size I know.  The smell is a very sweet and smells just like the sap that comes out of a real fir tree after trimming branches, but extremely strong.&lt;br /&gt;It lasted about as long as burning it as any other cheap candle that size&lt;br /&gt;For me it came in the same green tinted glass container as advertised, which I guess it didn&#x27;t for some people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it gets only 3 for the value, over 20$ for a little 1 wick candle? Yes its the best and strongest candle I know of, but not by much.  You&#x27;re better off buying a few of the cheaper 4-5$ bigger candles with the lid at walmart. It was good to try once, but I won&#x27;t buy one again.</li>
            <li> The best candle Thymes candle made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement to a &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; candle I used to buy since that company has gone out of business. It&#x27;s taken me three years, but this is the closest I&#x27;ve ever come. Great scent of pine. A little expensive, but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> If you long for the smell of Christmas when it is not Christmas this is the candle for you. It has a wonderful fragrance that permeates my house to make it smell like I have an evergreen Christmas tree inside. One of my all-time favorites!</li>
            <li> I adore this candle. It smells just like you would think it would. It is the essence of a Christmas tree without smelling like a pine cleaning product. I have probably bought 8 of these over the years and I love them. I find them very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great and lovely product.</li>
            <li> This candle is ok. I got it after reading all the Amazon reviews that said it smells just like a Christmas tree. While it certainly smells reminiscent of pine, it is also very sweet smelling, which makes the whole aroma a little nauseating for me. If you&#x27;re looking for something that smells exactly like a pine tree, this is not it. If you&#x27;re ok with a sweet pine scent, you may like this product. Overall, this was not for me and I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Burning these candles brings out the fresh scent of a real pine tree in your home. Not like that pine cleaner but more of a pine forest. A very complimentary winter scent to your home.</li>
