            <li>On top of that, as I said before, I&#x27;m on pills for my acne, as well as doctor prescribed Aczone for my mornings and Epiduo in the evenings.  </li>
            <li>The pills, Aczone, Epiduo, and Cerave products mostly just combat my acne.</li>

            <li>I love the way my skin feels after use.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product!!!</li>

            <li>However, I&#x27;m not 100% sure that my great results are all due to this one product.  </li>
            <li>It does not rinse cleanly off; I felt like I had to wash my face afterwards.</li>
            <li>This scrub makes my face feel and look moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a local drug store and loved the product - the smell, texture, and softening results on my face.</li>
            <li>My moisturizer absorbs better and my make-up application is so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I use this with the smoothing daily cleanser and my skin has been looking and feeling better and more balanced.</li>
            <li>struggle with acne prone, extremely sensitive, easily scarring skin.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this stuff, I began breaking out.  </li>
            <li>is that it smells kinda funny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been consistently using a Cerave cleanser in the mornings and a Cerave moisturizer as needed.  </li>
            <li>This might be good for someone with very dry and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t seem very strong as an exfoliant, compared to other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I assume it&#x27;s because I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle exfoliator.</li>
            <li>so it gets the job done while staying gentle.</li>
            <li>I love all the other</li>
            <li>Aside from that, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Really like this face wash - it is scrubby but not harsh.</li>
            <li>so I was hesitant to try something new, but this did not make me break out at all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I got it because I&#x27;m trying to boost my skin care routine and start fighting wrinkles early.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients</li>
            <li>It makes my face soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>After, my skin was so soft and even very soft the next day.</li>
            <li>It gently cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li>and I can understand the contents without being a physicist major.  </li>
            <li>I woke up one morning, and next thing I knew, CLEAR FACE.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> They are crap in natural looking labels. Deceptive marketing. Check out the ingredients in all the labels, the ingredients are all the same!!</li>
            <li> I love all the other Yes To products.  This one just wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  It left a strange feeling film on my skin.  Will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I got it because I&#x27;m trying to boost my skin care routine and start fighting wrinkles early.  Even if this stuff doesn&#x27;t end up helping me prevent wrinkles, I&#x27;m happy I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I struggle with acne prone, extremely sensitive, easily scarring skin.  I&#x27;m on antibiotics for my acne and although I haven&#x27;t had a ton of break outs as of late, I&#x27;ve still been dealing with the leftover scars.  When I first started using this stuff, I began breaking out.  I assume it&#x27;s because I have super sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never really used an exfoliant before (GASP - I know...)  After about a week, my skin got used to it.  I also noticed after about 7-10 days, my acne scars had faded.  I woke up one morning, and next thing I knew, CLEAR FACE.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if I look closely, I can still see a scar here or there, and some of the deeper ones are definitely still noticeable, but it&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve been able to see myself with no make up and still consider my skin as looking to be on the clear/healthy side of things.  If this stuff continues to fade my scars, I might just have to ditch my heavy foundations and powders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have about this product is that it smells kinda funny.  Aside from that, I highly recommend it.  However, I&#x27;m not 100% sure that my great results are all due to this one product.  Read below for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very same time I began using this exfoliant, I also began using a vegan alternate to petroleum jelly on my under eyes as a night cream, and a vitamin c hyaluronic serum and a daily moisturizer with sunscreen in it for the day.  On top of that, as I said before, I&#x27;m on pills for my acne, as well as doctor prescribed Aczone for my mornings and Epiduo in the evenings.  I&#x27;ve also been consistently using a Cerave cleanser in the mornings and a Cerave moisturizer as needed.  I didn&#x27;t start seeing results with my acne scarring until after using the exfoliant and hyaluronic serum.  The pills, Aczone, Epiduo, and Cerave products mostly just combat my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and never had any issues with it.  I like the fact it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients and I can understand the contents without being a physicist major.  Plus the company has a sense of humor (read the labels) and they do good things.  How could you not go wrong?</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local drug store and loved the product - the smell, texture, and softening results on my face. However the only downside to this item is the small tube size.</li>
            <li> My skin started breaking out a lot recently (hormonal shifts I guess)  I had been using st. ives green tea scrub for the past several years and really liked it, but lately it&#x27;s been feeling a little too harsh.  I use this with the smoothing daily cleanser and my skin has been looking and feeling better and more balanced.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. It gently cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. I highly recommended this great product!!</li>
            <li> This feels so amazing while using. After, my skin was so soft and even very soft the next day. I have very sensitive skin so I was hesitant to try something new, but this did not make me break out at all. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Really like this face wash - it is scrubby but not harsh.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product! Leaves my skin feeling softer and younger.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I use (and love!) other Yes To Blueberry (and Yes To Grapefruit) products regularly. This was a bit disappointing. It does not rinse cleanly off; I felt like I had to wash my face afterwards. And it didn&#x27;t seem very strong as an exfoliant, compared to other products I&#x27;ve used. This might be good for someone with very dry and/or sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll use this tube, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s a gentle exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I always say Yes to Blueberries ever since I tried this line of products.  My skin does not feel dried out afterward, and my skin has remained very clear.  I am a believer!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after use. Using twice a week does the trick. My moisturizer absorbs better and my make-up application is so much smoother.</li>
            <li> Slightly harsh and way too greasy for my skin. It makes me break out.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin free from blackheads. Terrific.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product!!! I use it once a week to exfoliate my face and wonders occur. It makes my face soft. Other products at very harsh. This one has the right amount to keep my skin great. Something I&#x27;ll be keeping in my regimen.</li>
            <li> Great product! I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores and was curious how it would be. I love it! It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This face wash is perfect. It have very fine exfoliant so it gets the job done while staying gentle. It leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> This scrub makes my face feel and look moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money. It irritated my skin, left it feeling weird and made me break out. It also gave me milia. Go ahead and google it! It sucks! I&#x27;m staying away from the Yes to ______ line of products from now on.</li>
