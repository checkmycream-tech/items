            <li>I came upon this co-wash theory and heard alot of good things about it, so with all my curiosity i googled good brands with a cowash for biracial hair.</li>

            <li>I have to use a lot of this to get to my scalp effectively.</li>
            <li>and i saw  many good reviews</li>
            <li>Sometimes I catch a good buy 1 get 1 free sale at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Best Co-wash for African Americans.</li>
            <li>Love it better than Carols daughters</li>
            <li>Love the results.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need cleansers to keep my curls popping and formed more of the O-shape (or spiral shaped).</li>
            <li>but it causes my hair to be more S-shaped (or wavy)</li>
            <li>However, I was using a lot of the product, and I like it best as a deep conditioner treatment.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most products in the SheaMoisture brand cost $8-10 dollars.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I have BSL wavy fine hair)</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s more economical.</li>
            <li>I have thick and curly hair, and this is the perfect product at a better price than I could find in the stores.</li>
            <li>I originally used the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Conditioner as a rinse-out for my wash and goes.</li>
            <li>It worked well, my curls were bouncy, O-shaped, and clean.</li>
            <li>It made my curly hair much softer, and I feel like my scalp is in better condition using this.</li>
            <li>This co-wash is absolute magic for my biracial son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair very clean and very soft!</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing, but not as much as the rinse-out, which is fine.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for better as far as I&#x27;m concerned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>First time trying.</li>
            <li>This specific product was in many youtube videos</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used both, Wen cleansing conditioner (Sweet Almond Mint) is hands down 100% better than Shea</li>
            <li>I think you really need to rinse hair well with very warm water, which I don&#x27;t like to do because it&#x27;s hard on your hair.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Light product, not a deep cleanser, but</li>
            <li>and i used too much.</li>
            <li>so would not leave fine hair greasy or flat.</li>
            <li>Now, I only use a full strength shampoo about every 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I believe this item is priced too highly.</li>
            <li>my curls came right back bouncy and shiny and just a tad bit frizzy but none the less worked magic on my hair.</li>
            <li>I used this after a week of my hair being straight ( i caved failing my natural hair journey...</li>
            <li>I usually am all into most of the the Shea Moisture products, but this wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all</li>
            <li>Smaller, skinny bottle for higher price, compared to others of their items.  </li>
            <li>The higher priced items are the Masque, or Deep Treatments, the unit size is around 12oz, and the retail cost is $12-15.00.</li>
            <li>When I statted using this for two weeks along with a sulfate free shampoo (I have natural and coarse hair), I started noticing softer hair, more curls, less pain when detangling, and less breakage.</li>
            <li>Use it on my daughters hair and leaves the curls with no frizz and so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with something more water-based and slippery over this thick sticky cream.</li>
            <li>Only a little bit of the product was needed to clean hair.</li>
            <li>starting my natural hair journey and a way to start</li>
            <li>You also have to use a lot to saturate your hair, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get more than 10 washes out of the bottle, so it&#x27;s pretty expensive for what you get!</li>
            <li>I tested this cleansing conditioner, the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus, and it left my hair super greasy (and smelled nasty like a cheap gas station deodorant, even after I washed it out with strong shampoo TWICE)</li>
            <li>I only use a small amount for my long hair -- just clean my scalp well, and then let it rinse through my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is super thick and doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets all over your hair</li>
            <li>Not great for fine hair and oily scalp.</li>

            <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t dry out hair though!</li>
            <li> I used this once, scrubbed like crazy and rinsed for super long, but my hair was still sticky with product even after completely drying.</li>
            <li> the other Shea Moisture products come in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> I am giving 3 stars (instead of 1) because it is clearly not for my hair type &amp; must work for others!</li>
            <li> I have curly and dry hair and was hoping this product would provide nourishment.  </li>
            <li> Both of our hair would be sooooo dry.</li>
            <li> Due to the winter weather, I switched to the African Black Soap Purification Masque for my wash and goes to maintain moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to give up on it, but I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> , my hair is long, white, slightly wavy (not curly), thin and dry.</li>
            <li> I will buy again if the price goes down.</li>
            <li> I used the baking soda and ACV no-poo method for 5 years, but just read some blogs saying thats been found to be too harsh.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to distribute through the hair and runs out in about five minutes.</li>
            <li> Girls with really thick curls might benefit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is ridiculous at $12.99 retail.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel really weird, sort of sticky.  </li>
            <li> That was very wrong.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should have tried again by rinsing even longer or doing an ACV rinse to get out the product, but I returned it immediately because it was so awful on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Leaves my hair felling oily.</li>
            <li> Best Co-wash for African Americans. Use it on my daughters hair and leaves the curls with no frizz and so soft. Love it better than Carols daughters Co-wash</li>
            <li> so great for curly hair!</li>
            <li> First time trying. I prefer to use their shampoo and conditioner. I have to use a lot of this to get to my scalp effectively.</li>
            <li> Sorry. I usually am all into most of the the Shea Moisture products, but this wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all and it was pricey. Smaller, skinny bottle for higher price, compared to others of their items.  Renpure&#x27;s co-wash beats this BY A MILE. Plus it&#x27;s more economical. Back to the drawing board with your co-wash, Shea Moisture.</li>
            <li> Not great for fine hair and oily scalp. Leaves my hair sort of sticky. I think you really need to rinse hair well with very warm water, which I don&#x27;t like to do because it&#x27;s hard on your hair. Definitely doesn&#x27;t dry out hair though! I&#x27;m not ready to give up on it, but I won&#x27;t order it again. You also have to use a lot to saturate your hair, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get more than 10 washes out of the bottle, so it&#x27;s pretty expensive for what you get!</li>
            <li> I have curly and dry hair and was hoping this product would provide nourishment.  I was disappointed.  It left my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair very clean and very soft! I used the baking soda and ACV no-poo method for 5 years, but just read some blogs saying thats been found to be too harsh. I don&#x27;t want to use shampoos, so I tried this. It made my curly hair much softer, and I feel like my scalp is in better condition using this. I only use a small amount for my long hair -- just clean my scalp well, and then let it rinse through my hair.</li>
            <li> Sheamoisture makes my hair shiny,an manageable. Love the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years on my hair (4cz) and my daughters (4a). I really like it. I use once a week on my daughters hair and every three days on mine. It keeps both our hair at a manageable moisture level. I see a big difference from when I was using a regular shampoo. Both of our hair would be sooooo dry. It was a big turning point when I began to use this. Now, I only use a full strength shampoo about every 4-6 weeks. Our hair loves it... Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product even though its pricey. Sometimes I catch a good buy 1 get 1 free sale at Walgreens. When I statted using this for two weeks along with a sulfate free shampoo (I have natural and coarse hair), I started noticing softer hair, more curls, less pain when detangling, and less breakage. A must have in my hair regime now. Smells great too. Leave it in for minutes and finger comb then rinse.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and by the way if it gets in your eyes - no issue cause it&#x27;s not soap. I even use on my face where it acts as a moisturizer (leave on for min and then wash off, just like for hair)</li>
            <li> Love it! Works as it says!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have thick and curly hair, and this is the perfect product at a better price than I could find in the stores. Can&#x27;t ask for better as far as I&#x27;m concerned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must try!</li>
            <li> Well im going to start from the beginning... im starting my natural hair journey and a way to start it is with research (a lot of research) and trying out the things that can work well with your hair. I came upon this co-wash theory and heard alot of good things about it, so with all my curiosity i googled good brands with a cowash for biracial hair. This specific product was in many youtube videos and i saw  many good reviews so i ordered it.I used this after a week of my hair being straight ( i caved failing my natural hair journey...oopps!) my curls came right back bouncy and shiny and just a tad bit frizzy but none the less worked magic on my hair. I do recomeend this product because it is absolutley amazing on my hair and my sisters as well (we both have a 3b curl texture and are mixed).</li>
            <li> Love love love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I have O and S shaped curls. I&#x27;m 4a with low porosity. I need cleansers to keep my curls popping and formed more of the O-shape (or spiral shaped). I only use SheaMoisture products. I originally used the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Conditioner as a rinse-out for my wash and goes. I like it but it causes my hair to be more S-shaped (or wavy) Due to the winter weather, I switched to the African Black Soap Purification Masque for my wash and goes to maintain moisture. It worked well, my curls were bouncy, O-shaped, and clean. Perfect 4a spirals. However, I was using a lot of the product, and I like it best as a deep conditioner treatment. I wanted to try this co-wash and I am glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: My curls instantly popped. Only a little bit of the product was needed to clean hair. It is moisturizing, but not as much as the rinse-out, which is fine. Light product, not a deep cleanser, but just enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 8oz. This was why I hesitated with buying, but...the amount of product I used means it would last the same amount of time as the rinse-out version. Also, a con is the price. The price is ridiculous at $12.99 retail. Most products in the SheaMoisture brand cost $8-10 dollars. The higher priced items are the Masque, or Deep Treatments, the unit size is around 12oz, and the retail cost is $12-15.00. Therefore, I believe this item is priced too highly. It should be the same amount as the conditioners, which is $8-10.99 and the conditioners are 12oz.</li>
            <li> I am giving 3 stars (instead of 1) because it is clearly not for my hair type &amp; must work for others! I was told that this would work on any hair type because it is an actual cleanser so would not leave fine hair greasy or flat. That was very wrong. I used this once, scrubbed like crazy and rinsed for super long, but my hair was still sticky with product even after completely drying. Maybe I should have tried again by rinsing even longer or doing an ACV rinse to get out the product, but I returned it immediately because it was so awful on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is super thick and doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets all over your hair so you feel like you need a lot. maybe that was another mistake and i used too much. I also think it&#x27;s way too pricey- the other Shea Moisture products come in larger bottles. I&#x27;ll stick with something more water-based and slippery over this thick sticky cream. Girls with really thick curls might benefit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I have BSL wavy fine hair)</li>
            <li> Too expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its a bit pricey, but it works. I will buy again if the price goes down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to distribute through the hair and runs out in about five minutes. But once you get it in your hair it&#x27;s pretty good and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This co-wash is absolute magic for my biracial son&#x27;s hair. We won&#x27;t use anything else - and we&#x27;ve tried LOTS of products! Plus, it smells WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> I tested this cleansing conditioner, the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus, and it left my hair super greasy (and smelled nasty like a cheap gas station deodorant, even after I washed it out with strong shampoo TWICE) and it did nothing for the quality of my hair. It made my hair feel really weird, sort of sticky.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, however, thoroughly recommend Wen products.  Now that I&#x27;ve used both, Wen cleansing conditioner (Sweet Almond Mint) is hands down 100% better than Shea Moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case it matters, my hair is long, white, slightly wavy (not curly), thin and dry.</li>
