            <li> Too small for adults, but decent for kids.</li>
            <li> They are also smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> They are not exactly one size fits all I would definitely only buy these for children because on a teenager they look a bit out of proportion.  </li>
            <li> Not high quality</li>
            <li> Underwhelmed with quality but expected it.  </li>
            <li> It was money well spent.</li>
            <li> so hope they at least last throughout our vacation.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t spread it out either, because the bow is glued down to the ears.</li>
            <li> Had to do a little glue repair but just as described.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they are the sturdiest</li>

            <li> Cute ears for a child. Not high quality but considering it was six dollars I can&#x27;t expect anything else. Will do for my trip to Disney soon though.</li>
            <li> Very cute the only thing is the bow is one sided and thin. Itss not stuffed like the ones you buy in Disney but for the price they are nice!</li>
            <li> Had to do a little glue repair but just as described. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice. 3 years old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> they were perfect. Well made</li>
            <li> Underwhelmed with quality but expected it.  They are under $5.  It was totally fine when we went to Disney World as I didn&#x27;t have to stress about my daughter dropping them or anything because of the cost.  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> It came on time but I thought it would be a lil bigger it don&#x27;t look right on a adult head... I put it on my baby cousin it&#x27;s too cute on her so I just gave it to her...but anyway she loved it</li>
            <li> Too small for adults, but decent for kids. Not sure if they are the sturdiest so hope they at least last throughout our vacation.</li>

            <li> High quality, great price.  Pre-Disney vacation purchase.</li>
            <li> Nothing special but as expected</li>
            <li> The ears are closer together than the picture shows. The bow is bunched up too. There isn&#x27;t much of a gap the like it shows in the picture. You can&#x27;t spread it out either, because the bow is glued down to the ears. They are also smaller than I expected. I will probably still use them, but wouldn&#x27;t have purchased if I had seen them in person before.</li>
            <li> It looked nothing like the picture the bows dots were big and the bow did not evan look  like the picture at all and it looked cheap</li>
