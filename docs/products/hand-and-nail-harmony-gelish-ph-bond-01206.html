            <li>mo14MZISWNQ48VC]]This Gelish pH bond is a good product.</li>

            <li>I wanted to start doing my own gel nails, and the price for all items combined was great.</li>
            <li>I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with these items.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>VERY PLEASED WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THIS PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>I also love that it eliminates bacteria that could grow while wearing the gel polish!</li>
            <li>WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    </li>
            <li>Love Gelish!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my moms UV light which was great</li>
            <li>so I can do my own nails at home and save some money.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  </li>
            <li>Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li>so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel for a while</li>
            <li>This Gelish Bond is perfect w/the whole Gelish application.</li>
            <li>Nice addition to my nail care products.  </li>
            <li>After applying this I soak my hands in some warm soapy water leaving the remover on for about 3-5 minutes n</li>
            <li>Saves me tons of money, and if it gets messed up I just fix it on my own time.</li>
            <li>And this one was a good price :-)</li>
            <li>love being able to do my nails my self on my own time!</li>
            <li>This product in particular is awesome, can&#x27;t do my nails without it.</li>
            <li>My first set of gel nails that I applied myself lasted three weeks and except for the nail growth, they were still looking good!  </li>
            <li>They were also almost always out of stock on the more popular colors.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this as it is a good price and a nice full size bottle (.5 oz).</li>
            <li>and it keep them nice and strong and prevents them from tearing&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Came wrapped up so great, came fast and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>Top It</li>
            <li>but I wish there were more.</li>
            <li>This product is great!I have used Shellac and in my opinion the Gelish is a better product.</li>
            <li>After opening the bottle and reading the ingredients, I would have been better to get the the over the counter acetone.  </li>
            <li>PH Bond dries out the nail to make the gellish foundation adhere better.</li>
            <li>I have had the polish on now for more than a week</li>
            <li>I like this one so much that I probably won&#x27;t try any others and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Doing her nails herself and buying at the better prices on Amazon she has saved a lot of money over going to the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you remove all cotton</li>
            <li>* Apply your favorite color of Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish or your favorite brand of UV</li>

            <li>TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control</li>
            <li>They are taking the top layer of keratin off.</li>
            <li>Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a must step and helps stay on better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s doing its&#x27;s job; now let&#x27;s see if the nail polish will work better.</li>
            <li>so the polish stick to it better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because I am getting better at doing them or because I am using this.</li>
            <li>most have from  </li>
            <li>start the nails most get</li>
            <li>After you use the pH bond, apply the top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Works better than another primer i&#x27;ved used.</li>
            <li>love the gelish product line</li>
            <li>A mandatory step, for the magical gel bond.  </li>
            <li>does not seem to make the gel bond any better at all.</li>
            <li>I am trying to get my nails stronger and getting the whole system works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed all of my gelish products, so of course I love this one as well.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer.</li>
            <li>PLEASE make sure you do not confuse this with BONDER. :-)</li>
            <li>I love doing this at home.</li>
            <li>If you are doing your own shellac manicures at home don&#x27;t forget this important step.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I really love that I found this product.</li>
            <li>&amp; you get more for your money.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>to be able to do my nails at home.</li>
            <li>This prep is much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Amazon for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Before my gel polish would peel but now that I brought this product it is safe to say I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>I still use it more than not.</li>
            <li>* Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails that just took about 1/5 of the time to cure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails that just took about 1/5 of the time to cure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>and I got it at a very good price, thanks very much</li>
            <li>Works very good, now my regular nail polish lasts 7 days without chipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try it myself with darker colors that I tend to apply heavier - those lift more than light colors for me.</li>
            <li>it works perfect as I expected.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use this product first, your gells with peel off - so buy it, it&#x27;s cheap and makes the gels stick!!</li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li>This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand.</li>
            <li>I can easily get 2 weeks use out of my manicure.</li>
            <li>easy to apply directions</li>
            <li>were easy to understandI</li>
            <li>that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is</li>
            <li>so we sat down and did some research and found out that Gelish makes the best products that we could find.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t using the PH Bond before and my nails were just fine.</li>
            <li>If you know what you are doing and have done this before this product would probably work fine for you.  </li>
            <li>However, when I put it on my nails it quickly dehydrated them and the foundation polish seemed to cure and stick better.</li>
            <li>The instructions for applying gel polish is you have to lightly buff the nail, use the cleanser</li>
            <li>wife got into gel nail polishes and using UV light to cure them and she asked me to help her</li>
            <li>* Place your hand into the USpicy UV LED lamp for 10 to 20 seconds for a light color or 20 to 30 seconds for a darker color.</li>
            <li>* Place your hand into the USpicy UV LED lamp for 10 to 20 seconds for a light color or 20 to 30 seconds for a darker color.</li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  </li>
            <li>Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  </li>
            <li>Curing Nail Dryer Light Timer[...]    </li>
            <li>[...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li>They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  </li>
            <li>The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It works great with all brands of gel polishes... help your Gel polishes last longer on your nails.</li>
            <li>This seems to work well with my UV light for my gel nail kit.</li>
            <li>Either way, it&#x27;s cheap and a part of my nail routine now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gelish products by Harmony for a few years now and this brand is the best of all Gel Products on the market!</li>
            <li>Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well...</li>
            <li>Works great with OPI bases and Red Carpet colors</li>
            <li>All you need to get online is a curing lamp and the nail polishes, everything else you can get cheaply at a nearby store.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li>I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li>the product was large size than had expected for the price, very happy I got the product on line instead of the store</li>
            <li>I do recommend still using the cleanser and the ph bond if you have super smooth nails</li>
            <li>A couple people have super smooth nails and they didn&#x27;t want them buffed</li>
            <li>* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li>Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li>Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li>this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li>Save yourself time and money and go buy rubbing alcohol to clean off and dehydrate your nails.</li>
            <li>Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not anything special.</li>
            <li>now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.</li>
            <li>This was worth buying the first time, though as I learn more, I may just refill the bottle with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Full size product.</li>
            <li>This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li>This is true for all gelish polishes.</li>
            <li>May be true, but I see the Salons use this as a step, so I follow suit.</li>
            <li>This is a great value.. full size product for less than the mini size available at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>I find this product to work just great, however I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try any other bonding agents.</li>
            <li>It had nicer colors than the other brands I looked at, and what is really great about the brand is tht all of the instructions at on their website, and the curing times are on the bottles too.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has a better selection of colors, larger bottles and better prices.</li>
            <li>My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li>I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li>I had to soak the gel polish a bit longer, after, to remove it, but if your nail beds are super shiny</li>
            <li>and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li>First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li>I now buy them exclusively and find them to be easy to use and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>remover\\&quot; by far the best hands down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced this dehydrates my nails any better than rubbing alcohol to prep for coats of gel, but it is easy to apply and it dries instantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little dehydrator.</li>
            <li>I find I get better adherence to the natural nail if I do that.</li>
            <li>It is worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s honestly the only polish I use on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Good value for money spent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alot of work, but SOO worth it.</li>
            <li>You also use rubbing alcohol on a lint free wipe to take off the tacky layer left over by harmony gelish &#x27;top it off.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Still worth it to have the bottle and brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same as alcohol, as soon as it touches your nail you can see the action - it dehydrates the nail way better!!  </li>
            <li>This is the exact same product used at my salon and a much better price!</li>
            <li>Came super fast!</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast and just what I needed!</li>
            <li>that if you are going to do something, do it right.  </li>
            <li>Which is why we use gel polish to begin with right?  </li>
            <li>thought I did everything correctly and my polish still peeled right off.  </li>
            <li>It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will save money in the long run if you are doing your own nails at home.</li>
            <li>Regular nail polish rarely lasted more than 2-3 days before it started peeling.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, what good does it do to have a beautiful nail polish job on your hands and have if peel off in a few days after all of the hard work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the first step that you put onto your nail to prepare them for the applications of the foundation and polishes.  </li>
            <li>You should not only apply this to your nail top but also to the nail tip.  </li>
            <li>When applying, wipe most of the product off from the brush applicator back into the bottle neck.  </li>
            <li>I have read somewhere that it applies a thousand or more applications if properly used.  </li>
            <li>Now I am able to give myself a lasting manicure at home instead of paying $30 plus tip every two weeks.</li>
            <li>it will last better.  </li>
            <li>Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li>then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li>This is the first step after cleaning and &amp;#34;roughing up&amp;#34; your nails when using Gelish UV gel polish.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is very similar to rubbing alcohol, but it is more concentrated</li>
            <li>came off the first day</li>
            <li>This is the thing that holds my whole day together!</li>
            <li>Works exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>Makes gel polish bond better and last longer.</li>
            <li>This was another piece of the pie that I wasn&#x27;t aware of when I first started using Gelish products.  </li>
            <li>You can also use acetone to dehydrate, but obviously it might damage more.  </li>
            <li>Came as described, have no complaints, regular PH bond like any :)</li>
            <li>This bottle will last me for many applications.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself.</li>
            <li>Used this dehydrator with Gelish base, color, and top coat, and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the drying effects to last long, and it&#x27;s very cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and dries out your nails instantly to prep for your gel nails.  </li>
            <li>I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li>It does tend to dry out the nail surface a bit, but it does make the polish bond better when used with it.</li>
            <li>Big bottle, easy brush to apply product.</li>
            <li>This item was shipped with a large bottle of acetone.</li>
            <li>I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li>but it did help to adhere the polish to my nails longer and not chip or lift as fast as it was.</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (</li>
            <li>apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li>Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li>but I dont have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much to prevent bleeding of color into the nail, however.</li>
            <li>This really did work.  </li>
            <li>I suggest it highly!</li>
            <li>I really like using the pH</li>
            <li>It really helps with my nails.</li>
            <li>I think it does its job and is absolutely satisfactory.</li>
            <li>It is relatively inexpensive and extremely important for the process to work.</li>
            <li>IT DOES WHAT IT SUPPOSE TO DO, I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li>You absolutely need to use this if you&#x27;re going to do a gelish manicure.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to buff the nail without using a block buffer or the 100/180 file</li>
            <li>(not too much because they split, chip and peel all the time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper than Sally&#x27; s</li>
            <li>so your nail is ready for the foundation layer of your gel polish.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand of gel products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li>(still worth it, since regular nail polish will be lucky to last a full day).  </li>
            <li>I order this product on Thursday morning and received that&#x27;s Saturday..was very surprised on how fast I got it..used it for the first time today</li>
            <li>i love this product, works well with my other gel polishes as well as harmony.</li>
            <li>I bought all the harmony products so they would work better with each other.</li>
            <li>* Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li>Great product and little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to complete my Harmony Gelish No chip manicure.</li>
            <li>and I am usually a pretty busy gal</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to spend the extra money on this step instead of first using the foundation.</li>
            <li>My nails chip pretty early, but I am using a bunch of new products-so I dont know if it&#x27;s this</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend NOT skipping this step.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly recommend.    </li>
            <li>high recommend for gel polish</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li>I use my electric nail drill \\&quot;very gently\\&quot; to remove the shine on my natural nail</li>
            <li>so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.  </li>
            <li>I am a fanatic about my gel nail polish and saving some money by doing my own nails.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the Gelish brand polish without this and it did not last that long maybe one week at the most.</li>
            <li>This is a dehydrator to remove the excess moisture of your nails and dry them so that the coats that follow will adhere better to your nails and last longer.  </li>
            <li>with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  </li>
            <li>I think this dehydrates better than just plain alcohol or gelish cleanser.</li>
            <li>Soaks right into the nail, no buffing of the nail necessary to ensure adhesion of the gel nail.  </li>
            <li>New    </li>
            <li>Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li>Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been 2 weeks yet, but it seems that my nails are lasting longer, which is exactly the point.</li>
            <li>I just used cleanser and their polish peeled but if the nails is slightly buffed or dehydrated it works fine without buffing.</li>
            <li>and they pretty much last for forever</li>
            <li>Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get the sequence down so that it would work for me smoothly.  </li>
            <li>wipe each nail down with it, this helps smooth out the cured foundation n removes the moisture.</li>
            <li>Essentially, after taking off any old nail polish you may be wearing, use this as your first step when giving yourself a gel manicure.</li>
            <li>trick to gel polishes is very thin coats, keeping the foundation, color n top it off sealer...off your skin...if you do get any on the skin around your nails, take a paint brush n dip in alcohol and clean it off before curing it...</li>
            <li>I guess pure acetone does just the same to my nails, I&#x27;ve tried it w/ diff</li>
            <li>The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li>Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li>simply use alcohol swab to dehydrate the nail.&lt;br /&gt;Not absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>It protects your natural nail and creates a bond for the bottom coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised that the PH bond worked.</li>
            <li>Cover the prepped natural nail plate with PH Bond.</li>
            <li>Apply a dot to the natural nail plate with what remains within the brush applicator.  </li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li>flick off old polish from</li>
            <li>Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  </li>
            <li>I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li>Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li>Always helps any of my gel polishes last much longer than without it.</li>
            <li>As far as I know</li>
            <li>this works very well with Gelish &amp; Red Carpet Manicure kits.</li>
            <li>and my hands see a lot of action.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I still developed an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was putting rubbing alcohol on my nails before doing my gel nail polish foundation.</li>
            <li>I bought the entire gelish system but can&#x27;t get the polish to adhere for more than a few days.</li>
            <li>If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li>It secures my polish and base coat perfectly.</li>
            <li>Currently using this to see if some less than reputable uv gel base and top coat will adhere better.</li>
            <li>My nails are super thin and bendy, so I&#x27;d be lucky to get 4 days out of it</li>
            <li>I THINK that alcohol would work as well, but one dip into the bottle will do your whole hand so it will go a long way.</li>
            <li>Tried this not expecting miracles but to my surprise it does exactly what is expected.  </li>
            <li>This is a major bargain in my book.</li>
            <li>I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very hard to use without touching the skin around my nail...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t originally purchase this and my manicure only lasted a few days but</li>
            <li>Well, for those who have thick nails - yeah, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li>I had spent so much money on the lamp and polishes</li>

            <li>Shipping from this seller was fast as expected.</li>
            <li>It goes on fast and absolutely no drying time needed.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply in an extremely thin layer.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry nail bed</li>
            <li>I used the base coat, polish and top coat as instructed using the led light as instructed in between each step.  </li>
            <li>Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li>thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    </li>
            <li>Not sure if this product just doesn&#x27;t work right</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve read reviews how unnecessary this product is and alcohol works just as fine.  </li>
            <li>(Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to be a little gentle)  </li>

            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    </li>
            <li> Love Gelish!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my moms UV light which was great</li>
            <li> so I can do my own nails at home and save some money.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li> so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel for a while</li>
            <li> This Gelish Bond is perfect w/the whole Gelish application.</li>
            <li> Nice addition to my nail care products.  </li>
            <li> After applying this I soak my hands in some warm soapy water leaving the remover on for about 3-5 minutes n</li>
            <li> Saves me tons of money, and if it gets messed up I just fix it on my own time.</li>
            <li> And this one was a good price :-)</li>
            <li> love being able to do my nails my self on my own time!</li>
            <li> This product in particular is awesome, can&#x27;t do my nails without it.</li>
            <li> My first set of gel nails that I applied myself lasted three weeks and except for the nail growth, they were still looking good!  </li>
            <li> They were also almost always out of stock on the more popular colors.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this as it is a good price and a nice full size bottle (.5 oz).</li>
            <li> and it keep them nice and strong and prevents them from tearing&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Came wrapped up so great, came fast and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Top It</li>
            <li> but I wish there were more.</li>
            <li> This product is great!I have used Shellac and in my opinion the Gelish is a better product.</li>
            <li> After opening the bottle and reading the ingredients, I would have been better to get the the over the counter acetone.  </li>
            <li> PH Bond dries out the nail to make the gellish foundation adhere better.</li>
            <li> I have had the polish on now for more than a week</li>
            <li> I like this one so much that I probably won&#x27;t try any others and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Doing her nails herself and buying at the better prices on Amazon she has saved a lot of money over going to the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you remove all cotton</li>

            <li> Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li> Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>

            <li> They are taking the top layer of keratin off.</li>
            <li> Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a must step and helps stay on better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s doing its&#x27;s job; now let&#x27;s see if the nail polish will work better.</li>
            <li> so the polish stick to it better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because I am getting better at doing them or because I am using this.</li>
            <li> most have from  </li>
            <li> start the nails most get</li>
            <li> After you use the pH bond, apply the top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Works better than another primer i&#x27;ved used.</li>
            <li> love the gelish product line</li>
            <li> A mandatory step, for the magical gel bond.  </li>
            <li> does not seem to make the gel bond any better at all.</li>
            <li> I am trying to get my nails stronger and getting the whole system works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed all of my gelish products, so of course I love this one as well.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer.</li>
            <li> PLEASE make sure you do not confuse this with BONDER. :-)</li>
            <li> I love doing this at home.</li>
            <li> If you are doing your own shellac manicures at home don&#x27;t forget this important step.  </li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I really love that I found this product.</li>
            <li> &amp; you get more for your money.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> to be able to do my nails at home.</li>
            <li> This prep is much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Amazon for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Before my gel polish would peel but now that I brought this product it is safe to say I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.</li>
            <li> Just okay.</li>
            <li> I still use it more than not.</li>

            <li> * Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails that just took about 1/5 of the time to cure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> and I got it at a very good price, thanks very much</li>
            <li> Works very good, now my regular nail polish lasts 7 days without chipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it myself with darker colors that I tend to apply heavier - those lift more than light colors for me.</li>
            <li> it works perfect as I expected.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use this product first, your gells with peel off - so buy it, it&#x27;s cheap and makes the gels stick!!</li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li> This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand.</li>
            <li> I can easily get 2 weeks use out of my manicure.</li>
            <li> easy to apply directions</li>
            <li> were easy to understandI</li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is</li>
            <li> so we sat down and did some research and found out that Gelish makes the best products that we could find.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using the PH Bond before and my nails were just fine.</li>
            <li> If you know what you are doing and have done this before this product would probably work fine for you.  </li>
            <li> However, when I put it on my nails it quickly dehydrated them and the foundation polish seemed to cure and stick better.</li>
            <li> The instructions for applying gel polish is you have to lightly buff the nail, use the cleanser</li>
            <li> wife got into gel nail polishes and using UV light to cure them and she asked me to help her</li>
            <li> * Place your hand into the USpicy UV LED lamp for 10 to 20 seconds for a light color or 20 to 30 seconds for a darker color.</li>
            <li> * Place your hand into the USpicy UV LED lamp for 10 to 20 seconds for a light color or 20 to 30 seconds for a darker color.</li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  </li>
            <li> Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  </li>
            <li> Curing Nail Dryer Light Timer[...]    </li>
            <li> [...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li> They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  </li>
            <li> The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It works great with all brands of gel polishes... help your Gel polishes last longer on your nails.</li>
            <li> This seems to work well with my UV light for my gel nail kit.</li>
            <li> Either way, it&#x27;s cheap and a part of my nail routine now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gelish products by Harmony for a few years now and this brand is the best of all Gel Products on the market!</li>
            <li> Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well...</li>
            <li> Works great with OPI bases and Red Carpet colors</li>
            <li> All you need to get online is a curing lamp and the nail polishes, everything else you can get cheaply at a nearby store.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li> I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li> the product was large size than had expected for the price, very happy I got the product on line instead of the store</li>
            <li> I do recommend still using the cleanser and the ph bond if you have super smooth nails</li>
            <li> A couple people have super smooth nails and they didn&#x27;t want them buffed</li>
            <li> * Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> * Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li> Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li> Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li> this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li> Save yourself time and money and go buy rubbing alcohol to clean off and dehydrate your nails.</li>
            <li> Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not anything special.</li>
            <li> now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.</li>
            <li> This was worth buying the first time, though as I learn more, I may just refill the bottle with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Full size product.</li>
            <li> This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li> This is true for all gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> May be true, but I see the Salons use this as a step, so I follow suit.</li>
            <li> This is a great value.. full size product for less than the mini size available at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> I find this product to work just great, however I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try any other bonding agents.</li>
            <li> It had nicer colors than the other brands I looked at, and what is really great about the brand is tht all of the instructions at on their website, and the curing times are on the bottles too.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has a better selection of colors, larger bottles and better prices.</li>
            <li> My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li> I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li> I had to soak the gel polish a bit longer, after, to remove it, but if your nail beds are super shiny</li>
            <li> and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li> First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li> I now buy them exclusively and find them to be easy to use and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> remover\\&quot; by far the best hands down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this dehydrates my nails any better than rubbing alcohol to prep for coats of gel, but it is easy to apply and it dries instantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little dehydrator.</li>
            <li> I find I get better adherence to the natural nail if I do that.</li>
            <li> It is worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s honestly the only polish I use on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Good value for money spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alot of work, but SOO worth it.</li>
            <li> You also use rubbing alcohol on a lint free wipe to take off the tacky layer left over by harmony gelish &#x27;top it off.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Still worth it to have the bottle and brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as alcohol, as soon as it touches your nail you can see the action - it dehydrates the nail way better!!  </li>
            <li> This is the exact same product used at my salon and a much better price!</li>
            <li> Came super fast!</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and just what I needed!</li>
            <li> that if you are going to do something, do it right.  </li>
            <li> Which is why we use gel polish to begin with right?  </li>
            <li> thought I did everything correctly and my polish still peeled right off.  </li>
            <li> It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will save money in the long run if you are doing your own nails at home.</li>
            <li> Regular nail polish rarely lasted more than 2-3 days before it started peeling.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, what good does it do to have a beautiful nail polish job on your hands and have if peel off in a few days after all of the hard work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the first step that you put onto your nail to prepare them for the applications of the foundation and polishes.  </li>
            <li> You should not only apply this to your nail top but also to the nail tip.  </li>
            <li> When applying, wipe most of the product off from the brush applicator back into the bottle neck.  </li>
            <li> I have read somewhere that it applies a thousand or more applications if properly used.  </li>
            <li> Now I am able to give myself a lasting manicure at home instead of paying $30 plus tip every two weeks.</li>
            <li> it will last better.  </li>
            <li> Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li> then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li> This is the first step after cleaning and &amp;#34;roughing up&amp;#34; your nails when using Gelish UV gel polish.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is very similar to rubbing alcohol, but it is more concentrated</li>
            <li> came off the first day</li>
            <li> This is the thing that holds my whole day together!</li>
            <li> Works exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> Makes gel polish bond better and last longer.</li>
            <li> This was another piece of the pie that I wasn&#x27;t aware of when I first started using Gelish products.  </li>
            <li> You can also use acetone to dehydrate, but obviously it might damage more.  </li>
            <li> Came as described, have no complaints, regular PH bond like any :)</li>
            <li> This bottle will last me for many applications.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself.</li>
            <li> Used this dehydrator with Gelish base, color, and top coat, and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the drying effects to last long, and it&#x27;s very cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and dries out your nails instantly to prep for your gel nails.  </li>
            <li> I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li> It does tend to dry out the nail surface a bit, but it does make the polish bond better when used with it.</li>
            <li> Big bottle, easy brush to apply product.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped with a large bottle of acetone.</li>
            <li> I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li> but it did help to adhere the polish to my nails longer and not chip or lift as fast as it was.</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (</li>
            <li> apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li> I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li> Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li> but I dont have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much to prevent bleeding of color into the nail, however.</li>
            <li> This really did work.  </li>
            <li> I suggest it highly!</li>
            <li> I really like using the pH</li>
            <li> It really helps with my nails.</li>
            <li> I think it does its job and is absolutely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> It is relatively inexpensive and extremely important for the process to work.</li>
            <li> IT DOES WHAT IT SUPPOSE TO DO, I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> You absolutely need to use this if you&#x27;re going to do a gelish manicure.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to buff the nail without using a block buffer or the 100/180 file</li>
            <li> (not too much because they split, chip and peel all the time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper than Sally&#x27; s</li>
            <li> so your nail is ready for the foundation layer of your gel polish.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of gel products.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li> (still worth it, since regular nail polish will be lucky to last a full day).  </li>
            <li> I order this product on Thursday morning and received that&#x27;s Saturday..was very surprised on how fast I got it..used it for the first time today</li>
            <li> i love this product, works well with my other gel polishes as well as harmony.</li>
            <li> I bought all the harmony products so they would work better with each other.</li>
            <li> * Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li> Great product and little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to complete my Harmony Gelish No chip manicure.</li>
            <li> and I am usually a pretty busy gal</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to spend the extra money on this step instead of first using the foundation.</li>
            <li> My nails chip pretty early, but I am using a bunch of new products-so I dont know if it&#x27;s this</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend NOT skipping this step.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly recommend.    </li>
            <li> high recommend for gel polish</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li> I use my electric nail drill \\&quot;very gently\\&quot; to remove the shine on my natural nail</li>
            <li> so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I am a fanatic about my gel nail polish and saving some money by doing my own nails.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the Gelish brand polish without this and it did not last that long maybe one week at the most.</li>
            <li> This is a dehydrator to remove the excess moisture of your nails and dry them so that the coats that follow will adhere better to your nails and last longer.  </li>
            <li> with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  </li>
            <li> I think this dehydrates better than just plain alcohol or gelish cleanser.</li>
            <li> Soaks right into the nail, no buffing of the nail necessary to ensure adhesion of the gel nail.  </li>
            <li> New    </li>
            <li> Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li> Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been 2 weeks yet, but it seems that my nails are lasting longer, which is exactly the point.</li>
            <li> I just used cleanser and their polish peeled but if the nails is slightly buffed or dehydrated it works fine without buffing.</li>
            <li> and they pretty much last for forever</li>
            <li> Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get the sequence down so that it would work for me smoothly.  </li>
            <li> wipe each nail down with it, this helps smooth out the cured foundation n removes the moisture.</li>
            <li> Essentially, after taking off any old nail polish you may be wearing, use this as your first step when giving yourself a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> trick to gel polishes is very thin coats, keeping the foundation, color n top it off sealer...off your skin...if you do get any on the skin around your nails, take a paint brush n dip in alcohol and clean it off before curing it...</li>
            <li> I guess pure acetone does just the same to my nails, I&#x27;ve tried it w/ diff</li>
            <li> The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li> Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li> simply use alcohol swab to dehydrate the nail.&lt;br /&gt;Not absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> It protects your natural nail and creates a bond for the bottom coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised that the PH bond worked.</li>
            <li> Cover the prepped natural nail plate with PH Bond.</li>
            <li> Apply a dot to the natural nail plate with what remains within the brush applicator.  </li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li> flick off old polish from</li>
            <li> Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  </li>
            <li> I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li> Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li> Always helps any of my gel polishes last much longer than without it.</li>
            <li> As far as I know</li>
            <li> this works very well with Gelish &amp; Red Carpet Manicure kits.</li>
            <li> and my hands see a lot of action.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I still developed an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was putting rubbing alcohol on my nails before doing my gel nail polish foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought the entire gelish system but can&#x27;t get the polish to adhere for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li> It secures my polish and base coat perfectly.</li>
            <li> Currently using this to see if some less than reputable uv gel base and top coat will adhere better.</li>
            <li> My nails are super thin and bendy, so I&#x27;d be lucky to get 4 days out of it</li>
            <li> I THINK that alcohol would work as well, but one dip into the bottle will do your whole hand so it will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Tried this not expecting miracles but to my surprise it does exactly what is expected.  </li>
            <li> This is a major bargain in my book.</li>
            <li> I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very hard to use without touching the skin around my nail...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t originally purchase this and my manicure only lasted a few days but</li>
            <li> Well, for those who have thick nails - yeah, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li> I had spent so much money on the lamp and polishes</li>
            <li> *Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li> Shipping from this seller was fast as expected.</li>
            <li> It goes on fast and absolutely no drying time needed.</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply in an extremely thin layer.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry nail bed</li>
            <li> I used the base coat, polish and top coat as instructed using the led light as instructed in between each step.  </li>
            <li> Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li> thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    </li>
            <li> Not sure if this product just doesn&#x27;t work right</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve read reviews how unnecessary this product is and alcohol works just as fine.  </li>
            <li> (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to be a little gentle)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for a long time now and in the past few years bonding has been an issue along with nail damage due to filing.  </li>
            <li> I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application.</li>
            <li> After removal of the prior gel nail, I wash my hands, dry them with a paper towel, place both hands in the Epica UV dryer to absorb any last signs of moisture, then apply the Gelish Nail Prep.  </li>
            <li> so the bottle will last long.</li>
            <li> I foresee this lasting me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed.</li>
            <li> Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula</li>
            <li> I hate giving Gelish a negative review, because I LOVE the Harmony Gelish line of products!!!!  </li>
            <li> but I cure the second coat for 2 to 3 minutes depending on how dark it is, if u are gonna apply a 3rd coat only cure 2 mins</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding a decently priced Nail Prep that actually worked.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s essentially just alcohol (read the ingredients), but I think there are a couple different alcohol concentrations in here, because it works better than plain alcohol and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird shinny residue like some brands.</li>
            <li> If you are using straight alcohol as a replacement for the PH Bond nail prep and your gel is lifting after a few days it is because the Ethyl Acetate and Isobutyl Acetate are the key ingredients which assist the Gelish Foundation base in making a proper and secure bond to the natural nail plate.  </li>
            <li> At least it wasn&#x27;t much money</li>
            <li> I got the gelish polishes and it was not staying on as long as i would like, so i decided to buy this.</li>
            <li> It saves money, time and hassle in the long run.</li>
            <li> when I heard how long gel nails lasted ..</li>
            <li> I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed ..</li>
            <li> I was doing gel nails for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional and should just stick to going to the salon for the gel polish.</li>
            <li> I wiped with alcohol, then brushed on this Nail Prep pH bond being careful not to touch my nails with my fingers at all after this step.  </li>
            <li> She looked at the local beauty supply houses and found that the prices they charged for Gelish was high and that the bottles were very small.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit and it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I only changed the color due to the unsightly nail grow out.</li>
            <li> i recommend to gel users and will purchase again, the item lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> your polish just will not stay on that long, I speak from experience!</li>
            <li> * Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let dry before applying foundation gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> this is a DRY cleaning.  </li>
            <li> This product is needed in doing gel polish it helps dry out nail bed..</li>
            <li> It is knowing when to touch and to dry it</li>
            <li> I apply 91% alcohol, let air dry...</li>
            <li> Take a dry paint brush that u would use for applying nail polish or makeup not the ones for removing the dust n</li>
            <li> This brush made even this amateur try look professional.</li>
            <li> No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out.</li>
            <li> Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last forever.  </li>
            <li> the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)  </li>
            <li> (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.</li>
            <li> This only dehydrates my nail immediately after applying but the polish will chop off in 2 days or less .</li>
            <li> than I use EZ flow nail primer being careful not to get any on the skin as it does burn, let air dry...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need each product to complete the manicure, which will be instantly dry and hard when done.</li>

            <li> I bought it, because I bought the other stuff.</li>

            <li> With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  </li>
            <li> [...]  TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:  </li>
            <li> When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail.</li>
            <li> I have tried this with other products too and it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other one, so I believe it is doing the job.</li>
            <li> so I was very careful in applying the product.</li>
            <li> with the pad slightly off center.  </li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails</li>
            <li> On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip.</li>
            <li> I have only one complaint about this product...</li>
            <li> I use this, a base coat, 2 coats of color, and a top coat.  </li>
            <li> Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  </li>
            <li> Graham Hands Down</li>
            <li> Graham Hands Down</li>
            <li> I used this after I wipe my nails down with rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail.</li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  </li>
            <li> Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.    </li>
            <li> (less harmful to cuticles and surrounding skin than UV lamps)  </li>
            <li> it lasted a week and a half with the pH Bond.</li>
            <li> I would question if the overall manicure would last up to the expected two weeks by cutting corners like this.  </li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!    </li>
            <li> If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  </li>
            <li> it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping.</li>
            <li> The ph bond dehydrates the nail plate, you will need just a little of the liquid</li>
            <li> I roughed them up a little.</li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.  </li>
            <li> I was having issues with the Gelish polish peeling after a few days which had never happened when a salon did my nails.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer</li>
            <li> So annoyed to find out I paid eight dollars for a tiny bottle of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> then you dont know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> The pH Bond is used to clean &amp; dehydrate the nail before applying the foundation base coat.  </li>
            <li> Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips.</li>
            <li> Broken in the package and nothing inside dry as a bone</li>
            <li> The acetone leaked and this item was broken in 2 pieces and completely empty.</li>
            <li> small toenails</li>
            <li> I even do my families and friends nails for a small fee.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment and a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Using a scrubbing motion, spread the PH Bond up to but just short of the cuticle line and not onto any applied artificial nail tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:  </li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  </li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.</li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  </li>
            <li> Apply a very thin coat of the gel polish color you have picked out n cure for 1 minute, 2 minutes for dark colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  </li>
            <li> Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application.</li>
            <li> This dehydrates the nail to help ensure the base coat sticks properly.</li>
            <li> So frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s so&lt;br /&gt;old</li>
            <li> It did nothing to help prep for the gel polish, Sorry I BOUGHT IT</li>
            <li> but I was wrong with out</li>
            <li> (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS</li>
            <li> This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  </li>
            <li> In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails ..</li>
            <li> or if I purchased the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> While I have not done a gel manicure without this, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Apply a very THIN coat of gelish foundation, cure in LED lamp for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have very thin nails</li>
            <li> dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush.</li>
            <li> * Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 10 to 15 seconds under LED lamp.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> * Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 10 to 15 seconds under LED lamp.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  </li>
            <li> IMPOSSIBLE after the LED</li>
            <li> SO BADLY TO AMAZON</li>
            <li> It took 5 month before the painful blisters showed up under my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> then do you base coat etc.</li>
            <li> I even wiped my nails with alcohol before applying the base coat but that didn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li> so the gel base coat can adher to my nail.  </li>
            <li> Use this product after the Gelish Foundation (BASE) step has been completed  Directions:</li>
            <li> I use it twice on each nail before applying any coats of base.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s your worst enemy.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CND shellac and Gelish Harmony polishes for almost a year.  And I&#x27;ve read reviews how unnecessary this product is and alcohol works just as fine.  Well, for those who have thick nails - yeah, it works just fine. I&#x27;ve done my friends and family nails, and everyone&#x27;s manicure lasts 2-3 weeks.  My nails are super thin and bendy, so I&#x27;d be lucky to get 4 days out of it (still worth it, since regular nail polish will be lucky to last a full day).  So i decided to give this a try, and I&#x27;m glad i did!!! It&#x27;s not the same as alcohol, as soon as it touches your nail you can see the action - it dehydrates the nail way better!!  It hasn&#x27;t been 2 weeks yet, but it seems that my nails are lasting longer, which is exactly the point.</li>
            <li> Works very good, now my regular nail polish lasts 7 days without chipping</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any problem with Gelish polishes sticking properly without using this.&lt;br /&gt;I simply use alcohol swab to dehydrate the nail.&lt;br /&gt;Not absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 6 months later and I&#x27;m here to buy a bottle to help manicure last longer on friends nails.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it myself with darker colors that I tend to apply heavier - those lift more than light colors for me.</li>
            <li> Came wrapped up so great, came fast and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Broken in the package and nothing inside dry as a bone</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an artist who&#x27;s been painting her nails&lt;br /&gt;for quite some time, though. If this happens to&lt;br /&gt;be the case for someone buying the Gelish set,&lt;br /&gt;it takes a lot of practice to get used to this&lt;br /&gt;procedure, especially for a French.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to save money and do it myself. I bought the:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Foundation&lt;br /&gt;2. pH Bond&lt;br /&gt;3. Sleek White&lt;br /&gt;4. Top It Off&lt;br /&gt;5. Nourish - which smells AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my moms UV light which was great&lt;br /&gt;that I didn&#x27;t have to buy. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s so&lt;br /&gt;old that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br /&gt;There are just a cople French Gelish Manicure videos&lt;br /&gt;on YouTube but I wish there were more. I am having such&lt;br /&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself. I even&lt;br /&gt;recently bought self-adhesive reinforcement circles&lt;br /&gt;to help make the line more perfect. We&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Best to have if you have a nail salon. It won&#x27;t discolor your nails. I always get a nail gel and I only use Gelish and Cuccio brand.</li>
            <li> does exactly as advertised. couldn&#x27;t use gel polish without it.</li>
            <li> I am a gelish fan and that is all I wear. I also do traveling manicures and pedicures. The instructions for applying gel polish is you have to lightly buff the nail, use the cleanser then do you base coat etc. PH Bond is optional but I find my customers do not like to have their nails buffed because it can be damaging to the nail. I think this dehydrates better than just plain alcohol or gelish cleanser. I do recommend still using the cleanser and the ph bond if you have super smooth nails and you don&#x27;t want them buffed. A couple people have super smooth nails and they didn&#x27;t want them buffed so I just used cleanser and their polish peeled but if the nails is slightly buffed or dehydrated it works fine without buffing. PH bond is good to have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this dehydrates my nails any better than rubbing alcohol to prep for coats of gel, but it is easy to apply and it dries instantly.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to help prep for the gel polish, Sorry I BOUGHT IT</li>
            <li> I got the gelish polishes and it was not staying on as long as i would like, so i decided to buy this. It did not make a drastic difference but it did help to adhere the polish to my nails longer and not chip or lift as fast as it was.</li>
            <li> This product is great!I have used Shellac and in my opinion the Gelish is a better product. The Gelish works great for people with oilier nail beds.</li>
            <li> This is a must have if your looking into the gelish nail polishes. It protects your natural nail and creates a bond for the bottom coat. I would highly recommend NOT skipping this step. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Well, I got this item too from Harmony gelish nail products.  After opening the bottle and reading the ingredients, I would have been better to get the the over the counter acetone.  Again, I like the packaging and I will just buy the cheaper acetone and refill the bottle.</li>
            <li> I guess pure acetone does just the same to my nails, I&#x27;ve tried it w/ diff no chip brand names and still peels off at its entirety on day #2... bummer...</li>
            <li> Great packaging and speedy arrival. Full size product. Just as described. PH Bond dries out the nail to make the gellish foundation adhere better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gelish before but it was applied at salons. For Christmas, I bought myself a UV lamp and Gelish polishes so I can do my own nails at home and save some money. I was having issues with the Gelish polish peeling after a few days which had never happened when a salon did my nails. I even wiped my nails with alcohol before applying the base coat but that didn&#x27;t seem to help. After reading the various reviews, I decided to buy the PH bond. I had spent so much money on the lamp and polishes I figured why not. I&#x27;m really surprised that the PH bond worked. My Gelish nails lasted over 2 weeks without any chips. I only changed the color due to the unsightly nail grow out.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped with a large bottle of acetone. The acetone leaked and this item was broken in 2 pieces and completely empty.</li>
            <li> I was having issues with the Gelish polish peeling off my nails after about a week.  Regular nail polish rarely lasted more than 2-3 days before it started peeling.  I was using alcohol wipes before but that didn&#x27;t work well either.  So, I decided to purchase the PH Bond.  This stuff works for me!  I have had the polish on now for more than a week and it&#x27;s still perfect - YAY!  If you are having problems with your Gelish peeling or not lasting, I would consider trying this product.  It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive and it does the job well.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish Products,  because the appearance of my nails is always perfect, without the damage that acrylic nails can cause.[[ASIN:B004J6WCBQ Hand &amp; Nail Harmony Gelish pH Bond - 01206]]</li>
            <li> I find this product to work just great, however I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try any other bonding agents. I like this one so much that I probably won&#x27;t try any others and the price is great.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It is easy to use, and dries out your nails instantly to prep for your gel nails.  I am very happy with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> However, the blogs all say I needed it as a part of the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; manicure process. I bought it, because I bought the other stuff. I think it works, it seems like the same stuff used in the salons. My nails chip pretty early, but I am using a bunch of new products-so I dont know if it&#x27;s this</li>
            <li> i love this product, works well with my other gel polishes as well as harmony. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo14MZISWNQ48VC]]This Gelish pH bond is a good product. This is a dehydrator to remove the excess moisture of your nails and dry them so that the coats that follow will adhere better to your nails and last longer.  It contains isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, and isobutyl acetate. These are solvents to remove the moisture and any oils that may be on the surface of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the first step that you put onto your nail to prepare them for the applications of the foundation and polishes.  Removing the moisture helps to prepare a good surface for the foundation and polish to stick to.  You should not only apply this to your nail top but also to the nail tip.  Let&#x27;s face it, what good does it do to have a beautiful nail polish job on your hands and have if peel off in a few days after all of the hard work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife got into gel nail polishes and using UV light to cure them and she asked me to help her so we sat down and did some research and found out that Gelish makes the best products that we could find. She looked at the local beauty supply houses and found that the prices they charged for Gelish was high and that the bottles were very small. They were also almost always out of stock on the more popular colors. Amazon has a better selection of colors, larger bottles and better prices. Doing her nails herself and buying at the better prices on Amazon she has saved a lot of money over going to the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been doing her nails with Gelish for over 2 years and she loves it. She has also done the nails for family and friends and helped them get started. She always recommends that they buy their supplies on Amazon because of the selection, the lower price and the size of the bottles. This bottle is 15 mL. The ones at the local beauty supply house are 9 mL and cost the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have written multiple reviews on UV nail curing machine and here are the steps and curing times for a UV LED machine for your information.

            <li> I was hesitant at first to spend the extra money on this step instead of first using the foundation. However, when I put it on my nails it quickly dehydrated them and the foundation polish seemed to cure and stick better.</li>
            <li> It does the trick and keeps me from worrying about the nail to being about to bond to the gel polish. I also love that it eliminates bacteria that could grow while wearing the gel polish!</li>
            <li> You could use 2 parts rubbing alcohol and 1 part acetone for same effect.  Does not dry nail bed that well. &amp;#34;PH&amp;#34; has nothing to do with product.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Dries out my nail so the gel base coat can adher to my nail.  A little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last forever.  Over all the Harmony Gelish gel is a great brand.  It had nicer colors than the other brands I looked at, and what is really great about the brand is tht all of the instructions at on their website, and the curing times are on the bottles too.  Another brand that I looked didnt have any instructions posted on their website, and instead you would have to sign up for a class to Learn how to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love being able to do my nails my self on my own time!</li>
            <li> Ingredients:  Isopropyl Alcohol, Ethyl Acetate, Isobutyl Acetate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose:  Used to dehydrate the nail plate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Direction:  Cover the prepped natural nail plate with PH Bond. When applying, wipe most of the product off from the brush applicator back into the bottle neck.  Apply a dot to the natural nail plate with what remains within the brush applicator.  Using a scrubbing motion, spread the PH Bond up to but just short of the cuticle line and not onto any applied artificial nail tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:  Let dry before applying foundation gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I have read other reviews which say you can use rubbing alcohol instead of purchasing this product as it is cheaper but it will be missing two key ingredients.  I would question if the overall manicure would last up to the expected two weeks by cutting corners like this.  If you are using straight alcohol as a replacement for the PH Bond nail prep and your gel is lifting after a few days it is because the Ethyl Acetate and Isobutyl Acetate are the key ingredients which assist the Gelish Foundation base in making a proper and secure bond to the natural nail plate.  Also, this product will last forever if applied correctly.  I have read somewhere that it applies a thousand or more applications if properly used.  I am a firm believer that if you are going to do something, do it right.  It saves money, time and hassle in the long run.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with other Harmony nail products. I wanted to start doing my own gel nails, and the price for all items combined was great.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product used at my salon and a much better price! I am very happy with both the product and seller.  Now I am able to give myself a lasting manicure at home instead of paying $30 plus tip every two weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great I thought I could get away with not using it but I was wrong with out my gel nails were pealing off within like 2 days but ions I use it and they pretty much last for forever</li>
            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  I have been doing my own nails for years .. when I heard how long gel nails lasted .. I was hooked!  I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks .. my manicure very nicely 2 weeks .. then I must start to \\&quot;tip\\&quot; the ends with a matching regular nail polish.  If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color .. it will last better.  My nails grow quickly so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  Hope the below is helpful .. thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    AUGUST 2013  (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS SO BADLY TO AMAZON VIA THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES!)     The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!    Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application    AUGUST 2013  The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.  Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application [...]   1. First remove old gel polish. Rough up nails well so acetone can get through. Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  with the pad slightly off center.  Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. . This helps keep the pads moist longer.  Do the second hand.  Put a glove on the second hand and set the timer for 20 minutes after completing 2nd hand. With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand,flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go. If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  Pads can reused a couple of times before throwing away .. flick off old polish from pad/flatten/let dry/store separated in paper sheets they came in.  (Using: Graham Hands Down Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps-works GREAT! -for small toenails the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)  2.  Apply cuticle remover .. push back the cuticle.  3.  Remove cuticle from nail plate.  Clean up as needed.  4.  Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  5.  Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  6.  Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  (IF POSSIBLE:  apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  Leave on overnight if possible. Then:  wash with soap and water and polish using the proper steps.  7.  Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol. You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  8. Apply  PH Bond to the nail plate. (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  9. SKIP TO #12 IF nails are not peeling/brittle/weak/damaged.  If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  **Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail. If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  10.  Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.) Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  10b NEXT  .. \\&quot;STRUCTURE GEL.  NOTE:  dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush. Then, wipe the rest of the gel off of the brush. Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail. I even wipe the brush off between each nail. This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds. (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails but Structure Gel is a wonderful strong product!.)  11. If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  DO NOT USE CLEANSER... this is a DRY cleaning.  12.  Apply Gelish Color Coat of Choice. First, seal the free edge of the nail. Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer. APPLICATION SHOULD BE ALMOST SEE-THROUGH ON 1st COAT!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  13.  Repeat Step 11, 12 &amp; 13 for 2nd color coat.  14.  Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER). First seal the free edge. Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION. If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  15.  Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  16.  Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.    TIPS:  a.  I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light .. with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  b.  I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet .. IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!c.  Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula, this was the culprit in my second  Gelish kit.  d.  By searching and finally finding a regular nail polish (Sally Hansen \\&quot;#350 Heart to Heart\\&quot; Diamond Strength No Chip Nail Color) close to my gel polish (gelish \\&quot;Tiger Blossum-Item #01334) I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  Not looking great toward the end but tolerable!  In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails .. ie using the #350 to color the tip of the nails after they wear off.  I find I must do this nearly every day .. just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed .. then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  I get another week out of it .. YEAH!  e.

I was always using my Iphone as a timer backup for the UV lamp so this was really nice.  I found that the replacement bulbs for the UV lamp were almost $30, and the LED lamp is supposed to last 35,000 hours - so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.  TECH TIPS:  [...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  For best performance follow recommended cure times.  **I think the soaking the Gel polish off in Acetone every time they come in weakens the nail bed as well. I make my client only wear it ever third time they get a manicure. I don&#x27;t care what they say...it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping. [...] **clients who like to peel the product off, I believe this may be why subsequent applications are not working. They are taking the top layer of keratin off. I always caution my clients not do to this and if they do, they cannot expect the product to perform the way it&#x27;s designed to do. **Do buy a bottle of cuticle oil and use it over your Shellac every day (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking. **there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now. Gelish, Geleration, Axxium, Gelicure... lots of them. They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  **Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first, some, all of the above.  **  [...]  TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:  *****GELISH STRUCTURE GEL  **I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine. I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  .. Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips. Use this product after the Gelish Foundation (BASE) step has been completed  Directions: Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application. When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail. Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail. You want to minimize the times you lift the brush from the product so as not to incorporate air bubbles. Once the nail is covered with the sculpting gel, turn your hand over keeping it level for 1 minute. This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape. Cure as directed between each application. See requirements for the cure time needed  Requirements: Gelish structure must be cured with an LED lamp or UV lamp system. LED cure time 30 seconds. 36W UV Lamp - 2 minutes  Note: For me this is a must have product. I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application. This helps to equal out the level differences between the two. On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip. Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top If Off as the final step .  **.  **Apply with a nail art brush.  **I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel. I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed. The end result is fantastic.  **The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  **Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  **Notice this is called a clean up brush. That is what it does. It will even up your French manicure very easily. Don&#x27;t know how anyone can do a French manicure without one. I wanted to try the French tip look with the CND Shellac process I do at home and purchased this brush for that specific purpose. This brush made even this amateur try look professional. This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand. No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out. Would recommend highly recommend.    BEAUTY~NAILS~GEL-JULY 2012  **VIDEO:  [...]</li>
            <li> This product is needed in doing gel polish it helps dry out nail bed..it&#x27;s a must step and helps stay on better.</li>
            <li> I am a fanatic about my gel nail polish and saving some money by doing my own nails.  I was having a hard time finding a decently priced Nail Prep that actually worked.  This worked great for what I needed.  I will definitely buy it again!!</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I do my  nails.  It does tend to dry out the nail surface a bit, but it does make the polish bond better when used with it.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Gelish brand polish without this and it did not last that long maybe one week at the most. Now that I am using the PH Bond I can easily get 2 weeks use out of my manicure.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product just doesn&#x27;t work right or if I purchased the wrong thing. I was looking for a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; so that I could apply gel polish and so that it would last longer. This only dehydrates my nail immediately after applying but the polish will chop off in 2 days or less .</li>
            <li> Currently using this to see if some less than reputable uv gel base and top coat will adhere better. If you check my purchases you will see the products that I&#x27;m talking about. Anyway... it&#x27;s doing its&#x27;s job; now let&#x27;s see if the nail polish will work better. Shipping from this seller was fast as expected.</li>
            <li> It works great with all brands of gel polishes... help your Gel polishes last longer on your nails. high recommend for gel polish</li>
            <li> This is the first step after cleaning and &amp;#34;roughing up&amp;#34; your nails when using Gelish UV gel polish.  It&#x27;s a great product.  I use it twice on each nail before applying any coats of base.  I find I get better adherence to the natural nail if I do that.</li>
            <li> This seems to work well with my UV light for my gel nail kit. It think it helps them but I dont have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li> This is a good start for the Gelish manicures.  Prepares nails for the foundation coat, and then the remainder of the process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for a long time now and in the past few years bonding has been an issue along with nail damage due to filing.  Tried this not expecting miracles but to my surprise it does exactly what is expected.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> works well w/any gel nail polish/starter. i recommend to gel users and will purchase again, the item lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This pH Bond definitely extended the wear of my gel polish. I have been doing my own gel for a while and it was only lasting 2 days before chipping. it lasted a week and a half with the pH Bond. It is worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what difference this makes because I haven&#x27;t applied polish without it.  Doesn&#x27;t do much to prevent bleeding of color into the nail, however.</li>
            <li> This is a must have with any nail product you are using. It dries the nail bed so the polish stick to it better. I bought all the harmony products so they would work better with each other. I have tried this with other products too and it works.</li>
            <li> I was doing gel nails for a long time. I wasn&#x27;t using the PH Bond before and my nails were just fine. I have started using this and they seem to last a little longer. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because I am getting better at doing them or because I am using this. Either way, it&#x27;s cheap and a part of my nail routine now.</li>
            <li> Always helps any of my gel polishes last much longer than without it. I highly recommend it. Great product and little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Oh my! This really did work.  Too well!  I had to soak the gel polish a bit longer, after, to remove it, but if your nail beds are super shiny then you will need this product to ensure you have a 2 to 3 week application.  Which is why we use gel polish to begin with right?  Happy polishing!!!</li>
            <li> Works great and it works with my shellac &amp; gel polish</li>
            <li> This was the best thing to get for you&#x27;re nails most have from  start the nails most get don&#x27;t forget it!</li>
            <li> The pH bond does help my gel manicure stay on longer. Yes, it is very similar to rubbing alcohol, but it is more concentrated so it dries your nails out and helps the gel polish hold. I don&#x27;t find the drying effects to last long, and it&#x27;s very cheap and easy to use. Essentially, after taking off any old nail polish you may be wearing, use this as your first step when giving yourself a gel manicure. After you use the pH bond, apply the top coat. I&#x27;ve done ia manicure with the bond and without- and I do see a difference.</li>
            <li> I hate giving Gelish a negative review, because I LOVE the Harmony Gelish line of products!!!!  I use it all the time and it&#x27;s honestly the only polish I use on my nails.  The pH Bond is used to clean &amp; dehydrate the nail before applying the foundation base coat.  With that said, it does the job ... however ... this pH Bond is truly just rubbing alcohol in a nail polish bottle with a brush.  If you want, you can purchase this, and refill with rubbing alcohol when done.  It&#x27;s only $5, so its not like your breaking the bank.(It&#x27;s what I do)</li>
            <li> came off the first day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gelish products by Harmony for a few years now and this brand is the best of all Gel Products on the market!</li>
            <li> Gelish is a great product.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. Now I don&#x27;t have to pay $20 a pop at the salon!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product!!  This is the thing that holds my whole day together! I love everything about manicures!!!  I will definitely buy this over and over!</li>
            <li> Some of the Gel Polish when you use them at home peel off this one doesn&#x27;t. lasts like I went to the nail salon. Great product for someone doing their nails at home.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t originally purchase this and my manicure only lasted a few days but this helps extend the life of my manicure.  I suggest it highly!</li>
            <li> I bought what I needed to do the gel polish along with this bond.  It is definitely a tricky process and I couldn&#x27;t get the sequence down so that it would work for me smoothly.  If you know what you are doing and have done this before this product would probably work fine for you.  I am not a professional and should just stick to going to the salon for the gel polish.</li>
            <li> this is a must for your gel nails and I got it at a very good price, thanks very much</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re doing Harmony Gelish nails yourself, this is step 2. You&#x27;ll need each product to complete the manicure, which will be instantly dry and hard when done.</li>
            <li> Used this dehydrator with Gelish base, color, and top coat, and it&#x27;s great! Works exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to and I recommend this product. It prolongs the life of your manicure and helps in the application process and makes it stick!</li>
            <li> Great price... and received on time!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works better than another primer i&#x27;ved used. Makes gel polish bond better and last longer. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> love the gelish product line</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to learn how to use it. It is knowing when to touch and to dry it</li>
            <li> Came super fast! Love Gelish! I really like using the pH after I have roughed up my nails. It really helps with my nails. The gelish doesn&#x27;t stay on too well if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged and as promised.</li>
            <li> It does its job perfectly. It preps your finger for the foundation coat to go on. it seems to work well</li>
            <li> This product seems to work like it should, drying out any oils on the nail as prep work before doing gel polish.  I think it does its job and is absolutely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these items.  I t is saving me bunches of money/  I even do my families and friends nails for a small fee.</li>
            <li> A mandatory step, for the magical gel bond.  It goes on fast and absolutely no drying time needed. yes in deedie</li>
            <li> This was another piece of the pie that I wasn&#x27;t aware of when I first started using Gelish products.  It is relatively inexpensive and extremely important for the process to work.</li>
            <li> This is a great value.. full size product for less than the mini size available at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. Some people say you don&#x27;t need this product, but my nails stay on perfectly when I use this.</li>
            <li> perfect need more now</li>
            <li> Excellent primer for nails.  I use this, a base coat, 2 coats of color, and a top coat.  I cover nail tips with each coat and my manicure will last 2 weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to complete my Harmony Gelish No chip manicure. Arrived super fast and just what I needed!</li>
            <li> does not seem to make the gel bond any better at all. I used it with and without this prep for my gel manicures and didn&#x27;t notice the difference.</li>
            <li> the product was large size than had expected for the price, very happy I got the product on line instead of the store</li>
            <li> I PUT THIS ON BEFORE PUTTING ON THE FOUNDATION. IT DOES WHAT IT SUPPOSE TO DO, I REALLY LIKE IT. TO GET RID OF OIL ON YOUR NAILS BEFORE GEL USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one bottle for 2 years and there&#x27;s still some left. This is a major bargain in my book.</li>
            <li> I bought the entire gelish system but can&#x27;t get the polish to adhere for more than a few days. Not the answer to home manicure</li>
            <li> good stuff great price</li>
            <li> This is a great dehydrator for step 2 of gel nails.  Would recommend this as it is a good price and a nice full size bottle (.5 oz).</li>
            <li> You absolutely need to use this if you&#x27;re going to do a gelish manicure.  As far as I know it does it&#x27;s function and it arrived quickly.  Be sure to apply in an extremely thin layer.  This is true for all gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> This Gelish Bond is perfect w/the whole Gelish application. It secures my polish and base coat perfectly. Without it the polish tends to peel off. Thank you for my item</li>
            <li> Thank you!  I saved me a lot of money &amp; and is a brand name</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for doing your own nails at home. It only takes a little bit and it last for a long time. It will save money in the long run if you are doing your own nails at home.</li>
            <li> Nice addition to my nail care products.  I would recommend.  I am trying to get my nails stronger and getting the whole system works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed all of my gelish products, so of course I love this one as well. Big bottle, easy brush to apply product. Good value for money spent. Much bigger bottles the CND.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it with all my gel products not just gelish. This is my manicure routine for gel polish n regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Remove all cuticles, I use Sally Hansen \\&quot;instant cuticle remover\\&quot; by far the best hands down. After applying this I soak my hands in some warm soapy water leaving the remover on for about 3-5 minutes n than I use a spoon metal cuticle pusher to push back my cuticles n remover the cuticle that has grown on my nail plate all the way around my nail, sides included...do not cut your cuticles or the skin around your nail plate, that&#x27;s what causes them to split and become callus. Should NEVER touch any of the skin around your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Wash hands good to remove all the cuticle remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I use my electric nail drill \\&quot;very gently\\&quot; to remove the shine on my natural nail n any remaining cuticle on the my nail plate only. This does not damage the nail plate n by using the E Drill it&#x27;s much easier to buff the nail without using a block buffer or the 100/180 file that&#x27;s very hard to use without touching the skin around my nail...I will NEVER use a block buffer or file on my nails ever again. Since giving up the buffer n file and using the E file only, my nails n the skin around my nail plate has never been healthier. There is a video on YouTube on how to do a proper manicure prep before applying gel polishes n regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Shape nails with a OPI crystal file, filing in one direction only. Do not file side to side this will only rip your nails and do not file the sides of your nails at all, this weakens the nails support causing them to break. Tips only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I use a brush or nail duster to remover the nail dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I apply 91% alcohol, let air dry...than I use EZ flow nail primer being careful not to get any on the skin as it does burn, let air dry...than I apply the gelish ph bond air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to gel polishes is very thin coats, keeping the foundation, color n top it off sealer...off your skin...if you do get any on the skin around your nails, take a paint brush n dip in alcohol and clean it off before curing it...so alway check all nails good before curing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Apply a very THIN coat of gelish foundation, cure in LED lamp for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Take a dry paint brush that u would use for applying nail polish or makeup not the ones for removing the dust n wipe each nail down with it, this helps smooth out the cured foundation n removes the moisture. I got this tip off the gelish web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Apply a very thin coat of the gel polish color you have picked out n cure for 1 minute, 2 minutes for dark colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Apply another coat of your color, again cure but I cure the second coat for 2 to 3 minutes depending on how dark it is, if u are gonna apply a 3rd coat only cure 2 mins n cure your 3rd coat 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Now it&#x27;s time for your gelish top it off top sealer. I usually put 2 coats of this on curing the first coat 2 minutes n curing the second coat for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Take the gelish cleanser or just alcohol on a lint free cloth or a paper towel will work as well...never use anything cotton with your gels or regular polish it&#x27;s your worst enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now you have beautiful nails with color that should last 10 days or more :-) and are fully dry.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my gel nails at home. PLEASE make sure you do not confuse this with BONDER. :-) You can also use acetone to dehydrate, but obviously it might damage more.  It&#x27;s alot of work, but SOO worth it.</li>
            <li> The ph bond dehydrates the nail plate, you will need just a little of the liquid so the bottle will last long. Good for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically alcohol</li>
            <li> I love doing this at home. Saves me tons of money, and if it gets messed up I just fix it on my own time. This is the best.</li>
            <li> Came as described, have no complaints, regular PH bond like any :)</li>
            <li> Bought and received this months ago (forgot to leave feedback).  I would buy from this seller again.  This bottle will last me for many applications.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> If you are doing your own shellac manicures at home don&#x27;t forget this important step.  It removes any oils from you nails and the polish is bonded to stay until you WANT to soak it off!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s essentially just alcohol (read the ingredients), but I think there are a couple different alcohol concentrations in here, because it works better than plain alcohol and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird shinny residue like some brands. Works great with OPI bases and Red Carpet colors</li>
            <li> this works very well with Gelish &amp; Red Carpet Manicure kits. It&#x27;s a great little dehydrator. I&#x27;d purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Since I use this product my nail polish stays for longer! I would recommend to a friend - it is a successul purchase.</li>
            <li> All this is, is rubbing alcohol. It is easier to buy a big bottle from a store. This dehydrates the nail to help ensure the base coat sticks properly. You also use rubbing alcohol on a lint free wipe to take off the tacky layer left over by harmony gelish &#x27;top it off.&#x27; I had bought the harmony gelish mini-starter kit and was annoyed to find all it has is rubbing alcohol (twice), acetone nail polish remover,cuticle oil, and the important top/bottom layer gel polishes. All you need to get online is a curing lamp and the nail polishes, everything else you can get cheaply at a nearby store. Hope this helps from a learned Harmony Gelish fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gelish products for a while and I love them. This product in particular is awesome, can&#x27;t do my nails without it.</li>
            <li> Some of the Gel Polish when you use them at home peel off this one doesn&#x27;t, lasts like I went to the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for someone doing their nails at home.</li>
            <li> So frustrating.  I took my time, thought I did everything correctly and my polish still peeled right off.  I swear my nails are made of Teflon.  I roughed them up a little. (not too much because they split, chip and peel all the time so I wanted to be a little gentle)  I wiped with alcohol, then brushed on this Nail Prep pH bond being careful not to touch my nails with my fingers at all after this step.  I used the base coat, polish and top coat as instructed using the led light as instructed in between each step.  They looked great when I wiped them off. Very happy.  I no sooner got out of the house to go out to dinner for mothers day and before I got out of the car, one was already peeling. Such a disappointment and a waste of time.  At least it wasn&#x27;t much money but I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really love that I found this product. It&#x27;s so much cheaper than Sally&#x27; s &amp; you get more for your money.</li>
            <li> So annoyed to find out I paid eight dollars for a tiny bottle of rubbing alcohol. That&#x27;s all this is. Save yourself time and money and go buy rubbing alcohol to clean off and dehydrate your nails.</li>
            <li> Does what I need it to do perfect</li>
            <li> Dries out and preps the nail bed. I THINK that alcohol would work as well, but one dip into the bottle will do your whole hand so it will go a long way.</li>
            <li> PH Bond is necessary for the gel polish application! Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This was a good investment for a novice. I just want to do my own nails, and cannot justify over $30 for a manicure! This was worth buying the first time, though as I learn more, I may just refill the bottle with rubbing alcohol. Still worth it to have the bottle and brush.</li>
            <li> I have only one complaint about this product...I didn&#x27;t invent it. I love this stuff. If you haven&#x27;t tried gel polish then you dont know what you are missing. Perfect manicure and stays without chipping and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks and I am usually a pretty busy gal and my hands see a lot of action. The best!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I was very careful in applying the product. I followed the directions precisely and I still developed an allergy to the product. It took 5 month before the painful blisters showed up under my fingernails.  I tried giving my nails 2months off but the blisters came back faster that before. But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it. I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li> I have been this product for over a year and it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin nails and it keep them nice and strong and prevents them from tearing&lt;br /&gt;Nice to be able to do my nails at home. Save me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use this product first, your gells with peel off - so buy it, it&#x27;s cheap and makes the gels stick!!</li>
            <li> It looks like it dryed the nail as described, now I must wait to see if the gel doesn&#x27;t peel when I remove the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I used this after I wipe my nails down with rubbing alcohol.  It is a Ph balancer, that you are supposed to use before you start with the basecoat.  I&#x27;ve never used any other one, so I believe it is doing the job.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT...VERY PLEASED WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THIS PURCHASE. easy to apply directions were easy to understandI will recommend this to all friends and family.</li>
            <li> Works just as described. I really like this product because I got thin nails and buffing is not an option. I foresee this lasting me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was putting rubbing alcohol on my nails before doing my gel nail polish foundation. This prep is much better. You can actually see how it dries out your nail so your nail is ready for the foundation layer of your gel polish.</li>
            <li> While I have not done a gel manicure without this, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  My first set of gel nails that I applied myself lasted three weeks and except for the nail growth, they were still looking good!  After removal of the prior gel nail, I wash my hands, dry them with a paper towel, place both hands in the Epica UV dryer to absorb any last signs of moisture, then apply the Gelish Nail Prep.  Soaks right into the nail, no buffing of the nail necessary to ensure adhesion of the gel nail.  Some say you can use alcohol for this step.  May be true, but I see the Salons use this as a step, so I follow suit.</li>
            <li> I order this product on Thursday morning and received that&#x27;s Saturday..was very surprised on how fast I got it..used it for the first time today so I will have to see how it works</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of gel products.  I now buy them exclusively and find them to be easy to use and reasonably priced.  If I were to buy this in my area I would get a smaller bottle for the same price and I pay for the regular sized bottle.  I&#x27;m a fan of Amazon for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this it works perfect as I expected. Before my gel polish would peel but now that I brought this product it is safe to say I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.</li>
            <li> Just okay. It&#x27;s not anything special. I could go either way on it. I still use it more than not.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and Harmony Brand is consistently excellent. I will continue to order their products. The colors are wonderful as well</li>
            <li> I, after years of paying someone else, have started doing my nails at home and this stuff for the gel polish is a MUST HAVE or your polish just will not stay on that long, I speak from experience! And this one was a good price :-)</li>
