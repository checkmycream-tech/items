    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Took over an hour to apply these wonderful nails on my 5-yr.</li>
            <li>It works surprisingly well!  </li>
            <li>so if you know someone who is, this is a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>She was thrilled!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what magic they did to create the perfect clean nails they show in the TV ad.</li>
            <li>I really thought this product looked awesome on TV and figured my stepdaughter would have a blast with it.</li>
            <li>Good luck having a child be able to do this.  </li>
            <li>Honestly this is just a hype.</li>
            <li>It was the perfect gift for my pre-teen niece who is totally into keeping her nails looking fresh and fly!</li>
            <li>The glitter is very fine, and you get a nice variety of gemstones.</li>
            <li>The nails it comes with fall off very easily.</li>
            <li>She wasn&#x27;t even able to try it out to form her own opinion.</li>
            <li>Nice idea, but just ok.</li>
            <li>The box says easy as 1-2-3!</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s easy as 1-2-3!</li>
            <li>Thankfully she has already used up most of nails and gems that came with it and it will be going in the trash soon.</li>
            <li>Better off just letting the kids do their nails on newpaper and sprinkling gitter on them.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off painting their nails with nail polish and then sprinkling the glitter on them.  </li>
            <li>Got it for my grand daughter</li>
            <li>She loves the spray glitter part the most.</li>
            <li>I think we could do a better job on her nails by hand.  </li>
            <li>Yeah right!!</li>
            <li>Nothing worked as easily as we thought it would.</li>
            <li>it is not that easy.</li>
            <li>While the idea is cute and my daughter enjoyed it, it certainly didn&#x60;t work like the comercial.</li>
            <li>The glitter just didn&#x27;t seem to fly around the chambers and land on the nails like the commercial advertises.</li>
            <li>Overall it was great daughter and mommy time</li>
            <li>and she enjoyed hours of fun and entertainment.</li>
            <li>The directions were clearly written, the product was well constructed and was a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>We gave this to our 6 year old granddaughter and she used it immediately and really loved it.  </li>
            <li>-she has had more success just applying the sparkly stuff directly on her own nails.  </li>
            <li>She was so excited when she opened it.  </li>
            <li>They were so excited.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something you dont want your young daughter (not for ages 6-11) to play with on her own.</li>
            <li>My main recommendation for improvement would be to give more nails and adhesive strips in the package.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off just using clear nail polish and sprinkling the glitter on yourself.</li>
            <li>My daughter did have fun with it, but I&#x27;m throwing it out just as soon as she forgets about it.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing that I have to say is that they sure fooled us well with the commercial.  </li>
            <li>The glitter section is fun</li>
            <li>Well it never has worked right</li>
            <li>so she washed her hands and the nails fell right off with water.</li>
            <li>They barely stick, then we put their fingers inside the glitter chamber and just like magic, glitter was everywhere, including all over the table we were working on.</li>
            <li>My bff and I were really hyped when we saw the mailman in front of our house and quickly we signed it off and ran upstairs to play with it.</li>
            <li>First, in order for us to use it, we have to look for a screwdriver to unscrew the lid that holds the batteries.</li>
            <li>Probably better for teenage girls.</li>
            <li>They wanted to wear their pretty nails for dinner.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think she is interested anymore.  </li>
            <li>It would be much easier just to paint your child nails and put the glitter on yourself.  </li>
            <li>But the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>The glitter does not blow around and cover the nail very well.</li>
            <li>Their whole finger was covered in glitter and when you pull your finger out, glitter falls off everywhere.</li>
            <li>and she is ready to wash them off too.</li>
            <li>She is really into her nails and all kinds of girlie things</li>
            <li>The glitter and gems did stick nicely to the adhesive but where the adhesive did not fit the nail..</li>
            <li>We got this for our daughter for Christmas, even paid extra for quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who into the bling on the nails.</li>
            <li>Just go to the store and buy the cute little pre-polished nails that soak off in water.</li>
            <li>Second, and most important, this thing sucks.</li>
            <li>Sounds cool, looks cool, but just a big mess.</li>
            <li>As it turns out it was messy to play with and it just didn&#x27;t work as easily as it is portrayed on TV.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge mess with glitter everywhere.  </li>
            <li>and the HUGE mess the glitter makes.</li>
            <li>We have one sad little girl here, bet there are many more too!</li>
            <li>My seven year old daugther wanted this after seeing the ads on TV.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 5 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 6yr old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my 6 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li>This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my eight year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my four year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Bought this item for my 8yr old this Christmas 2009.  </li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>There is no way a young child (7)can do it herself and even with help  </li>
            <li>She has played with it several times and all she has succeeded in doing is making a huge mess with the glitter.  </li>
            <li>, the nails don&#x27;t stay on good at all, and it just was a disappointment.</li>
            <li>The glitter doesnt stick to your own nails, or the fake ones they provide.</li>
            <li>A word of advice, throw the fake stick on nails out and just apply a coat of kiddie nail polish prior to having them stick their finger in the glitter compartment, it works much better, apply a coat of clear polish after the glitter dries for a minute.    </li>
            <li>She just ended up making a mess and really didn&#x27;t use it as it was advertised.</li>

            <li> She just ended up making a mess and really didn&#x27;t use it as it was advertised.</li>
            <li> I would recommend not using the little adhesion strips for your nails and just putting a thick coat of clear nail polish on right before you put the glitter on.</li>
            <li> It is impossible for a child to use on her own.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely messy and you can accomplish this effct by painting clear nail polish on the nails and pouring glitter over it.  </li>
            <li> I finally painted her nails with polish, and sprinkled glitter on them by hand and used the wet nail polish as an adhesive for the gems.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old asked for this for christmas after seeing the commercials all day, everyday.  </li>
            <li> This product was smaller than expected, but I could have gotten over that.</li>
            <li> The glitter is not nicely contained in the unit and quickly gets all over and is very difficult to clean up.  </li>
            <li> Only to have them \\&quot;fall off\\&quot; a few minutes later.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to buy this product to quench the thirst of my recent nail painting craze but it came to a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This nail glitter and gem is way too hard for a 7 year old to do.  </li>
            <li> What a big waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The nails lasted about 30 seconds (and they were careful).</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> Just go buy some glitter and shake it on her wet nails instead.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work the way we thought, it only works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; and is a bit messy with glitter stuck all over her fingers.</li>
            <li> The nails do not stick and the gems are hard to get on and do not last very long on the nail.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully a little sill stick to the adhesive, but not much.  </li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t fill the containers with glitter past the line the product works as promised.</li>
            <li> It is very messy and generally a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter couldn&#x27;t stand the glitter mess</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this is a mess.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!   </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Honestly, it is not worth the money!  </li>
            <li> I was not successful in finding out how to send it back.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The plastic nail did not fit her fingers.</li>
            <li> It is as messy as can be.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be like a regualr \\&quot;manicure\\&quot; that could be worn for a few days.  </li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Christmas day, I had a mess on my dining room table!</li>
            <li> Only down fall is it is very, very MESSY!!!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much, but figured, I would get it for her anyway, since she wanted it so bad.  </li>
            <li> They were to small and the recommended age was 6</li>
            <li> It requires that you put a small adhesive strip on each nail.  </li>
            <li> The fake nails that come with it only have one set of adhesive tapes.</li>
            <li> And the nails were too small for my daughter&#x27; fingers.</li>
            <li> SOOOOO MESSY!</li>
            <li> but it simply clumps onto to the stickies you apply to your nails or the fake nails.  </li>
            <li> It is very messy and the nails do not stay on.  </li>
            <li> The piece that is suppose to put the gems on uses suction and might I say not very good suction.  </li>
            <li> She has since concluded that it is \\&quot;pretty stupid and doesnt work like they show on TV</li>
            <li> No matter how hard you try not to get glitter everywhere</li>
            <li> No good,  very messy.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of my money. :(</li>
            <li> Not to mention that within 5 minutes (again Seriously)</li>
            <li> I thought with the name Conair behind it, it would at least be so-so...</li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my six year old daughter, and it is awful!!  </li>
            <li> Just sad to see just how false this item is.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all</li>
            <li> The fake nails do not even stick on.  </li>
            <li> What I would suggest is buying kid&#x27;s fake nails,nail appliques, and glitter polish.  </li>
            <li> I feel bad that I gave a broken gift to my niece.  </li>
            <li> The adhesive for the fake nails is difficult to work with and doesnt even stay on for the lightest of wear!</li>
            <li> Sorry to rant and critize on this product so badly</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> The motor did not even budge the glitter, making it impossible for the glitter to get to the finger nails.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to create the nail look in the picture with this product.</li>
            <li> that is another impossible feat.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, our granddaughter was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> The girls were disappointed.</li>
            <li> We were both disappointed in how it works.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the product needed to be removed before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> so disappointed when all it did was create problems.</li>
            <li> , I was disappointed too.  </li>
            <li> My daughter got this for Christmas, and was disappointed that Santa would bring her something that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> This product is very disappointing!</li>
            <li> and we were very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but my experience was horrible.</li>
            <li> This is the worst item I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> but it just horrible.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible time getting the adhesive strips to stick to their nails.</li>

            <li> I was excited to buy this product to quench the thirst of my recent nail painting craze but it came to a disappointment. My bff and I were really hyped when we saw the mailman in front of our house and quickly we signed it off and ran upstairs to play with it. First, in order for us to use it, we have to look for a screwdriver to unscrew the lid that holds the batteries. Second, and most important, this thing sucks. It says ages 6+, yet the fake nails don&#x27;t fit at all! Sorry to rant and critize on this product so badly but my experience was horrible. Should&#x27;ve known that this was only a kid&#x27;s toy.</li>
            <li> Sounds cool, looks cool, but just a big mess. It&#x27;s something you dont want your young daughter (not for ages 6-11) to play with on her own. The glitter is very fine, and you get a nice variety of gemstones. It works well. Probably better for teenage girls. I would recommend not using the little adhesion strips for your nails and just putting a thick coat of clear nail polish on right before you put the glitter on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9-year-old step-daughter. Even though she has normal-sized hands, not one of the nails were big enough for her. The nails are made for very tiny hands, maybe 5 or 6-year olds. She never even used the kit, just gave it to Salvation Army.</li>
            <li> My seven year old daugther wanted this after seeing the ads on TV.  She has played with it several times and all she has succeeded in doing is making a huge mess with the glitter.  She has since concluded that it is \\&quot;pretty stupid and doesnt work like they show on TV and they are trying to rip you off.\\&quot;  The nails that come in the kit are too big and dont stick well-she has had more success just applying the sparkly stuff directly on her own nails.  The glitter is not nicely contained in the unit and quickly gets all over and is very difficult to clean up.  Thankfully she has already used up most of nails and gems that came with it and it will be going in the trash soon.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  It really was a waste of money. She just ended up making a mess and really didn&#x27;t use it as it was advertised. Nothing worked as easily as we thought it would.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed in this product.  The glitter just didn&#x27;t seem to fly around the chambers and land on the nails like the commercial advertises.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for each of my daughters for Christmas. Neithe one worked properly. The motor did not even budge the glitter, making it impossible for the glitter to get to the finger nails. I was not impressed at all and neither were they.</li>
            <li> This is the worst item I have ever purchased.  Seriously!  It was number one on my daughter&#x27;s christmas list.  I was not expecting much, but figured, I would get it for her anyway, since she wanted it so bad.  It did not work after using on 2 nails and I ended up shaking the thing to get the glitter on the nails.  Not to mention that within 5 minutes (again Seriously) all the nails had fallen off.  Even my daughter who is 6 and wanted this item - did not like it.     It went staight in the garbage - I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 5 year old for Christmas. She was thrilled! As long as you don&#x27;t fill the containers with glitter past the line the product works as promised. Only down fall is it is very, very MESSY!!! No matter how hard you try not to get glitter everywhere it isn&#x27;t going to happen. Overall it was great daughter and mommy time but I wouldn&#x27;t let her play with this by herself!!</li>
            <li> My kid told me a million times she wanted this for christmas so I got it on amazon.com for her.  Well it never has worked right, the nails don&#x27;t stay on good at all, and it just was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 6yr old daughter.  It is extremely messy and you can accomplish this effct by painting clear nail polish on the nails and pouring glitter over it.  While the idea is cute and my daughter enjoyed it, it certainly didn&#x60;t work like the comercial.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 6 year old for Christmas. The plastic nail did not fit her fingers. They were to small and the recommended age was 6+. The adhesive to put on the plastic nail was different sizes than the plastic nail. The glitter and gems did stick nicely to the adhesive but where the adhesive did not fit the nail..there was no glitter. And the nails stayed on about 20 mins.The adhesive did not hold the plastic nail onto her fingers well at all.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my eight year old granddaughter.  The directions were clearly written, the product was well constructed and was a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter for christmas.  She was so excited when she opened it.  What a big waste of money.  It is as messy as can be.  The fake nails do not even stick on.  The glitter goes everywhere.  It would be much easier just to paint your child nails and put the glitter on yourself.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> No good,  very messy.  Better off just letting the kids do their nails on newpaper and sprinkling gitter on them.</li>
            <li> I really thought this product looked awesome on TV and figured my stepdaughter would have a blast with it. As it turns out it was messy to play with and it just didn&#x27;t work as easily as it is portrayed on TV. But the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my four year old daughter.  It works surprisingly well!  My main recommendation for improvement would be to give more nails and adhesive strips in the package.  After two applications, we are out and will have to buy replacements.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  It requires that you put a small adhesive strip on each nail.  Good luck having a child be able to do this.  Then you put your finger in the slot, press a button, and the glitter shoots around your finger.  Hopefully a little sill stick to the adhesive, but not much.  My daughter and I used it once.  Even she lost interest.  It is not in the trash.</li>
            <li> We got this for our daughter for Christmas, even paid extra for quick shipping. What a ripoff. IT totally doesn&#x27;t work. The nails don&#x27;t stick to your fingernails. There is no way the gems or glitter stick to nothing. Just sad to see just how false this item is. We have one sad little girl here, bet there are many more too!</li>
            <li> I got each of my daughters one of these for Christmas. They were so excited. They wanted to wear their pretty nails for dinner. What a mess. The girls were disappointed. The nails lasted about 30 seconds (and they were careful). I&#x27;m cleaning out my daughters&#x27; rooms and these are going in the garbage. Neither one of them used it (or asked to use it) again. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She saw it on TV and wanted it. We were both disappointed in how it works. The glitter does not blow around and cover the nail very well. It is nearly impossible to create the nail look in the picture with this product. The fake nails that come with it only have one set of adhesive tapes. And the nails were too small for my daughter&#x27; fingers. (She&#x27;s 9.) And the glitter gets everywhere but your finger! You&#x27;re better off just using clear nail polish and sprinkling the glitter on yourself.</li>
            <li> This nail glitter and gem is way too hard for a 7 year old to do.  It is very messy and the nails do not stay on.  You&#x27;re better off painting their nails with nail polish and then sprinkling the glitter on them.  This was a total waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> The gift that I gave my niece did not work at all.  The one that my daughter received as a gift was ok---I would not recommend this to anyone.  I was disappointed that the product needed to be removed before going to bed.  I was hoping this would be like a regualr \\&quot;manicure\\&quot; that could be worn for a few days.  I feel bad that I gave a broken gift to my niece.  She wasn&#x27;t even able to try it out to form her own opinion. What should I tell my niece to do with her gift?  Is there somewhere she can go to exchange it for something else?</li>
            <li> Its total garbage and I am so dissapointed. I thought with the name Conair behind it, it would at least be so-so...but it just horrible. The glitter doesnt stick to your own nails, or the fake ones they provide. The adhesive for the fake nails is difficult to work with and doesnt even stay on for the lightest of wear! The gems they provide, dont come with any sort of adhesive so you can actually adhere them to a nail! My daughter is 5, and I was heartbroken to see her so disappointed when all it did was create problems. I finally painted her nails with polish, and sprinkled glitter on them by hand and used the wet nail polish as an adhesive for the gems. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Just go buy some glitter and shake it on her wet nails instead. If I could give zero stars, I would.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my 8yr old this Christmas 2009.  It is impossible for a child to use on her own.  It took us longer than it should have just to put the thing together.  Then to get it to work...that is another impossible feat.  It makes a huge mess with glitter everywhere.  (I am still trying to get it off my table)  The nails do not stick and the gems are hard to get on and do not last very long on the nail.  She tried it once, I don&#x27;t think she is interested anymore.  For the same price we could have gone to the nail salon and had someone pamper us.    I would not recommend buying this.  If you want to decorate nails, I would suggest buying the stickers, nail polish or even the press on nails.  Save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> I brought this item as a gift for my daughter and niece.  It was the perfect gift for my pre-teen niece who is totally into keeping her nails looking fresh and fly! Highly recommend for anyone who into the bling on the nails.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old asked for this for christmas after seeing the commercials all day, everyday.  What a rip off!  It is tiny, about as big as my hand, and doesnt do what it says.  My daughter did have fun with it, but I&#x27;m throwing it out just as soon as she forgets about it.  A word of advice, throw the fake stick on nails out and just apply a coat of kiddie nail polish prior to having them stick their finger in the glitter compartment, it works much better, apply a coat of clear polish after the glitter dries for a minute.    JUNK JUNK JUNK</li>
            <li> My daughters got this for Christmas, and we just opened it to try it out. What a mess. I had a terrible time getting the adhesive strips to stick to their nails. They barely stick, then we put their fingers inside the glitter chamber and just like magic, glitter was everywhere, including all over the table we were working on. Their whole finger was covered in glitter and when you pull your finger out, glitter falls off everywhere. My youngest daughter couldn&#x27;t stand the glitter mess so she washed her hands and the nails fell right off with water. So, they lasted about 5 minutes. My oldest has had them on for about 15 minutes and she is ready to wash them off too. I don&#x27;t know what magic they did to create the perfect clean nails they show in the TV ad. As, we had glitter everywhere and on everything. SOOOOO MESSY!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my six year old daughter, and it is awful!!  I would not waist your money or time.  The only good thing that I have to say is that they sure fooled us well with the commercial.  The glitter does not apply to the nail like it shows!  This product is very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!   Christmas day, I had a mess on my dining room table! The glitter flies out when you insert your finger. Took over an hour to apply these wonderful nails on my 5-yr. old. Only to have them \\&quot;fall off\\&quot; a few minutes later.  The box says easy as 1-2-3! Yeah right!! And I&#x27;m a manicurist! Just go to the store and buy the cute little pre-polished nails that soak off in water. Now that&#x27;s easy as 1-2-3!</li>
            <li> Recommend. Got it for my grand daughter and she enjoyed hours of fun and entertainment. Would buy again in the future</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece who is 10 and she loves it!  She is really into her nails and all kinds of girlie things so if you know someone who is, this is a great purchase.  She loves the spray glitter part the most.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this is a mess. There is no way a young child (7)can do it herself and even with help  it is not that easy. The nails it comes with fall off very easily. The glitter ends up everywhere. I wouldn&#x27;t let my child have this again if they were giving them away. She used it once and we have put it away out of sight. Hopefully she will forget about it. I know I won&#x27;t because I will be cleaning up glitter for the next year......</li>
            <li> Daughter didnt like this and I have to say, I was disappointed too.  It doesnt work the way we thought, it only works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; and is a bit messy with glitter stuck all over her fingers. I think we could do a better job on her nails by hand.  Nice idea, but just ok.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this for Christmas, and was disappointed that Santa would bring her something that didn&#x27;t work.  The nails don&#x27;t stick, and the glitter doesn&#x27;t stick or gets everywhere.  It is very messy and generally a huge disappointment.  Definitely not worth the money!</li>
            <li> We gave this to our 6 year old granddaughter and she used it immediately and really loved it.  It was just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is just a hype. The piece that is suppose to put the gems on uses suction and might I say not very good suction.  It is easier to get the tweezers and apply them yourself.  The glitter section is fun but it simply clumps onto to the stickies you apply to your nails or the fake nails.  What I would suggest is buying kid&#x27;s fake nails,nail appliques, and glitter polish.  We used this product Christmas Day and haven&#x27;t used it since.  Honestly, it is not worth the money!  Sorry!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Conair nail glitter/polisher for my granddaughter for Christmas.  It was the only thing she asked for.  It came in a timely manner but we could not get it to work.  I was not successful in finding out how to send it back. Needless to say, our granddaughter was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product was smaller than expected, but I could have gotten over that. What I can not get over is the crappy job it actually does on the girls nails- and the HUGE mess the glitter makes. A total waste of my money. :(</li>
            <li> This product does not perform as it promises.  The glitter does not blow around and attach to the sticky tape put on the fingernail.    Don&#x27;t waste your money.  My daughters used it once and we were very disappointed.  I should have returned it!</li>
