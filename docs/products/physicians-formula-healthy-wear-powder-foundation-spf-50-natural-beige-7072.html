            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try studio fix from mac to see if it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and the powder leaves a nice/natural finish and contains safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in my purse, has really cute packaging, wears well from morning till night, nice frangrance free smell, I rarely purchase cosmetics more than once</li>
            <li>SPF 50 is a strong bonus.</li>
            <li>Love the SPF factor and it&#x27;s so light and clean</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from Southeast Asia and have lightly tanned skin.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how good of a natural coverage it provided for under $10.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage, a soft matte look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never looked orange and my skin does not appear to be affected, but I thought this was a notable heads up for this Natural Beige color.</li>
            <li>I have some mild signs of early aging and the powder doesn&#x27;t cake in the areas of fine wrinkling, though my skin is pretty greasy to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I like this very much.</li>
            <li>Since using this foundation, my facial skin and body skin are now more matched although my face is still about 2-3 shades darker.</li>
            <li>It does not soak into the sponge so most of the product actually goes on your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hardly aware I have on makeup.</li>
            <li>I really wish it worked out for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this makeup.</li>
            <li>Nice, in that other brands pick up every nook and cranny, making me look OLD-</li>
            <li>Plus, it has high SPF.</li>
            <li>Normally, the skin on my face is always 5-6 shades darker than the rest of my body as a result of burning and tanning under the sun.</li>
            <li>Living in a pretty high altitude location in Utah, I start to feel the skin on my face burn starting in April from the sun</li>
            <li>This natural beige color works really well to blend with my natural skin color while also giving me sun protection.</li>
            <li>My skin is light to medium olive (Asian) and it doesn&#x27;t make it look too white or flaky.  </li>
            <li>This showed up in just a couple of days in a clear vinyl zippered case-</li>
            <li>and this foundation has just stopped that completely.</li>
            <li>I noticed lately that it makes my face look more orange than I would like.</li>
            <li>It does not feel cake-y and leaves your skin soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>No other powder sunscreen foundation I&#x27;ve tried (Colorscience, Purmineral, Bare Mineral, etc.) has done this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find make-up that is smooth with this SPF.</li>

            <li> Good quality and price too</li>
            <li> Nice coverage, a soft matte look.  Too bad it made me break out.  I really wish it worked out for me.</li>
            <li> Really liked the packaging. The color is really nice. It covers very well and protects from sun just great. The only down side for me was that it ks a bit heavy. Overall great product and I would sugest buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Southeast Asia and have lightly tanned skin. I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for about 3 months now. This natural beige color works really well to blend with my natural skin color while also giving me sun protection. I have never been burned while using this product. Living in a pretty high altitude location in Utah, I start to feel the skin on my face burn starting in April from the sun and this foundation has just stopped that completely. Normally, the skin on my face is always 5-6 shades darker than the rest of my body as a result of burning and tanning under the sun. Since using this foundation, my facial skin and body skin are now more matched although my face is still about 2-3 shades darker. The only complaint that I have is that when I wash my face before going to bed, the foundation washes off orange. No other powder sunscreen foundation I&#x27;ve tried (Colorscience, Purmineral, Bare Mineral, etc.) has done this. The foundation itself is not orange in the compact and does not rub off orange until at least 2 hours later. I don&#x27;t know if this means the sunblock is working or if some oxidizing effect from one of the ingredients is causing the foundation to change colors, but it makes me somewhat concerned that the orange could be coloring my skin. I&#x27;ve never looked orange and my skin does not appear to be affected, but I thought this was a notable heads up for this Natural Beige color. I will try a slightly lighter shade from PF after this one runs out to see if the orange effect occurs again.</li>
            <li> defintetly a subscriber to this make up i love it</li>
            <li> This was a great powder for when I forget to put on my sunscreen.  My skin is light to medium olive (Asian) and it doesn&#x27;t make it look too white or flaky.  I have some mild signs of early aging and the powder doesn&#x27;t cake in the areas of fine wrinkling, though my skin is pretty greasy to begin with.  The applicator is nice too and distributes the powder evenly.  It does not soak into the sponge so most of the product actually goes on your face.</li>
            <li> good make up and good sun block&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again..I also like the blush and will buy that again as well</li>
            <li> I noticed lately that it makes my face look more orange than I would like. But it was the only powder that would last the majority of the day and not make my face look shiny. I&#x27;m going to try studio fix from mac to see if it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my purse, has really cute packaging, wears well from morning till night, nice frangrance free smell, I rarely purchase cosmetics more than once but this item might be a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> This showed up in just a couple of days in a clear vinyl zippered case- nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;It is so perfect for the color of my skin- one day my DH was watching as I applied it before a bike ride.  He asked me how I could tell it it was covering because he couldn&#x27;t see a difference. Nice, in that other brands pick up every nook and cranny, making me look OLD- No blemishes, no redness, excellent UV protection.</li>
            <li> This is lighter in color than I expected. I would go a little darker the next time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Light/Medium with Yellow undertones. And this appeared a bit pasty on me.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, the product is superb. No dryness &amp; no oiliness occurred and I went&lt;br /&gt;all day without one touch-up!</li>
            <li> I love this make-up! It&#x27;s hard to find make-up that is smooth with this SPF. I tried Neutrogena brand and it was gloppy.</li>
            <li> Perfect coverage for oily skin. Does not cake in pores.</li>
            <li> I like this very much. It&#x27;s affordable and the powder leaves a nice/natural finish and contains safe sunscreens. Plus, it has high SPF. The most bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  Leaves my face orange.</li>
            <li> Great for oily skins.  I don&#x27;t have any problem with product.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how good of a natural coverage it provided for under $10. SPF 50 is a strong bonus. It does not feel cake-y and leaves your skin soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> I really like this makeup. Love the SPF factor and it&#x27;s so light and clean feeling I&#x27;m hardly aware I have on makeup. It provides good coverage.</li>
