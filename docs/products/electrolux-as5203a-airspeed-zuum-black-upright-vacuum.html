    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>PErfect gift for someone too.</li>
            <li>Great suction!!  </li>
            <li>Boy was I impressed!!  </li>
            <li>Great for the $, hope it lasts!</li>
            <li>If you want a great vacume with dyson&#x27;s suction power and can deal with a shorter hose for attachments, this is the one.</li>
            <li>Well this is one time I can honestly say I&#x27;m happy with my impulse buy!</li>
            <li>This thing is great on carpet.</li>
            <li>it was great until I had to start taking the roller off and unwrapping my daughters hair from it before it would work.</li>
            <li>Great suction but a pain to maintain.  </li>
            <li>did fine, no complaints - probably the best use for this thing</li>
            <li>tried it on the wood floors, and loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they were amazed by how good it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The power cord felt surprisingly</li>
            <li>Good price for the power.</li>
            <li>good mats by your doors; take off shoes before tracking dirt all over carpet.</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed, and the carpet looks great now.</li>
            <li>Cleans my carpet very effectively and the Hepa filter makes a huge difference , greatly helps my asthma and allergies .</li>
            <li>Very pleased .</li>
            <li>I was nervous after reading some reviews but most were so great</li>
            <li>It is a good quality cord with a nice rubber feel.</li>
            <li>over a 10 yr. period you&#x27;d probably be better off with hardwoods, laminates or tile and some throw/room rugs instead!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Power was there, the tools worked great, and we were pretty happy...</li>
            <li>engineering here, honestly.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it that much because I also bought the Shark Rotator which I love!!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it that much because I also bought the Shark Rotator which I love!!!</li>
            <li>It cleans well, has good suction, great tools and is actually pretty light.  </li>
            <li>The unit is incredibly maneuverable and the suction is as good as my larger (and heavier) unit.</li>
            <li>lol ;)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tightened the screws many times, which is what customer service</li>
            <li>I have purchased many vacumes over the years.</li>
            <li>Love the Dyson but not the price.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem has been the hose coming undone from its plastic top and bottom.</li>
            <li>If you do, make sure you get a roll of duct tape to keep it all together.</li>
            <li>but I find this convenient for smaller spaces and it does an excellent job of getting close to the baseboards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I don&#x27;t know, but I know I love mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the advertisement that said better than a Dyson</li>
            <li>sure</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve cleaned the filter and made sure nothing was clogged, so that&#x27;s not the problem.</li>
            <li>, the one feature I thought I was going to be most grateful for I could never even use.</li>
            <li>I should be able to plug it in to a hallway outlet between two bedrooms and get them both</li>
            <li>I have owned many vacuums over the years: Oreck, Rainbow, Panasonic, Hoover upright, Kenmore canister.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought a belt at Target and it worked much better.</li>
            <li>think this unit generates a lot more heat than the chincy plastic parts can handle.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>But the suction is sooooooo good, it is still worth the cleaning hassle once in a while.</li>
            <li>Reviews were ok..</li>
            <li>Have no complaints with this vacuum; probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good!</li>
            <li>I think it does a pretty good job though.</li>
            <li>Then to top it off, the tip of the hose doesn&#x27;t fit into the clip, so even when the hose is connected</li>
            <li>I ignored it and so far it was great.</li>
            <li>Cleaning on stairs: seems to be average to below-average at best, but my Kenmore Progressive Canister is easier because I can just use the Powerhead on the stairs and it&#x27;s more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me get straight to the good points</li>
            <li>Assembly was easy.</li>
            <li>Plus, you have to clean the top filter, and replace a HEPA filter every 6 months.</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine told me this was a great vacuum, even better than Dyson.  </li>
            <li>OR better yet, if it came with the vacume in teh first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the dyson is more sturdier.</li>
            <li>If you can pick up your feet, then this cord is fine.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my husband wanted this vacuum and at first I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it I thought that I had found the perfect Vacuum.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job on the cat hair and fine dirt/dust.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job on the cat hair and fine dirt/dust.</li>
            <li>or so.&lt;br /&gt;The hepa filters are available here on amazon, but they are 10 bucks.  </li>
            <li>It has gone from amazing me to how much crud was on my rug to wanting to cry as I realize it is not picking a thing up.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, Target has a 90-day warranty and will give me my money back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The suction is really strong (NOTE you need to keep the filters clean and can emptied)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>- my priority is fantastic suction and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It picked up a lot of dirt, dust, and dog hair, never clogged, and was easy to maneuver and clean.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase and would absolutely buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>This vacuum has great suction power.</li>
            <li>This is a great vacuum for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basic workhorse vacuum great for the price.</li>
            <li>However, I love the power and ease of using this on carpeting and hardwood,  and the other attachments do a great job on corners etc.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) I am not about to go buy a Dyson like my mom has to clean my apartment, but I still need a good vacuum cleaner that gets the job done at a price point I can afford.</li>
            <li>VIP - If you do not keep the filters clean and free of caked on dust the unit will overheat.</li>
            <li>The sleek look got my kid excited to the point they volunteered to vacuum!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;m fairly handy, so I&#x27;ve been able to take apart the plastic housing and rethread the hose back in, but it keeps unscrewing itself.</li>
            <li>seems to be the easiest way to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>and since I have a baby just learning to crawl, clean carpets are my number one concern!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t even clean well.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t even clean well.</li>
            <li>This is a really great vacuum if you&#x27;re looking for a machine to scoot debris across the floor with a powerful brush roller.</li>
            <li>It comes with a cool attachment to clean the furniture and staircase.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy re-vacuuming dust you already vacuumed once, this is a really fun feature.  </li>
            <li>, is this a good vacuum?  </li>
            <li>I loved that vacuum because it had every feature (except auto rewind cord)</li>
            <li>But it quickly overheats again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;ll be paying more for a better vacuum this time around.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong suction even when it&#x27;s almost full and should really be emptied.</li>
            <li>I know the price is appealing, but you&#x27;re better off spending a few more bucks and getting a vac that doesn&#x27;t fall apart every time you try to use it.</li>
            <li>It left nice suction marks on the carpets.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Storage of stair brush: attaches on the main vac (via magnet), does fall off easily.</li>
            <li>, time spent vacuuming, cost to clean carpets once or twice a year, over a 10 yr. period you&#x27;d probably be better off with hardwoods, laminates or tile and some throw/room rugs instead!</li>
            <li>The Zuum is a powerful 12 Amp vacuum that has great section power, it is easy to empty, works great on both carpet and hard floors, and has a neat, easy to access hand tool.</li>
            <li>I am super impressed, especially since I&#x27;ve had previous Eureka&#x27;s that weren&#x27;t up to the tasks I&#x27;ve mentioned.</li>
            <li>This little unit is lighter than the old one and has some pretty impressive suction capability.</li>
            <li>Soft plastic and quickly spinning parts make a LOT of heat, very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>At first I really liked this vacuum.  </li>
            <li>The suction is fine, but that&#x27;s the only good thing about this vacuum.</li>
            <li>I will most likely be returning the unit to the store, which is a shame, because it worked great other than the belt issue!!</li>
            <li>It is pretty powerful, but is not noisy</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get a better cleaner, even one in the Airspeed line, but not this cheap-looking one.</li>
            <li>I love the retractable hose that does not fall off and the other tools are easily stowed.</li>
            <li>I went to work on the living room carpet and got a whole canister full of pet hair and dust on the first go.</li>
            <li>The cup will need to be emptied more frequently than bags, but it is quick and easy to empty right into the trash.</li>
            <li>Plus you get the headache of taking the entire thing apart and making sure</li>
            <li>When you first buy it, yes absolutley.  </li>
            <li>tried it first on the carpets downstairs and the pergo floors.</li>
            <li>Within the first month the belt broke.  </li>
            <li>Bristles started falling out after first use and now they are matted all over my carpet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this vac exactly 1 month, used it twice.</li>
            <li>approach was - buy it, if it doesn&#x27;t work better take it back.</li>
            <li>Left the most highest traffic area looking way brighter and cleaner, than my hoover</li>
            <li>I paid $75 in-store, rather than ordering online for a higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vacuumed a rental which had pets and got 7canisters of hair and dirt off the first floor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjustments</li>
            <li>the job is the first line of defense against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to do that with only removing six screws.</li>
            <li>The vacuum now works better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am able to vacuum in front of my baby and my toddler.</li>
            <li>others have mentioned, the unit does overheat when you have to vacuum more then one room.  </li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for this issue, I&#x27;d love this vacuum.</li>
            <li>Let me say that I love this vacuum.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how completely I was able to take it apart.</li>
            <li>I did 2 rooms and emptied it as it was full of new carpet fuzz and DIRT.</li>
            <li>But I have never bought a vacume that had this much suction power right out of the box.</li>
            <li>The upholstery brush (which I was very excited about when I bought the vacuum) worked once for me.</li>
            <li>Yes, small holding tube but easy to manage and assembled quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Nice little run there, but I can&#x27;t say it was entirely worth it.</li>
            <li>I was really quite pleased with the vacuum for the first six months of use.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic suction and easy to empty and store, very lightweight.</li>
            <li>That is pretty much the type of dirt and situation you have in your carpeting; you just don&#x27;t see it as fast, since most people don&#x27;t have white</li>
            <li>but this vacuum is perfect for small apartments with pets!</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this vacume right now.</li>
            <li>you would not believe it - powerful suction like no other machine I have owned - would not hesitate to recommend this Eureka - well worth the money</li>
            <li>I feel kind of silly reviewing a vacuum cleaner, but this is the absolute best one I&#x27;ve ever owned and as such it deserves</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain she is bound to have something to say about it</li>
            <li>Overall, for less than $100 this unit is a great value.</li>
            <li>It will grab big stuff, but without it the fine dust and dirt will go flying in the air.  </li>
            <li>you never need to use the tools, and simply want to push it around the floor, the suction is fine.  </li>
            <li>Purchased Vacuum approx 3 months ago and it worked fine during that time.</li>
            <li>When emptying the canister you can really see the fine particulates the vacuum captures.</li>
            <li>While it worked great for a few weeks, it then started overheating on a regular basis and I couldn&#x27;t finish vacuuming even one room</li>
            <li>I thought I would take a gamble with my money since it wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Because I am so ham - handed, I prefer the very cheapest model of the Airspeed which has the innards permanent placed in the cannister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did however have to dismantle the whole thing because I have two dogs</li>
            <li>My home shop has a powerful air compressor that I use to blow out the canister and filter(s) after nearly every use, this helps maintain pick-up ability a lot.</li>
            <li>At the price, it does what it does very well</li>
            <li>Prior to this vacuum I had a cheap $30 vacuum that work great and never had issues, only thing I ever had to replace was the belt and bags</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic vacuum - gets so much dirt</li>
            <li>When attempt to pull / extend the hose, the light weight vacuum cleaner starts rolling forwards.</li>
            <li>described in the original review below, the vacuum stopped working after 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I clean this vacuum after every use, including the filters as recommended on the manual.  </li>
            <li>I use to love Eureka products but they have gone to the dark side.</li>
            <li>Due to the lay out of my house, these are all things I can live with (afterall, does it take more than 30 seconds to move your cord from one room to the next?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And by the way, replacing filters on a bagless HEPA vacuum is completely normal and much more eco friendly than having something you have to replace bags on, it&#x27;s of the reasons the cost of the vacuum is low.</li>
            <li>starters, the main canister falls off all the time.  </li>
            <li>I believe there is a wiring or motor issue with this particular model that needs addressing by Eureka.</li>
            <li>I messed around pulling out the extension hose and putting it back in to make sure it was in all the way, turning it different ways and whatever else I could think of assuming I was just not clipping it in correctly.  </li>
            <li>My most recent Dirt Devil stopped picking anything up and over the last couple months</li>
            <li>One of my main complaints with products these days is how disposable they are.</li>
            <li>Ours is used weekly on the main floor of our house (about 1,100 sq ft.).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job, gets jammed easily and the magnetic clasp for it is weak.</li>
            <li>Open the top of the vacuum and dump the dirt inside, and you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li>So now I get to fork out more money for another vacuum because I cant find a friggin roller replacement online for my vacuum.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Zuum.</li>
            <li>We have high winds in the spring and the autumn.</li>
            <li>The screw that came with this vacuum cleaner never fit properly after many many attempts.</li>
            <li>It cleaned up closer to the edges than the dyson, went under the furniture a little more too because it is not has high</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d noticed I was sneezing a lot more often and felt like being inside my home was just dusty all the time but couldn&#x27;t figure out why because I keep things really clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be nice to have hard floors and some scatter or room rugs which could be washed as needed.</li>
            <li>Add in the physical job of cleaning the other filters at the top of the canister, which need cleaned on a insanely frequent basis, and you end up with an appliance which is more trouble than its worth.</li>
            <li>I keep a pretty clean home, vacuum regularly, dust, no pets, etc</li>
            <li>a few more strokes, and my work is thoroughly done...</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t too fun when it&#x27;s 10 degrees and a blizzard outside, otherwise do it in the garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also extremely hard to clean and there&#x27;s a build-up in the tubing that I can&#x27;t reach to clean out.</li>
            <li>One of our cats (the male), sheds a lot more than the other cat, so he really needs it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s be fairly durable, surviving 2 moves, a fall down the stairs and other mishaps</li>
            <li>also fairly certain this vacuum attracts more dust on the outside of the vacuum than in the canister itself.  </li>
            <li>Perfect little vacuum for an apartment or small house.</li>
            <li>The belt breaks constantly even when being diligent in making sure you change the setting from low carpet to bare floor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the manual, the troubleshooting guide, even called Eureka Customer Service who said I would have to purchase a new hose.</li>
            <li>I live on a dirt road and the yards are dirt --</li>
            <li>Long story short, I am now in an apt after moving out of our house and needed another vacuum.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be a nice little vacuum</li>
            <li>you factor the cost of replacing carpeting, buying vacuums, time spent vacuuming, cost to clean carpets once or twice a year,</li>
            <li>Even if this thing only lasts me 6 months or a year, the fact that it is ridiculously more efficient than any other inexpensive vacuum makes it well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>You could nearly buy a whole new vacuum for that much money.  </li>
            <li>Great suction , the apartment complex I recently moved into stated they had the unit &amp;#34;professionaly&amp;#34; cleaned before I moved in , I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of dirt and hair this vacuum pulled out of the carpet .</li>
            <li>This is the FIRST vacuum I&#x27;ve ever owned that lifts up ALL the hair on my carpet without a problem.</li>
            <li>This was my first vacuum purchase, ever.  </li>
            <li>Unlike others, I cannot compare this to a Dyson (old or new Dyson).</li>
            <li>Sometimes if you let it sit for an hour or more, it cools down enough to use again.</li>
            <li>vacuum is SO EASY to empty.</li>
            <li>I still wanted a powerful vacuum that did not lose suction, but now that I live in an apartment instead of a 2 story house I didn&#x27;t need all the extra features and didn&#x27;t want to pay for features I wasn&#x27;t going to use.</li>
            <li>I tried continuing to vacuum after cleaning the vacuum and more dust shot out of the vacuum and my entire main level was clouded in dust.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t review this vacuum for large homes.</li>
            <li>The HEPA filter in mine plugs off completely every 3 months</li>
            <li>Complete garbage.</li>
            <li>The machine was unbearably loud from the start.</li>

            <li>Speaking of professional carpet cleaning, I had</li>
            <li>I was amazed how soft my carpet was, I&#x27;d forgotten what it was supposed to feel like.</li>
            <li>Or, rather, frequent vacuuming with a machine that does</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>The cord is very short which although not a huge deal but seems like something a company that&#x27;s been making vacuums for many years would consider.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While its a good vacuum, its not great and heres why.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like bothering with customer service, and I really need to vacuum my floors.</li>
            <li>This vacuum is very serviceable.</li>
            <li>It also picks up fine dirt, little rocks and other crud we bring in after our outdoor adventures, it&#x27;s easy to empty, has a washable filter, and somehow manages to maintain</li>
            <li>We live in a relatively small apartment and having a vacuum that had a relatively small footprint was great.  </li>
            <li>In short, New Hoover did not suck up as much dirt as a 3-year-old Eureka.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hose on the back</li>
            <li>If you move the vac too quickly or even bump it into the wall ever so slightly, it will fall off.</li>
            <li>I have had a Dyson for several years, and granted while it is older, their slogan is \\&quot;never lose sucction\\&quot; - right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little stair vac attachment that connects to the front of the handle by a magnet also falls out occasionally, I can deal with that because it clips on easily.  </li>
            <li>Low and high carpets.</li>
            <li>I like the option to choose between the &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27; carpet settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And for the last month, I have spent just as much time trying to keep the vacuum clean as I have actually cleaning my house.</li>
            <li>This would be ideal for a small apartment but definitely not good enough for a 1700 sf house.</li>
            <li>This vacuum gets up more dirt in one vacuuming than I have gotten up with other, more expensive, machines in six months.</li>
            <li>I managed to get the belt in place, put the unit back together, and again within 10 minutes of use with the new belt, it broke again.  </li>
            <li>With four boys and a dog, I&#x27;m looking into a new vacuum.</li>
            <li>Bought this vacuum at Target a little over a year ago and have used it pretty much every week.  </li>
            <li>The motor whistles too which isn&#x27;t a very promising sign that the vacuum will be around very long.</li>
            <li>Really, if you use a quality vacuum, it&#x27;s going into the vacuum cleaner bag; you&#x27;re just not looking at it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never spent a lot of money on vacuums, I&#x27;m used to buying a really inexpensive vacuum once a year just because I don&#x27;t have the need for anything big and fancy.</li>
            <li>So when I saw on the box that this little eureka supposedly cleans  as well or better than a Dyson DC24, I totally fell victim to the marketing and bought this immediately.</li>
            <li>Anyway, saw this vacuum in a Target ad and read some reviews and thought it was worth the purchase even though it was more than the $20 that I usually pay for vacuums (I swear I&#x27;m not cheap!</li>
            <li>I previously had a Dyson which I thought worked very well and was well built but didn&#x27;t want to drop $400 on a new vac</li>
            <li>you need a carpet cleaning machine, try that Big Green Clean Machine (rental at Lowe&#x27;s to try it out).</li>
            <li>you need a carpet cleaning machine, try that Big Green Clean Machine (rental at Lowe&#x27;s to try it out).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this little vacuum to anyone looking for a powerful, affordable vacuum.</li>
            <li>two cats, I bought a Furminator and used gently at least once a week on the cats has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I literally had to place my foot on the unit, pull the belt out as far as it would go, and then force the brush through before the belt snapped back into place.  </li>
            <li>It actually was stronger than my dyson (my dyson is veryyyy old though).</li>
            <li>The floor brush does continuously spin even when upright or when using the tools, so I just recommend turning the floor brush to the \\&quot;bare floor\\&quot; position when using the tools so that you do not burn you carpet</li>
            <li>You do have to empty it often, or the dirt backs up and cleaning the unit is a real pain.  </li>
            <li>The canister is extremely stiff to turn open (to empty the dirt) and has cracked across the top.  </li>
            <li>I have had this vacuum cleaner for a year and mine nearly completely falls apart every time i try to move it.</li>
            <li>When I go to vacuum the piece in front (dust cup)  falls off completely while vacuuming.</li>

            <li>The \\&quot;Shark Rotator Professional 3 in 1\\&quot; Vacuum.</li>
            <li>It takes less than 15 minutes to soak them in hot water and a drop of dishwashing liquid in a bucket.</li>
            <li>The next day when using the Zuum, it had a pretty full canister after the first use so it suprised me what the other vacuum had left behind.</li>
            <li>Not user friendly in the least.  </li>
            <li>That is how much dirt and dust and dog hair and other stuff was stuck in my carpet.</li>
            <li>The only downside so far is that the cord is only 25 feet.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the most frustrating vacuums I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I empty the canister every time I vacuum the whole house</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m searching for a new power cord today because years of wrapping it around the back has worn the original one thin.</li>
            <li>You have to constantly empty the canister or it will no longer suck even though the canister is less than 1/2 full.</li>
            <li>Hard surfaces harbor less bacteria and are much easier and cheaper to keep clean, than carpeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only have bare floors upstairs</li>
            <li>I vacuumed the carpets once, cleaned the canister and vacuumed a second time and barely got</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get a full room done and it take at least an hour before it&#x27;ll start again.</li>
            <li>do disassemble mine every other month and do a full cleaning of the internal parts, HEPA and other pieces to ensure it keeps working.</li>
            <li>Now, this failure did not happen under my own use, but I doubt the wife used it for more than several seconds after the failure - because it makes a terrible grinding sound - but it quickly became damaged beyond repair because of the melted plastic...  </li>
            <li>That way you can sort of &amp;#34;aim&amp;#34; the debris into a general area of the floor as you scoot it around with the vacuum&#x27;s roller, and then use the broom and dustpan to remove the debris from the floor.</li>
            <li>have not used the attachments, nor used the vacuum on the bare floors.</li>
            <li>We have all of 790 square feet of apartment and apparently being used 20 or so times was too much for the little guy.  </li>
            <li>I used the u belt but not sure if its the right one...seems to stay on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The retractable hose is clunky and mine never would stay attached to unit, a real annoyance when falling in front of my feet every 10 seconds or less.</li>
            <li>It broke down into small enough pieces that I was able to just wash it in my kitchen sink and dry all the parts in my dish rack.</li>
            <li>The good news is that amazon sells them, the bad news is that they are 25 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> PErfect gift for someone too.</li>
            <li> Great suction!!  </li>
            <li> Boy was I impressed!!  </li>
            <li> Great for the $, hope it lasts!</li>
            <li> If you want a great vacume with dyson&#x27;s suction power and can deal with a shorter hose for attachments, this is the one.</li>
            <li> Well this is one time I can honestly say I&#x27;m happy with my impulse buy!</li>
            <li> This thing is great on carpet.</li>
            <li> it was great until I had to start taking the roller off and unwrapping my daughters hair from it before it would work.</li>
            <li> Great suction but a pain to maintain.  </li>
            <li> did fine, no complaints - probably the best use for this thing</li>
            <li> tried it on the wood floors, and loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they were amazed by how good it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The power cord felt surprisingly</li>
            <li> Good price for the power.</li>
            <li> good mats by your doors; take off shoes before tracking dirt all over carpet.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed, and the carpet looks great now.</li>
            <li> Cleans my carpet very effectively and the Hepa filter makes a huge difference , greatly helps my asthma and allergies .</li>
            <li> Very pleased .</li>
            <li> I was nervous after reading some reviews but most were so great</li>
            <li> It is a good quality cord with a nice rubber feel.</li>
            <li> over a 10 yr. period you&#x27;d probably be better off with hardwoods, laminates or tile and some throw/room rugs instead!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Power was there, the tools worked great, and we were pretty happy...</li>
            <li> engineering here, honestly.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that much because I also bought the Shark Rotator which I love!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that much because I also bought the Shark Rotator which I love!!!</li>
            <li> It cleans well, has good suction, great tools and is actually pretty light.  </li>
            <li> The unit is incredibly maneuverable and the suction is as good as my larger (and heavier) unit.</li>
            <li> lol ;)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tightened the screws many times, which is what customer service</li>
            <li> I have purchased many vacumes over the years.</li>
            <li> Love the Dyson but not the price.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem has been the hose coming undone from its plastic top and bottom.</li>
            <li> If you do, make sure you get a roll of duct tape to keep it all together.</li>
            <li> but I find this convenient for smaller spaces and it does an excellent job of getting close to the baseboards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I don&#x27;t know, but I know I love mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the advertisement that said better than a Dyson</li>
            <li> sure</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve cleaned the filter and made sure nothing was clogged, so that&#x27;s not the problem.</li>
            <li> , the one feature I thought I was going to be most grateful for I could never even use.</li>
            <li> I should be able to plug it in to a hallway outlet between two bedrooms and get them both</li>
            <li> I have owned many vacuums over the years: Oreck, Rainbow, Panasonic, Hoover upright, Kenmore canister.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought a belt at Target and it worked much better.</li>
            <li> think this unit generates a lot more heat than the chincy plastic parts can handle.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> But the suction is sooooooo good, it is still worth the cleaning hassle once in a while.</li>
            <li> Reviews were ok..</li>
            <li> Have no complaints with this vacuum; probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good!</li>
            <li> I think it does a pretty good job though.</li>
            <li> Then to top it off, the tip of the hose doesn&#x27;t fit into the clip, so even when the hose is connected</li>
            <li> I ignored it and so far it was great.</li>
            <li> Cleaning on stairs: seems to be average to below-average at best, but my Kenmore Progressive Canister is easier because I can just use the Powerhead on the stairs and it&#x27;s more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me get straight to the good points</li>
            <li> Assembly was easy.</li>
            <li> Plus, you have to clean the top filter, and replace a HEPA filter every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me this was a great vacuum, even better than Dyson.  </li>
            <li> OR better yet, if it came with the vacume in teh first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the dyson is more sturdier.</li>
            <li> If you can pick up your feet, then this cord is fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my husband wanted this vacuum and at first I was impressed.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it I thought that I had found the perfect Vacuum.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job on the cat hair and fine dirt/dust.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job on the cat hair and fine dirt/dust.</li>
            <li> or so.&lt;br /&gt;The hepa filters are available here on amazon, but they are 10 bucks.  </li>
            <li> It has gone from amazing me to how much crud was on my rug to wanting to cry as I realize it is not picking a thing up.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, Target has a 90-day warranty and will give me my money back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The suction is really strong (NOTE you need to keep the filters clean and can emptied)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> - my priority is fantastic suction and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It picked up a lot of dirt, dust, and dog hair, never clogged, and was easy to maneuver and clean.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase and would absolutely buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> This vacuum has great suction power.</li>
            <li> This is a great vacuum for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basic workhorse vacuum great for the price.</li>
            <li> However, I love the power and ease of using this on carpeting and hardwood,  and the other attachments do a great job on corners etc.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) I am not about to go buy a Dyson like my mom has to clean my apartment, but I still need a good vacuum cleaner that gets the job done at a price point I can afford.</li>
            <li> VIP - If you do not keep the filters clean and free of caked on dust the unit will overheat.</li>
            <li> The sleek look got my kid excited to the point they volunteered to vacuum!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;m fairly handy, so I&#x27;ve been able to take apart the plastic housing and rethread the hose back in, but it keeps unscrewing itself.</li>
            <li> seems to be the easiest way to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li> and since I have a baby just learning to crawl, clean carpets are my number one concern!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t even clean well.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t even clean well.</li>
            <li> This is a really great vacuum if you&#x27;re looking for a machine to scoot debris across the floor with a powerful brush roller.</li>
            <li> It comes with a cool attachment to clean the furniture and staircase.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> If you enjoy re-vacuuming dust you already vacuumed once, this is a really fun feature.  </li>
            <li> , is this a good vacuum?  </li>
            <li> I loved that vacuum because it had every feature (except auto rewind cord)</li>
            <li> But it quickly overheats again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;ll be paying more for a better vacuum this time around.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong suction even when it&#x27;s almost full and should really be emptied.</li>
            <li> I know the price is appealing, but you&#x27;re better off spending a few more bucks and getting a vac that doesn&#x27;t fall apart every time you try to use it.</li>
            <li> It left nice suction marks on the carpets.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Storage of stair brush: attaches on the main vac (via magnet), does fall off easily.</li>
            <li> , time spent vacuuming, cost to clean carpets once or twice a year, over a 10 yr. period you&#x27;d probably be better off with hardwoods, laminates or tile and some throw/room rugs instead!</li>
            <li> The Zuum is a powerful 12 Amp vacuum that has great section power, it is easy to empty, works great on both carpet and hard floors, and has a neat, easy to access hand tool.</li>
            <li> I am super impressed, especially since I&#x27;ve had previous Eureka&#x27;s that weren&#x27;t up to the tasks I&#x27;ve mentioned.</li>
            <li> This little unit is lighter than the old one and has some pretty impressive suction capability.</li>
            <li> Soft plastic and quickly spinning parts make a LOT of heat, very quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> At first I really liked this vacuum.  </li>
            <li> The suction is fine, but that&#x27;s the only good thing about this vacuum.</li>
            <li> I will most likely be returning the unit to the store, which is a shame, because it worked great other than the belt issue!!</li>
            <li> It is pretty powerful, but is not noisy</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get a better cleaner, even one in the Airspeed line, but not this cheap-looking one.</li>
            <li> I love the retractable hose that does not fall off and the other tools are easily stowed.</li>
            <li> I went to work on the living room carpet and got a whole canister full of pet hair and dust on the first go.</li>
            <li> The cup will need to be emptied more frequently than bags, but it is quick and easy to empty right into the trash.</li>
            <li> Plus you get the headache of taking the entire thing apart and making sure</li>
            <li> When you first buy it, yes absolutley.  </li>
            <li> tried it first on the carpets downstairs and the pergo floors.</li>
            <li> Within the first month the belt broke.  </li>
            <li> Bristles started falling out after first use and now they are matted all over my carpet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this vac exactly 1 month, used it twice.</li>
            <li> approach was - buy it, if it doesn&#x27;t work better take it back.</li>
            <li> Left the most highest traffic area looking way brighter and cleaner, than my hoover</li>
            <li> I paid $75 in-store, rather than ordering online for a higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vacuumed a rental which had pets and got 7canisters of hair and dirt off the first floor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjustments</li>
            <li> the job is the first line of defense against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to do that with only removing six screws.</li>
            <li> The vacuum now works better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am able to vacuum in front of my baby and my toddler.</li>
            <li> others have mentioned, the unit does overheat when you have to vacuum more then one room.  </li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this issue, I&#x27;d love this vacuum.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I love this vacuum.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how completely I was able to take it apart.</li>
            <li> I did 2 rooms and emptied it as it was full of new carpet fuzz and DIRT.</li>
            <li> But I have never bought a vacume that had this much suction power right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The upholstery brush (which I was very excited about when I bought the vacuum) worked once for me.</li>
            <li> Yes, small holding tube but easy to manage and assembled quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Nice little run there, but I can&#x27;t say it was entirely worth it.</li>
            <li> I was really quite pleased with the vacuum for the first six months of use.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic suction and easy to empty and store, very lightweight.</li>
            <li> That is pretty much the type of dirt and situation you have in your carpeting; you just don&#x27;t see it as fast, since most people don&#x27;t have white</li>
            <li> but this vacuum is perfect for small apartments with pets!</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this vacume right now.</li>
            <li> you would not believe it - powerful suction like no other machine I have owned - would not hesitate to recommend this Eureka - well worth the money</li>
            <li> I feel kind of silly reviewing a vacuum cleaner, but this is the absolute best one I&#x27;ve ever owned and as such it deserves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain she is bound to have something to say about it</li>
            <li> Overall, for less than $100 this unit is a great value.</li>
            <li> It will grab big stuff, but without it the fine dust and dirt will go flying in the air.  </li>
            <li> you never need to use the tools, and simply want to push it around the floor, the suction is fine.  </li>
            <li> Purchased Vacuum approx 3 months ago and it worked fine during that time.</li>
            <li> When emptying the canister you can really see the fine particulates the vacuum captures.</li>
            <li> While it worked great for a few weeks, it then started overheating on a regular basis and I couldn&#x27;t finish vacuuming even one room</li>
            <li> I thought I would take a gamble with my money since it wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Because I am so ham - handed, I prefer the very cheapest model of the Airspeed which has the innards permanent placed in the cannister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did however have to dismantle the whole thing because I have two dogs</li>
            <li> My home shop has a powerful air compressor that I use to blow out the canister and filter(s) after nearly every use, this helps maintain pick-up ability a lot.</li>
            <li> At the price, it does what it does very well</li>
            <li> Prior to this vacuum I had a cheap $30 vacuum that work great and never had issues, only thing I ever had to replace was the belt and bags</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic vacuum - gets so much dirt</li>
            <li> When attempt to pull / extend the hose, the light weight vacuum cleaner starts rolling forwards.</li>
            <li> described in the original review below, the vacuum stopped working after 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I clean this vacuum after every use, including the filters as recommended on the manual.  </li>
            <li> I use to love Eureka products but they have gone to the dark side.</li>
            <li> Due to the lay out of my house, these are all things I can live with (afterall, does it take more than 30 seconds to move your cord from one room to the next?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And by the way, replacing filters on a bagless HEPA vacuum is completely normal and much more eco friendly than having something you have to replace bags on, it&#x27;s of the reasons the cost of the vacuum is low.</li>
            <li> starters, the main canister falls off all the time.  </li>
            <li> I believe there is a wiring or motor issue with this particular model that needs addressing by Eureka.</li>
            <li> I messed around pulling out the extension hose and putting it back in to make sure it was in all the way, turning it different ways and whatever else I could think of assuming I was just not clipping it in correctly.  </li>
            <li> My most recent Dirt Devil stopped picking anything up and over the last couple months</li>
            <li> One of my main complaints with products these days is how disposable they are.</li>
            <li> Ours is used weekly on the main floor of our house (about 1,100 sq ft.).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a good job, gets jammed easily and the magnetic clasp for it is weak.</li>
            <li> Open the top of the vacuum and dump the dirt inside, and you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> So now I get to fork out more money for another vacuum because I cant find a friggin roller replacement online for my vacuum.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Zuum.</li>
            <li> We have high winds in the spring and the autumn.</li>
            <li> The screw that came with this vacuum cleaner never fit properly after many many attempts.</li>
            <li> It cleaned up closer to the edges than the dyson, went under the furniture a little more too because it is not has high</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d noticed I was sneezing a lot more often and felt like being inside my home was just dusty all the time but couldn&#x27;t figure out why because I keep things really clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be nice to have hard floors and some scatter or room rugs which could be washed as needed.</li>
            <li> Add in the physical job of cleaning the other filters at the top of the canister, which need cleaned on a insanely frequent basis, and you end up with an appliance which is more trouble than its worth.</li>
            <li> I keep a pretty clean home, vacuum regularly, dust, no pets, etc</li>
            <li> a few more strokes, and my work is thoroughly done...</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t too fun when it&#x27;s 10 degrees and a blizzard outside, otherwise do it in the garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also extremely hard to clean and there&#x27;s a build-up in the tubing that I can&#x27;t reach to clean out.</li>
            <li> One of our cats (the male), sheds a lot more than the other cat, so he really needs it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s be fairly durable, surviving 2 moves, a fall down the stairs and other mishaps</li>
            <li> also fairly certain this vacuum attracts more dust on the outside of the vacuum than in the canister itself.  </li>
            <li> Perfect little vacuum for an apartment or small house.</li>
            <li> The belt breaks constantly even when being diligent in making sure you change the setting from low carpet to bare floor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the manual, the troubleshooting guide, even called Eureka Customer Service who said I would have to purchase a new hose.</li>
            <li> I live on a dirt road and the yards are dirt --</li>
            <li> Long story short, I am now in an apt after moving out of our house and needed another vacuum.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a nice little vacuum</li>
            <li> you factor the cost of replacing carpeting, buying vacuums, time spent vacuuming, cost to clean carpets once or twice a year,</li>
            <li> Even if this thing only lasts me 6 months or a year, the fact that it is ridiculously more efficient than any other inexpensive vacuum makes it well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> You could nearly buy a whole new vacuum for that much money.  </li>
            <li> Great suction , the apartment complex I recently moved into stated they had the unit &amp;#34;professionaly&amp;#34; cleaned before I moved in , I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of dirt and hair this vacuum pulled out of the carpet .</li>
            <li> This is the FIRST vacuum I&#x27;ve ever owned that lifts up ALL the hair on my carpet without a problem.</li>
            <li> This was my first vacuum purchase, ever.  </li>
            <li> Unlike others, I cannot compare this to a Dyson (old or new Dyson).</li>
            <li> Sometimes if you let it sit for an hour or more, it cools down enough to use again.</li>
            <li> vacuum is SO EASY to empty.</li>
            <li> I still wanted a powerful vacuum that did not lose suction, but now that I live in an apartment instead of a 2 story house I didn&#x27;t need all the extra features and didn&#x27;t want to pay for features I wasn&#x27;t going to use.</li>
            <li> I tried continuing to vacuum after cleaning the vacuum and more dust shot out of the vacuum and my entire main level was clouded in dust.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t review this vacuum for large homes.</li>
            <li> The HEPA filter in mine plugs off completely every 3 months</li>
            <li> Complete garbage.</li>
            <li> The machine was unbearably loud from the start.</li>
            <li> the fixed ring at the bottom of the hose came off because it&#x27;s glue did not hold.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;professional\\&quot; vacuums didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ve moved twice and had to do a complete home run without issue.</li>
            <li> So far it works like a champ (For under $100 over 3 years -</li>
            <li> Totally disassemble dirt collection bin and place the whole thing in the dishwasher;</li>
            <li> old B...ll conked out on me</li>
            <li> Not overly loud when powered on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Speaking of professional carpet cleaning, I had</li>
            <li> Speaking of professional carpet cleaning, I had</li>
            <li> I was amazed how soft my carpet was, I&#x27;d forgotten what it was supposed to feel like.</li>
            <li> Or, rather, frequent vacuuming with a machine that does</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> The cord is very short which although not a huge deal but seems like something a company that&#x27;s been making vacuums for many years would consider.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While its a good vacuum, its not great and heres why.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like bothering with customer service, and I really need to vacuum my floors.</li>
            <li> This vacuum is very serviceable.</li>
            <li> It also picks up fine dirt, little rocks and other crud we bring in after our outdoor adventures, it&#x27;s easy to empty, has a washable filter, and somehow manages to maintain</li>
            <li> We live in a relatively small apartment and having a vacuum that had a relatively small footprint was great.  </li>
            <li> In short, New Hoover did not suck up as much dirt as a 3-year-old Eureka.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hose on the back</li>
            <li> If you move the vac too quickly or even bump it into the wall ever so slightly, it will fall off.</li>
            <li> I have had a Dyson for several years, and granted while it is older, their slogan is \\&quot;never lose sucction\\&quot; - right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little stair vac attachment that connects to the front of the handle by a magnet also falls out occasionally, I can deal with that because it clips on easily.  </li>
            <li> Low and high carpets.</li>
            <li> I like the option to choose between the &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27; carpet settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And for the last month, I have spent just as much time trying to keep the vacuum clean as I have actually cleaning my house.</li>
            <li> This would be ideal for a small apartment but definitely not good enough for a 1700 sf house.</li>
            <li> This vacuum gets up more dirt in one vacuuming than I have gotten up with other, more expensive, machines in six months.</li>
            <li> I managed to get the belt in place, put the unit back together, and again within 10 minutes of use with the new belt, it broke again.  </li>
            <li> With four boys and a dog, I&#x27;m looking into a new vacuum.</li>
            <li> Bought this vacuum at Target a little over a year ago and have used it pretty much every week.  </li>
            <li> The motor whistles too which isn&#x27;t a very promising sign that the vacuum will be around very long.</li>
            <li> Really, if you use a quality vacuum, it&#x27;s going into the vacuum cleaner bag; you&#x27;re just not looking at it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never spent a lot of money on vacuums, I&#x27;m used to buying a really inexpensive vacuum once a year just because I don&#x27;t have the need for anything big and fancy.</li>
            <li> So when I saw on the box that this little eureka supposedly cleans  as well or better than a Dyson DC24, I totally fell victim to the marketing and bought this immediately.</li>
            <li> Anyway, saw this vacuum in a Target ad and read some reviews and thought it was worth the purchase even though it was more than the $20 that I usually pay for vacuums (I swear I&#x27;m not cheap!</li>
            <li> I previously had a Dyson which I thought worked very well and was well built but didn&#x27;t want to drop $400 on a new vac</li>
            <li> you need a carpet cleaning machine, try that Big Green Clean Machine (rental at Lowe&#x27;s to try it out).</li>
            <li> you need a carpet cleaning machine, try that Big Green Clean Machine (rental at Lowe&#x27;s to try it out).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this little vacuum to anyone looking for a powerful, affordable vacuum.</li>
            <li> two cats, I bought a Furminator and used gently at least once a week on the cats has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I literally had to place my foot on the unit, pull the belt out as far as it would go, and then force the brush through before the belt snapped back into place.  </li>
            <li> It actually was stronger than my dyson (my dyson is veryyyy old though).</li>
            <li> The floor brush does continuously spin even when upright or when using the tools, so I just recommend turning the floor brush to the \\&quot;bare floor\\&quot; position when using the tools so that you do not burn you carpet</li>
            <li> You do have to empty it often, or the dirt backs up and cleaning the unit is a real pain.  </li>
            <li> The canister is extremely stiff to turn open (to empty the dirt) and has cracked across the top.  </li>
            <li> I have had this vacuum cleaner for a year and mine nearly completely falls apart every time i try to move it.</li>
            <li> When I go to vacuum the piece in front (dust cup)  falls off completely while vacuuming.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Shark Rotator Professional 3 in 1\\&quot; Vacuum.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Shark Rotator Professional 3 in 1\\&quot; Vacuum.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 15 minutes to soak them in hot water and a drop of dishwashing liquid in a bucket.</li>
            <li> The next day when using the Zuum, it had a pretty full canister after the first use so it suprised me what the other vacuum had left behind.</li>
            <li> Not user friendly in the least.  </li>
            <li> That is how much dirt and dust and dog hair and other stuff was stuck in my carpet.</li>
            <li> The only downside so far is that the cord is only 25 feet.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the most frustrating vacuums I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I empty the canister every time I vacuum the whole house</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m searching for a new power cord today because years of wrapping it around the back has worn the original one thin.</li>
            <li> You have to constantly empty the canister or it will no longer suck even though the canister is less than 1/2 full.</li>
            <li> Hard surfaces harbor less bacteria and are much easier and cheaper to keep clean, than carpeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have bare floors upstairs</li>
            <li> I vacuumed the carpets once, cleaned the canister and vacuumed a second time and barely got</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get a full room done and it take at least an hour before it&#x27;ll start again.</li>
            <li> do disassemble mine every other month and do a full cleaning of the internal parts, HEPA and other pieces to ensure it keeps working.</li>
            <li> Now, this failure did not happen under my own use, but I doubt the wife used it for more than several seconds after the failure - because it makes a terrible grinding sound - but it quickly became damaged beyond repair because of the melted plastic...  </li>
            <li> That way you can sort of &amp;#34;aim&amp;#34; the debris into a general area of the floor as you scoot it around with the vacuum&#x27;s roller, and then use the broom and dustpan to remove the debris from the floor.</li>
            <li> have not used the attachments, nor used the vacuum on the bare floors.</li>
            <li> We have all of 790 square feet of apartment and apparently being used 20 or so times was too much for the little guy.  </li>
            <li> I used the u belt but not sure if its the right one...seems to stay on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The retractable hose is clunky and mine never would stay attached to unit, a real annoyance when falling in front of my feet every 10 seconds or less.</li>
            <li> It broke down into small enough pieces that I was able to just wash it in my kitchen sink and dry all the parts in my dish rack.</li>
            <li> The good news is that amazon sells them, the bad news is that they are 25 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need to  vacuum ten times over the same area in the vain hope it will actually lift the critter fur-</li>
            <li> And if you want the vacuum to actually function, ALL of this stuff has to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I told him I&#x27;d cleaned the filter, and he opened the vacuum to show me a second filter that I hadn&#x27;t noticed before.  </li>
            <li> We could only vacuum one room at a time with it.</li>
            <li> For my part, however, this will be the last Eureka vacuum cleaner I ever buy.</li>
            <li> If you want the debris to actually end up IN the vacuum, you should probably augment your purchase with a broom and dustpan.</li>
            <li> The roller cover, which is the actual face of the vacuum</li>
            <li> The hose is very short, and EVERY TIME I use the tools, which I do every time I vacuum, the hose comes out of the vacuum cleaner and/or</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM CLEANER.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be out a hundred dollar bill and you still won&#x27;t have a vacuum cleaner...</li>
            <li> This vacuum will not work without the hepa filter.  </li>
            <li> This adds up to 115 dollars a year in parts to keep your vacuum going.  </li>
            <li> and we vacuum about twice a month.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s been 9 months and the vacuum won&#x27;t work at all, customer service states that we didn&#x27;t use the vacuum correctly (without any proof by the way) and that the three year warranty is void and they cannot help me.  </li>
            <li> , I had that vacuum for 6 years.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions for cleaning the vacuum, filters, etc., but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> Followed all of the instructions for cleaning the vacuum, filters, etc.</li>
            <li> The day before I got this vacuum, I vacuumed the apartment with my neighbors vacuum.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this vacuum..</li>
            <li> As in you touch the vacuum to move it and the canister takes a nose dive to the floor.  </li>
            <li> here we are today, about two years after buying a vacuum that I use about once a month.  </li>
            <li> I brought it over to a friends who&#x27;s vacuum stopped working</li>
            <li> This vacuum cleaner picks up well but overheats and shuts off after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this vacuum.</li>
            <li> The hose will pull the vacuum along with it.</li>
            <li> would not recommend this vacuum to a friend.</li>
            <li> Lasted one vacuum before the belt died and smelled like it melted.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the hose extension yet, and my wife has not yet tried the vacuum.</li>
            <li> Listen, I had a Kirby vacuum cleaner demonstrator/salesman come to my house and HE EVEN TRIED TO PUT THE SCREW INTO MY VACUUM CLEANER!</li>
            <li> If they choose not to replace it, the new brush will fail quite quickly, since it will not be held in place properly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This vacuum falls apart every time I lift it-literally!</li>
            <li> then the hose started falling out of the top retention clip every time I would be using the floor vacuum part which is pretty annoying.  </li>
            <li> : I did drop the can part on concrete when emptying it a few months back and</li>
            <li> I was also shocked that I emptied the canister so much, I probably could have even done one more pass and had to empty it a fourth time.</li>
            <li> When the screw arrived, it was the wrong screw...far too short to fit.  </li>
            <li> Pretty frustrating, but I had the thing for a few years and didn&#x27;t really expect it to last that long anyways.</li>
            <li> When the canister falls off, the entire top portion of the vacuum cleaner separates off, the hand tool falls off because of the weak magnet that holds it in place, and the hose falls off on the back because of a weak plastic clip that doesn&#x27;t hold it in place properly...</li>
            <li> On his advice, I took the vacuum home, cleaned the filter and let it dry for 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have fine carpets or expensive flooring.</li>
            <li> Powerful suck, drew out all the dog hair and other dry residues trapped in the carpet fibers that clearly my other vaccuum never picked</li>
            <li> I can only speculate that either people are NOT maintaining it properly which would explain early failure (the six month people) or perhaps the newer models are made someplace different now with lower quality control, maybe in China?&lt;br</li>
            <li> indicated in several other one-star reviews here, after 6 months of use the vacuum began to shut off withing 10 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> You really need about to add about another foot or two of extension at least.</li>
            <li> I had to empty 3 times because it does have a smaller caniser than the dyson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they had a LONG pole attachement we can buy to extend it.</li>
            <li> I took the vacuum to the service center.  </li>
            <li> I never really had to deal with a dirty vacuum before, but I actually have to clean the vacuum itself after a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> I was never a fan of Eureka before because i noticed the products don&#x27;t last as long as other vacuums</li>
            <li> can no longer speak for the other one-star reviews here, but after a proper cleaning of the filters I am revising my rating to four</li>
            <li> I vacuum every other day on a rotating room schedule with two cats and a dog it gets every other day, vacuumed out my SUV after camping multiple times, picked up stuff</li>
            <li> And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, thing has recently started to overheat after a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li> One hang up was the lack of clear indication where the 1 screw was located to attach the handle (the screw is on the handle attachment itself, with a small tinted plastic covering it).&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> I then called customer service and spoke with an extremely helpful person who provided me with the address of a local Eureka service center.  </li>
            <li> But add in the fact that you need a bunch of spares and you are looking at a new belt at least every month or two.  </li>
            <li> Usually one pass is enough to pick up all of the sea of white fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only $259 (even less if you can find a BB&amp;B coupon).  </li>
            <li> Only $259 (even less if you can find a BB&amp;B coupon).  </li>
            <li> other minor issues...</li>
            <li> I ordered this vacuum when it was $130 less than a month ago...</li>
            <li> For a little back story, we have a 2500 sq foot house, 1/2 is carpet</li>
            <li> The hand tool still works a little bit, but the regular part is not doing a thing.  </li>
            <li> This vacuum is not worth the money!  </li>
            <li> 5) Hard to use the on/off switch - bad location, can&#x27;t hold and turn the vacuum cleaner on with only one hand - you need two hands free to turn it on !</li>
            <li> the flap is cracked which makes it harder to empty, but it still works and maintains suction pressure.</li>
            <li> (Be careful when opening it, too, because it&#x27;ll all fall out the bottom when you&#x27;re not expecting it.)  </li>
            <li> global warming killed just about everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been harder for me to get the cannister pieces inserted correctly than putting the machine together.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I find myself having to empty the canister after cleaning just two rooms of my townhouse.</li>
            <li> When I do empty it, dust gets EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I do however have a dog with long black hair and my apartment is fully carpeted.</li>
            <li> 1) Gets so hot in a minute even in a cold room that feels you are next to a blowing heater .</li>
            <li> , this does have an affordable price, but in the long run it&#x27;s not worth it!  </li>
            <li> So, I have owned this vaccum for a few years and here is my long term advice for someone who buys this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus there are two other filters that need cleaned REGULARLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Assuming this was due to the belt being jolted out of place in shipment to the store, I opted to get a replacement belt.  </li>
            <li> but I read review saying that it can be a problem on other vacuums).</li>
            <li> This may be due to the issue discussed above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only tool required was a small screw driver for the screw that hold the handle in place.</li>
            <li> other attachments are okay.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I am assuming this maybe leading to motor burnout for some of the other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Causing the roller brush to move around on one side due to the deformed end and it now sounds like its chewing up bolts when you run it.</li>
            <li> wont accept the return due to the 90 day rule and the item being over $70....</li>
            <li> The bad news is that cost of maintenence is almost as much as the entire vacuum anually.  </li>
            <li> This is annoying, but the vacuum still worked just fine.</li>
            <li> The brush has two small bearings, between the yellow roller tube and the black end-caps.  </li>
            <li> Then the canister started falling out if it were touched ever so slightly, as did the hose and other attachments.</li>
            <li> The tool attachment hose is too short and hard to extend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which is not worth the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure how long this will hold up.</li>
            <li> , I complained about via email, afterward, and have yet to hear back on its warranty coverage.  </li>
            <li> The suction is good, no doubt, but vacuuming a couple small rooms became a hated chore.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t take long to set up the vacuum so anyone who had trouble likely did something wrong.</li>
            <li> Luckily they arent hard to replace and they arent terribly expensive.  </li>
            <li> (I know, I am out of control), so there is a lot of fur accumulation on the carpets if I don&#x27;t vacuum at LEAST once weekly.</li>
            <li> but we do have spiders and the vacuum sucks them up along with everything</li>
            <li> About once a year the bristles to the roller in this vaccum will get ground down to nubs.  </li>
            <li> Lets give the belts a break (no pun intended) and drop it down to 50 bucks a year, plus 40 bucks yearly for Hepa Filters, and another 25 dollars for a roller.  </li>
            <li> It can shut it down</li>
            <li> and then you have to wait until it cools down before you can use it</li>
            <li> When you look inside the knob on the end by the band all of the plastic materials are melted down.</li>
            <li> for floor vs. carpets: you have to bend down to change those.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cut down quite a bit on the hair floating around the house and landing on the carpeting.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of this model about 2 months ago and 2 of them now shut down for some reason.</li>
            <li> Maybbe they are over heating and then shut down?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine less than a year, and it has been giving me problems since 3 months in.  </li>
            <li> and I am seriously worried that this vacuum is making our home dirtier rather than cleaner.</li>
            <li> tossed around the idea of a rhoomba, but I don&#x27;t want to mess with batteries charging</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronic back trouble and my 22lb vacuum is difficult for me to push around and carry from floor to floor.  </li>
            <li> , I think my carpet is getting a slight shave, but if that&#x27;s what it takes to make it last and perform, hardly a chore!</li>
            <li> this little champ does it effortlessly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dead.  </li>
            <li> The head is narrow...</li>
            <li> I read another review where the user said a similar thing happened, and some bearings on the brush roller had broken off.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble putting the parts together again.  </li>
            <li> I used this vacuum once, and 10 minutes into use the thing started to smoke, a result of the broken and melting belt.  </li>
            <li> Upon trying to replace the belt, I find that \\&quot;feeding it through the two metal pins and pushing through the frame\\&quot; as instructed in the manual was close to impossible as the belt was so tight it was almost too short to feed all the way through with enough slack to \\&quot;slip\\</li>
            <li> The accordion-style hose for the attachments is also stiff to extend, and the nozzle has now unglued from the hose.  </li>
            <li> The hose storage isn&#x27;t very tight, and it sometimes flops out while I&#x27;m vacuuming.</li>
            <li> It needs constant attention because the moveable parts fall off and the part that holds the arm needs to be put back, bad design choice.  </li>
            <li> This is shoddy workmanship and they say half the price of the Dyson...</li>
            <li> Never in my life has vacuuming been as frustrating as it is with this unit, having to stop and reattach the handle and/or hose every single time I use it.  </li>
            <li> The filter is washable, so no more shopping for bags and filters.</li>
            <li> It is small in width</li>
            <li> No love lost.</li>
            <li> Came home and was AMAZED at what the Dyson has been missing!</li>
            <li> The can is small and needs to be emptied a lot.</li>
            <li> The problem is the small capacity dust cup.</li>
            <li> Small collecting can, fills up after vacuuming one or two rooms.</li>
            <li> Parts are not that expensive online (the cord is going to run about $22), relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> At first, the vacuum made a terrible whistling noise every time I vacuumed.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is useless now for either tool or floor use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, when the upholstery attachment is clicked into the vacuum for storage that too randomly shoots off as you&#x27;re vacuuming.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry that i bought this vacuum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, wasn&#x27;t in the market for a new vac because I THOUGHT my very expensive Dyson was handling the deeds around here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the negative experiences / reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve called customer care about this issue at least three times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late to return it to Target.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine since late 2011 bought at Target on sale.</li>
            <li> Also the power-wand part is completely useless for anything (Minus one star)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just because I am so clumsy.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe all the dust and dirt this vac sucks out of your carpets.  </li>
            <li> ft thick, plush carpet, 4 levels&lt;</li>
            <li> Not the Dyson, or the other expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I guess I get to go buy a new vac now because it&#x27;s really annoying that the extension hose comes out every time I vacuum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY</li>
            <li> furniture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an electrolux battery operated floor cleaner, but returned it after seeing how weak the suction was.</li>
            <li> is because I was disappointed in how short the hose for the attachment extends.</li>
            <li> I was disgusted to see was in new carpet even!!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s too broken to sell it on Craigslist.</li>
            <li> I just paid $99 for this piece of crap last month at Target.</li>
            <li> ...n \, extending the hose is annoying, but I only do stairs biweekly</li>
            <li> This is a flimsy, poorly made piece of garbage and should not be on the market.</li>
            <li> I will submit a review, in the event I get poor results.</li>
            <li> I sense it isn&#x27;t picking up any debris, and before I know it, it has overheated and smoked, with a broken belt.</li>
            <li> Not great on stairs.</li>
            <li> Finally: something that gets the crap</li>
            <li> But poor quality materials ruin it for me.</li>
            <li> I hate this vacuum.</li>
            <li> have read reviews (elsewhere) that say it is difficult to assemble - false.</li>
            <li> Weak!</li>
            <li> Some of it is actually decently expensive.  </li>
            <li> The hose falls out randomly as I&#x27;m vacuuming.</li>
            <li> Hair gets stuck in canister and difficult to extract.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of sitting there and never getting washed, it&#x27;s going to be filthy.</li>
            <li> Completely useless if you want to use the tools.  </li>
            <li> On my unit, one of the bearings failed, causing the brush to mis-align itself and start eating away at the outer plastic guides and the roller itself.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, some of it gets all over when you release the canister contents into the trashbin.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this vacuum to my worst enemies.</li>
            <li> Awful vacuum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a couple bad reviews, to that I will say: A poor craftsman blames his tools.</li>
            <li> This is not washable and has to be replaced when dirty.  </li>
            <li> rotating upholstery attachment just stinks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some articles that say that carpeting is extremely dirty and hold lots of bacteria and fungi.</li>
            <li> 2) Unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Now I know that I was very wrong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Everytime I vacuum, and the canister falls off, I am reminded of how horrible the product is and how horrible Eureka customer service is.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this bad of a product would ever be sold.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I was shocked.</li>
            <li> the path to the canister is not plugged up or filthy.  </li>
            <li> flaws are annoying though.</li>
            <li> When I saw what was in that canister it disgusted me.</li>
            <li> This machine is dangerous!!!</li>
            <li> The worst part?</li>

            <li> My canister falls off whenever it is moved or touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tightened the screws many times, which is what customer service suggests.&lt;br /&gt;Or they suggest I unattach and reattach it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I suggest that it is under warranty and that this should be fixed&lt;br /&gt;they tell me that if it is found to be a consumer error then I will be charged.&lt;br /&gt;Which is not worth the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I vacuum, and the canister falls off, I am reminded of how horrible the product is and how horrible Eureka customer service is.</li>
            <li> I have had this vacuum cleaner for a year and mine nearly completely falls apart every time i try to move it. This is NOT user error. The screw that came with this vacuum cleaner never fit properly after many many attempts. I&#x27;ve called customer care about this issue at least three times. THE 1ST CALL...i was advised to try to screw it in again. This did not work. THE 2ND CALL...i was told they would send another screw out (maybe the one i had was defective). The screw never arrived. THE 3RD CALL TO CUSTOMER CARE...i asked to speak with a supervisor but was not allowed to. The rep assured me that she would send a screw. When the screw arrived, it was the wrong screw...far too short to fit.  Listen, I had a Kirby vacuum cleaner demonstrator/salesman come to my house and HE EVEN TRIED TO PUT THE SCREW INTO MY VACUUM CLEANER! No luck. The canister falls off because of the lack of this screw. When the canister falls off, the entire top portion of the vacuum cleaner separates off, the hand tool falls off because of the weak magnet that holds it in place, and the hose falls off on the back because of a weak plastic clip that doesn&#x27;t hold it in place properly...all at the same time. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, thing has recently started to overheat after a few minutes of use. Can&#x27;t get a full room done and it take at least an hour before it&#x27;ll start again. DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM CLEANER. Customer service will NOT help you. You&#x27;ll be out a hundred dollar bill and you still won&#x27;t have a vacuum cleaner...with Eureka laughing all the way to the bank.</li>
            <li> So, I have owned this vaccum for a few years and here is my long term advice for someone who buys this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While its a good vacuum, its not great and heres why.  There is a ton of maintenance involved in ownership here.  Some of it is actually decently expensive.  Here are the items you are going to be replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1:  The roller.  About once a year the bristles to the roller in this vaccum will get ground down to nubs.  You will have to buy a replacement and keep it in a drawer somewhere for when this happens.  The good news is that amazon sells them, the bad news is that they are 25 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:  The belt.  This thing eats belts.  Luckily they arent hard to replace and they arent terribly expensive.  Anywhere from 2 to 5 bucks.  But add in the fact that you need a bunch of spares and you are looking at a new belt at least every month or two.  5 bucks a month for 12 months is 60 dollars.  Add that to the 25 dollars you are spending per year for the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3:  The hepa filter.  This vacuum will not work without the hepa filter.  It will grab big stuff, but without it the fine dust and dirt will go flying in the air.  This is not washable and has to be replaced when dirty.  The HEPA filter in mine plugs off completely every 3 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;The hepa filters are available here on amazon, but they are 10 bucks.  Every 3 months you are replacing them 4 times a year.  Thats 40 dollars a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So add this all up.  Lets give the belts a break (no pun intended) and drop it down to 50 bucks a year, plus 40 bucks yearly for Hepa Filters, and another 25 dollars for a roller.  This adds up to 115 dollars a year in parts to keep your vacuum going.  You could nearly buy a whole new vacuum for that much money.  Plus you get the headache of taking the entire thing apart and making sure the path to the canister is not plugged up or filthy.  Plus there are two other filters that need cleaned REGULARLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;So, is this a good vacuum?  When you first buy it, yes absolutley.  It cleans well, has good suction, great tools and is actually pretty light.  The bad news is that cost of maintenence is almost as much as the entire vacuum anually.  And if you want the vacuum to actually function, ALL of this stuff has to be replaced.  Add in the physical job of cleaning the other filters at the top of the canister, which need cleaned on a insanely frequent basis, and you end up with an appliance which is more trouble than its worth.</li>
            <li> I used this vacuum once, and 10 minutes into use the thing started to smoke, a result of the broken and melting belt.  Assuming this was due to the belt being jolted out of place in shipment to the store, I opted to get a replacement belt.  Back to the store I go to find a replacement belt... which they don&#x27;t carry at Target.  Off to Wal-mart I go where I find a replacement, and they have it in stock.  Upon trying to replace the belt, I find that \\&quot;feeding it through the two metal pins and pushing through the frame\\&quot; as instructed in the manual was close to impossible as the belt was so tight it was almost too short to feed all the way through with enough slack to \\&quot;slip\\&quot; the brush through.  I literally had to place my foot on the unit, pull the belt out as far as it would go, and then force the brush through before the belt snapped back into place.  Not user friendly in the least.  I managed to get the belt in place, put the unit back together, and again within 10 minutes of use with the new belt, it broke again.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I can&#x27;t keep replacing the belt after each use!!!!!  I have emailed Eureka, but I doubt they&#x27;ll fix the problem as I feel it&#x27;s a design flaw.  I will most likely be returning the unit to the store, which is a shame, because it worked great other than the belt issue!!</li>
            <li> No issues as of yet . Cleans my carpet very effectively and the Hepa filter makes a huge difference , greatly helps my asthma and allergies . Great suction , the apartment complex I recently moved into stated they had the unit &amp;#34;professionaly&amp;#34; cleaned before I moved in , I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of dirt and hair this vacuum pulled out of the carpet . Very pleased .</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement vacume for the upper level of my house. I used to have a dyson for both levels, but daughter took the 2nd one. I only have bare floors upstairs so I did not want to invest in 500.00 for a second dyson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tossed around the idea of a rhoomba, but I don&#x27;t want to mess with batteries charging and I have two hairy dogs that shed. It would never handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest cleaning problem is getting under the beds. I have to use a swiffer to get the hair from under the beds, then I vacume the wood floors around beds and furniture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an electrolux battery operated floor cleaner, but returned it after seeing how weak the suction was. Also, the battery issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up this Eureka Zuum and figured I could just use the plugged in version, and get under the beds with the hose attachment like my dyson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it first on the carpets downstairs and the pergo floors. I was amazed at the suction power of this machine! It actually was stronger than my dyson (my dyson is veryyyy old though). It left nice suction marks on the carpets. Low and high carpets. I had to empty 3 times because it does have a smaller caniser than the dyson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is about a foot shorter than the dyson. It is a good quality cord with a nice rubber feel. Not plasticy. It cleaned up closer to the edges than the dyson, went under the furniture a little more too because it is not has high up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on the wood floors, and loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I am taking a star off is because I was disappointed in how short the hose for the attachment extends. You really need about to add about another foot or two of extension at least. When I tried to vacume under the bed with the hose attachment, the vacume kept tipping over since there was no length. I will have to continue with using a swiffer to get under the bed. I wish they had a LONG pole attachement we can buy to extend it. OR better yet, if it came with the vacume in teh first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the dyson is more sturdier. I am not sure how long this will hold up. But I just got it and plan on keeping it away from my husband who is equivilent to a gorilla when it comes to using appliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this vacume right now. It has only been day one. But I have never bought a vacume that had this much suction power right out of the box. I have purchased many vacumes over the years. Love the Dyson but not the price. If you want a great vacume with dyson&#x27;s suction power and can deal with a shorter hose for attachments, this is the one. PErfect gift for someone too.</li>
            <li> Bought this vac at Target for $99 about 6 months ago. The biggest problem has been the hose coming undone from its plastic top and bottom. Luckily, I&#x27;m fairly handy, so I&#x27;ve been able to take apart the plastic housing and rethread the hose back in, but it keeps unscrewing itself. Then to top it off, the tip of the hose doesn&#x27;t fit into the clip, so even when the hose is connected, I have to tape it to the body of the vac to keep it from falling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other minor issues... the fancy hose attachment is held on the vac w a clip and a tiny magnet. If you move the vac too quickly or even bump it into the wall ever so slightly, it will fall off. That is being held on w tape as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service has been no help. It&#x27;s too late to return it to Target. And it&#x27;s too broken to sell it on Craigslist. DON&#x27;T BUY. If you do, make sure you get a roll of duct tape to keep it all together. I know the price is appealing, but you&#x27;re better off spending a few more bucks and getting a vac that doesn&#x27;t fall apart every time you try to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my husband wanted this vacuum and at first I was impressed.  For a little back story, we have a 2500 sq foot house, 1/2 is carpet and we vacuum about twice a month. Within the first month the belt broke.  It needs constant attention because the moveable parts fall off and the part that holds the arm needs to be put back, bad design choice.  I clean this vacuum after every use, including the filters as recommended on the manual.  You have to constantly empty the canister or it will no longer suck even though the canister is less than 1/2 full. Now it&#x27;s been 9 months and the vacuum won&#x27;t work at all, customer service states that we didn&#x27;t use the vacuum correctly (without any proof by the way) and that the three year warranty is void and they cannot help me.  I was never a fan of Eureka before because i noticed the products don&#x27;t last as long as other vacuums and I was right. Prior to this vacuum I had a cheap $30 vacuum that work great and never had issues, only thing I ever had to replace was the belt and bags, I had that vacuum for 6 years.  Will never buy a Eureka ever again.</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronic back trouble and my 22lb vacuum is difficult for me to push around and carry from floor to floor.  I was concerned after reading the review posted about this unit falling apart when lifted; but if you screw the handle together properly, it is sturdy and the cup stays put.  I love the retractable hose that does not fall off and the other tools are easily stowed. The unit is incredibly maneuverable and the suction is as good as my larger (and heavier) unit. The cup will need to be emptied more frequently than bags, but it is quick and easy to empty right into the trash. The filter is washable, so no more shopping for bags and filters. The only downside so far is that the cord is only 25 feet. Overall, for less than $100 this unit is a great value.</li>
            <li> Complete garbage. Do not buy. Bristles started falling out after first use and now they are matted all over my carpet. I hate this vacuum. I can&#x27;t believe this bad of a product would ever be sold. NEVER BUY A EUREKA!!!!!</li>
            <li> Update as of February 17, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As described in the original review below, the vacuum stopped working after 6 months.  I followed the instructions for cleaning the vacuum, filters, etc., but nothing worked.  I then called customer service and spoke with an extremely helpful person who provided me with the address of a local Eureka service center.  I took the vacuum to the service center.  One of the staff plugged it in, turned it on, and within 5 seconds told me that the filter was clogged.  I told him I&#x27;d cleaned the filter, and he opened the vacuum to show me a second filter that I hadn&#x27;t noticed before.  On his advice, I took the vacuum home, cleaned the filter and let it dry for 48 hours.  The vacuum now works better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can no longer speak for the other one-star reviews here, but after a proper cleaning of the filters I am revising my rating to four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As indicated in several other one-star reviews here, after 6 months of use the vacuum began to shut off withing 10 minutes of use.  Followed all of the instructions for cleaning the vacuum, filters, etc. to no avail.  Calling customer service tomorrow and will update my review after that.  For now, recommend avoiding this product at any cost.</li>
            <li> The machine was unbearably loud from the start. The retractable hose is clunky and mine never would stay attached to unit, a real annoyance when falling in front of my feet every 10 seconds or less. I finally taped t to unit. The suction is good, no doubt, but vacuuming a couple small rooms became a hated chore. Spend a little more and get a better cleaner, even one in the Airspeed line, but not this cheap-looking one.</li>
            <li> This vacuum falls apart every time I lift it-literally! If you attempt to lift it by the handle, the handle comes off, and the filter falls forward spilling ALL the dirt out. I would not recommend this vacuum to my worst enemies.</li>
            <li> After reading review after review and feeling totally overwhelmed by all the choices of vacuums, I finally decided on the Zuum. I had owned a Bissell Liftoff before but after 5 years, it finally died. I loved that vacuum because it had every feature (except auto rewind cord) one could ever need. I still wanted a powerful vacuum that did not lose suction, but now that I live in an apartment instead of a 2 story house I didn&#x27;t need all the extra features and didn&#x27;t want to pay for features I wasn&#x27;t going to use. The Zuum is a powerful 12 Amp vacuum that has great section power, it is easy to empty, works great on both carpet and hard floors, and has a neat, easy to access hand tool. The power button is in a convenient spot, as well as the toggle between floor and tools. It is small in width but I find this convenient for smaller spaces and it does an excellent job of getting close to the baseboards. The floor brush does continuously spin even when upright or when using the tools, so I just recommend turning the floor brush to the \\&quot;bare floor\\&quot; position when using the tools so that you do not burn you carpet (I have never had this happen personally to me but I read review saying that it can be a problem on other vacuums). The day before I got this vacuum, I vacuumed the apartment with my neighbors vacuum. The next day when using the Zuum, it had a pretty full canister after the first use so it suprised me what the other vacuum had left behind. It is pretty powerful, but is not noisy so I am able to vacuum in front of my baby and my toddler. I would highly recommend the Zuum.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic vacuum - gets so much dirt you would not believe it - powerful suction like no other machine I have owned - would not hesitate to recommend this Eureka - well worth the money</li>
            <li> This vacuum has great suction power. Unlike others, I cannot compare this to a Dyson (old or new Dyson). I think it does a pretty good job though. I recently bought a Hoover, then went over the carpet with this one, and it still picked up junk. In short, New Hoover did not suck up as much dirt as a 3-year-old Eureka.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hose on the back broke the second time I used it. Just snapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, the reason I bought a Hoover was because of this, it would overheat and turn itself off. It would stay on for maybe two minutes. Pretty frustrating, but I had the thing for a few years and didn&#x27;t really expect it to last that long anyways. I wound up washing the washable filter and replacing the HEPA filter. It is back to working like a charm now!</li>
            <li> I bought this unit about 6 months ago.  When I first got it I thought that I had found the perfect Vacuum. Now I know that I was very wrong.  It has gone from amazing me to how much crud was on my rug to wanting to cry as I realize it is not picking a thing up.  The hand tool still works a little bit, but the regular part is not doing a thing.  I have looked in the several areas where pet hair DOES clog this and they are all clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the unit does overheat when you have to vacuum more then one room.  It can shut it down and then you have to wait until it cools down before you can use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this does have an affordable price, but in the long run it&#x27;s not worth it!  I would not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> What can I say about this vacuum.. This would be ideal for a small apartment but definitely not good enough for a 1700 sf house. It does miss alot when you are vacuuming and you have to go back over places.</li>
            <li> At first I really liked this vacuum.  We live in a relatively small apartment and having a vacuum that had a relatively small footprint was great.  Power was there, the tools worked great, and we were pretty happy...for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the main canister falls off all the time.  As in you touch the vacuum to move it and the canister takes a nose dive to the floor.  If you enjoy re-vacuuming dust you already vacuumed once, this is a really fun feature.  When the canister isn&#x27;t falling off, the hose attachments are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also fairly certain this vacuum attracts more dust on the outside of the vacuum than in the canister itself.  I never really had to deal with a dirty vacuum before, but I actually have to clean the vacuum itself after a couple of uses.  This may be due to the issue discussed above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here we are today, about two years after buying a vacuum that I use about once a month.  It&#x27;s dead.  We have all of 790 square feet of apartment and apparently being used 20 or so times was too much for the little guy.  Do yourself a favor and look for something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this vac exactly 1 month, used it twice. Well, tried to use it twice but the hose came apart. Not where it&#x27;s is supposed to come apart -- the fixed ring at the bottom of the hose came off because it&#x27;s glue did not hold. The vacuum is useless now for either tool or floor use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the manual, the troubleshooting guide, even called Eureka Customer Service who said I would have to purchase a new hose. No way! I just paid $99 for this piece of crap last month at Target. Fortunately, Target has a 90-day warranty and will give me my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Eureka, you have just lost a customer for life and I&#x27;ll never recommend a Eureka product after this experience.</li>
            <li> This is a great vacuum for the price. I have had a Dyson for several years, and granted while it is older, their slogan is \\&quot;never lose sucction\\&quot; - right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, wasn&#x27;t in the market for a new vac because I THOUGHT my very expensive Dyson was handling the deeds around here. Saw an ad for the Airspeed, then overheard someone talking about just days later and thought \\&quot;I should check this out\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My approach was - buy it, if it doesn&#x27;t work better take it back. No love lost. So when I saw it on sale, I had to give it a shot. I vacuumed my family room and my bed room with the Dyson, and headed out to purchase the Eureka. Came home and was AMAZED at what the Dyson has been missing! When I saw what was in that canister it disgusted me. UGH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews (elsewhere) that say it is difficult to assemble - false. My 10 year-old daughter and I put it together in under 10 minutes. Only tool required was a small screw driver for the screw that hold the handle in place. Everything else is a matter of snapping in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the cannister is smaller, the cord is shorter, and the tube is shorter than the Dyson. Due to the lay out of my house, these are all things I can live with (afterall, does it take more than 30 seconds to move your cord from one room to the next?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good! Will update if my opinion changes. Can&#x27;t believe I paid $89 for this and $400 for my last vac (which is leaving dust on my floors!!!).</li>
            <li> I ordered this vacuum when it was $130 less than a month ago... When I go to vacuum the piece in front (dust cup)  falls off completely while vacuuming. It clips in but loosens immediately. Definitely going to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine since late 2011 bought at Target on sale. It&#x27;s been used and abused multiple times - I vacuum every other day on a rotating room schedule with two cats and a dog it gets every other day, vacuumed out my SUV after camping multiple times, picked up stuff \\&quot;professional\\&quot; vacuums didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ve moved twice and had to do a complete home run without issue. I brought it over to a friends who&#x27;s vacuum stopped working and they were amazed by how good it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do disassemble mine every other month and do a full cleaning of the internal parts, HEPA and other pieces to ensure it keeps working. It takes less than 15 minutes to soak them in hot water and a drop of dishwashing liquid in a bucket. I&#x27;m not sure about the negative experiences / reviews. I can only speculate that either people are NOT maintaining it properly which would explain early failure (the six month people) or perhaps the newer models are made someplace different now with lower quality control, maybe in China?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I don&#x27;t know, but I know I love mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) So far it works like a champ (For under $100 over 3 years - Plus one star)&lt;br /&gt;2) The suction is really strong (NOTE you need to keep the filters clean and can emptied)&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s be fairly durable, surviving 2 moves, a fall down the stairs and other mishaps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The can is small and needs to be emptied a lot. SERIOUSLY A LOT!&lt;br /&gt;2) Also the power-wand part is completely useless for anything (Minus one star) other attachments are okay.&lt;br /&gt;3) VIP - If you do not keep the filters clean and free of caked on dust the unit will overheat. I am assuming this maybe leading to motor burnout for some of the other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did drop the can part on concrete when emptying it a few months back and the flap is cracked which makes it harder to empty, but it still works and maintains suction pressure.</li>
            <li> Bought this vacuum at Target a little over a year ago and have used it pretty much every week.  Have no complaints with this vacuum; probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Great suction!!  Totally disassemble dirt collection bin and place the whole thing in the dishwasher; seems to be the easiest way to keep it clean.  Perfect little vacuum for an apartment or small house.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the advertisement that said better than a Dyson and since I have a baby just learning to crawl, clean carpets are my number one concern!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old B...ll conked out on me so I had to give this one a shot, especially at eighty dollars!!  Boy was I impressed!!  I vacuumed the carpets once, cleaned the canister and vacuumed a second time and barely got anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The head is narrow... a few more strokes, and my work is thoroughly done...&lt;br /&gt;- I empty the canister every time I vacuum the whole house, I think my carpet is getting a slight shave, but if that&#x27;s what it takes to make it last and perform, hardly a chore! lol ;)&lt;br /&gt;- Just like the D...n \, extending the hose is annoying, but I only do stairs biweekly and that&#x27;s not my priority - my priority is fantastic suction and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll repost an update in a year!</li>
            <li> This machine is dangerous!!! I don&#x27;t know if this is for all these models or just a defect in mine but you cannot turn off the rotating brush. When using hand attachments the brush keeps going causing friction damage to the carpet below. You can smell the carpet just beginning to melt. This is a flimsy, poorly made piece of garbage and should not be on the market. I use to love Eureka products but they have gone to the dark side. Avoid Avoid Avoid!!</li>
            <li> I feel kind of silly reviewing a vacuum cleaner, but this is the absolute best one I&#x27;ve ever owned and as such it deserves it&#x27;s moment of glory &#x3D;) I am not about to go buy a Dyson like my mom has to clean my apartment, but I still need a good vacuum cleaner that gets the job done at a price point I can afford. So when I saw on the box that this little eureka supposedly cleans  as well or better than a Dyson DC24, I totally fell victim to the marketing and bought this immediately. Well this is one time I can honestly say I&#x27;m happy with my impulse buy! I have an Aussie Shepherd mix with medium length hair as well as ferrets (I know, I am out of control), so there is a lot of fur accumulation on the carpets if I don&#x27;t vacuum at LEAST once weekly. This is the FIRST vacuum I&#x27;ve ever owned that lifts up ALL the hair on my carpet without a problem. No need to  vacuum ten times over the same area in the vain hope it will actually lift the critter fur- this little champ does it effortlessly. It also picks up fine dirt, little rocks and other crud we bring in after our outdoor adventures, it&#x27;s easy to empty, has a washable filter, and somehow manages to maintain it&#x27;s strong suction even when it&#x27;s almost full and should really be emptied. I am super impressed, especially since I&#x27;ve had previous Eureka&#x27;s that weren&#x27;t up to the tasks I&#x27;ve mentioned. I highly recommend this little vacuum to anyone looking for a powerful, affordable vacuum. Very happy with my purchase and would absolutely buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Let me get straight to the good points I observed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The sleek look got my kid excited to the point they volunteered to vacuum!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Assembly was easy. One hang up was the lack of clear indication where the 1 screw was located to attach the handle (the screw is on the handle attachment itself, with a small tinted plastic covering it).&lt;br /&gt;3.  The power cord felt surprisingly sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;4.  It comes with a cool attachment to clean the furniture and staircase.&lt;br /&gt;5.  I like the option to choose between the &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27; carpet settings.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Not overly loud when powered on.&lt;br /&gt;7.  Powerful suck, drew out all the dog hair and other dry residues trapped in the carpet fibers that clearly my other vaccuum never picked up.&lt;br /&gt;8.  Left the most highest traffic area looking way brighter and cleaner, than my hoover ever did.&lt;br /&gt;9.  Good price for the power. I paid $75 in-store, rather than ordering online for a higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the attachments, nor used the vacuum on the bare floors. I will submit a review, in the event I get poor results.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target for $99, just about a year ago. I was nervous after reading some reviews but most were so great I thought I would take a gamble with my money since it wasn&#x27;t much. At first, the vacuum made a terrible whistling noise every time I vacuumed. I ignored it and so far it was great. Fantastic suction and easy to empty and store, very lightweight. I&#x27;m in a one bedroom apartment so I don&#x27;t need much. Then the canister started falling out if it were touched ever so slightly, as did the hose and other attachments. This is annoying, but the vacuum still worked just fine. Here we are a year later. I sense it isn&#x27;t picking up any debris, and before I know it, it has overheated and smoked, with a broken belt. No biggie. Change belt and try again...nope. The brush roller does not want to roll. I read another review where the user said a similar thing happened, and some bearings on the brush roller had broken off. I don&#x27;t feel like bothering with customer service, and I really need to vacuum my floors. Looks like I&#x27;ll be paying more for a better vacuum this time around. Nice little run there, but I can&#x27;t say it was entirely worth it.</li>
            <li> This vacuum cleaner picks up well but overheats and shuts off after 5 minutes. After waiting 20-30 minutes, you can restart it and continue. We could only vacuum one room at a time with it. The problem is the small capacity dust cup. If you have pets, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> This vacuum is not worth the money!  I&#x27;ve had mine less than a year, and it has been giving me problems since 3 months in.  The canister is extremely stiff to turn open (to empty the dirt) and has cracked across the top.  (Be careful when opening it, too, because it&#x27;ll all fall out the bottom when you&#x27;re not expecting it.)  The accordion-style hose for the attachments is also stiff to extend, and the nozzle has now unglued from the hose.  It is also extremely hard to clean and there&#x27;s a build-up in the tubing that I can&#x27;t reach to clean out. The suction is fine, but that&#x27;s the only good thing about this vacuum.</li>
            <li> Purchased Vacuum approx 3 months ago and it worked fine during that time. Today however the roller brush has melted itself into a non-working manner. When you look inside the knob on the end by the band all of the plastic materials are melted down. Causing the roller brush to move around on one side due to the deformed end and it now sounds like its chewing up bolts when you run it. This is shoddy workmanship and they say half the price of the Dyson...sure but you definitely wont have a Dyson melt on you....and to cap it off Target wont accept the return due to the 90 day rule and the item being over $70....So now I get to fork out more money for another vacuum because I cant find a friggin roller replacement online for my vacuum. Customer Service was unhelpful and this is just unacceptable Eureka.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this vacuum. While it worked great for a few weeks, it then started overheating on a regular basis and I couldn&#x27;t finish vacuuming even one room let alone my entire house. Sometimes if you let it sit for an hour or more, it cools down enough to use again. But it quickly overheats again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve cleaned the filter and made sure nothing was clogged, so that&#x27;s not the problem. I believe there is a wiring or motor issue with this particular model that needs addressing by Eureka. If it weren&#x27;t for this issue, I&#x27;d love this vacuum.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I love this vacuum. We have 2 dogs and a cat, so there is a lot of pet fur in our house. This thing is great on carpet. Usually one pass is enough to pick up all of the sea of white fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vacuum is SO EASY to empty. One click to remove canister and one to empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flaws are annoying though. The hose is retractable and stores in back of the unit in an upright position. The hose will pull the vacuum along with it. Not great on stairs. A traditional wrap around hose would eliminate that problem. The hose storage isn&#x27;t very tight, and it sometimes flops out while I&#x27;m vacuuming. Annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating upholstery attachment just stinks. It doesn&#x27;t do a good job, gets jammed easily and the magnetic clasp for it is weak. Any bump sends it flying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a corded Bissel Pet Hair Eraser for the stairs and furniture. However, I love the power and ease of using this on carpeting and hardwood,  and the other attachments do a great job on corners etc. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the most frustrating vacuums I&#x27;ve ever had. The hose falls out randomly as I&#x27;m vacuuming. The upholstery brush (which I was very excited about when I bought the vacuum) worked once for me. After that, the roll inside never spun no matter how I cleaned it out and thus, the one feature I thought I was going to be most grateful for I could never even use. Plus, when the upholstery attachment is clicked into the vacuum for storage that too randomly shoots off as you&#x27;re vacuuming. The worst part? The belt breaks constantly even when being diligent in making sure you change the setting from low carpet to bare floor. The motor whistles too which isn&#x27;t a very promising sign that the vacuum will be around very long. With four boys and a dog, I&#x27;m looking into a new vacuum.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a nice little vacuum but it didn&#x27;t hold up.  I previously had a Dyson which I thought worked very well and was well built but didn&#x27;t want to drop $400 on a new vac so I thought I would give this one a shot.  Well it worked well for about 5 months then the hose started falling out of the top retention clip every time I would be using the floor vacuum part which is pretty annoying.  I messed around pulling out the extension hose and putting it back in to make sure it was in all the way, turning it different ways and whatever else I could think of assuming I was just not clipping it in correctly.  I guess the clip is just garbage.  The little stair vac attachment that connects to the front of the handle by a magnet also falls out occasionally, I can deal with that because it clips on easily.  The cord is very short which although not a huge deal but seems like something a company that&#x27;s been making vacuums for many years would consider. The bedrooms in my house are not that big I should be able to plug it in to a hallway outlet between two bedrooms and get them both but can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;So I guess I get to go buy a new vac now because it&#x27;s really annoying that the extension hose comes out every time I vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this vacuum to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have owned many vacuums over the years: Oreck, Rainbow, Panasonic, Hoover upright, Kenmore canister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picked this up at Target for $79.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- 2 cats (shorthairs)&lt;br /&gt;--- approx. 1500 sq. ft thick, plush carpet, 4 levels&lt;br /&gt;--- we remove our shoes before coming in&lt;br /&gt;--- no children at home, just the 2 of us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zuum:&lt;br /&gt;THe belt never worked out of the box. Bought a belt at Target and it worked much better. I used the u belt but not sure if its the right one...seems to stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an illusion you are cleaning well, since you *see* the dirt and hair, but it&#x27;s smoke &amp; mirrors. Really, if you use a quality vacuum, it&#x27;s going into the vacuum cleaner bag; you&#x27;re just not looking at it. There is still dirt in all carpets since they act like a magnet for life&#x27;s crud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord: use cord clip on unit to keep it up and out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stairs: wand pulls out of hose; stairs piece pops on, simple. Cleaning on stairs: seems to be average to below-average at best, but my Kenmore Progressive Canister is easier because I can just use the Powerhead on the stairs and it&#x27;s more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bare floors:  did fine, no complaints - probably the best use for this thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No powerhead like a canister, so this won&#x27;t get under your bed; prepare to move furniture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjustments for floors/vs tools: you need to manually choose those settings on the back of the vac, so bending necessary when switching functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vacuumed a rental which had pets and got 7canisters of hair and dirt off the first floor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjustments for floor vs. carpets: you have to bend down to change those. They&#x27;re not up by the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage of stair brush: attaches on the main vac (via magnet), does fall off easily. That will annoy you, so just pull the thing off and set it aside, then replace before you store .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allergies issues: go with a *bagged* vac instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dust Cup:&lt;br /&gt;The Zuum is going to expose you to dust when emptying dust cup, plus it has parts within the cup where the cat hair can lodge, requiring you to use your fingers or a tool to extract the clumps; another nuisance issue. Hair gets stuck in canister and difficult to extract. Plus, you have to clean the top filter, and replace a HEPA filter every 6 months. You&#x27;re exposing yourself to dust, hair and dirt having to maintain this and rinse out the filter. Take the trash can outside and dump it out there, otherwise you get a cloud of dust in the house. That isn&#x27;t too fun when it&#x27;s 10 degrees and a blizzard outside, otherwise do it in the garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prevent dirt:&lt;br /&gt;have good mats by your doors; take off shoes before tracking dirt all over carpet. Shoes bring in so much bacteria, think of public bathrooms, what&#x27;s on sidewalks (dog waste, spit, bird droppings, etc.). I&#x27;ve read some articles that say that carpeting is extremely dirty and hold lots of bacteria and fungi. I believe it. Imagine a white bath towel at each of your doors. After a few weeks of sitting there and never getting washed, it&#x27;s going to be filthy. That is pretty much the type of dirt and situation you have in your carpeting; you just don&#x27;t see it as fast, since most people don&#x27;t have white carpeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice to have hard floors and some scatter or room rugs which could be washed as needed. Hard surfaces harbor less bacteria and are much easier and cheaper to keep clean, than carpeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pet Hair issues:&lt;br /&gt;having two cats, I bought a Furminator and used gently at least once a week on the cats has made a huge difference. One of our cats (the male), sheds a lot more than the other cat, so he really needs it and it&#x27;s cut down quite a bit on the hair floating around the house and landing on the carpeting. I also use a sticky roller on them after the Furminator and they tend to like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;If you factor the cost of replacing carpeting, buying vacuums, time spent vacuuming, cost to clean carpets once or twice a year, over a 10 yr. period you&#x27;d probably be better off with hardwoods, laminates or tile and some throw/room rugs instead! Speaking of professional carpet cleaning, I had OxiFresh come in to the tune of $280 and it didn&#x27;t even clean well. Never again with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;if you need a carpet cleaning machine, try that Big Green Clean Machine (rental at Lowe&#x27;s to try it out). I use that about every 6 to 8 months and it does a terrific job - I have a review on it. You can also buy this for your home, but I have not done so yet. Want one so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE***** It is now Jan. 2014 and this is already smelling \\&quot;hot,\\&quot; like it&#x27;s going to burn out. I haven&#x27;t used it that much because I also bought the Shark Rotator which I love!!! The \\&quot;Shark Rotator Professional 3 in 1\\&quot; Vacuum. Love it! Only $259 (even less if you can find a BB&amp;B coupon).  Does a fantastic job on the cat hair and fine dirt/dust.

            <li> I have a tiny apartment so I can&#x27;t review this vacuum for large homes. I do however have a dog with long black hair and my apartment is fully carpeted. I&#x27;ve never spent a lot of money on vacuums, I&#x27;m used to buying a really inexpensive vacuum once a year just because I don&#x27;t have the need for anything big and fancy. My most recent Dirt Devil stopped picking anything up and over the last couple months I&#x27;d noticed I was sneezing a lot more often and felt like being inside my home was just dusty all the time but couldn&#x27;t figure out why because I keep things really clean. Anyway, saw this vacuum in a Target ad and read some reviews and thought it was worth the purchase even though it was more than the $20 that I usually pay for vacuums (I swear I&#x27;m not cheap! Just a bargain hunter) it didn&#x27;t take long to set up the vacuum so anyone who had trouble likely did something wrong. Keep in mind my apartment is 545 sq ft. I emptied the canister THREE TIMES while I was vacuuming. That is how much dirt and dust and dog hair and other stuff was stuck in my carpet. I was amazed how soft my carpet was, I&#x27;d forgotten what it was supposed to feel like. I was also shocked that I emptied the canister so much, I probably could have even done one more pass and had to empty it a fourth time. Even if this thing only lasts me 6 months or a year, the fact that it is ridiculously more efficient than any other inexpensive vacuum makes it well worth the purchase. And by the way, replacing filters on a bagless HEPA vacuum is completely normal and much more eco friendly than having something you have to replace bags on, it&#x27;s of the reasons the cost of the vacuum is low. So if you have a 1500 sq ft house read someone else&#x27;s review but this vacuum is perfect for small apartments with pets!</li>
            <li> I have about 5 square feet of carpet but I have 10 dogs. I live on a dirt road and the yards are dirt -- global warming killed just about everything. We have high winds in the spring and the autumn. I have agonized over vacuums. I have tried a ot of different vacuums. Not the Dyson, or the other expensive ones. I need a basic suction machine, no frills. This vacuum gets up more dirt in one vacuuming than I have gotten up with other, more expensive, machines in six months. Frankly, I was shocked. We don&#x27;t have ticks or fleas but we do have spiders and the vacuum sucks them up along with everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vacuuming defeats ticks and fleas. Or, rather, frequent vacuuming with a machine that does the job is the first line of defense against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic workhorse vacuum great for the price. I would pay Eureka the purchse price every month as  rental if I had to. Finally: something that gets the crap up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have fine carpets or expensive flooring. Can&#x27;t speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ten thumbs and actually got this put together without any issues. It&#x27;s all just plastic that snaps together. It&#x27;s been harder for me to get the cannister pieces inserted correctly than putting the machine together. Because I am so ham - handed, I prefer the very cheapest model of the Airspeed which has the innards permanent placed in the cannister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the attachments much, howver, the few times I have, they seem to also do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pefer power cords that automatically rewind, but that&#x27;s just because I am so clumsy. If you can pick up your feet, then this cord is fine.</li>
            <li> I have a 750 sq ft apartment, all hardwood floors.  A friend of mine told me this was a great vacuum, even better than Dyson.  Last time I&#x27;ll ever take advice from that friend.  Completely useless if you want to use the tools.  The hose is very short, and EVERY TIME I use the tools, which I do every time I vacuum, the hose comes out of the vacuum cleaner and/or the handle that the tools attach to comes out of the hose.  Never in my life has vacuuming been as frustrating as it is with this unit, having to stop and reattach the handle and/or hose every single time I use it.  Do NOT waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you never need to use the tools, and simply want to push it around the floor, the suction is fine.  For my part, however, this will be the last Eureka vacuum cleaner I ever buy.</li>
            <li> This is a really great vacuum if you&#x27;re looking for a machine to scoot debris across the floor with a powerful brush roller. If you want the debris to actually end up IN the vacuum, you should probably augment your purchase with a broom and dustpan. That way you can sort of &amp;#34;aim&amp;#34; the debris into a general area of the floor as you scoot it around with the vacuum&#x27;s roller, and then use the broom and dustpan to remove the debris from the floor. Open the top of the vacuum and dump the dirt inside, and you&#x27;re done! Easy.</li>
            <li> I picked one of these up a year ago, still haven&#x27;t had to change the belt. I did however have to dismantle the whole thing because I have two dogs and it was clogged to hell. I was very surprised at how completely I was able to take it apart. It broke down into small enough pieces that I was able to just wash it in my kitchen sink and dry all the parts in my dish rack. I was able to do that with only removing six screws. One of my main complaints with products these days is how disposable they are. This vacuum is very serviceable. I&#x27;ve noticed a couple bad reviews, to that I will say: A poor craftsman blames his tools.</li>
            <li> This was my first vacuum purchase, ever.  I was really quite pleased with the vacuum for the first six months of use.  It picked up a lot of dirt, dust, and dog hair, never clogged, and was easy to maneuver and clean.  However, I believe the brush is this units Achilles&#x27;s heel.  The brush has two small bearings, between the yellow roller tube and the black end-caps.  On my unit, one of the bearings failed, causing the brush to mis-align itself and start eating away at the outer plastic guides and the roller itself.  Now, this failure did not happen under my own use, but I doubt the wife used it for more than several seconds after the failure - because it makes a terrible grinding sound - but it quickly became damaged beyond repair because of the melted plastic...  Soft plastic and quickly spinning parts make a LOT of heat, very quickly.  Eureka has said the brush is covered under the warranty, and has since mailed a replacement (its been over a week and I have yet to see it, however).  The roller cover, which is the actual face of the vacuum, I complained about via email, afterward, and have yet to hear back on its warranty coverage.  If they choose not to replace it, the new brush will fail quite quickly, since it will not be held in place properly.&lt;br /&gt;I think this unit generates a lot more heat than the chincy plastic parts can handle.&lt;br /&gt;Great engineering here, honestly.  But poor quality materials ruin it for me.</li>
            <li> Awful vacuum...awful! bought this thing last weekend. Lasted one vacuum before the belt died and smelled like it melted. Weak!</li>
            <li> 1) Gets so hot in a minute even in a cold room that feels you are next to a blowing heater . 2) Unpleasant smell. 3) The tool attachment hose is too short and hard to extend. When attempt to pull / extend the hose, the light weight vacuum cleaner starts rolling forwards. 4) Small collecting can, fills up after vacuuming one or two rooms. 5) Hard to use the on/off switch - bad location, can&#x27;t hold and turn the vacuum cleaner on with only one hand - you need two hands free to turn it on !</li>
            <li> We have had ours for three years or so (actually lost track). I&#x27;m searching for a new power cord today because years of wrapping it around the back has worn the original one thin. My home shop has a powerful air compressor that I use to blow out the canister and filter(s) after nearly every use, this helps maintain pick-up ability a lot. Parts are not that expensive online (the cord is going to run about $22), relatively inexpensive. *Ours is used weekly on the main floor of our house (about 1,100 sq ft.).</li>
            <li> Yes I have a $400+ Dyson and it was great until I had to start taking the roller off and unwrapping my daughters hair from it before it would work. Long story short, I am now in an apt after moving out of our house and needed another vacuum. My daughter stayed with her Dad to finish college so her hair is not on my floor now. I did 2 rooms and emptied it as it was full of new carpet fuzz and DIRT. Yes, small holding tube but easy to manage and assembled quickly and easily. Sucked up stuff I was disgusted to see was in new carpet even!! WOW. Got it at Target for $99. Great for the $, hope it lasts!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of this model about 2 months ago and 2 of them now shut down for some reason. After about 5-10 minutes the units turns off. If  wait  until the next morning, they start w/o a problem. Maybbe they are over heating and then shut down? Anyone else have this issue?</li>
            <li> Great suction but a pain to maintain.  You won&#x27;t believe all the dust and dirt this vac sucks out of your carpets.  Unfortunately, some of it gets all over when you release the canister contents into the trashbin.  You do have to empty it often, or the dirt backs up and cleaning the unit is a real pain.  I always have trouble putting the parts together again.  But the suction is sooooooo good, it is still worth the cleaning hassle once in a while.</li>
            <li> Seen this same one at Walmart for $88.... Buy for my Dad to make things easier for him.... Except for price... Reviews were ok.. Mentions about breaking in some reviews...</li>
            <li> I am so sorry that i bought this vacuum. I have had it for almost a month. I keep a pretty clean home, vacuum regularly, dust, no pets, etc.. Anyway, I find myself having to empty the canister after cleaning just two rooms of my townhouse. When I do empty it, dust gets EVERYWHERE. I was covered in dust today before work. I tried continuing to vacuum after cleaning the vacuum and more dust shot out of the vacuum and my entire main level was clouded in dust. My children were home and I am seriously worried that this vacuum is making our home dirtier rather than cleaner. And for the last month, I have spent just as much time trying to keep the vacuum clean as I have actually cleaning my house.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Hoover Windtunnel which after a short three years of service was not yielding the performance it used to. Planned obsolescence I guess. This little unit is lighter than the old one and has some pretty impressive suction capability. I went to work on the living room carpet and got a whole canister full of pet hair and dust on the first go. When emptying the canister you can really see the fine particulates the vacuum captures. I was pretty impressed, and the carpet looks great now. At the price, it does what it does very well although you sacrifice features such as a cord rewind and an on-off switch for the brush. I have not tried the hose extension yet, and my wife has not yet tried the vacuum. I&#x27;m certain she is bound to have something to say about it so I&#x27;ll update the review once she&#x27;s had a chance to use it.</li>
