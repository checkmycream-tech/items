    <ol>
            <li>Great shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant smelling, and does a great job getting your hair and scalp clean.  </li>
            <li>so it lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>but it does a good job</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>To my surprise it gives great volume and makes my hair easy to style.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice smell but it and the lavender conditioner used together can be drying to your hair.</li>
            <li>stuff smells great and leaves my hair SUPER</li>
            <li>This stuff does wonders for keeping my scalp happy, and my hair looks and feels amazing for the first couple of shampoos.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I am a lavender junkie; I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Like the Biotin Jason Shampoo and Conditioner better.</li>
            <li>I really had to get used to the fact that this does not have a great amount of lather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Quality product with a very nice lavender scent - highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I get a whiff of my hair all day long and the fragrance is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It is so strong</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair looking full and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>I suggest for those interested in this wonderful product to do their comparison price check, as I later found out</li>
            <li>This is a nice shampoo with a strong, pure lavender smell.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and cleans your hair very well with no residue after rinsed.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a pretty good price considering most bottles of natural shampoo that I buy are all 8oz, sometimes 12, but this bottle is 16oz</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because I read that I needed to use a special type of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo to extend the life of my keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Over time, I added other Jason lavender products and I must say , when used in combination, they produce a unique, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Following a couple of uses I am very pleased with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had to use so much oil in my hair to makeup for my ends snapping so easily.</li>
            <li>Except lavender is not one of my favorite fragrances personally, but it isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells more like musk than lavender and strips every bit of natural moisture from my hair.</li>
            <li>Great smelling, love that it comes from small, family business and that it&#x27;s natural and vegan.</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to evaluate and use this product for the future, but it seems to hit all the marks of a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>However, it is also cheaper, so I think it probably works out to be about the same price in the end, even if you have to use more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s necessary to wash more than once to generate a sufficient lather.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, soaps (suds) up pretty well for being all natural, smells really good.</li>
            <li>Great, natural shampoo without any harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>I was really bummed out.</li>
            <li>REALLY over-powering smell.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I think that would be too much lavender for me.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very affordable (another bonus).</li>
            <li>My husband commented on how much thicker my hair looked without my telling him that I used this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because I have a really dry, sensitive scalp that usually does best with natural products containing lavender and chamomile.</li>
            <li>Apparently I, like many people, are sensitive to the foaming agent sodium laurel sulfate (SLS) used in the vast majority of shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>This product is a natural one that doesn&#x27;t have any of the chemicals that normal shampoo has in it.</li>
            <li>Even thou I am happy with the product I was shocked to have paid 50% more at Amazon, in comparison to other online retailers!</li>
            <li>Wanted Lavender shampoo so decided to try Jason Natural Lavender.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos, but the fresh lavender fragrance makes up for it.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because the product seems to be decent enough.</li>
            <li>I really like how it&#x27;s got natural ingredients and less (or no) preservatives.  </li>
            <li>Also, it seems like I have to use more of this product than the other sulfate-free shampoos I have used in the past (Carol&#x27;s Daughter, for one).</li>

            <li> It actually left a lasting dryness that my favorite conditioner hasn&#x27;t improved. :(</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave it oily, nor does is over dry your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that this is common when switching to natural shampoos, so I am going to stick with it until the bottle is empty and then make a final ruling.  </li>

            <li> It can cause a dry, red, itchy flakey condition in these folks (usually they then spend lots of money on anti-dandruff shampoos that also contain SLS).  </li>
            <li> Well this shampoo does not contain any SLS yet lathers just as well as any other.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a shampoo with Tea Tree in it, but it seemed to leave my hair a little oily.  </li>
            <li> it is 50% cheaper at two other online retailers!!</li>
            <li> It gives it body without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair is already dry and this was making my hair horrible.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with Amazon&#x27;s prices as of lately!!</li>

            <li> This shampoo is great for my fine hair. It gives it body without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> I am a lavender junkie; I love this shampoo.  I get a whiff of my hair all day long and the fragrance is wonderful.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender, smells like lemon bathroom cleaner.</li>
            <li> Great, natural shampoo without any harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> This shampoo cured my years of chronic dandruff problems in a couple weeks.  Apparently I, like many people, are sensitive to the foaming agent sodium laurel sulfate (SLS) used in the vast majority of shampoos.  It can cause a dry, red, itchy flakey condition in these folks (usually they then spend lots of money on anti-dandruff shampoos that also contain SLS).  Well this shampoo does not contain any SLS yet lathers just as well as any other.  Quality product with a very nice lavender scent - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice smell but it and the lavender conditioner used together can be drying to your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is already dry and this was making my hair horrible. I had to use so much oil in my hair to makeup for my ends snapping so easily. I was really bummed out. It actually left a lasting dryness that my favorite conditioner hasn&#x27;t improved. :(</li>
            <li> It took a while until Jason&#x27;s lavender grew on me . Over time, I added other Jason lavender products and I must say , when used in combination, they produce a unique, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> REALLY over-powering smell.  This does not smell like an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; product because of the scent.  It definitely smells like there is a chemical perfume added.  It is so strong I cannot use it-- I can taste lavender after I do!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, soaps (suds) up pretty well for being all natural, smells really good. Also, it&#x27;s a pretty good price considering most bottles of natural shampoo that I buy are all 8oz, sometimes 12, but this bottle is 16oz so it lasts a good while.</li>

I suggest for those interested in this wonderful product to do their comparison price check, as I later found out it is 50% cheaper at two other online retailers!! very disappointed with Amazon&#x27;s prices as of lately!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I have a really dry, sensitive scalp that usually does best with natural products containing lavender and chamomile. This stuff does wonders for keeping my scalp happy, and my hair looks and feels amazing for the first couple of shampoos. However, after a few shampoos, my naturally blond hair starts to get dull and gross looking and I have to break out a salon shampoo about once a week to get the residue out. Also, it seems like I have to use more of this product than the other sulfate-free shampoos I have used in the past (Carol&#x27;s Daughter, for one). However, it is also cheaper, so I think it probably works out to be about the same price in the end, even if you have to use more.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m still getting used to this shampoo.  I colored my hair and followed it with a keratin treatment. I bought this shampoo because I read that I needed to use a special type of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo to extend the life of my keratin treatment.  I decided on this specific one because of the reviews and the lavender scent.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great and leaves my hair SUPER soft.&lt;br /&gt;However, after about 36 hours, my hair feels the way it would have felt after not being washed for 3-4 days when I was using regular shampoo. I&#x27;ve read that this is common when switching to natural shampoos, so I am going to stick with it until the bottle is empty and then make a final ruling.  I will update this review at that point!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells more like musk than lavender and strips every bit of natural moisture from my hair. It was as if I washed my hair with Dawn detergent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Nature&#x27;s Gate instead.</li>
            <li> Following a couple of uses I am very pleased with the shampoo. It does leave my hair looking full and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, has a nice smell. Like the Biotin Jason Shampoo and Conditioner better.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!  Smells nice and cleans your hair very well with no residue after rinsed.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  Except lavender is not one of my favorite fragrances personally, but it isn&#x27;t that strong. I don&#x27;t use the matching conditioner for this reason. I think that would be too much lavender for me.  I really had to get used to the fact that this does not have a great amount of lather.  It&#x27;s necessary to wash more than once to generate a sufficient lather.  I understand this is the price of a non sulfate shampoo though so that&#x27;s to be expected.  I really like how it&#x27;s got natural ingredients and less (or no) preservatives.  I have fine hair and this does not weigh it down.  My scalp feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Great smelling, love that it comes from small, family business and that it&#x27;s natural and vegan. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used but it does a good job and it&#x27;s very affordable (another bonus).</li>
            <li> This is a nice shampoo with a strong, pure lavender smell.  It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos, but the fresh lavender fragrance makes up for it.</li>
            <li> This product does add volume to my thinning hair.  My husband commented on how much thicker my hair looked without my telling him that I used this shampoo.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Wanted Lavender shampoo so decided to try Jason Natural Lavender.  To my surprise it gives great volume and makes my hair easy to style.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smelling, and does a great job getting your hair and scalp clean.  I had been using a shampoo with Tea Tree in it, but it seemed to leave my hair a little oily.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave it oily, nor does is over dry your scalp.  Will definitely continue to evaluate and use this product for the future, but it seems to hit all the marks of a great shampoo.</li>

            <li> Love it! Smells wonderful.</li>
