            <li>I love the natural scent, it&#x27;s not too manly or feminine, its very nuetral but wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love the natural scent, it&#x27;s not too manly or feminine, its very nuetral but wonderful.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s aluminum free (some crystal deodorants are not).  </li>

            <li>have been using this stuff for years, stink free.</li>

            <li>You don&#x27;t have to keep it in the fridge, I just cool it in there to harden it together a bit.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to keep it in the fridge, I just cool it in there to harden it together a bit.</li>
            <li>And true to the advertising</li>
            <li>Be sure to have reasonable expectations before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Firstly, my item arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>I very sensitive to deodorants and most cause me irritation over time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more easy to use that the stone, but with the same quality as the one stone.</li>
            <li>A few sprays under each arm and your good to go, the sprays are a fine mist</li>
            <li>it helped a little, I ended up giving it to a friend that liked it ALOT, I just wanted the smell to smell better, there was no sent.</li>
            <li>I have used the Thai Crystal stick for a few months and it works great</li>
            <li>The ingredients are similar to my own recipe.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are similar to my own recipe.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to finally be free of those wretched chemicals found in every other deodorant I&#x27;ve used throughout my life.</li>
            <li>The trick to its effectiveness is to apply right out of the shower, before  you have a chance to sweat.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to put it on right after a shower, before you start to stink.</li>
            <li>More money wasted finding a good natural deodorant</li>
            <li>I have tried several &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; that weren&#x27;t really so, and I have tried to make my own deodorant, which is what I do now (alternating with Schmidt&#x27;s deodorant sold here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>(if you skip this step, it will be gritty), just till warm, mix it again really well</li>
            <li>(if you skip this step, it will be gritty), just till warm, mix it again really well</li>
            <li>on my second bottle now, and I think these fine folks have made a customer for life!</li>
            <li>1 heaping tablespoon of baking soda and enough organic coconut oil to be able to mix it all together, but not too runny.</li>
            <li>1 heaping tablespoon of baking soda and enough organic coconut oil to be able to mix it all together, but not too runny.</li>
            <li>I tried this all summer and intentionally stood out in the hot sun for hours waiting to see if my smelly BO would  return.</li>
            <li>this is the only one that i have found, and i am in love.</li>
            <li>It has no odor, and you can even put on deodorant on top of this stuff for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>That is more of an issue with the seller than the actual product itself.  </li>
            <li>I tried the stone first before buying this...</li>
            <li>It is gentle in my underarms, and I even use it in my shoes right before I put them in in the morning.</li>
            <li>one tiny complaint is that, after many sprays, you can see tiny salt crystals forming in the solution, settling to the bottom of the bottle, and occasionally getting stuck in the &amp;#34;straw.&amp;#34;  To remedy this, follow the printed instructions on the bottle and rinse the straw thoroughly with warm water; specifically, take the cap off, dip the straw in a cup of warm water and squeeze the sprayer several times to let the warm water melt the salt crystals and clear the clogged straw.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I have to balance how much I have to spray so that it works but does not drip too much.</li>
            <li>It feels like water when sprayed on but it works very well.</li>
            <li>it is chemical free, and one bottle lasts several months.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and wish my skin did too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 7 years, and I have nothing but good things to say about it.  </li>
            <li>i live in FL and that means it is HOT</li>
            <li>For something that looks and feels like plain water, this stuff does an amazing job.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it works and it&#x27;s a natural option.  </li>
            <li>Also the nozzle did get clogged once but running it under hot water fixed that problem.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone suffering with smelly BO.</li>
            <li>The spray form completely solves that problem and works much better than that or any of the other stinky chemical varieties of deodorant.</li>
            <li>The stone works a little better than this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To know that not only this spray works better than other deodorants, but it also is odorless and chemical free gives me such peace of mind</li>
            <li>Better yet, it last a long long time and your pits feel free and clear, not sticky or glued together like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I saturated my underarms, figuring that&#x27;s the ONLY way it could work for me, but within the space of a week I realized that only 3 or 4 sprays under each arm would keep me smelling shower fresh ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li>The salty solution (among the other safe ingredients in this) create a hyper-tonic environment; water rushes out of the bacteria by osmosis, killing the bacteria as water goes from low salt to a high salt concentration, it leaves the bacteria into the salt, therefore killing the bacteria...and the odor it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, it left no residue at all on my clothing, and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>you still want to try the Thai mist, here is my old review (the recipe for the deodorant I make myself is at the bottom):</li>
            <li>i have searched the globe for a natural deodorant that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is a Natural deoderant that reall works.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff because this product is made up of a salty solution that actually kills odor causing bacteria, by creating a harsh environment that bacteria will not thrive in.</li>
            <li>After you get that all mixed together well enough that it isn&#x27;t gritty anymore, then cool in the fridge.</li>
            <li>After you get that all mixed together well enough that it isn&#x27;t gritty anymore, then cool in the fridge.</li>
            <li>This spray looks like a much better alternative though the amount charged here is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I did perspire in the hot weather and during Zumba, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li>It sucks to have the straw clog up on me on a busy morning, as I&#x27;m scrambling to get ready for work, but nothing can be done about this, really.  </li>
            <li>Wow totally amazed.</li>
            <li>This product did NOTHING for me as far as masking sweat, ONLY smell.  </li>
            <li>I tried the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; kind of crystal deodorant before, but I found that to be abrasive and difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about the long term effects of aluminum (contained in most antiperspirant/deodorants), but I still get unbelievable protection...with no staining of my shirts!  </li>
            <li>Gave me enough courage to throw away all of my smelly stained white T-shirts and bought new ones.</li>
            <li>So the last time I travelled, I transfered some of this liquid into a small plastic spray bottle i purchased from my local drug store and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is even more natural (only mineral salts and purified water), so I was very skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li>Much longer than other spray</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I noticed that after a couple weeks of use, it seems to have rendered useless as my odors are let to clear the room once more.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that if you are not careful you can spray the liquid into your mouth!</li>
            <li>Basically what the title says, it lasts a long time odor-wise, but it won&#x27;t stop me from sweating for very long, and I don&#x27;t really sweat a lot.</li>

            <li> I tried the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; kind of crystal deodorant before, but I found that to be abrasive and difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about the long term effects of aluminum (contained in most antiperspirant/deodorants), but I still get unbelievable protection...with no staining of my shirts!  </li>
            <li> Gave me enough courage to throw away all of my smelly stained white T-shirts and bought new ones.</li>
            <li> So the last time I travelled, I transfered some of this liquid into a small plastic spray bottle i purchased from my local drug store and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is even more natural (only mineral salts and purified water), so I was very skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> Much longer than other spray</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I noticed that after a couple weeks of use, it seems to have rendered useless as my odors are let to clear the room once more.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that if you are not careful you can spray the liquid into your mouth!</li>
            <li> Basically what the title says, it lasts a long time odor-wise, but it won&#x27;t stop me from sweating for very long, and I don&#x27;t really sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> There is just no excuse to keep smearing those aluminum loaded deodorants under your arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this deodorant for a long time, and then, it just stopped working for me.  </li>
            <li> any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used and last twice as long.</li>
            <li> so I can tell this bottle will last a long long time.</li>
            <li> I had tried several other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants, but they only held up for 7 or 8 hours before their effectiveness began to fade.  </li>
            <li> This is now the only deodorant I use and it lasts much longer than other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually sweat through the Dove high aluminum content deodorant I used to use too.</li>
            <li> and I did not have any issues all day long, and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritations like others have.</li>
            <li> It works, doesn&#x27;t smell, lasts a long time for one bottle.  </li>
            <li> Dry all day no body odor.</li>
            <li> (I use a popsicle stick) and add a few drops of any essential oil that you like, and that doesn&#x27;t cause you skin irritation.</li>

            <li> and it arrived carefully covered in plastic to prevent leaking on Oct. 19 in TN.</li>
            <li> Switched to this because of an allergy to other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask how that happens but don&#x27;t look down while spraying</li>
            <li> The pump was taped when I got the package, and the glue from the tape leaked down and the pumped didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> : when I perspired through the Thai crystal deodorant, it had no odor (I wasn&#x27;t stinky, and there was less perspiration).  </li>
            <li> It is half off at vitacost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get a little canning jar, any little glass jar will do.</li>

            <li> I once wore an older pair of shoes I had lying around to work, and I swear I could smell the &amp;#34;oldness&amp;#34; of the shoes all day, very faintly.  </li>
            <li> I think I will use this all winter instead of deodorant, but not sure it will do the job in the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it forms crystals in the bottom of the bottle that clog the nozzle :/</li>
            <li> The other problem is that it uncomfortably drips down the side of my body.</li>

            <li> I thought this would be a weak product</li>

            <li> Some people may have tried the crystal deodorant stone in the past, I know I have, and I hated it.  </li>
            <li> but it fell out of the base and cracked making it uncomfortable to use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried several &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; that weren&#x27;t really so, and I have tried to make my own deodorant, which is what I do now (alternating with Schmidt&#x27;s deodorant sold here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;If you still want to try the Thai mist, here is my old review (the recipe for the deodorant I make myself is at the bottom): Thai crystal deodorant mist: Ingredients: mineral salts and purified water.  It is aluminum free, non staining (true!), no alcohol, etc.  You can spray it on your feet, under your arms.. The trick to its effectiveness is to apply right out of the shower, before  you have a chance to sweat.  Now, I tested it in 100 plus degree weather, through Zumba, and here&#x27;s how it worked... I did perspire in the hot weather and during Zumba, but that&#x27;s expected. This is a deodorant, not an anti perspirant. I usually sweat through the Dove high aluminum content deodorant I used to use too. I had to reapply once during the day. Also had to do that with Dove deodorant.  Here is the difference: when I perspired through the Thai crystal deodorant, it had no odor (I wasn&#x27;t stinky, and there was less perspiration).  With Dove deodorant, I would be stinky and have more perspiration come through (sounds lovely, I know).  Dove also leaves streaks on my clothes, and the crystal deodorant doesn&#x27;t.  During regular indoor activities, I did not have a problem at all with perspiration or odor (with the Thai crystal deodorant mist).  Some people may have tried the crystal deodorant stone in the past, I know I have, and I hated it.  The Thai crystal mist is NOT the same thing.  First of all, it works and it&#x27;s a natural option.  It&#x27;s aluminum free (some crystal deodorants are not).  It dries fast, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, it left no residue at all on my clothing, and it works pretty well. There is just no excuse to keep smearing those aluminum loaded deodorants under your arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this deodorant for a long time, and then, it just stopped working for me.  I started sweating through it almost immediately, and it just had no effect on me anymore.  I have switched to Schmidt&#x27;s Cedarwood and Juniper, and have been happy with it for a very long time, alternating it with one I make myself. I love the natural scent, it&#x27;s not too manly or feminine, its very nuetral but wonderful. They do make five different scents, if you want something different.  The ingredients are similar to my own recipe. I get a little canning jar, any little glass jar will do. I mix just under 1/2 cup of arrowroot powder, 1 heaping tablespoon of baking soda and enough organic coconut oil to be able to mix it all together, but not too runny. Then I microwave it (if you skip this step, it will be gritty), just till warm, mix it again really well (I use a popsicle stick) and add a few drops of any essential oil that you like, and that doesn&#x27;t cause you skin irritation. I am currently using lemongrass essential oil in mine, but my next one will be a mix of cedarwood and grapefruit! After you get that all mixed together well enough that it isn&#x27;t gritty anymore, then cool in the fridge. You don&#x27;t have to keep it in the fridge, I just cool it in there to harden it together a bit. You might experiment a few times, until you get the consistency you like.I started sweating through it almost immediately, and it just had no effect on me anymore.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for you for over 30 YEARS!!! I&#x27;ve tried everything and this worked within the 1st week I started using this product. I tried this all summer and intentionally stood out in the hot sun for hours waiting to see if my smelly BO would  return. It didn&#x27;t. I forgot how awful I smelled. Gave me enough courage to throw away all of my smelly stained white T-shirts and bought new ones. I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone suffering with smelly BO. I spray everywhere and it really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I only use spray crystal deodorant.  Nothing else seems to work for me, and sometimes this is the only place that I can find it.  I like the fact that is has no odor, and I feel like I am wearing nothing.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple of decades now and it works great - lasts all day, even in the hot Arizona summers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything. It works really well. However, the last order I made, I never received it. They said the Post Office had it and I ended up never getting the product and getting a REFUND...BUT, I NEEDED the DEODORANT.</li>
            <li> Works great and no aluminum.</li>
            <li> I have used the Thai Crystal stick for a few months and it works great but it fell out of the base and cracked making it uncomfortable to use. There is no stain or odor and it works for many hours. This spray looks like a much better alternative though the amount charged here is ridiculous. It is half off at vitacost.&lt;br /&gt;As of April 7th I have used this spray now for 4 months and it works well. The only problem is that if you are not careful you can spray the liquid into your mouth! Don&#x27;t ask how that happens but don&#x27;t look down while spraying and if you do keep your mouth closed. I learned that the hard way. The other problem is that it uncomfortably drips down the side of my body. I have to balance how much I have to spray so that it works but does not drip too much. Also the nozzle did get clogged once but running it under hot water fixed that problem. Now another issue is that the size of this spray bottle is larger than permitted by our dear take all our rights away TSA for carry on board aircraft luggage. So the last time I travelled, I transfered some of this liquid into a small plastic spray bottle i purchased from my local drug store and it worked fine. So with all its limitations this product works well.</li>
            <li> Best deoderant I ever used</li>
            <li> Switched to this because of an allergy to other deodorants. Have been using for about 6 years now. It feels like water when sprayed on but it works very well. This is now the only deodorant I use and it lasts much longer than other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> If my sister hadn&#x27;t given me a bottle to try, I wouldn&#x27;t have given this product a second glance, because I came to understand over the years that only the strongest antiperspirant/deodorant would last me all day.  I had tried several other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants, but they only held up for 7 or 8 hours before their effectiveness began to fade.  This deodorant is even more natural (only mineral salts and purified water), so I was very skeptical at first.  One day I finally gave in and tried it out.  At first I saturated my underarms, figuring that&#x27;s the ONLY way it could work for me, but within the space of a week I realized that only 3 or 4 sprays under each arm would keep me smelling shower fresh ALL DAY.  I can&#x27;t put into words how happy I am to have \\&quot;discovered\\&quot; this product!!  Now I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about the long term effects of aluminum (contained in most antiperspirant/deodorants), but I still get unbelievable protection...with no staining of my shirts!  Wow - truly amazing!!</li>
            <li> i have searched the globe for a natural deodorant that lasts all day. this is the only one that i have found, and i am in love. it works all day and keeps me smell free. it&#x27;s the only deodorant i will use. i live in FL and that means it is HOT and i sweat A LOT. this keeps me fresh! it doesn&#x27;t stop the wetness, but that is not important to me. it is chemical free, and one bottle lasts several months.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this spray. I&#x27;ve tried alternatives, but this spray is the best. I wore a sweater to work yesterday and I did not have any issues all day long, and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritations like others have. This will be the only deodorant I will buy from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this with ground shipping on Oct. 14 and it arrived carefully covered in plastic to prevent leaking on Oct. 19 in TN. Nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 7 years, and I have nothing but good things to say about it.  It works, doesn&#x27;t smell, lasts a long time for one bottle.  I tried the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; kind of crystal deodorant before, but I found that to be abrasive and difficult to apply.  The spray form completely solves that problem and works much better than that or any of the other stinky chemical varieties of deodorant.</li>
            <li> This spray Thai deodorant is an excellent product, the best I&#x27;ve never used. I recommend to try this product, the cost is lower in relation with the quality of the product. It&#x27;s more easy to use that the stone, but with the same quality as the one stone.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 2 years now and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> For something that looks and feels like plain water, this stuff does an amazing job.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you order.</li>
            <li> I was reading others views decided to try it. Wow totally amazed. Dry all day no body odor. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product does not cover up odor, so its NOT a deodorant, and it also does not contain aluminum to block pores, so its NOT a anti-antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff because this product is made up of a salty solution that actually kills odor causing bacteria, by creating a harsh environment that bacteria will not thrive in. It has no odor, and you can even put on deodorant on top of this stuff for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works:&lt;br /&gt;Salt dehydrates bacteria through diffusion. The salty solution (among the other safe ingredients in this) create a hyper-tonic environment; water rushes out of the bacteria by osmosis, killing the bacteria as water goes from low salt to a high salt concentration, it leaves the bacteria into the salt, therefore killing the bacteria...and the odor it causes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this stuff for years, stink free. Make sure to apply liberally and all around your armpit ( i use 3-5 sprays)</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. To be frank I thought this would be a weak product but it works as good as any medium strength deodorant I think.</li>
            <li> I like this Thai Crystal Mist Deodorant because it has no colorants, no perfumes, and it works. It is gentle in my underarms, and I even use it in my shoes right before I put them in in the morning. It always works!</li>
            <li> When I first got this, it worked amazingly as my, erm, odors can be a bit overwhelming at times even when I use top brand deoderants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I noticed that after a couple weeks of use, it seems to have rendered useless as my odors are let to clear the room once more.</li>
            <li> An 8 oz bottle of water. More money wasted finding a good natural deodorant</li>
            <li> Great product though it may irritate the skin of some ...as  it did me but not my friend.  I really like this product and wish my skin did too.  I&#x27;m back to using Secret while admiring this bottle every time I peek under the sink.</li>
            <li> I like the product, it works well, my armpits are not so sweaty/smelly.  That is a plus.  The pump was taped when I got the package, and the glue from the tape leaked down and the pumped didn&#x27;t work.  I bought a little pump bottle from Walmart for 99 cents and poured some of the product into it to use it.  That is more of an issue with the seller than the actual product itself.  I think I will use this all winter instead of deodorant, but not sure it will do the job in the summer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since a doctor and health store recommended it because of a bout with breast cancer.</li>
            <li> Firstly, my item arrived very quickly. Came with a piece of tape over it to prevent leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how happy I am with this product, it works better then any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used and last twice as long. I am thrilled to finally be free of those wretched chemicals found in every other deodorant I&#x27;ve used throughout my life. The trick is to put it on right after a shower, before you start to stink. A few sprays under each arm and your good to go, the sprays are a fine mist so I can tell this bottle will last a long long time. Much longer than other spray deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To know that not only this spray works better than other deodorants, but it also is odorless and chemical free gives me such peace of mind I just can&#x27;t tell you. Better yet, it last a long long time and your pits feel free and clear, not sticky or glued together like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy with this product I want to kiss the seller on the cheek and say thankyou!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it forms crystals in the bottom of the bottle that clog the nozzle :/ Rinsing the nozzle or shaking the bottle prior to spraying helps, but it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> This is a Natural deoderant that reall works. I have used it for years. Try it you will love it..........Gene</li>
            <li> it helped a little, I ended up giving it to a friend that liked it ALOT, I just wanted the smell to smell better, there was no sent. and did not work with my deodorants at all :(</li>
            <li> I very sensitive to deodorants and most cause me irritation over time.  This one was no exception.  I started getting redness after a couple of months of daily use.</li>
            <li> ...but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  I can say for a FACT this spray works because I tested it out: I once wore an older pair of shoes I had lying around to work, and I swear I could smell the &amp;#34;oldness&amp;#34; of the shoes all day, very faintly.  The next day I wore the same pair, but this time I sprayed the shoes thoroughly, inside and out.  And voila, no smell.  None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray itself is not scented, so it&#x27;s not a matter of &amp;#34;covering up one smell with another&amp;#34; like some products do.  There is just no smell, none.  And that&#x27;s all I wanted.  And true to the advertising, this spray doesn&#x27;t stain, so I spray it all over my entire wardrobe and all over the house, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some confusion regarding this product, and its &amp;#34;stone&amp;#34; counterpart; it&#x27;s meant as a deodorant only, NOT an anti-perspirant.  This product did NOTHING for me as far as masking sweat, ONLY smell.  Be sure to have reasonable expectations before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one tiny complaint is that, after many sprays, you can see tiny salt crystals forming in the solution, settling to the bottom of the bottle, and occasionally getting stuck in the &amp;#34;straw.&amp;#34;  To remedy this, follow the printed instructions on the bottle and rinse the straw thoroughly with warm water; specifically, take the cap off, dip the straw in a cup of warm water and squeeze the sprayer several times to let the warm water melt the salt crystals and clear the clogged straw.  It sucks to have the straw clog up on me on a busy morning, as I&#x27;m scrambling to get ready for work, but nothing can be done about this, really.  It&#x27;s not the fault of the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second bottle now, and I think these fine folks have made a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it works!  I&#x27;ve tried others but this is the brand that works best for the money.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use this because I seem to be allergic to everything else.  Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Aloe vera gel keeps more sweat away this this does.</li>
            <li> Basically what the title says, it lasts a long time odor-wise, but it won&#x27;t stop me from sweating for very long, and I don&#x27;t really sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> This product is like water. I tried the stone first before buying this... The stone works a little better than this one.</li>
            <li> Keeps the stench away during 100 degree days with lots of humidity! I&#x27;m a greasy Italian and require a second &amp;#34;freshening up&amp;#34; in the late afternoon if I&#x27;ve been exercising a lot. Makes sense and is no problem. I prefer this pump spray over the traditional &amp;#34;rock&amp;#34; form.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I have been using the stone for some time and I like this much better. Excellent product. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Great product! Can be sprayed anywhere on the body - even in your shoes!</li>
