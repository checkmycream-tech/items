            <li>Shampoo was just okay otherwise.  </li>

            <li>I love Jason products.. just not this one.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product and will order this again.  </li>
            <li>is very quick.</li>
            <li>This shampoo left my hair feeling super clean, with a brilliant, noticeable shine!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a fine product.  </li>
            <li>I like the &amp;#34;chemical free shampoo&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as well as the original.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave hair shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>Natural beauty products are great, I always go natural and even organic where I can</li>
            <li>and they are not near as good as this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiney and clean, my scalp does far better with this shampoo as compared to any chaeper brands.</li>
            <li>No expensive Salon shampoo or organic product beats this!  </li>

            <li>The pictured item is the original Sea Kelp Shampoo, the one I received is Sea Kelp Smoothing (New).</li>

            <li>I really like how the seaweed works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super impressed, this shampoo seems to strip my hair pretty hard.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finishing out the bottle because the stuff was more money than I like to waste</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for nearly 10 years maybe longer.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>I guess having colored hair and using a natural shampoo do not go hand in hand, I could not get my fingers thru my hair once this shampoo was in my hair, it stripped it and was like straw afterwards, be</li>
            <li>but I may have to re-think natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Jason Natural Sea Kelp Shampoo?</li>
            <li>It gives my hair body and makes it so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Switching shampoos every so often, this one you should give a try it not bad.&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried the other jason shampoos but this was the first one.</li>

            <li> After having used this shampoo a few times now, I really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> My wifes hair is really long and this shampoo realy makes it shine.</li>
            <li> My hair has body, shine, not weighted down.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected, though not better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> once I get it dried.</li>
            <li> Not oily, just heavy.</li>
            <li> I do find that my hair is less frizzy when I use it, but it also feels a little heavier than usual</li>
            <li> although it could be that we have really hard water, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel luxurious or silky, even coupled with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> At least for me, it did nothing.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a coating on the hair to the point that my hair looks nearly as dirty coming out of the shower as it did going in.  </li>
            <li> I tried Suave Naturals and my hair frizzed up like crazy, so then I try Dr. Brauner&#x27;s all-purpose. .</li>
            <li> Itchy and uncomfortable!  </li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>

            <li> its good for your hair. its good for your scalp. give it a try, I gnow u&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Switching shampoos every so often, this one you should give a try it not bad.&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried the other jason shampoos but this was the first one.I loved it 5 years ago and seen it keep my hair balanced.</li>
            <li> After having used this shampoo a few times now, I really can&#x27;t complain! The smell is pleasantly tropical and feels like a shampoo should. Lathers well and doesn&#x27;t leave my supremely curly hair tangled. Thanks JASON!</li>
            <li> I would say that this shampoo is just okay... although it could be that we have really hard water, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel luxurious or silky, even coupled with the conditioner.  It smells really good, though, and I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great and my hair feels awesome. On LOVE. The conditioner is even better!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for nearly 10 years maybe longer. My hair doesn&#x27;t get out of control. I really like how the seaweed works. I use seaweed soap also. My hair is shiney and clean, my scalp does far better with this shampoo as compared to any chaeper brands. My wifes hair is really long and this shampoo realy makes it shine. It is not oily at all, it is a really great product.&lt;br /&gt;I ran low on money for awhile and used some cheaper brands and they are not near as good as this shampoo. So buy in confidence, this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING product!  My hair is so perfect!  This company must have some magic ingredients that makes hair gorgeous.  I have to be the pickiest person when it comes to hair products.  I have tried everything out there.    No expensive Salon shampoo or organic product beats this!  I have a fair amount of fine hair.  My hair has body, shine, not weighted down.  It&#x27;s perfect!  BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!   EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair feeling super clean, with a brilliant, noticeable shine! I am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Sea kep shampoo  is great for my perm damaged hair.  It makes your hair so soft.  I getit here because it is a good price and delivery is very quick.</li>
            <li> I developed Psoriasis a couple years ago...  especially on my scalp!  Itchy and uncomfortable!  Someone told me that this shampoo helps a lot with easing the itch of psoriasis.  Wrong!  At least for me, it did nothing.  Shampoo was just okay otherwise.  But it did nothing to help my itching scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a fine product.  For the money, I have no complaints, but it is not the shampoo that we had in mind.</li>
            <li> Excellent results! My hair look so much better</li>
            <li> I guess having colored hair and using a natural shampoo do not go hand in hand, I could not get my fingers thru my hair once this shampoo was in my hair, it stripped it and was like straw afterwards, be warned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matching conditioner didnt make it better either.......</li>
            <li> I love Jason products.. just not this one.  It leaves a coating on the hair to the point that my hair looks nearly as dirty coming out of the shower as it did going in.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> Natural beauty products are great, I always go natural and even organic where I can but I may have to re-think natural shampoo. I tried Suave Naturals and my hair frizzed up like crazy, so then I try Dr. Brauner&#x27;s all-purpose. . .same thing. Jason Natural Sea Kelp Shampoo? Yep. Frizz City. I&#x27;m finishing out the bottle because the stuff was more money than I like to waste but I&#x27;ll probably go with a popular brand-name next time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair shiny and clean. There is a residue left over.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, though not better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. The fragrance is very strong (way too strong for my liking), though the scent does not stick around after I&#x27;ve dried my hair.</li>
            <li> The pictured item is the original Sea Kelp Shampoo, the one I received is Sea Kelp Smoothing (New). I don&#x27;t like it as well as the original.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this shampoo. I do find that my hair is less frizzy when I use it, but it also feels a little heavier than usual once I get it dried. Not oily, just heavy. The anti-frizz power hold up for pretty much my whole work day. That being said, I intend to finish the bottle and buy another. I do love the way it lathers and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and will order this again.  It gives my hair body and makes it so soft and shiny.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super impressed, this shampoo seems to strip my hair pretty hard. I&#x27;ve run into another Jason product I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with either. I like the &amp;#34;chemical free shampoo&amp;#34; (people... water is a chemical) just for its properties with my hair, it doesn&#x27;t strip like a detergent or leave a film like a soap... http://amzn.to/1KXzTRG</li>
