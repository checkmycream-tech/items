            <li>, I just wish it helped more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, you should be able to cope with the heat.</li>
            <li>It does burn a lot more if the acne is already a bump on your face</li>
            <li>To my dismay, I found that each area was now much MORE raised than before - because blisters had formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad amazon takes returns...</li>
            <li>Well now I can take as many as I want.</li>
            <li>It seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>an acne buster that&#x27;s easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great concept--if only it worked.  </li>
            <li>This works great on the occasional breakout and pesky zit.</li>
            <li>but it is not meant for primary treatment.</li>
            <li>beeps, but the light no longer turns on.&lt;br /&gt;same</li>
            <li>and the light comes on at the push of a button.  </li>
            <li>This worked much better than a Zeno, really easy to use, very high heat levels.</li>
            <li>and I am excited for the purchase I made .</li>
            <li>Klima Magic Wand (BECAUSE KLIMA HAS COPIED THIS PRODUCT WITH A HIGHER PRICE.)I recommend this Product to everyone because it is AMAZING.IT WORKS.</li>
            <li>The acne significantly heals faster than before.</li>
            <li>While the indicator lights come on (so I know the battery is good), the blue light that makes it work</li>
            <li>Cleared my chin zits right up!</li>
            <li>I tried many times to be certain this was true.</li>
            <li>When I received this product, I was super excited to start using it</li>
            <li>Since I rarely get pimples, I successfully used this product only ONE time.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing she told me is to remember to charge or change batteries often, even though the light is still shining If the device is low on power it doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is important to start treatment at the first sign of swelling and/or redness.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, it felt very hot, so I made sure to move it gently to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>This device gets WAY too hot!</li>
            <li>It seems to work better when I hold it completely still.</li>
            <li>Love this handy little tool!  </li>
            <li>but the packaging just didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>I like Zeno better as it gradually gets hot and near the end</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t over use, I got a blister on top of my pimple which made it worse because I thought the more times I put it on my pimple the better.</li>
            <li>so far so good but have only used twice</li>
            <li>I believed the heat was too much for my sensitive skin because my acne became more inflamed after each use.</li>
            <li>Packaging was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It heated up way too hot but did not hurt while I was using it</li>
            <li>so use caution or try using it on an area that isn&#x27;t too noticeable first to see how you react to it.</li>
            <li>Oh, one reviewer said it got so hot it burned them.  </li>
            <li>Husband found the heat a bit hot</li>
            <li>: It doesn&#x27;t get that hot.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks, China!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn at all and did exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>If you buy it, try it out on one pimple first.</li>
            <li>My son was the first to use it and raved at how much he likes the BrightTherapy.  </li>
            <li>When it beeps it&#x27;s time for new batteries, which can be often, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Buy a large pack of batteries at Costco.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased this item as a gift, so I have no idea if it really works or not.  </li>
            <li>From the reviews, this product seems to really help some people, but it does basically nothing for acne cysts that I get.</li>
            <li>This Zit zapper really works.  </li>
            <li>this product really seems to shorten the healing time of my acne!&lt;br /&gt;you</li>
            <li>I put the blue light on my acne spots for 2 min</li>
            <li>This product really works for me.</li>
            <li>it became much hotter</li>
            <li>I used it again when I once again got a pimple, and then again absolutely nothing happened</li>
            <li>It really depends on when you catch the zit.</li>
            <li>it works if you catch a blemish way way befor its really there</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.  </li>
            <li>really* works.</li>
            <li>so maybe I read too much into what the package looks like</li>
            <li>I was willing to keep it, but after trying both new batteries and rechargable ones nothing works.</li>
            <li>I have used this on large acne cysts that normally take two weeks to disappear.  </li>
            <li>It works well on mild to moderate pimples</li>
            <li>It actually does start to feel very hot like it&#x27;s burning, but doesn&#x27;t leave any burn mark.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes but this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li>at first this worked okay until i had a similar experience to other reviewers where the device stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviews, the device goes through batteries very quickly so I am using rechargable batteries</li>
            <li>single AA battery last about 2 weeks, Don&#x27;t buy cheap batteries like I did the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same like Zeno or a little bit better than Zeno because it has the temperature of Zeno and also blue light .</li>
            <li>or whenever I have an important event (due to the stress I&#x27;m guessing) which is why I got it</li>
            <li>saving up for a new one....</li>
            <li>I only used it on newly forming pimples because of the combination of heat and blue light.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the same with</li>
            <li>preferred this one over the \\&quot;Zeno\\&quot; because it seems much higher quality and has a blue LED</li>
            <li>This product has worked much better and faster than any spot treatments I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>However, they can get pretty big when they hit the surface.</li>
            <li>and it did nothing for me, my pimple was exactly the same!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first about buying this product but considering there were 5 out of 6 ppl that liked it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look professional and there is a UPC tag on the front with the same title as the first words of the product description here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Price is right, runs on a single battery</li>
            <li>It helped clear up his skin.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 15 year old.</li>
            <li>The blue LED and heat really seem to stop the bacteria growth before it can become a pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works to reduce pimple size but doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li>Gentlemen, I can&#x27;t really say the same for you.</li>
            <li>I never even got that far.  </li>
            <li>Spend the extra few bucks for a better one and get yourself some re chargeable</li>
            <li>This little device does a good job on very small blemishes that are in the early stages, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for the cyst pimples.</li>
            <li>this one, it gets hot relatively quick and at least to me, is hotter than Zeno but not where it burns....</li>
            <li>It works better with acne that are in the midst of &#x27;blooming&#x27; - whilst they are still small and red.</li>
            <li>I definitely believe they had a defective product or either OVERLY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but it will blister you if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>I tried with several brand new batteries from different packs.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re worried about burning your skin, I suggest you move it slightly while using until you know it won&#x27;t burn your skin or trying it first somewhere besides your face, like the inside of your wrist.</li>
            <li>put this handy little device on it and the pain will diminish and the sucker will shrink.  </li>
            <li>, it worked for me (the beeping is annoying and my boyfriend isn&#x27;t a fan of the blue light), but beauty isn&#x27;t always easy.</li>

            <li> preferred this one over the \\&quot;Zeno\\&quot; because it seems much higher quality and has a blue LED</li>
            <li> This product has worked much better and faster than any spot treatments I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> However, they can get pretty big when they hit the surface.</li>
            <li> and it did nothing for me, my pimple was exactly the same!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about buying this product but considering there were 5 out of 6 ppl that liked it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look professional and there is a UPC tag on the front with the same title as the first words of the product description here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Price is right, runs on a single battery</li>
            <li> It helped clear up his skin.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old.</li>
            <li> The blue LED and heat really seem to stop the bacteria growth before it can become a pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works to reduce pimple size but doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen, I can&#x27;t really say the same for you.</li>
            <li> I never even got that far.  </li>
            <li> Spend the extra few bucks for a better one and get yourself some re chargeable</li>
            <li> This little device does a good job on very small blemishes that are in the early stages, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for the cyst pimples.</li>
            <li> this one, it gets hot relatively quick and at least to me, is hotter than Zeno but not where it burns....</li>
            <li> It works better with acne that are in the midst of &#x27;blooming&#x27; - whilst they are still small and red.</li>
            <li> I definitely believe they had a defective product or either OVERLY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but it will blister you if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I tried with several brand new batteries from different packs.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re worried about burning your skin, I suggest you move it slightly while using until you know it won&#x27;t burn your skin or trying it first somewhere besides your face, like the inside of your wrist.</li>
            <li> put this handy little device on it and the pain will diminish and the sucker will shrink.  </li>
            <li> , it worked for me (the beeping is annoying and my boyfriend isn&#x27;t a fan of the blue light), but beauty isn&#x27;t always easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad because I think it would be a good instrument in battling pimples and blackheads, but without any instructions you could get in trouble for having a concealed weapon.</li>
            <li> I will be devastated if it leaves scars and am praying that it wont, however in the mean time the burn marks are much redder and are taking far longer to heal then any pimple would.</li>
            <li> Be very careful using this if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For the money I expected some success but after a few tries now following the instructions closely iy simply does not do anything.</li>
            <li> the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt hot to the touch during the cycles, but the heat was tolerable.</li>
            <li> Has been working very well for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll warn you it does really sting sometimes (especially on larger zits), but at least for me, it has never burned my skin.</li>
            <li> It does not work regardless how long or how often you use it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long.</li>
            <li> For some strange reason they don&#x27;t accept replacements either...</li>
            <li> and I do not have to buy new heads plus its small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently dealing with acne due to chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li> So I would recommend to people who want to use it for acne treatment as it&#x27;s cheaper than other products but only for 1 pimple at a time.</li>
            <li> I was worried by the reviewers that said it did nothing but burn their skin, but was encouraged enough by the other reviews to give it a try.</li>
            <li> also disappointed that there was not an option for sending this back and getting a new one, just getting a refund, so now I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth it to order a new one or just look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I was treating acne that was coming from deep down in the skin.  </li>
            <li> However, about half an hour later I felt itching at each of the areas on which the pimple remover had been used.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> There is a little heating sensation and leaves a red spot</li>
            <li> This product quit working as soon as the return window closed.  </li>
            <li> and I received what I expected.</li>
            <li> and is a lot hotter than i expected</li>
            <li> And immediately following the treatment the pimples did seem a bit smoother (I used it on a few).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on November 1st, used it a few times then suddenly on November 25th...</li>
            <li> I woke up this morning and one pimple is completely gone and the other one has shrunk at least 90%.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to do multiple treatments, which can be tedious, but if you follow the directions and are careful, you can get decent results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can not believe I spent that much money on something so useless.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth $50.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll still put your dermatologist&#x27;s kids through college, but if you&#x27;re like me those dermo appointments usually don&#x27;t correspond to the worst part of the breakout cycle (kinda like how your hair looks great the day you get it cut.).</li>
            <li> From the reviews I&#x27;m seeing, it looks like almost half may be defective.</li>
            <li> face is now a mess.</li>
            <li> This little gizmo just needs a AA battery.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a little oily</li>
            <li> Just a little redness that fades after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Blast the zit a few times during the day and it&#x27;s gone by the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Pimple Remover for about a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I tend to get a few zits a week.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> I needed something for my occasional breakouts and to stop my pimples from getting worse.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would keep these cysts from getting so large and painful, but once they are developing it didn&#x27;t do anything to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> It is designed to treat one or a small cluster of pimples</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and was so anxious to use it.  </li>
            <li> what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic</li>
            <li> Maybe you if you push too hard.</li>
            <li> I waited at least two minutes for it to beep</li>
            <li> I always used the Zeno without problems but this device burned, blistered and peeled a thick layer of skin off my face in an area wider than where I used it and is now taking forever to heal.</li>
            <li> Not sure who to contact!</li>
            <li> I have used Zeno in the past, and it seemed to help with some acne, but I was annoyed with the need to continuously buy applicator tips.</li>
            <li> If you have serious acne then this is not for</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t take the neg reviews seriously -</li>
            <li> This was my only hope of stopping the acne before it got bad.  </li>
            <li> so try to catch it earlier and it won&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
            <li> It burned my skin, leaving painful red circles!</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the other bad reviews.</li>
            <li> My husband tried on a bigger and painful acne and although it did shrink a bit and was less painful, it didn&#x27;t go away even though we applied it every night.  </li>
            <li> This product seemed to make my acne worse.</li>
            <li> not happy.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps mine was poorly manufactured...</li>
            <li> Tried it on some impending blemishes and it neither stopped their formation or decreased the inflammation.</li>
            <li> The refills for the Zeno are expensive, and the version I have is rechargeable, and has quit working.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 2 weeks with a once a day usage the unit died on me - now all it does is turn on, beep and then shuts off.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s complicated to use.</li>
            <li> useless...</li>
            <li> it eats batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t break out that bad</li>
            <li> when they are really bad, you have to use it twice.</li>
            <li> And helpful for those painful, under-the-skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> Got a painful zit --</li>
            <li> If it would have gotten rid of my cyst I would be raving about it, but it&#x27;s still here after four days. :(.</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for something that works for me :(</li>
            <li> I hate to agree -</li>
            <li> beeping is annoying but it serves a purpose on timing of treatment .</li>
            <li> Awful!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> It burned my skin, leaving painful red circles!</li>
            <li> so far so good but have only used twice</li>
            <li> Purchased this item as a gift, so I have no idea if it really works or not.  However, delivery was perfect.  It  came within 10 days of order date.  Packaging was exactly as described.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Hello I&#x27;ve bought this item 8 months ago and I am excited for the purchase I made . It&#x27;s the same like Zeno or a little bit better than Zeno because it has the temperature of Zeno and also blue light . This product is AMAZING and I really LOVE it. It is exactly the same with Klima Magic Wand (BECAUSE KLIMA HAS COPIED THIS PRODUCT WITH A HIGHER PRICE.)I recommend this Product to everyone because it is AMAZING.IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> This product quit working as soon as the return window closed.  While the indicator lights come on (so I know the battery is good), the blue light that makes it work simply never cones on.  Since I rarely get pimples, I successfully used this product only ONE time.  It&#x27;s a great concept--if only it worked.  Sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently dealing with acne due to chemotherapy.  After lots of proper cleansing, exfoliation and visits to my esthetician I came to the conclusion that my chemo was the root cause of my acne.  This was my only hope of stopping the acne before it got bad.  I followed the instructions word for word and 24 hours later the acne that I treated was disappearing.  I was treating acne that was coming from deep down in the skin.  I&#x27;m super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was bought got my husband. I thought it was similar to something my brother had when he was in his teens. It helped clear up his skin. This unit came with multiple parts and there wasn&#x27;t any instructions. I did contact the dealer only to be told they&#x27;ll look for a copy  for me. I &#x27;s been over 4 months and have yet to hear anything from anyone. So this item sits in it&#x27;s case unused to this day. It&#x27;s sad because I think it would be a good instrument in battling pimples and blackheads, but without any instructions you could get in trouble for having a concealed weapon.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time and I received what I expected. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now. It works quite well, just don&#x27;t expect some magical, miracle treatment. It&#x27;s good for mild acne. Prevents zits from forming. And lessens the time you have one and its size. Easy to use. Just requires 1 AA battery, but theres a catch; I have to change the battery about once a week. Had to go to Costco to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good product for the price. And helpful for those painful, under-the-skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old. It works well on mild to moderate pimples</li>
            <li> It does not work regardless how long or how often you use it. I would not recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> After I adjusted the way I used it, so as not to burn, it seemed to work. Then about two weeks later it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long. However, it has helped my acne. Works as it says. The best part about this light is that you don&#x27;t have to change heads like the Zeno or toss it away after 1000 uses like the ZAP. Cheaper too.</li>
            <li> From the reviews, this product seems to really help some people, but it does basically nothing for acne cysts that I get.</li>
            <li> Be very careful using this if you have sensitive skin. I always used the Zeno without problems but this device burned, blistered and peeled a thick layer of skin off my face in an area wider than where I used it and is now taking forever to heal. It heated up way too hot but did not hurt while I was using it so I had no idea of the damage it would cause so use caution or try using it on an area that isn&#x27;t too noticeable first to see how you react to it.</li>
            <li> This device gets WAY too hot! My wife ordered it and does not like it. It burned her skin. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> It does reduce the size of your pimple if you follow the directions. Don&#x27;t over use, I got a blister on top of my pimple which made it worse because I thought the more times I put it on my pimple the better. No!</li>
            <li> This little device does a good job on very small blemishes that are in the early stages, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for the cyst pimples. I had hoped it would keep these cysts from getting so large and painful, but once they are developing it didn&#x27;t do anything to get rid of them. The treated area will be very red for a while so and it will fade so allow time for that before trying to apply makeup. Like the other reviews, the device goes through batteries very quickly so I am using rechargable batteries and I don&#x27;t mind that. The therapy device is a good device for the money. If it would have gotten rid of my cyst I would be raving about it, but it&#x27;s still here after four days. :(. UPDATE: Mine quit charging!!! I was willing to keep it, but after trying both new batteries and rechargable ones nothing works.</li>
            <li> Loved this thing!!! My dog just had to chew it up today... saving up for a new one.... word great for acne and bug bites too!!</li>
            <li> Has helped my pimples heal quicker.</li>
            <li> It has left scars on my face where I used it. Would not recommend for anyone to use</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the other bad reviews. This worked much better than a Zeno, really easy to use, very high heat levels. Cleared my chin zits right up! Zaaaaap! Love it!</li>
            <li> This Zit zapper really works.  seems to work best on new pimples.  I have a friend who used to work at a laser therapy clinic who turned me on to this.  I don&#x27;t know how it works but it works great.  The most important thing she told me is to remember to charge or change batteries often, even though the light is still shining If the device is low on power it doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;I preferred this one over the \\&quot;Zeno\\&quot; because it seems much higher quality and has a blue LED and I do not have to buy new heads plus its small.</li>
            <li> this product really seems to shorten the healing time of my acne!&lt;br /&gt;you need to change the batteries often, but i use rechargeable so im not that bothered by it.&lt;br /&gt;it is well made and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This works great on the occasional breakout and pesky zit. Blast the zit a few times during the day and it&#x27;s gone by the morning. It is designed to treat one or a small cluster of pimples but it is not meant for primary treatment. If you have serious acne then this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;A single AA battery last about 2 weeks, Don&#x27;t buy cheap batteries like I did the first time. They didn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to make my acne worse. I believed the heat was too much for my sensitive skin because my acne became more inflamed after each use. I tried many times to be certain this was true. I sent it back to Amazon</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my grand-daughter. She wasn&#x27;t too impressed with it. So her mother said she would try it on her grin lines.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the Zeno, which is too expensive.  The refills for the Zeno are expensive, and the version I have is rechargeable, and has quit working.  This little gizmo just needs a AA battery.  It works quite well.</li>
            <li> Awful!!  Do not buy!!  Does not work!  Tried everything but I still could not get it to work.  Not sure who to contact!</li>
            <li> I have used this on large acne cysts that normally take two weeks to disappear.  After a day or two, they are virtually gone.  It is important to start treatment at the first sign of swelling and/or redness.  This product has worked much better and faster than any spot treatments I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about buying this product but considering there were 5 out of 6 ppl that liked it I figured for the price it was a deal.  I&#x27;m soooooooo glad I decided to get this.  I got it yesterday and was so anxious to use it.  I have to say it works!!!  I woke up this morning and one pimple is completely gone and the other one has shrunk at least 90%.  This will definitely be going into my purse so I have it at all times.  GREAT PRODUCT!  Oh, one reviewer said it got so hot it burned them.  I definitely believe they had a defective product or either OVERLY sensitive skin.  The heat is barely a warm feeling.  NO BURNING, STINGING, UNCOMFORTABLENESS OR PAIN WHATSOEVER!</li>
            <li> Save your money and look for something else.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this product to try, hoping I would not receive one of the defected ones everybody was talking about. Unfortunately, after 2 weeks with a once a day usage the unit died on me - now all it does is turn on, beep and then shuts off. I tried contacting the seller, but still have not received a response. Definitely not worth $50.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month. Press the power button and wait for the beep like 30 seconds. Then I have to press the star button to turn it on a use. I put the blue light on my acne spots for 2 min and it worked just fine. The acne significantly heals faster than before. But it&#x27;s complicated to use. So I would recommend to people who want to use it for acne treatment as it&#x27;s cheaper than other products but only for 1 pimple at a time.</li>
            <li> This product really works for me. When it beeps it&#x27;s time for new batteries, which can be often, but it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and not a zit in sight. I love it!</li>
            <li> It works to reduce swelling of up and coming pimples, but it doesn&#x27;t end them. Still, it helps improve things substantially. Also- it eats batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> The headline says it all.  Got a painful zit -- put this handy little device on it and the pain will diminish and the sucker will shrink.  Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll still put your dermatologist&#x27;s kids through college, but if you&#x27;re like me those dermo appointments usually don&#x27;t correspond to the worst part of the breakout cycle (kinda like how your hair looks great the day you get it cut.). I like this, it worked for me (the beeping is annoying and my boyfriend isn&#x27;t a fan of the blue light), but beauty isn&#x27;t always easy. Price is right, runs on a single battery and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Has been working very well for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> Love this handy little tool!  Works great!  Husband found the heat a bit hot but it&#x27;s bearable for me. It works better with acne that are in the midst of &#x27;blooming&#x27; - whilst they are still small and red. The night it was applied on, it shrunk visibly and the next morning, it was totally gone.  My husband tried on a bigger and painful acne and although it did shrink a bit and was less painful, it didn&#x27;t go away even though we applied it every night.  But overall, we&#x27;re still very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Pimple Remover for about a few weeks. I stopped about a dozen pimples before they could get established. It works. My skin is a little oily and I tend to get a few zits a week. However, they can get pretty big when they hit the surface. The blue LED and heat really seem to stop the bacteria growth before it can become a pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries: This thing eats batteries. Buy a large pack of batteries at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;Stops working: When the middle button does not work, change the battery.&lt;br /&gt;Burning: It doesn&#x27;t get that hot. I just don&#x27;t see how that is possible. Maybe you if you push too hard.</li>
            <li> After I received this item, I opened it and read the directions through. When I powered it on, it said to wait 30 seconds while it warmed up and then it would beep to let me know that I could start the treatment. I waited at least two minutes for it to beep and when it did it automatically turned off. I tried it over and over for like an hour and tried looking in the instructions for something to help me with this problem, but there wasn&#x27;t anything in them for this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also disappointed that there was not an option for sending this back and getting a new one, just getting a refund, so now I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth it to order a new one or just look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Works to reduce pimple size but doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely. You can definitely feel it working. I would buy it again because it helps, I just wish it helped more.</li>
            <li> not happy.  beeps, but the light no longer turns on.&lt;br /&gt;same experience as that reported by others.  took a chance and lost.</li>
            <li> at first this worked okay until i had a similar experience to other reviewers where the device stopped working.  I changed the battery at that time and the device worked again however at this point it became much hotter and i noticed that all of the pimples i had treated were severely burned and had blistered over.  I will be devastated if it leaves scars and am praying that it wont, however in the mean time the burn marks are much redder and are taking far longer to heal then any pimple would. so watch out</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t break out that bad, I get a zit about once a month or whenever I have an important event (due to the stress I&#x27;m guessing) which is why I got it and it did nothing for me, my pimple was exactly the same! I&#x27;m so jealous of the people that says that works! I used it again when I once again got a pimple, and then again absolutely nothing happened and my pimples aren&#x27;t even that bad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for something that works for me :(</li>
            <li> ...But nothing overly spectacular. It really depends on when you catch the zit. Sometimes you have to do multiple treatments, which can be tedious, but if you follow the directions and are careful, you can get decent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, you should be able to cope with the heat. Gentlemen, I can&#x27;t really say the same for you. ;)</li>
            <li> it works if you catch a blemish way way befor its really there but it will blister you if you are not careful. and is a lot hotter than i expected</li>
            <li> I have the Zeno which I like, but buying replacement heads cost a lot of money, so I found this one on Amazon and bought it based on the reviews.  I like Zeno better as it gradually gets hot and near the end, does it reach the maximum temperate, and it doesn&#x27;t burn as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this one, it gets hot relatively quick and at least to me, is hotter than Zeno but not where it burns....it stings though sometimes.  But I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to keep buying replacement heads.  I did try it and it does seem to work.  It does burn a lot more if the acne is already a bump on your face so try to catch it earlier and it won&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
            <li> I have used Zeno in the past, and it seemed to help with some acne, but I was annoyed with the need to continuously buy applicator tips. So, I decided to give the BrightTherapy pimple remover a try. I was optimistic. I just got this item today, used it, and I will be returning it promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to use low level heat and to be non-burning. Actually, the description says that it \\&quot;cannot burn or overtreat.\\&quot; Well, I found that to be untrue the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt hot to the touch during the cycles, but the heat was tolerable. And immediately following the treatment the pimples did seem a bit smoother (I used it on a few). However, about half an hour later I felt itching at each of the areas on which the pimple remover had been used. To my dismay, I found that each area was now much MORE raised than before - because blisters had formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is now a mess. I don&#x27;t know whether this is a defective item that runs hotter than it is supposed to, or whether this is an indication that some skin types are at risk of this. Either way, I would NOT recommend this product and I WILL be contacting the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on November 1st, used it a few times then suddenly on November 25th... the middle button stopped working. Perhaps mine was poorly manufactured... I don&#x27;t know. For some strange reason they don&#x27;t accept replacements either... I am waiting to process my refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Replaced the battery as this Amy person suggested... useless... still broke. I have since gotten rid of mine because they will not accept returns and will not refund you, had to throw it away... what a waste of money! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Tried it on some impending blemishes and it neither stopped their formation or decreased the inflammation. Had high hopes but this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Works great at reducing zits.</li>
            <li> I hate to agree - I really wanted this to work.  But the truth is this: It just doesn&#x27;t work - won&#x27;t even turn on.  I tried with several brand new batteries from different packs.  I could only get it to beep at me.  It&#x27;s supposed to warm up and the light comes on at the push of a button.  I never even got that far.  I didn&#x27;t take the neg reviews seriously - I wish I had.  Now I have to wait several days to get my money back.  If you&#x27;re thinking of trying your luck, really really cross your fingers.  From the reviews I&#x27;m seeing, it looks like almost half may be defective. Thanks, China!  Spend the extra few bucks for a better one and get yourself some re chargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;So glad amazon takes returns...</li>
            <li> For the money I expected some success but after a few tries now following the instructions closely iy simply does not do anything.</li>
            <li> This device *really* works. It depends on the zit, though...when they are really bad, you have to use it twice. Still, it&#x27;s a life saver and SO much better for your skin than popping lol</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use gets rid of your pimple in a day or two.  There is a little heating sensation and leaves a red spot but it will soon disappear.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I was worried by the reviewers that said it did nothing but burn their skin, but was encouraged enough by the other reviews to give it a try. Nothing else has worked besides continually taking antibiotics. When I first used it, it felt very hot, so I made sure to move it gently to prevent burning. It didn&#x27;t burn at all and did exactly what it promises. The smaller blemishes were gone after one or two uses. A larger one did take a few days to disappear, but disappeared MUCH faster than they have without this. It seems to work better when I hold it completely still. It actually does start to feel very hot like it&#x27;s burning, but doesn&#x27;t leave any burn mark. Just a little redness that fades after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re worried about burning your skin, I suggest you move it slightly while using until you know it won&#x27;t burn your skin or trying it first somewhere besides your face, like the inside of your wrist. I&#x27;ll warn you it does really sting sometimes (especially on larger zits), but at least for me, it has never burned my skin.</li>
            <li> This product has been helpful for cystic acne. What you need to know about this is :&lt;br /&gt;Each treatment is 2.5 min, so have patiences&lt;br /&gt;Works best when your blemish starts.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t over do it , you might scar&lt;br /&gt;Get rechargeable batteries&lt;br /&gt;The beeping is annoying but it serves a purpose on timing of treatment .</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get rid of any acne. I just left burn marks. If you buy it, try it out on one pimple first.</li>
            <li> This works awesome, follow directions</li>
            <li> It definitely works. As soon as a pimple starts to form, I use this,  and it flattens it. It never comes back.  My only complaint is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, I was super excited to start using it but the packaging just didn&#x27;t look right. It doesn&#x27;t look professional and there is a UPC tag on the front with the same title as the first words of the product description here on Amazon. I&#x27;m a designer so maybe I read too much into what the package looks like but this seems like a Chinese factory knock-off of another product. It just seemed fishy so I am returning it.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of your money.I can not believe I spent that much money on something so useless.Does not work</li>
            <li> I always break out during the holidays and end up avoiding pictures of myself. I needed something for my occasional breakouts and to stop my pimples from getting worse. Well now I can take as many as I want. The BrightTherapy Pimple Remover helps with breakouts in just 24 hours. I only used it on newly forming pimples because of the combination of heat and blue light. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so inexpensive, an acne buster that&#x27;s easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok. It&#x27;s not magic but it did seem to reduce the time for pimples to dissipate.</li>
            <li> My son was the first to use it and raved at how much he likes the BrightTherapy.  I recently used it and feel the same - it&#x27;s a great product and helps get rid of pimples quicker.</li>
