            <li>Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li>bought this because I know honey to be great for it&#x27;s moisturizing and healing properties, and I have not been dissapointed.</li>
            <li>it axtually fixes my hands after a clean-a-thon or gardening-fest, which is quite remarkable as I never wear gloves when I do either of them</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful light honey scent!</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t looked this good since I stopped using Avon.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion  - it smells great and works really well to moisturize skin without leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!  ...and also love that I can get it with &amp;</li>
            <li>love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>so I gave it away to a co worker who liked it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how people are not bothered by the fact that this stuff has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>Love, love Burts Bees products!</li>
            <li>This lotion smells amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t feel slimy on my hands like many lotions do.</li>
            <li>I used Avon for many years and loved it, but when I decided to go paraben free, I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent is not my favorite, but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect middle ground.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees &amp; Jergens - my favorite.</li>
            <li>However, the scent smells like cheap Barbie dolls and it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>hands down, no doubt about it, the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare, but I think the new formula is lovely!</li>
            <li>Has a nice gentle smell that quickly fades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but recently my daughter started breaking out in an itchy, bumpy rash.</li>
            <li>I got a small tube of this lotion for Christmas and loved it so much I needed more.</li>
            <li>Also, I have mild eczema on my hands and the perfume, I&#x27;m assuming, really aggravates it.</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>My thumbs still cracked and the tips of most of my fingers were dry and flaky until I found Burt&#x27;s Bees Milk and Honey.</li>
            <li>Way too much perfume.</li>
            <li>As someone who washes her hands A LOT out of necessity, I have found this moisturizer to be very healing.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t too greasy but also doesnt&#x27; absorb so fast it relies on alcohol and dries out.</li>
            <li>and I have been going nuts trying to find a decent lotion ever since.</li>
            <li>I got it as a gift when I was pregnant since my skin always seemed dry.</li>
            <li>Within a few days the crack was fully healed and the rest of my hands were back to healthy normal.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to added chemical ingredients,  this too gave me allergies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never smelled the old formula</li>
            <li>The smell is faintly coconut but fades quickly and isn&#x27;t too much at all.</li>
            <li>Great texture- not too thin or too thick!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Also, my daughter says this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t make her skin &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; - she tends to get very dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands in the winter and this does the trick.</li>

            <li> She has a eczema and has to be careful about what she puts on her skin.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time finding lotion that actually softens my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this to have something when I travel that I didn&#x27;t hate.</li>
            <li> I found some pure Shea Butter this summer and started our very dry, cold Colorado winter using that.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, my sister-in-law introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> Once I applied this, it started healing within a few hours and the pain went away.</li>
            <li> If I use a small enough amount it soaks right in, and there&#x27;s very little of the annoying feeling of my hands sliding around instead of being productive</li>
            <li> I keep this small bottle in my purse and try to put some on my hands after I wash them.</li>
            <li> When it comes to Berts you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I had a painful crack on my thumb that wouldn&#x27;t heal.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll use all of it soon and find a replacement because this stuff makes me feel sick.</li>
            <li> but I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Over-priced for a cream that does the same thing as any cheaper cream on the market.  Could not feel any extra benefits.  I am extremely sensitive to added chemical ingredients,  this too gave me allergies.</li>
            <li> I got a small tube of this lotion for Christmas and loved it so much I needed more. I&#x27;ve never smelled the old formula so I can&#x27;t compare, but I think the new formula is lovely! This lotion smells amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t feel slimy on my hands like many lotions do. If I use a small enough amount it soaks right in, and there&#x27;s very little of the annoying feeling of my hands sliding around instead of being productive like I often get with lotion. I used it today on a friend of mine, who has VERY dry, cracked skin, and it seems to have made a difference on it.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion  - it smells great and works really well to moisturize skin without leaving an oily residue. I keep this small bottle in my purse and try to put some on my hands after I wash them. Also, my daughter says this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t make her skin &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; - she tends to get very dry, irritated skin. It works really well!</li>

            <li> love this lotion! Great texture- not too thin or too thick! Has a nice gentle smell that quickly fades. Try it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for your purse... and not greasy (which I like for hand cream)  Smells great.</li>
            <li> Way too much perfume. You can smell this stuff from a mile away. Also, I have mild eczema on my hands and the perfume, I&#x27;m assuming, really aggravates it. So, this is definitely not for the guys, or for those who have any sensitivity to perfumes or dyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people are not bothered by the fact that this stuff has a very strong smell. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I hate the smell. I purchased it because it was Burt&#x27;s Bees and I have a hard time finding lotion that actually softens my dry skin. This one works, which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, the scent smells like cheap Barbie dolls and it&#x27;s very strong. I hate it but I use it anyway. Hopefully I&#x27;ll use all of it soon and find a replacement because this stuff makes me feel sick.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. I have really dry hands in the winter and this does the trick. It makes the perfect lotion to throw in a purse because it&#x27;s not too perfumed. I can&#x27;t stand when I sit next to someone who pulls out highly fragranced lotion when you have little to no space in between.</li>
            <li> As a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees, I would recommend this moisturizer for dry and/or damaged skin. The scent is not my favorite, but it&#x27;s not terrible. This is the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Most importantly, the scent is not overpowering. As someone who washes her hands A LOT out of necessity, I have found this moisturizer to be very healing. It prevents them from getting too damaged and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I know honey to be great for it&#x27;s moisturizing and healing properties, and I have not been dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but recently my daughter started breaking out in an itchy, bumpy rash. She has a eczema and has to be careful about what she puts on her skin. After reading the ingredients in this stuff, we discovered it contains Shea butter, which she is allergic to.  When did they start using shea butter in their products?  We won&#x27;t be buying Burt&#x27;s Bees products anymore because of this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. I used Avon for many years and loved it, but when I decided to go paraben free, I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore and I have been going nuts trying to find a decent lotion ever since. I run a home day care and wash my hands constantly. I found some pure Shea Butter this summer and started our very dry, cold Colorado winter using that. I put it on at night (to greasy for day time) and put on gloves. My thumbs still cracked and the tips of most of my fingers were dry and flaky until I found Burt&#x27;s Bees Milk and Honey. A few weeks ago, my sister-in-law introduced me to it. I had a painful crack on my thumb that wouldn&#x27;t heal. Once I applied this, it started healing within a few hours and the pain went away. I also didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to apply lotion every three minutes! Within a few days the crack was fully healed and the rest of my hands were back to healthy normal. They haven&#x27;t looked this good since I stopped using Avon. I don&#x27;t even wear gloves at night anymore like I did with the Avon. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. It has a wonderful light honey scent!</li>
            <li> I didnt care for the smell so I gave it away to a co worker who liked it.</li>
            <li> When it comes to Berts you can&#x27;t go wrong. I like this size because i keep it at work or in my purse.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  ...and also love that I can get it with &amp;#34;Subscribe &amp; Save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> Love, love Burts Bees products!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I got it as a gift when I was pregnant since my skin always seemed dry. It works great and doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this to have something when I travel that I didn&#x27;t hate. This product isn&#x27;t too greasy but also doesnt&#x27; absorb so fast it relies on alcohol and dries out. It&#x27;s the perfect middle ground. The smell is faintly coconut but fades quickly and isn&#x27;t too much at all. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees &amp; Jergens - my favorite.</li>
