            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>I use a gloss over it and that has a pearlized effect that works perfectly together.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon stain is a wonderful color.</li>
            <li>great for lining and filling in.</li>
            <li>Save your money and invest in a good quality lip stain with a good reputation!</li>
            <li>Great color and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>and it was gorgeous on her,</li>
            <li>Because lipstains go on like a magic marker, you can easily outline your lips perfectly and then fill them</li>
            <li>The tube and swatch makes it look like a nice rosy berry mauve color.</li>
            <li>After the product wore off I really liked the color.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this lipstain!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: great color that isn&#x27;t overpowering and seems to work well for many, lasts longest, simple to apply, great liner and lip color combo in one.</li>
            <li>which irritates me the most.</li>

            <li>Really love it, pretty good price</li>
            <li>Comes off too easily.</li>
            <li>This one is my current favorite shade; it goes on great and lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>color is a lot more true to the packaging once the \\&quot;product\\&quot; wears off.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>It is handy and doesn&#x27;t melt like lipstick in hot weather.</li>
            <li>, awesome color - in between a nude brown neutral and a dash of pretty red hint.</li>
            <li>It is still a pleasant tone and can be a natural look if used sparingly.</li>
            <li>I adore lipstains for their precision, ease of application, lasting power and great under lipgloss or lipstick color punch.</li>
            <li>I love this color and stain so much!  </li>
            <li>Perfect everyday!</li>
            <li>Bought this lipstick, thinking it would be a new kind of stain to try.   </li>
            <li>It goes on a super bright blue-based RED.</li>
            <li>I do  LOVE the color, and it does last longer than most lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>This one by CoverGirl in Cinnamon Smile is VERY close to the Urban Decay one - feels and smells great</li>
            <li>the product wears off, the color is more natural looking than</li>
            <li>Color is just right</li>
            <li>The color is a beautiful red and stays on really long.</li>
            <li>The reason I keep buying another tube is that I love the color the FIRST day I open the package.</li>

            <li>I love CoverGirl Outlast Lipstain, so I definitely recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>The color was much darker than I wanted when I first applied it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very nice color, but a bit too subtle on my mouth.</li>
            <li>like this color in comparison to many other lipstains because so many are vividly bright red or pink and the cinnamon is a more subtle color.</li>
            <li>You really have to mash it on your lips to get any color to come out of the tube.</li>
            <li>Its very drying on the lips also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with application techniques and it still looks far brighter and more red than the shade indicates.</li>
            <li>I love the lip stains  but for some reason this particular color dries out faster than any of the other colors.</li>
            <li>I only wish the colors were true to life.</li>
            <li>The color tip is similar to a felt magic marker and occasionally has fuzz on it.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit as well in my jammed make up case</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s not really a negative, I think I&#x27;d grown used to the thinner longer tubes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so ridiculous too as to not save the receipt because many drug stores offer refunds on beauty products!  </li>
            <li>long as your lips stay dry, the color seems to last a fair amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is now my new favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get it to last for more than a month even while rotating with other lipsticks.</li>
            <li>First, they are the longest lasting way of adding color to your lips that wont rub off...</li>
            <li>but on me it almost blends with my natural lips.</li>
            <li>At first it feels tacky and doesn&#x27;t really dry for a while.  </li>
            <li>Not long after applying it to my lips I ate breakfast and it all came off completely.</li>
            <li>I have desperately been searching for a good lipstain that was not so freaking</li>

            <li> I still used a lip gloss or lip balm over it because it left my lips a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I tried putting on several layers to show some color, but it got all sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder how other reviewers find it lasting so long lasting.</li>
            <li> pink like all the rest, ever since Sephora got rid of the Vincent Longo line ( I refuse to order off their shady website, where no one ever calls back or answers your return questions) and Urban Decay discontinued my fav, Urban Decay&#x27;s Lip Marker in Naked.</li>

            <li> apply to DRY lips, wipe excess, then use a balm or gloss to hold in lip moisture).</li>
            <li> This product is DRY -</li>
            <li> After 1-3 days of application, the tube is completely dry.</li>
            <li> It does tend to dry my lips out if I don&#x27;t use some type of lip moisturizer when I&#x27;m not using it, but I use lip gloss all the time&#x27;</li>
            <li> you wet your lips, the product will continue to transfer, even after drying.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This comes on slightly dark but the color made me expect that.</li>
            <li> Lipstick is quite outdated in comparison when you have a busy day or night and want STAYING</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product on an average of 1 tube a month!</li>
            <li> but it was almost dried out from the start.</li>

            <li> I would give it a shot, unfortunately this one dried out within a few uses</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> Every day after that, I experience disappointment.   </li>

            <li> I love the lip stains  but for some reason this particular color dries out faster than any of the other colors. I can&#x27;t get it to last for more than a month even while rotating with other lipsticks. That&#x27;s the reason for the three stars versus five stars.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of lip stains. First, they are the longest lasting way of adding color to your lips that wont rub off...even when wiping with a napkin. Lipstick is quite outdated in comparison when you have a busy day or night and want STAYING color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, no smears no gunk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it replaced my lipliner. Because lipstains go on like a magic marker, you can easily outline your lips perfectly and then fill them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...I tried various brands and then read that this one, according to an Elle magazine test, lasted longer than the other pens on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t believe all marketing til I try it.  This is now my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this color in comparison to many other lipstains because so many are vividly bright red or pink and the cinnamon is a more subtle color. I had a few other brands and other colors but wound up with this as my \\&quot;go to\\&quot;...great for lining and filling in. Lasted longest...I concur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s not really a negative, I think I&#x27;d grown used to the thinner longer tubes and this is thicker and shorter. Not a big deal and probably, in all honesty, it&#x27;s easier to apply that way...but it doesn&#x27;t fit as well in my jammed make up case so if I HAD to come up with a negative that&#x27;s all I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: great color that isn&#x27;t overpowering and seems to work well for many, lasts longest, simple to apply, great liner and lip color combo in one.</li>
            <li> I love this color and stain so much!  Perfect everyday!</li>
            <li> Bought this lipstick, thinking it would be a new kind of stain to try.   It was a total disappointment. the color doesn&#x27;t last, it clumps. Avoid it</li>
            <li> I have tried two of the Covergirl Outlast Lipstains (Flirty Nude &amp; Teasing Blush) and was so looking forward to lasting lip color. Not long after applying it to my lips I ate breakfast and it all came off completely. After applying it other times it was very short lived.  It makes me wonder how other reviewers find it lasting so long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a lipstain, and this looked like an affordable way to try them out. I bought the 440 berry something color. The tube and swatch makes it look like a nice rosy berry mauve color. OH NOT SO! It goes on a super bright blue-based RED. I&#x27;ve experimented with application techniques and it still looks far brighter and more red than the shade indicates. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. It stays on my lips like gangbusters. I have to use a makeup remover to get it off at the end of the day (helpful hint: apply to DRY lips, wipe excess, then use a balm or gloss to hold in lip moisture). I only wish the colors were true to life. If it makes your lips neon red, they should let you know up front!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year! The reason I keep buying another tube is that I love the color the FIRST day I open the package. Every day after that, I experience disappointment.   This product is NOT long-lasting. In fact, this product doesn&#x27;t last. I apply it in the morning and by the time I get to work, it has faded drastically.  This product is DRY - which irritates me the most. After 1-3 days of application, the tube is completely dry. You really have to mash it on your lips to get any color to come out of the tube. I have had to apply additional lip products (gloss, chapstick, etc) to enhance the color and get it stay on by lunch time.   I have purchased this product on an average of 1 tube a month! I&#x27;m so ridiculous too as to not save the receipt because many drug stores offer refunds on beauty products!  Save your money and invest in a good quality lip stain with a good reputation!</li>
            <li> The color is a beautiful red and stays on really long. Perfect.</li>
            <li> This works.  I would prefer another color</li>
            <li> The lipstain has a felt tip like a marker.  The color is a lot darker than the packaging when you first put it on.  At first it feels tacky and doesn&#x27;t really dry for a while.  The color was much darker than I wanted when I first applied it.  After the product wore off I really liked the color.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t look like I have a bunch of lipstick on my lips, but I still get the color on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The color is a lot more true to the packaging once the \\&quot;product\\&quot; wears off.&lt;br /&gt;Once the product wears off, the color is more natural looking than when applied.&lt;br /&gt;As long as your lips stay dry, the color seems to last a fair amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The product is tacky when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;The product transfers to anything that touches your lips until it wears off.&lt;br /&gt;When you wet your lips, the product will continue to transfer, even after drying.&lt;br /&gt;It took about an hour to get to the point where just the stain was left on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post an update later to document how long the color lasted.</li>
            <li> i really love cg outlast lipstain. its one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lipstain!! I adore lipstains for their precision, ease of application, lasting power and great under lipgloss or lipstick color punch. I have desperately been searching for a good lipstain that was not so freaking pink like all the rest, ever since Sephora got rid of the Vincent Longo line ( I refuse to order off their shady website, where no one ever calls back or answers your return questions) and Urban Decay discontinued my fav, Urban Decay&#x27;s Lip Marker in Naked. This one by CoverGirl in Cinnamon Smile is VERY close to the Urban Decay one - feels and smells great, awesome color - in between a nude brown neutral and a dash of pretty red hint. Really love it, pretty good price - pelase keep it around forever Cover Girl - way to go!</li>
            <li> This comes on slightly dark but the color made me expect that. It is still a pleasant tone and can be a natural look if used sparingly. I use a gloss over it and that has a pearlized effect that works perfectly together.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t exactly what I anticipated but it does the job well. I needed a simple lipstain for work and that&#x27;s what I got! I still used a lip gloss or lip balm over it because it left my lips a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Great color and goes on nicely. The stain lasts awhile and it travels well in any purse. The cinnamon stain is a wonderful color.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because this is my first lipstain, maybe it&#x27;s just a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, I have medium brown skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very nice color, but a bit too subtle on my mouth. I saw a video of a woman with darker skin than mine apply the same color and it was gorgeous on her, but on me it almost blends with my natural lips. Our lips were the same color. It was as though nothing was put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, it didn&#x27;t last long at all. I tried putting on several layers to show some color, but it got all sticky and dry. Even with those multiple layers, one lick of the lips was all it took to take most of it off. What a rip!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I&#x27;m doing it wrong, this product is a waste of money. Comes off too easily.</li>
            <li> Color is just right but it was almost dried out from the start.</li>
            <li> I generally like this lipstain, I usually buy it at target or walmart but thought since it was a little cheaper on amazon I would give it a shot, unfortunately this one dried out within a few uses, it could have just been one bad one but I&#x27;ve never had that problem before.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was expecting.  I do  LOVE the color, and it does last longer than most lipsticks.  The color tip is similar to a felt magic marker and occasionally has fuzz on it.  I might buy it again.  It is handy and doesn&#x27;t melt like lipstick in hot weather.</li>
            <li> Love the lipstain. It stays on my lips and not my clothes or glasses.</li>
            <li> does not last, it dried up in a couple weeks. Would not buy again.Its very drying on the lips also.</li>
            <li> I love CoverGirl Outlast Lipstain, so I definitely recommend this product!  This one is my current favorite shade; it goes on great and lasts forever.  It does tend to dry my lips out if I don&#x27;t use some type of lip moisturizer when I&#x27;m not using it, but I use lip gloss all the time&#x27; so this isn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
