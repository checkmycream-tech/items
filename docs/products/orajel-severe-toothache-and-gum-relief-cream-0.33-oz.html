    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>awesome product!  </li>
            <li>AND IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li>AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>It was my best friend when I had braces.</li>
            <li>I was impressed!  </li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>It is very good product and has helped me getting rid off tooth sensitivity</li>
            <li>The product was great.</li>
            <li>Orajel has always been a great product through out the years.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff!und</li>
            <li>Works good, just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really, though, this is a good product and a lot of people loved it from the reviews.</li>
            <li>The quick solution is pain killer and best is to see a doctor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure this product is brilliant for most people</li>
            <li>My son swears by it, he said it stays in place much better than the gel!</li>
            <li>and I am so grateful for the kind scientists at Orajel for making this amazing lifesaver.</li>
            <li>This is not as effective as Kanka for me but still helped.</li>
            <li>It was brilliant the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Relieved that I had some Orajel in stock, I rubbed some on the tooth and gums as directed ... and it hurt even more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken the edge off, but I&#x27;m still hurting more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>It works like a miracle and no nasty</li>
            <li>The cream sticks way better</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad for the moment of relief.</li>
            <li>Better than novacaine.</li>
            <li>and if you have a toothache you are better off trying to find some clove oil instead.</li>
            <li>I am glad I was able to get \\&quot;Orajel Severe Toothache Pain</li>
            <li>Cream\\&quot; should not be use for more than 7 Days, according to the Directions on the Box, however, I was able to get to the Dentist before that.</li>
            <li>For those Emergencies, I am glad I found this Over-the-Counter Medication...</li>
            <li>it lasts for15 minutes at best and can only be taken 4x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product was phenomenal for nighttime relief because it didn&#x27;t move around, but stayed where I wanted it, which meant the relief lasted all night.  </li>
            <li>With the GEL, the product moved around easily, numbing my tongue and more surface area than needed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After hours of discomfort, I was finally able to fall asleep and was still pain free when I woke up this morning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product was a lifesaver and saved my vacation and even allowed me to eat and enjoy fine restaurant dining, which I otherwise would not have been able to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product was a lifesaver and saved my vacation and even allowed me to eat and enjoy fine restaurant dining, which I otherwise would not have been able to do.</li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem except the cream dose not sink into the gums and easily gets wiped of by just talking and drinking anything.  </li>
            <li>Works great at relieving most moderate toothache pain.</li>
            <li>but it really works I reccomnend using even if u are waiting for a dentist appt &amp; etc to get it fixed permanently GREAT STUFF !</li>
            <li>I get abscesses occasionally and this is great at relieving some of the pressure / pain associated.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT, FINALLY WENT TO DENTIST</li>
            <li>The pain increased significantly.  </li>
            <li>Also I noticed that my chin and cheek in the area of the tooth were significantly swollen.  </li>
            <li>This really does work OK, but I found it numbed my throat as well</li>
            <li>I love Orajel but the swabs are so much better and last longer.</li>
            <li>I quickly discovered that two things helped.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get decent sleep.  </li>
            <li>an amazing tooth painkiller, it instantly works</li>
            <li>WORTH THE PRICE FOR COMFORT FROM TOOTH/GUM PAIN.</li>
            <li>It also contains menthol, which has a very soothing effect and provides a more pleasing flavor than most topical numbing pain gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I needed it to do, and quickly.</li>
            <li>I at first gave Orajel one star and then read another one star review -- where the person had the same response as me (more pain, swollen face)  -- and realized we had both suffered an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Within 10-15 It had numbed the entire area and I was able to sleep.</li>
            <li>This product, a cream, is easier to apply than a gel, and it really extends the length of time you get relief!  </li>
            <li>Relief\\&quot; Especially dealing with a Wisdom Tooth, I was putting Salt Water on it, however, Oragel Cream is so much better, it really gets rid of the Pain right away</li>
            <li>If you do get this cream version it is best to put some on your finger and squish or lightly rub into the part of your gums that directly connect to the tooth because the little dip there has a better chance of holding on to the cream giving it more time to numb.</li>
            <li>I was on vacation and cracked off a piece of a tooth that had a large filling in it.  </li>
            <li>The tube has a handy application tip that feeds out the medication into tight areas.</li>
            <li>I have a very high tolerance of pain</li>
            <li>Works great, however the constiancy of the creme is a bit tough to use.</li>
            <li>once I realised why, thanks to a comment made during the 111 call, I stopped using it and after a night&#x27;s sleep the pain had gone completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>would suggest you try Clove Bud Essential Oil, available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I thank God for this stuff, I really do.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I had a intense throbbing pain in my tooth and was running on painkillers.</li>
            <li>very good....working...</li>
            <li>Last night, however, I woke up in such great pain that I could not go back to sleep.</li>
            <li>Only downside is it also numbs the rest of your mouth to the point if you wonder if you have a tongue or lips anymore, but so worth the relief!</li>
            <li>I even ran out of the other brand numbing gel from reapplying it so many times.</li>
            <li>With Advil, I received pretty much complete relief.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it to anyone with tooth/gum pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While some people have a positive experience with Oragel, be aware you could have an allergic reaction so severe it requires immediate medical intervention.</li>
            <li>I had about seven for a week or two and it completely numbed all of them!!</li>
            <li>I put some of this gel directly into the deep cavity, and got instant relief that lasted many hours.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I am battling an unbearable abscess.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the gel product worked great, I thought the relief didn&#x27;t last long enough given I could only use it 4 times a day per directions on the packet.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback with the cream vs. gel is that it takes a little longer to work - maybe 5-10 minutes to become fully effective vs. immediate relief with the gel.  </li>
            <li>but if the pain is inside the tooth somewhere which is generally the case, it cannot help much.</li>
            <li>but it worked with the cream it takes a little longer for you to see and feel results and be pain free</li>
            <li>I could not sleep any longer, and other medication wasn&#x27;t strong enough.  </li>
            <li>but this product really feels like a total rip off</li>
            <li>It works fast and last for some time.  </li>
            <li>BOUGHT THIS TO USE FOR SENSITIVE GUMS</li>
            <li>for an adult.</li>
            <li>If I have screaming pain in the middle of the night, I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li>Removes that intense deep pain in moments.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever left on any product but this stuff actually works and the only reason I tried it was because of all the positive reviews here</li>
            <li>The same pain came right back and only lasted if I put a glob of this stuff on a peice of gauze and held it there, of course after 30 mins of holding it there</li>
            <li>experienced a burning sensation and found it impossible to eat or drink anything without excruciating agony.</li>
            <li>Applied liberally to the gums and teeth, and it numbed the area and killed the pain rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Its been well reviewed in general.</li>
            <li>which was kind of scary.</li>
            <li>I developed a toothache during the Christmas holidays when my dentist office was closed until after New Years.  </li>
            <li>the price was much less than l/2 of what I would have paid at my neighborhood store and it was the exact same item.  </li>
            <li>The afflicted area in my mouth swelled to the size of a large golf ball and the nerves in my cheek became to inflamed even a slight wisp of hair brushing against my cheek</li>
            <li>So I gave it one extra star because it clearly works great for some people, but only two stars because they need clearer warnings about dangerous allergic reactions, because at first when your tooth hurts worse</li>

            <li> For me the cream only works as long as it is on the gums around the tooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t cover well enough a short while later, other times I didn&#x27;t need to re-apply it for several hours.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and just a little orajel</li>
            <li> LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> Works well for temporary relief of minor tooth irritations.</li>
            <li> I did not notice swelling a few weeks ago when I had the last toothache, and can only conclude it was caused by the Orajel.</li>
            <li> The product provided a slight numbing around the gum and with several applications the pain eventually subsided.  </li>
            <li> and it numbed me for like a sec or two</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this a minus 5 star.</li>
            <li> The toothache was gone by the time Orajel arrived in the mail but a few weeks later it started up again.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up tonight at a local Wal-Mart after crying in pain that my wisdom tooth was giving me.</li>
            <li> This is the total waste of money.</li>
            <li> gel is thick and clear colored.  </li>
            <li> I tried every home remedy out there as well as other products.</li>
            <li> It was like the pain went from nothing to full blast, the pain makes me just feel like I&#x27;m going crazy.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds like it would be very painful, but by putting some of the product on with a swab first - and by being very gentle - this technique worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This stuff also does wonders for cold sores!! I had about seven for a week or two and it completely numbed all of them!! Only downside is it also numbs the rest of your mouth to the point if you wonder if you have a tongue or lips anymore, but so worth the relief!</li>
            <li> I keep it on hand  just in case.  Never want a tooth ache.</li>
            <li> Immediate pain relief</li>
            <li> I love Orajel but the swabs are so much better and last longer. For me the cream only works as long as it is on the gums around the tooth. This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem except the cream dose not sink into the gums and easily gets wiped of by just talking and drinking anything.  If you do get this cream version it is best to put some on your finger and squish or lightly rub into the part of your gums that directly connect to the tooth because the little dip there has a better chance of holding on to the cream giving it more time to numb.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever left on any product but this stuff actually works and the only reason I tried it was because of all the positive reviews here so I thought I would show my appreciation. I had a bad tooth ache and couldn&#x27;t get to the dentist. The usual pain medications didn&#x27;t work. This stuff did. Finally a product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> You can develop an allergic reaction to this product and it can be quite painful.  The afflicted area in my mouth swelled to the size of a large golf ball and the nerves in my cheek became to inflamed even a slight wisp of hair brushing against my cheek was painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some people have a positive experience with Oragel, be aware you could have an allergic reaction so severe it requires immediate medical intervention.</li>
            <li> Works great at relieving most moderate toothache pain. Even provides a bit of relief for severe pain. I get abscesses occasionally and this is great at relieving some of the pressure / pain associated. If this doesn&#x27;t relieve the pain, you should probably be making an appointment with your dentist to fix the issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done a review butthos stuff works I had a really bad tooth ache I mean excruicating paci on a scale from 1-10 the pain was about an 8 I have a very high tolerance of pain so I had been having the pain off and on for about 2wks and because it wasn&#x27;t t so bad I brushed it off and when I felt pain I would swish cold water in my mouth and on the side with the tooth was aching it was sort of soothing and it numbed me for like a sec or two but everyone kept telling me to use orajel becuz they said it&#x27;s probably an absessed tooth but I never used it becuz I didn&#x27;t think it would really help but the pain got so bad that I was almost in tears and I gave in to buying it to see it that would help me until I went to by dentist appt which is tomorrow morning but it worked with the cream it takes a little longer for you to see and feel results and be pain free but I didn&#x27;t have to apply anymore on u may have to reapply if you still feel pain you may have missed an area but it really works I reccomnend using even if u are waiting for a dentist appt &amp; etc to get it fixed permanently GREAT STUFF !</li>
            <li> I recently had my wisdom teeth removed, one of which the root was infected. I had issues finding an oral surgeon who accepted my insurance and in the mean time, my tooth was throbbing. This was the worst pain of my life and I&#x27;ve had two children. This product was the ONLY product that provided relief. I tried every home remedy out there as well as other products. If you have tooth pain, buy this!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this a minus 5 star. I applied as directed and it started numbing my gums about 30 seconds in. Then the numbing lasted about a minute. The same pain came right back and only lasted if I put a glob of this stuff on a peice of gauze and held it there, of course after 30 mins of holding it there I figured the meds should have penetrated enough to last. Nope, as soon as I removed the gause the numness (which wasn&#x27;t even fully numb) disappeared about a minute later. It says you should only use it 4X a day which I guess would work if you eat your meals in under a minute. Will not be buying this again, would not recommend. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product really feels like a total rip off, I had to share. BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> I have been bothered with on and off again pain in my gums and teeth for about a month and this has been a life saver.  It works fast and last for some time.  the price was much less than l/2 of what I would have paid at my neighborhood store and it was the exact same item.  The product was great.</li>
            <li> My son swears by it, he said it stays in place much better than the gel!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and just a little orajel really&lt;br /&gt;helps.[[ASIN:B000052YE9 Orajel Maximum Strength Gel Oral Pain Reliever - .42 oz]]</li>
            <li> I at first gave Orajel one star and then read another one star review -- where the person had the same response as me (more pain, swollen face)  -- and realized we had both suffered an allergic reaction. After some googling I realized that the allergic reaction to Orajel is actually quite common and can be very dangerous ... but the Orajel directions and warnings contain NO warning of this.  So I gave it one extra star because it clearly works great for some people, but only two stars because they need clearer warnings about dangerous allergic reactions, because at first when your tooth hurts worse you just think your toothache must be getting worse ... it was only because of the swelling, which I had never had before, that I realized Orajel itself must be the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** My initial review ***&lt;br /&gt;I had been suffering from a toothache a while ago, and ordered some Orajel. The toothache was gone by the time Orajel arrived in the mail but a few weeks later it started up again.  Relieved that I had some Orajel in stock, I rubbed some on the tooth and gums as directed ... and it hurt even more.  The pain increased significantly.  Also I noticed that my chin and cheek in the area of the tooth were significantly swollen.  I did not notice swelling a few weeks ago when I had the last toothache, and can only conclude it was caused by the Orajel.</li>
            <li> It takes the pain away like a champ</li>
            <li> Looks like my dentist accidentally cracked my tooth while he was fixing the one next to it!  It&#x27;s Friday night (because of course it is!), so to tide me over the weekend I thought I&#x27;d try this stuff. It&#x27;s taken the edge off, but I&#x27;m still hurting more than I&#x27;d like. I just took a big drink of cold water and the offending canine is about 40% less sensitive. Overall, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> It is very good product and has helped me getting rid off tooth sensitivity</li>
            <li> an amazing tooth painkiller, it instantly works</li>
            <li> Instant pain relief!!!!! After 50 loratab 10&#x27;s and 7 penicillin pills. This worked AS SOON AS I APPLIED IT!!  Jesus in a tube. If u have a toothache like I did. U have to try this. 100 stars thank u Jesus and Orajel!!!</li>
            <li> Works good, just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!!&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with the person who had a severe reaction to this product. I am awaiting an extraction and was having a lot of discomfort. Whilst collecting my antibiotic,  a pharmacist recommended Orajel Extra Strength.  It was brilliant the first time I used it but within 24 hrs the pain in my mouth was so severe I had to phone 111.&lt;br /&gt;I experienced a burning sensation and found it impossible to eat or drink anything without excruciating agony. I was pacing and heavy breathing trying to lessen the pain at times. Not even a mixture of Ibuprofen, Codeine and Paracetamol touched it.&lt;br /&gt;However once I realised why, thanks to a comment made during the 111 call, I stopped using it and after a night&#x27;s sleep the pain had gone completely.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this product is brilliant for most people but if you experience these symptoms,  be warned,  it could be it doesn&#x27;t agree with you!</li>
            <li> This really does work OK, but I found it numbed my throat as well which was kind of scary. it was probably me. In desperation I probably applied too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest you try Clove Bud Essential Oil, available at Amazon. It works like a miracle and no nasty artificial ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, though, this is a good product and a lot of people loved it from the reviews.</li>
            <li> awesome product!  BOUGHT THIS TO USE FOR SENSITIVE GUMS AND IT WORKS GREAT! LASTS A LONG TIME. WORTH THE PRICE FOR COMFORT FROM TOOTH/GUM PAIN.</li>
            <li> I picked this up tonight at a local Wal-Mart after crying in pain that my wisdom tooth was giving me. It was like the pain went from nothing to full blast, the pain makes me just feel like I&#x27;m going crazy. I applied this and I feel a little ache but nothing like it was an hour ago. The cream sticks way better I thank God for this stuff, I really do. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but I&#x27;m so glad for the moment of relief. I&#x27;m taking pain meds but for what the medication is not ridding of the orajel is helping a lot.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. This product provides temporary relieve of toothache pain as advertised on the package. Note, this product does NOT replace the need to see a dentist to identify and resolve whatever is causing the pain.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously saved my life. I am uninsured, and have known for a while I needed to get something done about my wisdom teeth, but put it off because it didn&#x27;t hurt yet. When it did start to hurt, it went from 0-10 in a day. Unbelievable pain. I needed a week to get money together to see a dentist. I tried everything I could think of, and nothing made a dent. Finally, in the middle of yet another sleepless, I went to the pharmacy and bought this product, and boy did it ever work miracles. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Within 10-15 It had numbed the entire area and I was able to sleep. I woke in the morning to find I still had no pain. It did exactly what I needed it to do, and quickly. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Would not go without it. Grest for tooth aches.</li>
            <li> I am blown away at this product.  It truly has been a blessing and I am so grateful for the kind scientists at Orajel for making this amazing lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Works great, however the constiancy of the creme is a bit tough to use.</li>
            <li> AWESOME.  Better than novacaine.</li>
            <li> WORKS&#x27; .even for an adult.Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the total waste of money. I had a intense throbbing pain in my tooth and was running on painkillers. Get to know about Orajel from Wallgreens and I purchased Severe pain relief plus. It just numb the outer skin of mouth around the tooth but if the pain is inside the tooth somewhere which is generally the case, it cannot help much. The quick solution is pain killer and best is to see a doctor.</li>
            <li> After being kept up by over 24 hours of horrendous impacted wisdom tooth pain, my sister picked this up for me.  Applied liberally to the gums and teeth, and it numbed the area and killed the pain rather quickly.  Definitely a life saver for me, I highly recommend it to anyone with tooth/gum pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple times I had to re-apply to areas I may have missed/didn&#x27;t cover well enough a short while later, other times I didn&#x27;t need to re-apply it for several hours.</li>
            <li> very good....working...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all and if you have a toothache you are better off trying to find some clove oil instead.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it but I&#x27;m putting it in my BOB. Its been well reviewed in general. If I have screaming pain in the middle of the night, I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li> It did what it was supposed to do stop the pan</li>
            <li> I had a severely rotted tooth and the pain was unbelievable.  I could not sleep any longer, and other medication wasn&#x27;t strong enough.  I put some of this gel directly into the deep cavity, and got instant relief that lasted many hours.  Orajel helped me survive until the tooth was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is thick and clear colored.  The tube has a handy application tip that feeds out the medication into tight areas.</li>
            <li> I developed a toothache during the Christmas holidays when my dentist office was closed until after New Years.  Since I didn&#x27;t want to bring someone away from their families, I searched and found the Orajel.  The product provided a slight numbing around the gum and with several applications the pain eventually subsided.  Orajel tied me over until I could reach my dentist.  I ended up having a root canel.</li>
            <li> I am glad I was able to get \\&quot;Orajel Severe Toothache Pain Relief\\&quot; Especially dealing with a Wisdom Tooth, I was putting Salt Water on it, however, Oragel Cream is so much better, it really gets rid of the Pain right away and it heals irritated Gums soothing the entire area. \\&quot;Orajel Toothache Pain Relief Cream\\&quot; should not be use for more than 7 Days, according to the Directions on the Box, however, I was able to get to the Dentist before that. For those Emergencies, I am glad I found this Over-the-Counter Medication...Thank You  D.D.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with a lot of pain from a wisdom tooth lately. I&#x27;ve been getting by chewing on aspirin and using another brand topical numbing gel, which offered some relief. Last night, however, I woke up in such great pain that I could not go back to sleep. I tried all of my usual toothache remedies and there was no relief. I even ran out of the other brand numbing gel from reapplying it so many times. Finally, I got up and drove to a 24 hour pharmacy to see if there was something I hadn&#x27;t tried yet. I decided to give the Orajel Severe Pain Formula a try even though I&#x27;m not a fan of their regular gel formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked instantly. Unlike the usual gels which have a tendency to spread throughout your mouth, the Orajel Severe Pain formula comes in cream that stays put on the source of the pain. It also contains menthol, which has a very soothing effect and provides a more pleasing flavor than most topical numbing pain gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hours of discomfort, I was finally able to fall asleep and was still pain free when I woke up this morning.</li>
            <li> I rub some of this on my gums when in pain and it helps alleviate it.  Normally, I am battling an unbearable abscess.  This is not as effective as Kanka for me but still helped.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT, FINALLY WENT TO DENTIST, WISH HE USED IT.</li>
            <li> Orajel has always been a great product through out the years.  The taste isn&#x27;t to bad and it works instantly. It was my best friend when I had braces.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; - You&#x27;ve got to be kidding me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the standard Orajel while waiting for a root canal, only to be shocked to find out it lasts for15 minutes at best and can only be taken 4x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found out there is a &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; version,  so I went back to the store to try that.  Which also lasts about 15 minutes and same dosage restrictions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does numb quickly,  but this is useless for any extended pain.</li>
            <li> This product, a cream, is easier to apply than a gel, and it really extends the length of time you get relief!  I was on vacation and cracked off a piece of a tooth that had a large filling in it.  The pain became excruciating in a short time.  I tried the orajel GEL and it worked quickly and brought my pain from about an 8 on a 1-10 pain scale, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable, to a 1 or 2.  With Advil, I received pretty much complete relief.  I was impressed!  The toughest thing about using it was getting it where I needed it and getting it to stay there.  I quickly discovered that two things helped.  One was using a q-tip to apply it and, if necessary, putting some on a toothbrush to get into smaller, jagged spots.  I know this sounds like it would be very painful, but by putting some of the product on with a swab first - and by being very gentle - this technique worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the gel product worked great, I thought the relief didn&#x27;t last long enough given I could only use it 4 times a day per directions on the packet.  I went back to the drug store and asked the pharmacist if there was something that lasted longer.  He directed me to this product, which is a cream (thicker than gel and a whitish color).  I found it easier to apply, as it went where I wanted and stayed there.  With the GEL, the product moved around easily, numbing my tongue and more surface area than needed.  Because the cream is thicker, it stayed where I needed it. It may have helped that I was putting the product in an open space on a tooth missing a piece, but the stuff really sort of glued itself where I needed it.  The product was phenomenal for nighttime relief because it didn&#x27;t move around, but stayed where I wanted it, which meant the relief lasted all night.  Yay!  I was able to get decent sleep.  The only drawback with the cream vs. gel is that it takes a little longer to work - maybe 5-10 minutes to become fully effective vs. immediate relief with the gel.  I found the length of time I got relief to outweigh the slightly longer time for it to work as well as the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product was a lifesaver and saved my vacation and even allowed me to eat and enjoy fine restaurant dining, which I otherwise would not have been able to do. I used this product for about 8 days; it worked as well on day eight as on day one. Great stuff!und the length of time I got relief to outweigh the slightly longer time for it to work as well as the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product was a lifesaver and saved my vacation and even allowed me to eat and enjoy fine restaurant dining, which I otherwise would not have been able to do. I used this product for about 8 days; it worked as well on day eight as on day one. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Works as promised.  Removes that intense deep pain in moments.</li>
            <li> Works well for temporary relief of minor tooth irritations.</li>
