            <li>Super good</li>
            <li>I am a Master Barber of 28 years and now finally a shaving product that is awesome.</li>
            <li>There are better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li>I like it most for shaving hairline and neck of clients and beards.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it ,will buy this again.</li>
            <li>ok...</li>
            <li>Proraso is my favorite wanted to try something else but won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>I will keep using conditioner until I find something better.</li>
            <li>Great product, makes shaving with straight edge a breeze.</li>
            <li>Eh its whatever, I thought it&#x27;d be better.</li>
            <li>By far the best razor product out there it is a barbers best friend makes line ups smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li>I love it the hairs stand up and makes it easy to shave a client even with a derby</li>
            <li>Great shaving gel, very soothing and helps with a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Did not seem to create a smooth surface for my Mach III razor.  </li>
            <li>Smooth like butter.</li>
            <li>This is AMAZING and in my opinion better than regular foam shaving cream!</li>
            <li>This product is does just what is says i will most definitely be purchasing more</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not cold on the face.</li>
            <li>Work just as the name says easy, I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I think its more for using the razor on the edges and not so much for full facial shaving, but still does the job.</li>
            <li>When my barber uses this on my neckline with the straight razor the hair feels like it just melts off as I don&#x27;t feel any pulling like with foam.</li>
            <li>I did not like it at all, I&#x27;ve been using regular conditioner and works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone for use with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really live up to my expectations...</li>
            <li>I am VERY prone to ingrown hairs and razor bumps and use everything from a straight edge, double edge and a mach 3 razor and this stuff never kills my face.</li>
            <li>The smell is minty fresh for sure and not AMAZING but who cares, so long as it keeps protecting my face</li>
            <li>Clearly she&#x27;s not a barber.</li>
            <li>It also feels smooth and there is less friction than with foam.!</li>
