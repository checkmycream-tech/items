            <li>I have received so many compliments asking if I have had my hair done in a salon.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>

            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling fantastic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li>be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;Sharing</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and it smells great.</li>
            <li>When you have to balance between moisture and protein for your damaged hair, these products hit both extremely well and leave your hair smelling great too!</li>
            <li>AND it has a tint of purple which all blondes know is a blondes best friend to fight the endless fight against brass and orange that creeps up on us every now and then.</li>
            <li>Spectacular at conditioning, evens out hair tone and keeps your color looking good for several weeks after coloring.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy scent, but a very pleasant fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li>I received very quick which I like to get what I order quickly!  </li>
            <li>my hair is silk and beautiful champagne blonde when i use this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I have fine, chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It is fine and not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li>I love that it works quickly</li>
            <li>It works great on my fine, blonde hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>but this is a great conditioner for blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>When I held the tube up to light, 1/4 the tube was gone.</li>
            <li>WILL BE PURCHASING AGAIN REAL SOON!!!</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have tried this product in the past, and it is the best conditioner for blondes that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love love love it.....and always have 3 extra in my closet at all times...</li>
            <li>Love the whole line of products!</li>
            <li>It really works great though, makes my hair so soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing &amp; tones any brassy areas well, and it leaves my hair amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair nice and soft and manageable&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this product because it really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Bottle wasn&#x27;t completely full.</li>
            <li>But this thing works wonders - it is a light purple, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much toning from it</li>
            <li>This is by far the more efficient hair treatment I have.</li>
            <li>It will brighten your blonde a bit and leave a nice shine though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s A 10 Blonde Miracle spray and have been happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing again because I don&#x27;t feel its worth the money.</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner for blonde hair, takes out the brassy tones.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a lot coming from someone who has had the hardest time finding the right conditioner.</li>
            <li>This stuff is nice, but not phenomenal like most</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t deep condition as much as I would have liked, but my hair was definitely more soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but I didn&#x27;t want to give it a five star review, as I am saving my five star review for a product that magically turns my completely fried bleached blonde hair into spun, silken gold.</li>
            <li>I just highlighted my hair, they the color looks good and radiant, so it&#x27;s hard to say if this product made a huge difference at this point.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and is very manageable, it is not frizzy and is a very pretty bright blonde.</li>
            <li>Leaves my ends very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It made my damaged, frizzy hair feeling so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>There are much better items on the market that serve the same purpose.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot express how much Iove this!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping though!</li>
            <li>However, first time I used it</li>
            <li>I highlighted it a few weeks ago and decided I need to make an effort in finding a good product for it, and to minimize dryness and damage.</li>
            <li>makes your hair super soft without weighing it down and it smells SOOOOO good.</li>
            <li>Moreover, I am a blonde, and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement over the regular formula that has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>The results could be seen right away: my hair really looks better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great scent, creamy, deeply moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves fine hair smooth &amp;  detangled, but a bit heavy even with extensive rinsing.</li>
            <li>My hair which I highlight frequently is super soft.</li>
            <li>My hair felt more dry than ever and even seemed more dry than before I had put it in my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the way my dry hair feels after using this product</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that has been a bit fried from trying to lighten it, but this product really makes it silky smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Also after shampooing (with a good blonde shampoo like John Frieda Lustrous Touch) towel dry your hair to remove some water then add the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kayla</li>
            <li>I have extremely hard water and highlighted hair....not a good combo but</li>
            <li>but it works really well getting rid of the brass.  </li>
            <li>I was very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>After just one use, I noticed a difference, and after almost a week of use, I feel like my color has improved dramatically and my hair is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Plus I noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair when I washed my hair.</li>
            <li>As for the toning, I didn&#x27;t see much.</li>
            <li>Very straw like.</li>
            <li>It really IS a 10</li>
            <li>Really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>being said, this doesn&#x27;t do much more for my hair than my regular conditioner (redken all soft).  </li>
            <li>but it does a really nice job at keeping my blonde hair from looking brassy or feeling dry.</li>
            <li>At first I was mixing this product with Redken Pure Pearl since Pure Pearl was the only conditioner that really brightened my hair.</li>
            <li>my blonde and red highlughts shine!&lt;br /&gt;Takes the tangles out &amp; makes my hair very manageable  too:)</li>
            <li>I could see that the bottle was only full up to the bottom of the</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>But actually I see no difference if anything the reg blue bottle samples I got is better in the spray</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair long hair that I dye blonde.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It also keeps the pesky red undertones from showing through so much!!</li>
            <li>Maybe when the color starts to fade a little the results are more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the heat and humidity of Texas it is hard to keep your hair nice.  </li>
            <li>it helped sooooo much you will be surprised</li>
            <li>my hair feels even flatter (more limp?) than its usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 line, and when something new comes out...</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer, more pliable and less frizzy/dry after only one treatment.</li>
            <li>It did help condition my blonde hair, but I don&#x27;t know if it really did much</li>
            <li>Brought my dry, brittle hair back to soft, shiny and healthy again.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser had used this product in my hair after having bleached my roots and it was very soft.</li>
            <li>When I got the bottle I just happened to be reading the back of it while holding it up, and the light hit it right which  allowed me to see that it was not a full bottle.</li>
            <li>makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>would definitely not purchase this item for moderately damaged hair, and would definitely not pay more than $10 for it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product,  have being buying this mask for a while now and totally healed my hair,  my hair broke off and was really damaged,  I was afraid to brush it so it won&#x27;t brake more.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth a try for folks with really dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Too heavy for my fine blinda hair.</li>
            <li>HAIR IS SOOOOO SOFT &amp; MANAGEABLE(((GREAT RESULTS)))</li>
            <li>Really like this product for extra conditioning and to reduce brassiness of bleached hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, the only difference in appearance is one I don&#x27;t really like-</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and I as using the product and I really do believe that the produce works try it</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair incredibly soft, shiny, and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft as silk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seriously cut back the number of times I wash my hair, so use this on every-other wash to help keep my hair looking shiny and healthy and really have seen a difference.</li>
            <li>It was half way full  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be better off using the blonde spray for daily use, rather than putting down cash for this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It changes the texture of my hair so that it feels thicker and softer, and my blow dry lasts so much longer.  </li>
            <li>Giving 3 stars because the bottle was only filled to below the 2/3 and seemed like some of the conditioner was missing...</li>
            <li>but because I received a sample packet of this with the matching leave-in product I wasn&#x27;t too concerned, especially because I got it for $12 when it cost nearly $20 elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural brunette and why I go blonde</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it at every wash, yet it runs out much faster than all the other ones I have.</li>
            <li>I  get it highlighted professionally, blow dry and heat style it regularly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used two bottles now and while my highlighted hair hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse (dry, split ends, etc) it hasn&#x27;t gotten any better, either.</li>

            <li> and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, I just do not like the smell of it.  </li>

            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> When I use this my hair feels and looks more like...uh....hair (rather than frizzy straw).</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I have found.</li>
            <li> This does give my hair some volume and softness but some others are better.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and my hair does feel smoother.  </li>
            <li> It is my most favorite.</li>
            <li> made my over-processed hair silky smooth overnight!</li>
            <li> love the way this makes my hair feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I remember this because she and I even  talked about the scent being so lovely.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many products in my hair with no luck since highlighting and bleaching is so severe on hair.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments asking if I have had my hair done in a salon.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Product Works ok.</li>
            <li> This 5 minute hair repair is like magic.</li>
            <li> Love this and use it almost every day, even though I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m supposed to...</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just how much I love it.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky smooth and so shiny!</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> I love how well this detangles my hair</li>

            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using 10 Miracle Hair Repair even after a couple washings.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling fantastic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li> be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;Sharing</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> When you have to balance between moisture and protein for your damaged hair, these products hit both extremely well and leave your hair smelling great too!</li>
            <li> AND it has a tint of purple which all blondes know is a blondes best friend to fight the endless fight against brass and orange that creeps up on us every now and then.</li>
            <li> Spectacular at conditioning, evens out hair tone and keeps your color looking good for several weeks after coloring.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy scent, but a very pleasant fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li> I received very quick which I like to get what I order quickly!  </li>
            <li> my hair is silk and beautiful champagne blonde when i use this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I have fine, chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It is fine and not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li> I love that it works quickly</li>
            <li> It works great on my fine, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> but this is a great conditioner for blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> When I held the tube up to light, 1/4 the tube was gone.</li>
            <li> WILL BE PURCHASING AGAIN REAL SOON!!!</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product in the past, and it is the best conditioner for blondes that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love love love it.....and always have 3 extra in my closet at all times...</li>
            <li> Love the whole line of products!</li>
            <li> It really works great though, makes my hair so soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing &amp; tones any brassy areas well, and it leaves my hair amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and soft and manageable&lt;</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really works for me.  </li>
            <li> Bottle wasn&#x27;t completely full.</li>
            <li> But this thing works wonders - it is a light purple, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much toning from it</li>
            <li> This is by far the more efficient hair treatment I have.</li>
            <li> It will brighten your blonde a bit and leave a nice shine though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s A 10 Blonde Miracle spray and have been happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing again because I don&#x27;t feel its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner for blonde hair, takes out the brassy tones.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a lot coming from someone who has had the hardest time finding the right conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice, but not phenomenal like most</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t deep condition as much as I would have liked, but my hair was definitely more soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but I didn&#x27;t want to give it a five star review, as I am saving my five star review for a product that magically turns my completely fried bleached blonde hair into spun, silken gold.</li>
            <li> I just highlighted my hair, they the color looks good and radiant, so it&#x27;s hard to say if this product made a huge difference at this point.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and is very manageable, it is not frizzy and is a very pretty bright blonde.</li>
            <li> Leaves my ends very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It made my damaged, frizzy hair feeling so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> There are much better items on the market that serve the same purpose.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.  </li>
            <li> I cannot express how much Iove this!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping though!</li>
            <li> However, first time I used it</li>
            <li> I highlighted it a few weeks ago and decided I need to make an effort in finding a good product for it, and to minimize dryness and damage.</li>
            <li> makes your hair super soft without weighing it down and it smells SOOOOO good.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I am a blonde, and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement over the regular formula that has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> The results could be seen right away: my hair really looks better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great scent, creamy, deeply moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves fine hair smooth &amp;  detangled, but a bit heavy even with extensive rinsing.</li>
            <li> My hair which I highlight frequently is super soft.</li>
            <li> My hair felt more dry than ever and even seemed more dry than before I had put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way my dry hair feels after using this product</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that has been a bit fried from trying to lighten it, but this product really makes it silky smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Also after shampooing (with a good blonde shampoo like John Frieda Lustrous Touch) towel dry your hair to remove some water then add the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kayla</li>
            <li> I have extremely hard water and highlighted hair....not a good combo but</li>
            <li> but it works really well getting rid of the brass.  </li>
            <li> I was very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> After just one use, I noticed a difference, and after almost a week of use, I feel like my color has improved dramatically and my hair is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Plus I noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair when I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> As for the toning, I didn&#x27;t see much.</li>
            <li> Very straw like.</li>
            <li> It really IS a 10</li>
            <li> Really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> being said, this doesn&#x27;t do much more for my hair than my regular conditioner (redken all soft).  </li>
            <li> but it does a really nice job at keeping my blonde hair from looking brassy or feeling dry.</li>
            <li> At first I was mixing this product with Redken Pure Pearl since Pure Pearl was the only conditioner that really brightened my hair.</li>
            <li> my blonde and red highlughts shine!&lt;br /&gt;Takes the tangles out &amp; makes my hair very manageable  too:)</li>
            <li> I could see that the bottle was only full up to the bottom of the</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> But actually I see no difference if anything the reg blue bottle samples I got is better in the spray</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair long hair that I dye blonde.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It also keeps the pesky red undertones from showing through so much!!</li>
            <li> Maybe when the color starts to fade a little the results are more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the heat and humidity of Texas it is hard to keep your hair nice.  </li>
            <li> it helped sooooo much you will be surprised</li>
            <li> my hair feels even flatter (more limp?) than its usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 line, and when something new comes out...</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer, more pliable and less frizzy/dry after only one treatment.</li>
            <li> It did help condition my blonde hair, but I don&#x27;t know if it really did much</li>
            <li> Brought my dry, brittle hair back to soft, shiny and healthy again.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser had used this product in my hair after having bleached my roots and it was very soft.</li>
            <li> When I got the bottle I just happened to be reading the back of it while holding it up, and the light hit it right which  allowed me to see that it was not a full bottle.</li>
            <li> makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> would definitely not purchase this item for moderately damaged hair, and would definitely not pay more than $10 for it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product,  have being buying this mask for a while now and totally healed my hair,  my hair broke off and was really damaged,  I was afraid to brush it so it won&#x27;t brake more.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth a try for folks with really dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my fine blinda hair.</li>
            <li> HAIR IS SOOOOO SOFT &amp; MANAGEABLE(((GREAT RESULTS)))</li>
            <li> Really like this product for extra conditioning and to reduce brassiness of bleached hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, the only difference in appearance is one I don&#x27;t really like-</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and I as using the product and I really do believe that the produce works try it</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair incredibly soft, shiny, and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft as silk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously cut back the number of times I wash my hair, so use this on every-other wash to help keep my hair looking shiny and healthy and really have seen a difference.</li>
            <li> It was half way full  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be better off using the blonde spray for daily use, rather than putting down cash for this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It changes the texture of my hair so that it feels thicker and softer, and my blow dry lasts so much longer.  </li>
            <li> Giving 3 stars because the bottle was only filled to below the 2/3 and seemed like some of the conditioner was missing...</li>
            <li> but because I received a sample packet of this with the matching leave-in product I wasn&#x27;t too concerned, especially because I got it for $12 when it cost nearly $20 elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural brunette and why I go blonde</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it at every wash, yet it runs out much faster than all the other ones I have.</li>
            <li> I  get it highlighted professionally, blow dry and heat style it regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two bottles now and while my highlighted hair hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse (dry, split ends, etc) it hasn&#x27;t gotten any better, either.</li>
            <li> As far as the &amp;#34;purple magic&amp;#34; for blond hair goes, it does the same job as any other hair care products in purple</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair extremely silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and Caucasian with heavily highlighted (almost completely) non relaxed blonde hair.</li>
            <li> If I bought it in store and paid the full price I would be super disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure if it was the real formula either.</li>
            <li> I am an all over highlighted blonde with long hair and this product did not help with detangling.</li>
            <li> Definitely need to leave it on for a while if you have dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Basically, I bleached my hair too far and got some breakage and limp strands in result.  </li>
            <li> Seems to protect color and leaves my long hair both silky and full.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty damaged due to hard water, heat styling, and highlights.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair dry up or damage from bleaching them.</li>
            <li> My ends do not look dry or shabby, so I can probably go longer between trims as well.  </li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s always been dry, frizzy, and somewhat damaged.</li>
            <li> This product just did not live up to my expectation.  </li>
            <li> After years of being blonde, I decided to go dark.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Not really what it was made for.</li>
            <li> As a blonde with very thin, fine curly hair, it is hard to find a product that won&#x27;t weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is purple (which is supposed to help take out the blond &amp;#34;brassiness&amp;#34;) and is a thick, thick cream.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job extremely well leaving your hair fully moisturized</li>
            <li> unlike any other product.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My hair was easier to comb after washing (less knots) but doesn&#x27;t look much different than it usually does.  </li>
            <li> the shampoo not only nourishes my hair but also takes the hard water by products out.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Having said that, this is not a product that will tone down brassiness if that is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> While the bottle looks small, a little but goes a long way</li>
            <li> I got my conditioner and it have been used, half of the tube was gone..</li>
            <li> Nothing special but nothing bad.</li>
            <li> a little works well.</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get this</li>
            <li> When this arrived I noticed that it seemed to be missing some product</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the hair conditioned and doesnt get so dried out from all the heating tools.</li>
            <li> BUT when I recieved it, it looks as if 1/4 was already missing.</li>
            <li> I have thin dry hair with highlights &amp; lowlights.</li>
            <li> and you can see noticeable differences in your hair after a few uses!</li>
            <li> No more crying!</li>
            <li> I put a small amount into my hair every evening before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Just too small for money.</li>
            <li> My hair has a weird (not soft) texture after using it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle was not full when I received the product.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product, but it&#x27;s just not good enough for non-natural blondes.</li>
            <li> and I usually end up disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I knew it had to be fake.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I returned it.  </li>
            <li> guess is that I got a bootleg formula. :(</li>
            <li> AND AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T DO ANYTHING FOR MY HAIR, I AM RETURNING TODAY VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> quick delivery awesome product</li>
            <li> This is great for brassiness and it makes your hair soft, shiny, and smells good!  I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Great product in every way!  Makes my hair easy to comb out-makes my hair really soft-and smells great!  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This makes my ends soft and shiny :)!!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my blonde and red highlughts shine!&lt;br /&gt;Takes the tangles out &amp; makes my hair very manageable  too:)</li>
            <li> I love this product! I saw a YouTube review on it and decided to order it immediately. While the bottle looks small, a little but goes a long way and I&#x27;m still using it months after purchasing. I&#x27;ve seriously cut back the number of times I wash my hair, so use this on every-other wash to help keep my hair looking shiny and healthy and really have seen a difference. The product itself is purple (which is supposed to help take out the blond &amp;#34;brassiness&amp;#34;) and is a thick, thick cream. I love that it works quickly and you can see noticeable differences in your hair after a few uses!</li>
            <li> this broght my hair back to life!!! i used it once but left it on 10 mins and it brought my hair back to relinished!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave me this.  Basically, I bleached my hair too far and got some breakage and limp strands in result.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work or how &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; it was since I had never heard of it before.  But this thing works wonders - it is a light purple, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much toning from it but it works really well getting rid of the brass.  I had to come look it up to see if others had rated it as well as it worked for me!  My hair is much softer, more pliable and less frizzy/dry after only one treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It softens and leaves the prettiest scent!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my cousin for Christmas. I asked her how did she like it and she said she absolutely loved it and going to buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  In the heat and humidity of Texas it is hard to keep your hair nice.  This product works for me.</li>
            <li> When this arrived I noticed that it seemed to be missing some product but because I received a sample packet of this with the matching leave-in product I wasn&#x27;t too concerned, especially because I got it for $12 when it cost nearly $20 elsewhere. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I love this product but it does a really nice job at keeping my blonde hair from looking brassy or feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It was half way full  but the cream is good..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My hair which I highlight frequently is super soft. And it smells so good too!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous conditioner! I love what just 5 minutes of this product did to my hair! It is worth every penny! It not only softened my hair, but tamed my fly-aways!</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair every 2-3 months. I need something that WORK to restore/recovery my hair. My stylist recommend this brand so I look it up on Amazon. This is by far the more efficient hair treatment I have. It&#x27;s very easy to use. Just make sure you leave on FIVE MINUTES. The result are almost instant. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair dry up or damage from bleaching them. Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AFTER YOU WASH YOUR HAIR IT FEELS SO SILKY AND HEALTHY  I USE THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER ALSO  BUY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T DO ANYTHING FOR MY HAIR, I AM RETURNING TODAY VERY DISAPPOINTED. I HAVE THE LEAVE IN SPRAY THAT WORKS GREAT SO I DECIDED TO TRY THIS AND AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> I have thin dry hair with highlights &amp; lowlights. This smells amazing &amp; tones any brassy areas well, and it leaves my hair amazingly soft. I use it  once/week with the miracle leave in treatment &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> i like, good for my hair</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC CONDITIONER FOR BLONDES !!! FOR FINALIZING YOUR SHAMPOOING!!!  HAIR IS SOOOOO SOFT &amp; MANAGEABLE(((GREAT RESULTS))) COLOUR IS TERRIFIC!!! WILL BE PURCHASING AGAIN REAL SOON!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have extremely hard water and highlighted hair....not a good combo but the shampoo not only nourishes my hair but also takes the hard water by products out. Would def buy again</li>
            <li> Although my daughter does not have blond hair, this product does an excellent job of restoring moisture to her natural hair. No more crying!</li>
            <li> Pretty impressive. I have fine, chemically damaged hair. When I use this my hair feels and looks more like...uh....hair (rather than frizzy straw). Better than anything else I have found.</li>
            <li> Really like this product for extra conditioning and to reduce brassiness of bleached hair.</li>
            <li> This does give my hair some volume and softness but some others are better. But if your looking for a lower price than the better ones this is it&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair long hair that I dye blonde. It doesn&#x27;t even need to move to tangle. This is a great once a week conditioner and smells a lot better than the it&#x27;s a 10 daily. Having said that, this is not a product that will tone down brassiness if that is what you are looking for. It will brighten your blonde a bit and leave a nice shine though.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and soft and manageable&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> my hair has never been happier..I&#x27;m a natural brunette and why I go blonde this stuff is my best friend</li>
            <li> It was good, but not any better than its a 10 with Keratin.</li>
            <li> Love!!! Cheaper on Amazon and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this stuff is great. It made my damaged, frizzy hair feeling so smooth and soft. Plus, it enhanced my blonde hair. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of conditioners but this is my top one! It even tops It&#x27;s a 10 regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice, weightless in your hair. My hair feels great when I use this.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product in the past, and it is the best conditioner for blondes that I have ever used. I purchased this bottle because of the price. Unfortunately, the bottle was not full when I received the product. This issue may not be  store problem here at Amazon, but it may be that the manufacturer reduces the amount of product they add to their containers. Nevertheless, the product is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and my hair does feel smoother.  Definitely need to leave it on for a while if you have dry hair.  I use it a few times a week.  All of  It&#x27;s a 10 products are very nice!</li>
            <li> makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have fine hair that has been a bit fried from trying to lighten it, but this product really makes it silky smooth without weighing it down. It also keeps the pesky red undertones from showing through so much!!</li>
            <li> I use the entire It&#x27;s a 10 line, and when something new comes out...you bet I&#x27;ve got it stashed under the sink. Especially if its&#x27;s for blondes! The thing about this line is that is truly does work. When you have to balance between moisture and protein for your damaged hair, these products hit both extremely well and leave your hair smelling great too! That being said, the Miracle Five Minute Hair Repair for Blondes is, well let&#x27;s just say, it&#x27;s amazing. It does it&#x27;s job extremely well leaving your hair fully moisturized AND it has a tint of purple which all blondes know is a blondes best friend to fight the endless fight against brass and orange that creeps up on us every now and then. It leaves your hair extremely silky and soft.  I&#x27;m a hair dye/platinum doo junkie and this is one of my weapons in the combat of damaged hair I keep in my arsenal!</li>
            <li> I was recommended to use this by my hairdresser, it&#x27;s wonderful. The scent is really pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  have being buying this mask for a while now and totally healed my hair,  my hair broke off and was really damaged,  I was afraid to brush it so it won&#x27;t brake more. after buying this mask OMG it helped sooooo much you will be surprised</li>
            <li> Spectacular at conditioning, evens out hair tone and keeps your color looking good for several weeks after coloring. Great product!</li>
            <li> Some background- I have blonde hair with blonde highlights.  It is fine and not frizzy at all.  I  get it highlighted professionally, blow dry and heat style it regularly. I would say my damage level is 3/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this doesn&#x27;t do much more for my hair than my regular conditioner (redken all soft).  I only used 1/3-1/2 the sample package.  My hair was easier to comb after washing (less knots) but doesn&#x27;t look much different than it usually does.  In fact, the only difference in appearance is one I don&#x27;t really like- my hair feels even flatter (more limp?) than its usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not purchase this item for moderately damaged hair, and would definitely not pay more than $10 for it.  There are much better items on the market that serve the same purpose.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner EVER....it smells devine!!!  I love love love it.....and always have 3 extra in my closet at all times...please please do not discontinue this gem!!!  It is my most favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but I didn&#x27;t want to give it a five star review, as I am saving my five star review for a product that magically turns my completely fried bleached blonde hair into spun, silken gold. IT STILL IS A GREAT PRODUCT, smells nice and does make my hair MUCH MUCH softer than it was before I used it.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and I as using the product and I really do believe that the produce works try it</li>
            <li> I was very unimpressed. I am an all over highlighted blonde with long hair and this product did not help with detangling. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> made my over-processed hair silky smooth overnight!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it smells great and leaves my parched hair with shine and moisture. It keeps my blond beautiful!! I am a hair product junkie and this is one of the best conditioners for blonds! I received very quick which I like to get what I order quickly!  Its a good value because you don&#x27;t need a ton of product, a little works well. I use with the leave in spray as well, they make a good team.</li>
            <li> After years of being blonde, I decided to go dark.  When I wanted to switch back to blonde, my blonde colored dye came out brassy.  I bought this product to improve the brassy tone and soften my hair.  It works!  After just one use, I noticed a difference, and after almost a week of use, I feel like my color has improved dramatically and my hair is much smoother.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner!  It also smells great.  I use this in pair with the It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Leave-In for Blondes.</li>
            <li> love the way this makes my hair feel and smell. Great product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product does what it says!</li>
            <li> makes your hair super soft without weighing it down and it smells SOOOOO good. it&#x27;s purple tinted to help banish brassiness.</li>
            <li> When I got the bottle I just happened to be reading the back of it while holding it up, and the light hit it right which  allowed me to see that it was not a full bottle. I could see that the bottle was only full up to the bottom of the It&#x27;s a 10 writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it was the real formula either. When my hair stylist used this on my hair I remember it had a really pleasant scent. I remember this because she and I even  talked about the scent being so lovely. When I got this product there was no scent that stood out to me. It did help condition my blonde hair, but I don&#x27;t know if it really did much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that I got a bootleg formula. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a 10, or a miracle product.  I think if you have super-duper chemically processed hair and/or using purple shampoo, this conditioner might not meet your needs.  This isn&#x27;t a bad product, but it&#x27;s just not good enough for non-natural blondes.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and I usually end up disappointed.  This stuff is awesome.  My hair is pretty damaged due to hard water, heat styling, and highlights.  I have been using this once a week for a month.  I leave it on 5-10 minutes in combination with Redken Blonde Idol Shampoo.  It leaves my hair incredibly soft, shiny, and bouncy.  A noticeable difference.  My ends do not look dry or shabby, so I can probably go longer between trims as well.  Excellent.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner</li>
            <li> I got my conditioner and it have been used, half of the tube was gone.. TERIIBLE</li>
            <li> I really like this product and that&#x27;s a lot coming from someone who has had the hardest time finding the right conditioner. I&#x27;m African American and Caucasian with heavily highlighted (almost completely) non relaxed blonde hair. I have tried SO many products in my hair with no luck since highlighting and bleaching is so severe on hair. At first I was mixing this product with Redken Pure Pearl since Pure Pearl was the only conditioner that really brightened my hair. Now I leave this product in my hair alone overnight and rinse it out in morning along with adding Redken Color Stay conditioner after rinsing it out, then rinsing again after 5 mins. My hair feels so soft and is very manageable, it is not frizzy and is a very pretty bright blonde. It has the same effect as the toner does in the salon. I have received so many compliments asking if I have had my hair done in a salon. I think the key is leaving this product in longer than 5 minutes.When I was leaving it in for 15 minutes it did not give me the same effect as the overnight treatment. Also after shampooing (with a good blonde shampoo like John Frieda Lustrous Touch) towel dry your hair to remove some water then add the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kayla</li>
            <li> I use this once a week. Keeps the hair conditioned and doesnt get so dried out from all the heating tools.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. Seems to protect color and leaves my long hair both silky and full.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy the leave in spray for blondes as well.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount into my hair every evening before going to bed. I  do not have greasy looking hair in the morning. After my morning swim, I wash out the salt water. Having used this product the night before I do not need to use conditioner in the morning after shampooing</li>
            <li> Just too small for money. But actually I see no difference if anything the reg blue bottle samples I got is better in the spray</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get this but this is a great conditioner for blonde hair.  A little expensive but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.  I actually left it in over night, and rinsed it out the next morning.  It works just as well as the leave-in spray conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love love love! I cannot express how much Iove this!</li>
            <li> Works great. Makes my hair so soft. Smells really good too:)</li>
            <li> Product Works ok. My hair has a weird (not soft) texture after using it. Fast shipping though!</li>
            <li> This 5 minute hair repair is like magic. My hair was very dry and frizzy.  I used this and instantly noticed a difference. My hair was soft as silk. Plus I noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair when I washed my hair. I highly recommend this product, and it smells great. Not a heavy scent, but a very pleasant fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li> I am a highlighted blonde who straightens hair daily. This stuff is nice, but not phenomenal like most It&#x27;s a 10 products. It didn&#x27;t deep condition as much as I would have liked, but my hair was definitely more soft. As for the toning, I didn&#x27;t see much. You&#x27;ll be better off using the blonde spray for daily use, rather than putting down cash for this conditioner. I just wish it was stronger!</li>
            <li> Great scent, creamy, deeply moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves fine hair smooth &amp;  detangled, but a bit heavy even with extensive rinsing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product fulfilled from a different company by amazon. My hair dresser had used this product in my hair after having bleached my roots and it was very soft. So I thought I&#x27;d buy it off amazon.  However, first time I used it I knew it had to be fake. My hair felt more dry than ever and even seemed more dry than before I had put it in my hair. Very straw like. Needless to say I returned it.  I bought this product again at ULTA and it worked wonderfully well.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really works for me.  It changes the texture of my hair so that it feels thicker and softer, and my blow dry lasts so much longer.  It really IS a 10</li>
            <li> this is an awsome product!!</li>
            <li> Although I like &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Ten&amp;#34; in the regular formula, the reformulation for blondes has an overbearing perfume smell that didn&#x27;t dissipate in 24 hours.  Moreover, I am a blonde, and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement over the regular formula that has a pleasant smell.  I&#x27;ll return to the product in the blue bottle.</li>
            <li> Smell goods and wonderful results</li>
            <li> The best quality of this product is detangling. Not really what it was made for. As far as the &amp;#34;purple magic&amp;#34; for blond hair goes, it does the same job as any other hair care products in purple I tried, John Frieda Colour Renew Tone-Correcting conditioner is a good example and priced @ 5$!  Giving 3 stars because the bottle was only filled to below the 2/3 and seemed like some of the conditioner was missing... I don&#x27;t use it at every wash, yet it runs out much faster than all the other ones I have. If I bought it in store and paid the full price I would be super disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s always been dry, frizzy, and somewhat damaged. I highlighted it a few weeks ago and decided I need to make an effort in finding a good product for it, and to minimize dryness and damage. I purchased the It&#x27;s A 10 Blonde Miracle spray and have been happy with it so far. It came with a sample pack of this 5 minute treatment and I tried it tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It smells amazing. Not too strong, but a very pleasant, fresh scent. Personally I&#x27;d get this product just because it smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;-It left my hair shiny, bouncy, healthy-looking, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;-Since I just highlighted my hair, they the color looks good and radiant, so it&#x27;s hard to say if this product made a huge difference at this point. Maybe when the color starts to fade a little the results are more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this treatment. The results could be seen right away: my hair really looks better.&lt;br /&gt;I think for now I&#x27;m done with my search and want to stick to this treatment and the spray. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this and use it almost every day, even though I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m supposed to... but that&#x27;s just how much I love it.  Great scent, better than some of their spray-on leave-in treatments.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Leaves my hair silky smooth and so shiny! Love the whole line of products! Protects my blonde! Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my fine blinda hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way my dry hair feels after using this product</li>
            <li> Bottle wasn&#x27;t completely full. Works ok.</li>
            <li> I love how well this detangles my hair and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff BUT when I recieved it, it looks as if 1/4 was already missing. When I held the tube up to light, 1/4 the tube was gone. It really works great though, makes my hair so soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using 10 Miracle Hair Repair even after a couple washings.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling fantastic</li>
            <li> This product just did not live up to my expectation.  It did not leave my hair looking and feeling conditioned. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I&#x27;ll keep buying over and over! I personally brush it through my hair and leave it in over night. My Platinum hair is soft, bright and beautiful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. Nothing special but nothing bad. I don&#x27;t love the smell. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again because I don&#x27;t feel its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Really like this conditioner.  It works great on my fine, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, I just do not like the smell of it.  Just for that reason I will try and find something else to use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my ends very soft and smooth.  I will purchase this line of products in the future.  I also use the Miracle potion leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> my hair is silk and beautiful champagne blonde when i use this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Smell&#x27;s terrific- unlike any other product. I&#x27;ve used two bottles now and while my highlighted hair hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse (dry, split ends, etc) it hasn&#x27;t gotten any better, either. I think it is worth a try for folks with really dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I Love it!  It works Wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;Sharing this product with friends.</li>
            <li> As a blonde with very thin, fine curly hair, it is hard to find a product that won&#x27;t weigh hair down.  This is now my go-to daily conditioner.  Best I have ever used!  :)</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner for blonde hair, takes out the brassy tones.</li>
            <li> The BEST hair conditioner I have ever used. Brought my dry, brittle hair back to soft, shiny and healthy again.</li>
