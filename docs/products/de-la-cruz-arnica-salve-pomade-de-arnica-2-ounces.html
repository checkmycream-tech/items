            <li>Thank you very much for a job well done and for a 100% perfect support regarding the Arnica Salve Oitment Pomada de Arnica De la Cruz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing since nothing ever seems to work.</li>
            <li>almost floral, but it&#x27;s light and fragrant, all-natural, and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>Effective on damaged skin.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>I really do think some of the ancient medications are best for the body.  </li>
            <li>It seems effective when I applied it to my cut on my arm.  </li>
            <li>It was so amazing to find some relief that I knew finding some Arnica Salve would be even better than the cream.  </li>
            <li>Great product, great price, works wonders for very dry, cracked feet and elbows.</li>
            <li>I need to order some more.</li>

            <li>love this salve.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this product.</li>
            <li>He had tried so many products.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this many times.</li>
            <li>Have tried this on a bruised foot and it seems to make it better sooner.  </li>
            <li>This salve is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I use this on my eczema, works better than the subscription cream.</li>
            <li>A LOT better.</li>
            <li>and I will buy more soon for ailments.</li>
            <li>I love this cream&lt;br /&gt;Omg</li>
            <li>Need it to work legs love it .</li>
            <li>I love this ointment.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This is primarily &amp;#34;petroleum jelly,&amp;#34; better known as Vaseline.</li>
            <li>Easy to rub in and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Soothing comfort and healing comes with every application, but I am not turned off by any strong odor.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my face but the smell was a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Great product at a terrific price</li>
            <li>The cream or gel is far superior to this salve.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a clean, fantastic scent...</li>
            <li>looking to get some more, been searching for it, as baboon syndrom  feels like somebody is holding a whit hot piece of steel on your skin.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it will work great for dry and cracked skin, as it&#x27;s intended, but if you are looking to buy it specifically to feel the benefits of arnica</li>
            <li>i use this arnica on my feet because I have neuropathy; it works pretty good and helps keep my feet soft.  </li>
            <li>It has worked as well or better than NSAID creams and just as fast.  </li>
            <li>painthis relieves it so much, even better than some prescription&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>use this EVERY DAY twice or three times at lease a day and now my feet feel better and look better, I can go wtih out shoes and not feel ashamed to go outside.</li>
            <li>It helps with dry skin &amp; it smells so pleasant.  </li>
            <li>My feet felt better overnight, and within two days they felt normal.</li>
            <li>that very minute!!</li>
            <li>and IT REALLY HELPED!!  </li>
            <li>I put the salve right over it....</li>
            <li>Use regularly and found it in a drug store until recently, so was so happy to find it on line.  </li>
            <li>AND DOESN&#x27;T TAKE VERY MUCH OF THE PRODUCT TO STAY ON.</li>
            <li>This was the exact salve that I found.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t smell like an old lady , the scent is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have time to write reviews for everything I write but know that if I take the time to add this then the product was as described and the sale pas a positive experience.</li>
            <li>My boys (14 and 4) are very accident prone and they always have bruises.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>So, Thanks for providing this item.</li>
            <li>thanks I hope it works for some.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing</li>
            <li>Thanks I like that you guys had it sealed and that is was unused.</li>
            <li>and I think it does, but not as much as I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>really helped my knee.</li>
            <li>It helped but other creams/ointments helped better.  </li>
            <li>Well, it didn&#x27;t smell bad, but I didn&#x27;t notice a \\&quot;refreshing smell of flowers\\&quot;, more a herbal smell and not mint, rosemary, or eucalyptus... less pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Classic mistake of not reading the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it actually healed the bruising, but it smells fantastic and made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I bruise very easily and have anemia--all of which effect my skin in a very dramatically negative way.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no sting to it even on an open wound like a cut (which is what I was using it on--a deep cut), it absorbs easily, and it doesn&#x27;t stain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The creams usually worked - but took a week or more before I saw any improvement.  </li>
            <li>Too firm to easily use</li>
            <li>I developed a very sensitive knee and ACL and decided to try Arnica Salve.  </li>
            <li>I actually ordered the wrong product but have been using this on my cracked heels and it works great.</li>
            <li>I buy this frequently</li>
            <li>The skin on the heels of my feet crack frequently.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>I was told that using Arnica on bruising was one of the most common uses for it, that it helped heal bruising.</li>
            <li>Its okay, very small size for the  price.</li>
            <li>This cheap and all natural cream works WONDERS for dry chapped elbows and dry skin in general.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time too, not needing to be reapplied very often but keeping skin soft.</li>
            <li>the next day wake up brand new again .</li>
            <li>Works incredibly well on my hand and fingers which tend to dry out and crack badly in winter.  </li>
            <li>ARNICA IS MIRACULOUS, it helps diminish bruising and pain, ARNICA is a life saver, especially for those of us who have major skin disorders and are extremely sensitive to anything topical.  </li>
            <li>One old male, one old female, and one young woman use Arnica Salve on dry skin and it keeps it from cracking!</li>

            <li> Works incredibly well on my hand and fingers which tend to dry out and crack badly in winter.  </li>
            <li> ARNICA IS MIRACULOUS, it helps diminish bruising and pain, ARNICA is a life saver, especially for those of us who have major skin disorders and are extremely sensitive to anything topical.  </li>
            <li> One old male, one old female, and one young woman use Arnica Salve on dry skin and it keeps it from cracking!</li>
            <li> Have not had it long enough to see if it woks as promised</li>
            <li> ,now is not so bad thanks to arnica salve my god huuuuuge difference specially on plyo days</li>
            <li> But, I only used it about four times; the greasy feel just kept me worrying about getting it on other things...</li>
            <li> and I recommend it for dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li> The benefits to my dry and splitting hands in the winter months, to minimizing a bruise.  </li>
            <li> It has been a dry winter and hands and feet are dry, so it works well.</li>
            <li> and I hoped this might do the same thing for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands, my elbows and other dry skin areas</li>
            <li> Not what I expected it is not ARNICARE ---</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT A FAST SOLUTION</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t pink and gaping, but closing and not inflamed.  </li>
            <li> the next morning my knuckles were smoother and even a little moisturized and the crack started to heal!  </li>
            <li> A foreign friend of mine told me about this product</li>
            <li> I had an open crack that was pretty painful.  </li>
            <li> I put arnica on everything from their bruises (it helps break down the blood clots that cause the bruising)</li>
            <li> This is basically scented petroleum jelly with a little bit of arnica in it.</li>
            <li> I have been to the doctor a few times through the years for this issue and have gotten prescriptions for creams that should take care of the issue.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of arnica, but apparently, in other countries besides the US, this is a common household item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excema is mean and Arnica was beneficial for the dried up skin and softening of the thickened skin left behind.</li>
            <li> It is a small pill taken 5/time sublingually.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M EVEN TRYING IT ON MY CHEEKS TO TRY TO GET RID OF SOME SMALL SPIDER VEINS I HAVE.</li>
            <li> but it cost about 20 dollars for a small jar</li>
            <li> She is one of the very few people that still do everything holistically</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard to get out.</li>
            <li> It has a stinging feeling and for the place and purpose that I&#x27;m using it, that is not good.</li>

            <li> Great product at a terrific price</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, and when I applied it there was an unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I use Arnica all the time. It is great for bruising and sore muscles. Best thing I have found that works.</li>
            <li> Works good on my arthritis</li>
            <li> Effective on damaged skin. Smells plesent.</li>
            <li> Use for scrapes, eczema, rashes. You name it. It&#x27;s my go to product</li>
            <li> I actually ordered the wrong product but have been using this on my cracked heels and it works great.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great! It works for everything from chapped lips, do puffy eyes! I need to order some more.</li>
            <li> Have not had it long enough to see if it woks as promised</li>
            <li> It smells nice. I didn&#x27;t notice any effects on my hand pain or numbness.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected it is not ARNICARE ---</li>
            <li> Great for bruises. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard to get out. The cream or gel is far superior to this salve.</li>
            <li> My boys (14 and 4) are very accident prone and they always have bruises. I put arnica on everything from their bruises (it helps break down the blood clots that cause the bruising), I use it on their lips when they&#x27;re chapped, even on my hands when they get chapped in the winter. Delivery is about 2 weeks but so worth the wait as the product is awesome! I buy this frequently</li>
            <li> I had heard of Arnica Montana.  It is a small pill taken 5/time sublingually.  I thought it worked well so when I found Arnica Salve I had to try it.  This was the exact salve that I found.  I developed a very sensitive knee and ACL and decided to try Arnica Salve.  It has worked as well or better than NSAID creams and just as fast.  I really do think some of the ancient medications are best for the body.  I will always go to this salve for sprains, abrasions, and cracked skin.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> This cheap and all natural cream works WONDERS for dry chapped elbows and dry skin in general.  I use 2-3 times week and its best quality is its not greasy! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, works wonders for very dry, cracked feet and elbows. It Makes one fell a bit youthful.</li>
            <li> Anything that has Arnica in it is great.  I did not order this, my friend did, and what I wanted was Arnica Cream, not ointment. Be that as it may, I still love Arnica because it helps!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great for any type of wound healing!</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well on my hand and fingers which tend to dry out and crack badly in winter.  Soothing comfort and healing comes with every application, but I am not turned off by any strong odor.  The product is a must for those in a tough winter climate.</li>
            <li> This is primarily &amp;#34;petroleum jelly,&amp;#34; better known as Vaseline.</li>
            <li> The skin on the heels of my feet crack frequently. I have been to the doctor a few times through the years for this issue and have gotten prescriptions for creams that should take care of the issue. The creams usually worked - but took a week or more before I saw any improvement.  My wife bought some of this Arnica Salve and I tried it.  My feet felt better overnight, and within two days they felt normal. I plan to buy more of this to always keep on hand in my nightstand.  I won&#x27;t hesitate to use it on my hands and elbows also when the skin on them crack.</li>
            <li> It helped but other creams/ointments helped better.  It has a stinging feeling and for the place and purpose that I&#x27;m using it, that is not good.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Had a problem getting the package but it was USPS fault. Anyways great product</li>
            <li> I have very bad feet surface and this helps to elimenate the problem that the salve is indicated to correct.&lt;br /&gt;I use this EVERY DAY twice or three times at lease a day and now my feet feel better and look better, I can go wtih out shoes and not feel ashamed to go outside. So, Thanks for providing this item.</li>
            <li> love this salve. works great</li>
            <li> I have been using Arnica for awhile now and I recommend it for dry, cracked heels. I was surprised to find it on Amazon but then again Amazon is a company I can always count on.</li>
            <li> ARNICA SALVE IS GREAT FOR BRUISES ON YOUR LEGS AND THIGHS AND ELSE WHERE. IT&#x27;S NOT A FAST SOLUTION BUT IF USED FAITHFULLY IT DOES WORK. I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT&#x27;S A SALVE AND I LIKE THE WAY IT CAN BE RUBBED ON YOUR SKIN AND DOESN&#x27;T TAKE VERY MUCH OF THE PRODUCT TO STAY ON. I&#x27;M EVEN TRYING IT ON MY CHEEKS TO TRY TO GET RID OF SOME SMALL SPIDER VEINS I HAVE. I&#x27;VE GIVEN THE SALVE TO MY DAUGHTER FOR HER USE.</li>
            <li> I got this to see if it would help the pain in my neck. It&#x27;s amazing since nothing ever seems to work. I also use it when I get bug bites and used on my dog for a cut. Great ointment!</li>
            <li> Bought this at a local CVS. Got home and tried it on immediately knew that it was not what I was looking for. This is basically scented petroleum jelly with a little bit of arnica in it. Classic mistake of not reading the ingredients. Anyways, it will work great for dry and cracked skin, as it&#x27;s intended, but if you are looking to buy it specifically to feel the benefits of arnica then I would suggest finding a different product - perhaps a cream or Trameel. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I never rec&#x27;d product. I had to cancel tried some from a friend and it didn&#x27;t not work. thanks I hope it works for some.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this product. He has a problem on his heel. He had tried so many products. None of them work. Until he tried this one, he loves it. We do re order twice already.</li>
            <li> Too firm to easily use</li>
            <li> I have ordered this many times. I plan to never run out !  When in severe neck and muscle painthis relieves it so much, even better than some prescription&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of arnica, but apparently, in other countries besides the US, this is a common household item. A foreign friend of mine told me about this product and I had some dry skin issues, some cracked skin issues, and bad bruise from an injury. I was told that using Arnica on bruising was one of the most common uses for it, that it helped heal bruising. I can&#x27;t say it actually healed the bruising, but it smells fantastic and made my skin soft. I use it on my hands, my elbows and other dry skin areas and I used it on a wound to keep the edges moist while healing. It works great. There&#x27;s no sting to it even on an open wound like a cut (which is what I was using it on--a deep cut), it absorbs easily, and it doesn&#x27;t stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention it smells great? It&#x27;s really a clean, fantastic scent... almost floral, but it&#x27;s light and fragrant, all-natural, and feels great on the skin. It lasts a long time too, not needing to be reapplied very often but keeping skin soft. I would imagine this would work great for someone with eczema or psoriasis, with doctor&#x27;s permission, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be keeping a jar of this around the house from now on.</li>
            <li> i use this arnica on my feet because I have neuropathy; it works pretty good and helps keep my feet soft.  it is greasy so I wear good socks with it, but I like greasy.</li>
            <li> Have tried this on a bruised foot and it seems to make it better sooner.  Easy to rub in and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> I wish I knew the smell in advance.  It seems effective when I applied it to my cut on my arm.  I tried it on my face but the smell was a bit strong.</li>
            <li> Arnica is incredible!  The benefits to my dry and splitting hands in the winter months, to minimizing a bruise.  This stuff really works.  Smells pleasent also.</li>
            <li> No joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this stuff on my knuckles this winter.  I had an open crack that was pretty painful.  I put the salve right over it....the next morning my knuckles were smoother and even a little moisturized and the crack started to heal!  It wasn&#x27;t pink and gaping, but closing and not inflamed.  This salve is fantastic!</li>
            <li> One old male, one old female, and one young woman use Arnica Salve on dry skin and it keeps it from cracking!</li>
            <li> Its okay, very small size for the  price.</li>
            <li> I use this on my eczema, works better than the subscription cream. A LOT better.</li>
            <li> I had gotten Penetrex that had arnica in it to help the pain in my knees but it cost about 20 dollars for a small jar and I hoped this might do the same thing for a lot less money. Plus it said it was good for cracked skin and smelled good. Well, it didn&#x27;t smell bad, but I didn&#x27;t notice a \\&quot;refreshing smell of flowers\\&quot;, more a herbal smell and not mint, rosemary, or eucalyptus... less pleasant.  Someone said it felt great on their skin. Not me, it felt greasy to me.  They said it relieved their cracked skin... I&#x27;d say it did this about as well as Vaseline. I didn&#x27;t notice any pain relief.  But, I only used it about four times; the greasy feel just kept me worrying about getting it on other things...the furniture, my clothes, the floor ( go barefoot a lot).</li>
            <li> Use regularly and found it in a drug store until recently, so was so happy to find it on line.  It has been a dry winter and hands and feet are dry, so it works well.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and I will buy more soon for ailments. Thanks I like that you guys had it sealed and that is was unused.</li>
            <li> I have a severe problem with skin and this makes my skin say thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Excema is mean and Arnica was beneficial for the dried up skin and softening of the thickened skin left behind.</li>
            <li> I have discoidal Lupus and after a breakout my skin is bruised, discolored and tremendously painful.  A dear, elderly, wonderful neighbor was insistent that I go out and buy ARNICA cream that very minute!! She is one of the very few people that still do everything holistically and/or by way of naturopathy before even THINKING of going out to the Doctor.  Additionally, I bruise very easily and have anemia--all of which effect my skin in a very dramatically negative way.  So, I did go out a bought some arnica cream and IT REALLY HELPED!!  It was so amazing to find some relief that I knew finding some Arnica Salve would be even better than the cream.  Since finding and using ARNICA I sprained my ankle, which resulted in blackish-blueish purple bloody bruising from mid calf to the bottom of my feet with terrible pain---ARNICA IS MIRACULOUS, it helps diminish bruising and pain, ARNICA is a life saver, especially for those of us who have major skin disorders and are extremely sensitive to anything topical.  This is a must!!!</li>
            <li> I would rather make my own cr√®me with ARNICA MONTANA X3 TABS put in any good lotion...</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for a job well done and for a 100% perfect support regarding the Arnica Salve Oitment Pomada de Arnica De la Cruz. Thank you for your support.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended as a good way to heal cracked skin and it does.  Arnica is also reported to help with arthritic pain and I think it does, but not as much as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this ointment on my finger and toe nails and find that it helps with aging nail problems.</li>
            <li> I love this cream&lt;br /&gt;Omg with a passion , I&#x27;m a gym rat and my joints are all mest up they always hurt from lifting weights also my hamstrings are tight and they hurt sooooo bad after working my legs and I use this on both of my knees also my elbow I had tennis elbow before  ,now is not so bad thanks to arnica salve my god huuuuuge difference specially on plyo days I hop all over the place and the next day wake up brand new again . Don&#x27;t smell like an old lady , the scent is not bad at all. Need it to work legs love it .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have time to write reviews for everything I write but know that if I take the time to add this then the product was as described and the sale pas a positive experience.</li>
            <li> looking to get some more, been searching for it, as baboon syndrom  feels like somebody is holding a whit hot piece of steel on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is petroleum jelly. I should&#x27;ve read the ingredients before purchasing this. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you just want petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> soothes, smoothes, does what it is supposed to</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what l think..</li>
            <li> really helped my knee.</li>
            <li> A must have for all those nasty bruises they we tend to get as we get older.</li>
            <li> I love this ointment.  I massage it into my hands &amp; feet almost every night then put on a pair of moisturizing gloves and socks for about an hour. It helps with dry skin &amp; it smells so pleasant.  Arnica salve also helps soothe pain.</li>
            <li> There is NO ARNICA in it.  May work on cracked skin but not on bruises.  Check the ingrediants before you purchase.</li>
            <li> Works for wat I need it to do . Takes my pain away too . Love it</li>
