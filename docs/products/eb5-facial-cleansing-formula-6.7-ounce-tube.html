            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE. AND I DO LOVE IT. IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL SO SOFT AND CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;  I WILL CONTINUE USING EB5.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my 81 year old Mom and she looks 70 because she&#x27;s been using it a long time.  I just wish it would be a little cheaper because of her fixed income but I guess you pay to be beautiful.</li>

            <li> My mother loves this cream. She used to be able to buy it in Puerto Rico but they no longer sale it over the island. I purchased it here but to my surprise I wasn&#x27;t able to ship from your warehouse to Puerto Rico. I had to have it ship to my house and then re shipped to Puerto Rico. That is just ridiculous so much for buying on line I guess. I had to go to the post office stand in line for two hours to re shipped to my mother.</li>

            <li> I like this cleanser for times that I am not wearing makeup.  It does not remove eye makeup and some base makeup comes off on the towel after I have washed with this cleanser.  It does not lather, it is a cream cleanser.</li>
