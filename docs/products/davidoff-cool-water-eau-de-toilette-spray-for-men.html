            <li>I love cool water and my wife loves it too, I am happy with this product i use it everyday now</li>
            <li>The smell is so fresh and cool not too strong or&lt;br /&gt;over- powering.</li>
            <li>HOPE YOU HAVE  SOME SPECIAL SALES OFFER OF THIS COOL WATER, SOON.</li>
            <li>I prefer Cool Water during the daytime in spring or summer but it can be worn at night also.</li>
            <li>Good for price similar to creed GIT</li>
            <li>Been using Cool Water for years.</li>
            <li>Cool Water is an exception.  </li>
            <li>The spray bottles were packaged very well for shipping and arrived safe and sound.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i like the Cool Water By Davidoff For Men Edt Spray 6.7 Oz  </li>
            <li>Cool Water By Davidoff For Men Edt Spray 6.7 Oz</li>
            <li>Cool perfume.</li>
            <li>Cool fragrance.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;everybody loves this scent on me and this is a classic favorite</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update...it is now seeping more and there is a crack following the seam at the top edge of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Many people are surprised when I tell them its&#x27; Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>Fresh scent with hints of fruity citrus&lt;</li>
            <li>This product is very wonderful and lasts long for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>Its cool, I mostly like it because it brings me back to the days of snoop dong with his baby powder and cool water cologne.</li>
            <li>Suitable for daily use and worthy for the price paid.</li>
            <li>It is very fresh and clean yet still masculine.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a larger size for the first time due to the great price!</li>
            <li>Last week, I got a chance to had a shot from the \\&quot;Original\\&quot; and the smell is totally different, and the Original is so cool, and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear!  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, long lasting with such a pleasant smell which works just fine for me!</li>
            <li>As I get older, I find I am very repulsed by really strong cologne on anyone.  </li>
            <li>My brother likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Cool Water is a classic for a reason.</li>
            <li>Was not the normal cool water smell.</li>
            <li>We ordered 2 of the 6.7 Oz bottles and were so pleased they were delivered with the Standard shipping in two days!!  </li>
            <li>Cool Water is a soft fresh smelling product.</li>
            <li>Love the big size, gave to my son for Christmas.</li>
            <li>This has been my personal favorite since 1997.  </li>
            <li>first seen and</li>
            <li>I prefer this product because the scent is pleasant, not overwhelming, and my lady does not catch the scent when I am parking the car to come in.</li>
            <li>The seller was nice enough to send me a pre-paid return envelope and Amazon gave me a full refund, but to save people the headache in the future, know that you&#x27;re going to get Deep and not the original Cool Water.</li>
            <li>Very cool feel and surprinsingly lasting smell.</li>
            <li>You could barely smell the original scent.  </li>
            <li>I have not used Cool Water for awhile due to me trying other products and Cool Water still smells as refreshing as it did the first time I tried it!</li>
            <li>Its a classic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very versatile and can be used anytime of year in any weather.</li>
            <li>Never get tired of that great smell.</li>
            <li>but it appears to be the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The box was not shrink-wrapped and the liquid seemed very diluted.  </li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>Got it fast and was just as posted/Great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed going back to old skool</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend and the size of the bottle is huge so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It smells very good, but my main complaint was that for the price it should last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>The box arrived with no outside damage but the bottle of Cool Water had a large horizontal crack (about 5 inches) across the top, right above the name and it follows the curve of the bottle towards the back and starts heading downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Cool Water For Men for over a decade and regularly receive compliments on it.</li>
            <li>It is not very strong compared to the ones available in the store!</li>
            <li>Since we both wear it nearly everyday, the smaller bottles can soon be depleted fairly rapidly.  </li>
            <li>Same pakcage, and more importantly same smell.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is this bottle is a big bottle where the Armani bottle is a forth of the size at virtually the same price.</li>
            <li>The last thing to mention is you can actually smell this one after you&#x27;ve applied it, so it&#x27;s decently strong, but not too overpowering unless you spray too much of it on yourself, of course.</li>
            <li>Even at the Outlet Stores which are located near us here in the Desert don&#x27;t sell it for THAT much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Most colognes or Eau de Toillets we have tried in the past are really overpowering or smell like deodorant soap.  </li>
            <li>The concentration of fragance is not one normally gets</li>
            <li>But accepted assuming a new product.</li>
            <li>I am experimenting with finding myself within a certain cologne and although I&#x27;m not sure if this is THE ONE, it does smell better than another cologne I bought as well as this one which is actually the Armani Code cologne.</li>
            <li>no matter what cologne you choose or anyone chooses you can never go wrong with cool water which is always one of my old time favorite.</li>
            <li>Cool water has a reputation of lasting long this doesn&#x27;t live up to that</li>
            <li>You have to put your nose to your skin to even know you put this imitation Cool Water on.</li>
            <li>It is actually Cool Water DEEP, not Cool Water, and Cool Water Deep</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and extra care shown in packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and received frequent compliments regarding it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>THOUGH IT CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY AND HAS ZERO FINGRPRINTS ID</li>
            <li>I have purchased several other items over the last six years, mostly cologns for my wife.  </li>
            <li>any particular proof- but definitely not up to the mark.</li>
            <li>Davidoff for men&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying this product for many years, but the last three few times, its scent does not last.</li>
            <li>I was unsure about buying, finally gave in an ordered, I was skeptical at first but smells exactly like dept store cool water.</li>
            <li>Fast and just as expected</li>
            <li>and wow big difference from this big bottle of junk.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> br /&gt;everybody loves this scent on me and this is a classic favorite</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update...it is now seeping more and there is a crack following the seam at the top edge of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Many people are surprised when I tell them its&#x27; Cool Water.  </li>
            <li> Fresh scent with hints of fruity citrus&lt;</li>
            <li> This product is very wonderful and lasts long for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Its cool, I mostly like it because it brings me back to the days of snoop dong with his baby powder and cool water cologne.</li>
            <li> Suitable for daily use and worthy for the price paid.</li>
            <li> It is very fresh and clean yet still masculine.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a larger size for the first time due to the great price!</li>
            <li> Last week, I got a chance to had a shot from the \\&quot;Original\\&quot; and the smell is totally different, and the Original is so cool, and very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday wear!  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, long lasting with such a pleasant smell which works just fine for me!</li>
            <li> As I get older, I find I am very repulsed by really strong cologne on anyone.  </li>
            <li> My brother likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Cool Water is a classic for a reason.</li>
            <li> Was not the normal cool water smell.</li>
            <li> We ordered 2 of the 6.7 Oz bottles and were so pleased they were delivered with the Standard shipping in two days!!  </li>
            <li> Cool Water is a soft fresh smelling product.</li>
            <li> Love the big size, gave to my son for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This has been my personal favorite since 1997.  </li>
            <li> first seen and</li>
            <li> I prefer this product because the scent is pleasant, not overwhelming, and my lady does not catch the scent when I am parking the car to come in.</li>
            <li> The seller was nice enough to send me a pre-paid return envelope and Amazon gave me a full refund, but to save people the headache in the future, know that you&#x27;re going to get Deep and not the original Cool Water.</li>
            <li> Very cool feel and surprinsingly lasting smell.</li>
            <li> You could barely smell the original scent.  </li>
            <li> I have not used Cool Water for awhile due to me trying other products and Cool Water still smells as refreshing as it did the first time I tried it!</li>
            <li> Its a classic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very versatile and can be used anytime of year in any weather.</li>
            <li> Never get tired of that great smell.</li>
            <li> but it appears to be the real deal.  </li>
            <li> The box was not shrink-wrapped and the liquid seemed very diluted.  </li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> Got it fast and was just as posted/Great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed going back to old skool</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend and the size of the bottle is huge so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It smells very good, but my main complaint was that for the price it should last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> The box arrived with no outside damage but the bottle of Cool Water had a large horizontal crack (about 5 inches) across the top, right above the name and it follows the curve of the bottle towards the back and starts heading downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Cool Water For Men for over a decade and regularly receive compliments on it.</li>
            <li> It is not very strong compared to the ones available in the store!</li>
            <li> Since we both wear it nearly everyday, the smaller bottles can soon be depleted fairly rapidly.  </li>
            <li> Same pakcage, and more importantly same smell.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is this bottle is a big bottle where the Armani bottle is a forth of the size at virtually the same price.</li>
            <li> The last thing to mention is you can actually smell this one after you&#x27;ve applied it, so it&#x27;s decently strong, but not too overpowering unless you spray too much of it on yourself, of course.</li>
            <li> Even at the Outlet Stores which are located near us here in the Desert don&#x27;t sell it for THAT much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Most colognes or Eau de Toillets we have tried in the past are really overpowering or smell like deodorant soap.  </li>
            <li> The concentration of fragance is not one normally gets</li>
            <li> But accepted assuming a new product.</li>
            <li> I am experimenting with finding myself within a certain cologne and although I&#x27;m not sure if this is THE ONE, it does smell better than another cologne I bought as well as this one which is actually the Armani Code cologne.</li>
            <li> no matter what cologne you choose or anyone chooses you can never go wrong with cool water which is always one of my old time favorite.</li>
            <li> Cool water has a reputation of lasting long this doesn&#x27;t live up to that</li>
            <li> You have to put your nose to your skin to even know you put this imitation Cool Water on.</li>
            <li> It is actually Cool Water DEEP, not Cool Water, and Cool Water Deep</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and extra care shown in packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and received frequent compliments regarding it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> THOUGH IT CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY AND HAS ZERO FINGRPRINTS ID</li>
            <li> I have purchased several other items over the last six years, mostly cologns for my wife.  </li>
            <li> any particular proof- but definitely not up to the mark.</li>
            <li> Davidoff for men&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying this product for many years, but the last three few times, its scent does not last.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about buying, finally gave in an ordered, I was skeptical at first but smells exactly like dept store cool water.</li>
            <li> Fast and just as expected</li>
            <li> and wow big difference from this big bottle of junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the typical new ones these days that are &amp;#34;In</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit diluted and the scent does not last long.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Does not last very long when applied.  </li>
            <li> I can always smell it a mile away and the people who wears it must have absolutely no sense of smell left in their nose.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that is normal, or what.</li>
            <li> Cool Water is still fairly expensive to buy in department stores.  </li>
            <li> The box and bottle are the same as in the stores but what ever was put in the bottle is not Cool Water.</li>
            <li> the product was exactly as i expected.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints</li>
            <li> Just what I expected, I used this brand before and lasts longer when applied than other cologne&#x27;s that I have used.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT REAL COOL WATER COLOGNE</li>
            <li> This cologne has very little scent and does not last.</li>
            <li> This item can not be returned due to being a safety hazard according to amazon.</li>
            <li> However, with this particular bottle the scent is so weak after a few minutes, that you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> must be watered down....</li>
            <li> This time I paid lot less for it compared to what I use to pay in the department stores,</li>
            <li> half that amount.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried that this would be some watered down knock off</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> and I have tried quite a few.  </li>
            <li> It is not strong, yet you&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> want to stop short of calling it a fake- since I dont have</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this product at all.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne and to find it locally can get expensive.</li>
            <li> They all say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;delightful&amp;#34; is what I usually get from people.</li>
            <li> Not much more I can say.</li>
            <li> Got a small bottle in a gift set and did a comparison</li>
            <li> This is definitely very weak compared to the ones I have bought from Sams Club, Perfumania or other places in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I seriously wish all Customer Service departments were like this.</li>
            <li> This is not Cool Water, this is a bad imitation.</li>
            <li> Cologne was fine,but bottle was broken.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has the wrong picture for this item.</li>
            <li> FAKE</li>
            <li> Any fool can tell its a fake.</li>
            <li> Ill order again after I finish this bottle</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of this product and believe I received a counterfeit.</li>
            <li> and amazon should be refunding everyone who has purchased this crap.</li>
            <li> I think the worst I&#x27;ve ever smelled is Jean Paul Gaultier &amp;#34;LE MALE&amp;#34; cologne for men.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite cologne of all time.</li>
            <li> my favorite.The ladies love it</li>
            <li> Great product for a low price.Delivery was fast and extra care shown in packaging.</li>
            <li> For the price, this was a steal. Huge bottle for $45 when at the mall this would of easily cost me $72-75. More than happy and my dad LOVED it!</li>
            <li> Amazon has the wrong picture for this item. It is actually Cool Water DEEP, not Cool Water, and Cool Water Deep smells assy. The seller was nice enough to send me a pre-paid return envelope and Amazon gave me a full refund, but to save people the headache in the future, know that you&#x27;re going to get Deep and not the original Cool Water.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS COLOGNE BUTS ITS A FAKE THIS IS NOT REAL COOL WATER COLOGNE THE SMELL WARES OFF ABOUT TEN MINUTES DO NOT BUY FROM HERE.</li>
            <li> I have not used Cool Water for awhile due to me trying other products and Cool Water still smells as refreshing as it did the first time I tried it! It&#x27;s been and always will be one of my favorites! It&#x27;s light, long lasting with such a pleasant smell which works just fine for me! I ordered a larger size for the first time due to the great price! I get nice compliments from the ladies too!!</li>
            <li> In my opinion Cool Water is one of the best men&#x27;s fragrances available for those on a budget.  The fragrance has a very clean fresh scent that is perfect for daytime wear. It is non offensive. Everybody likes this smell. It isn&#x27;t musky, or spicy, or powdery, or fruity, or soapy. It smells very fresh and makes a man smell well groomed in an outdoorsy kind of way. It&#x27;s also very versatile and can be used anytime of year in any weather. I prefer Cool Water during the daytime in spring or summer but it can be worn at night also. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. Cool Water is a classic for a reason.</li>
            <li> Yes, this bottle Eas Great. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have orded this item and been able to bring it to Sri lanka. Was not the normal cool water smell. But accepted assuming a new product. Last week, I got a chance to had a shot from the \\&quot;Original\\&quot; and the smell is totally different, and the Original is so cool, and very refreshing. So assume the one shipped was a Cheap Duplicate. Do not buy the Mens one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orderd a women Coll water too, and it was the Original.</li>
            <li> Good for price similar to creed GIT but it is synthetic ,but very nice to have it,best part is its price for 6.7oz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit diluted and the scent does not last long. It is not very strong compared to the ones available in the store!</li>
            <li> All My Lady Friends Love This Sent On Me,&lt;br /&gt;Especially The Love of My Life \\&quot;BabyGirl\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;As For The Price For The 6.7Oz Well Its Okay 4Me...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of this product and believe I received a counterfeit. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long. The cap for the bottle doesn&#x27;t fit snugly onto the bottle.</li>
            <li> Item as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Totally love Cool Water. It&#x27;s authentic. Priced very fairly</li>
            <li> Been using Cool Water for years. Never get tired of that great smell.</li>
            <li> This is definitely very weak compared to the ones I have bought from Sams Club, Perfumania or other places in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I want to stop short of calling it a fake- since I dont have any particular proof- but definitely not up to the mark.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by stating that neither I or my Partner are big Cologne Guys!  Most colognes or Eau de Toillets we have tried in the past are really overpowering or smell like deodorant soap.  As I get older, I find I am very repulsed by really strong cologne on anyone.  \\&quot;Assault to the Senses\\&quot;, as I refer to it!  Where your eyes burn, you can actually taste perfume or cologne in your throat and the lingering stench when a person who bathes in perfume walks by....Anyway!&lt;br /&gt;Davidoff Cool Water is an exception.  We both like it because you can spray 2 shots in the morning and maybe another 2 in the evening and it is never \\&quot;loud\\&quot; or obnoxious a scent.  It is very fresh and clean yet still masculine.  People comment constantly, \\&quot;You smell nice!  What is that?\\&quot;  Since we both wear it nearly everyday, the smaller bottles can soon be depleted fairly rapidly.  Cool Water is still fairly expensive to buy in department stores.  Even at the Outlet Stores which are located near us here in the Desert don&#x27;t sell it for THAT much cheaper.  We ordered 2 of the 6.7 Oz bottles and were so pleased they were delivered with the Standard shipping in two days!!  The spray bottles were packaged very well for shipping and arrived safe and sound.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder from amazon.com when we start running low again!!</li>
            <li> Davidoff for men&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying this product for many years, but the last three few times, its scent does not last. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent 100% recomended.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this product at all. The concentration of fragance is not one normally gets</li>
            <li> What a perfect scent so manly but yet smooth</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I always get the question, what is your colone? Cool Water is a soft fresh smelling product. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Does not last very long when applied.  Maybe an hour or so? It smells very good, but my main complaint was that for the price it should last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> he was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> i like the Cool Water By Davidoff For Men Edt Spray 6.7 Oz  Cool Water By Davidoff For Men Edt Spray 6.7 Oz</li>
            <li> Just what I expected, I used this brand before and lasts longer when applied than other cologne&#x27;s that I have used.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne and to find it locally can get expensive. I couldn&#x27;t believe the size I got for the price I paid! I am very happy with what I paid and my husband is very happy with his big bottle of his favorite cologne! It also arrived when it said it would so another plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed going back to old skool and i&#x27;ve gotten SO many compliments on how good it smells to them.  Many people are surprised when I tell them its&#x27; Cool Water.  They all say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;delightful&amp;#34; is what I usually get from people. I agree!!  It&#x27;s not the typical new ones these days that are &amp;#34;In Your Face and Up Your Nose&amp;#34; cologne that is abrasive and repelling.  I can&#x27;t believe some of the ones out there these days.  I think the worst I&#x27;ve ever smelled is Jean Paul Gaultier &amp;#34;LE MALE&amp;#34; cologne for men.  The closest I can describe is that it smells like Raid Roach spray.  I can always smell it a mile away and the people who wears it must have absolutely no sense of smell left in their nose.  Or they like the smell of Raid Roach Kill.</li>
            <li> I was worried about reviews saying it was a knock off, but I don&#x27;t think so at all.  Same pakcage, and more importantly same smell.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Its a classic! Great for everyday wear!  excellent fragance at excellent Price for the 200ml bottle! Women always ask what perfum am I wearing, they love it!</li>
            <li> Love the big size, gave to my son for Christmas. Shipped on time. Would order it agin. Not much more I can say.</li>
            <li> Decent price, decent shipping, good and reputable vendor.</li>
            <li> must be watered down....a lot...actually.&lt;br /&gt;No comparison to the units i got in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Will not order again....</li>
            <li> Love it smells great and great price for amount of bottle</li>
            <li> This is not Cool Water, this is a bad imitation. I have an original bottle of Cool Water and this does not smell like it at all. You have to put your nose to your skin to even know you put this imitation Cool Water on. This item can not be returned due to being a safety hazard according to amazon. I read the reviews and thought if I did not like it I could return it, but that is not the case. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did thinking that I was going to get the real thing. The box and bottle are the same as in the stores but what ever was put in the bottle is not Cool Water.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne. I wear it to work and the ladies love it. I recommend wearing this good product.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED ON TIME EVERYTHING OK</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY PREFERED PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;AND THE PRICE IS GOOD TOO.&lt;br /&gt;I HOPE YOU HAVE  SOME SPECIAL SALES OFFER OF THIS COOL WATER, SOON.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried that this would be some watered down knock off but it appears to be the real deal.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Was the real deal and for a great price.</li>
            <li> Good smell my husband likes this perfume.</li>
            <li> Any fool can tell its a fake. Cool water has a reputation of lasting long this doesn&#x27;t live up to that and amazon should be refunding everyone who has purchased this crap. Got a small bottle in a gift set and did a comparison and wow big difference from this big bottle of junk.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product because the scent is pleasant, not overwhelming, and my lady does not catch the scent when I am parking the car to come in.</li>
            <li> the product was exactly as i expected. Plus it arrived on time. I have absolutely no complaints and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this one smells. I am experimenting with finding myself within a certain cologne and although I&#x27;m not sure if this is THE ONE, it does smell better than another cologne I bought as well as this one which is actually the Armani Code cologne. What&#x27;s even better is this bottle is a big bottle where the Armani bottle is a forth of the size at virtually the same price. The last thing to mention is you can actually smell this one after you&#x27;ve applied it, so it&#x27;s decently strong, but not too overpowering unless you spray too much of it on yourself, of course. I would certainly recommend! Cheers!</li>
            <li> Cool perfume. My brother likes it very much. I got this as a gift for him.</li>
            <li> The price is absolute amazing. I plan on buying plenty more!!</li>
            <li> Fresh scent with hints of fruity citrus&lt;br /&gt;everybody loves this scent on me and this is a classic favorite&lt;br /&gt;excellent price too for this size</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance. Suitable for daily use and worthy for the price paid. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and received frequent compliments regarding it&#x27;s scent. This time I paid lot less for it compared to what I use to pay in the department stores,</li>
            <li> This was everything I was looking for. I got it in time and I will be sure to buy again</li>
            <li> This has been my personal favorite since 1997.  I love it.  I always get favorable comments when I wear it which is most the time.  It has the greatest scent of any men&#x27;s cologne I have ever tried and I have tried quite a few.  Guys if you want to smell great try Cool Water.</li>
            <li> This product is very wonderful and lasts long for a long period of time. Also, I want to indicate that this astounding product is great for everyone and is very useful for me. Therefore, this is an astounding product.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the department stores but cheaper.</li>
            <li> Todos j&amp;aacute; devem conhecer o perfume da Davidoff.  No tamanho 200 ml vale muito &amp;agrave; pena. Recomendo muito a compra.</li>
            <li> Smells good! The ladies love it!</li>
            <li> Why spend $100 for 200 mL of a good cologne while you can buy Cool Water&lt;br /&gt;for half that amount. I put some at 5:30 am and at 9:00 pm my wife still&lt;br /&gt;feels the great odor of this outstanding cologne. It is not strong, yet you&lt;br /&gt;will enjoy the difussing vapors with a great smile for many hours.</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED WITH PRICE AND QUALITY.IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY AND HAS ZERO FINGRPRINTS ID EST HANDLING MARKS ETC. ETC.THE REAL DEAL,THANX!!!</li>
            <li> The box was not shrink-wrapped and the liquid seemed very diluted.  You could barely smell the original scent.  This is nothing like the version you would get over the counter from a department store.  I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> no matter what cologne you choose or anyone chooses you can never go wrong with cool water which is always one of my old time favorite.</li>
            <li> Cologne was fine,but bottle was broken.  Still usable.</li>
            <li> This is a good clean scent.  My husband has been wearing it forever and gets lots of compliments, not too strong.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My husband love it, it id very fresh and a good price for the size if the bottle, again love it</li>
            <li> Fast and just as expected</li>

            <li> Great price for the large bottle. Thanks,</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> first seen and I was unsure about buying, finally gave in an ordered, I was skeptical at first but smells exactly like dept store cool water.I would recommend and purchase again.Received item promptly, cant beat amazons price anywhere!</li>
            <li> Has a Great smell. Always get compliments when I wear this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best price per /oz you can find anywhere.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift. Good price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband and he loved it. The smell is so fresh and cool not too strong or&lt;br /&gt;over- powering. Strongly recommend and the size of the bottle is huge so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This scent is just about the best any man can wear! I can&#x27;t help myself when my man uses it, I just keep hugging him closer and closer to smell it. Just yummy!</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne</li>
            <li> would recommend it to every one</li>
            <li> Timely delivery and  the price was great. Re ordered the scent because I was running out. Ill order again after I finish this bottle</li>
            <li> Perfect scent, especially for warm temperatures! Very cool feel and surprinsingly lasting smell. Worth a try unlike its value! Works for me.</li>
            <li> Yes I was completely  satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> This cologne has very little scent and does not last. The bottle was opened when I received it.</li>
            <li> I have used Cool Water For Men for over a decade and regularly receive compliments on it. However, with this particular bottle the scent is so weak after a few minutes, that you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing it. It is either counterfeit or a defective batch of product.</li>
            <li> My husband smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  I have purchased several other items over the last six years, mostly cologns for my wife.  I cannot get close to their prices anywhere else and they deliver on time.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!! Wonderful packing protection!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Its cool, I mostly like it because it brings me back to the days of snoop dong with his baby powder and cool water cologne.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Cool fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells like coolwater.  But, the smell is gone by the end of lunch.  So, it only seems to last about 3-4 hours after two sprays on the chest and wrists.  Not sure if that is normal, or what.</li>
            <li> I love cool water and my wife loves it too, I am happy with this product i use it everyday now</li>
            <li> Lite scented, I have been using this for years. The women love it.</li>
            <li> Got it fast and was just as posted/Great</li>
            <li> Great purchase well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This Has Always Been One Of My Favorite Sents Peoples!:):):)☺😊😆</li>
            <li> The box arrived with no outside damage but the bottle of Cool Water had a large horizontal crack (about 5 inches) across the top, right above the name and it follows the curve of the bottle towards the back and starts heading downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...it is now seeping more and there is a crack following the seam at the top edge of the bottle. I am hoping it stops leaking/seeping through the crack when the cologne level goes below the lowest part of the crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[IMG][...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE******&lt;br /&gt;Chatted with Amazon agent online (Noel) and within minutes Noel resolved the issue without any hassle at all. I seriously wish all Customer Service departments were like this.</li>
