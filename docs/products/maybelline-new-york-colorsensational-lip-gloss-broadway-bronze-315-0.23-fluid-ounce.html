            <li>I love the color and the texture.</li>

            <li>Put this on top of your main color and your lips will just pop with a statement....</li>
            <li>I am African American, and about Michelle Obama&#x27;s complexion, and it&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I think is a great natural color especially for women with brown skin.  </li>
            <li>Glaze up your smile.  </li>
            <li>(smile)</li>
            <li>, i have already purchased many colors, in fact since the probe, i have a time only using this brand of lipstick.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was expecting</li>

            <li>I will update more about consistency and wear later.</li>
            <li>Love this colour but like all lip gloss it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long.</li>

            <li>This is going to be my new every day lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit more red than I had expected, rather than the brown/pink/golden that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Goes with everything and still looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I like the consistency of this so far.</li>
            <li>But, the red is not necessarily bad--and it does a golden tint to it.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, especially since I really don&#x27;t like actual lipstick!</li>
            <li>It gives me this nice natural pink color which is difficult to find for darker skin.</li>

            <li> nice shade feels great on lips</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is fantastic! The color is vibrant but not too much and it keeps the lips moist. I like it a lot, especially since I really don&#x27;t like actual lipstick! This product is worth the price and definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Love this colour but like all lip gloss it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it got orange color</li>
            <li> This lip gloss I think is a great natural color especially for women with brown skin.  It gives me this nice natural pink color which is difficult to find for darker skin. It has no odor or taste and also its not sticky.</li>
            <li> It is not as dark as I wanted but i have gotten many comments on it.  It does help extend the life of my fav lipstick which I am able to get any more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!!! The color is beautiful and matched my skin tone really well! Easily applicable, it&#x27;s a great buy!!!! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Are very soft and give a very nice color on the lips and i love the price, i have already purchased many colors, in fact since the probe, i have a time only using this brand of lipstick.Godd price.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because the product came to me a day before it was supposed to which made me really happy. It looked how it does in the image. The color is definitely great. So I absolutely love it and will buy from Discount World.</li>
            <li> It was good for the price. I am used to using Buxom from Sephora but couldn&#x27;t pass up the price on this lip gloss.  I love the color, hence the 4 star but you have to reapply quite often.</li>
            <li> My girl says it works great she loves the colcr</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing lip gloss and a beautiful color. Feels great on lips.</li>
            <li> recomendado 100% original y el color es fascinante me encanta dura mucho tiempo en los labios y no tienes que hacer tantos retoques</li>
            <li> Like this product...the shade was perfect coloring  for my skin type. There was just enough gloss for a perfect lip cover.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this lip gloss, but it is more brown/orange than pictured.  It&#x27;s always tough to tell with a computer screen what the shade will actually be.</li>
            <li> I just love Maybelline color texture everything was perfect when I received this product it was still in its perfect condition new and this is what I give five star good job .</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and as described</li>
            <li> Color of the lip gloss is so pretty!!! It goes well with my complexion! I love it! I recommend it for all types!</li>
            <li> Great color, great price, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my lips. Oh, and it smells lovely. This is totally a good buy!</li>
            <li> very nice and on time</li>
            <li> This lipgloss isn&#x27;t what I had hoped. It isn&#x27;t the color it looks to be, and it only stays on for a about half an hour..if that. I do not recommend this gloss.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the texture. It has a nice shimmer to it but not to much. The smell is also nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and she really loved it, so yes i am happy with with the overall experience.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. The company is also great and they shipped the product before the expected time. I will recommend this for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Color is true, but doesn&#x27;t last long (granted, most lip glosses are that way). The texture is a bit tacky. Non-offensive scent.</li>
            <li> I found this shade that I loved, then of course, when I go to repurchase at the drugstore, it is discontinued.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was SO glad to have found that Amazon still has it, so I bought 2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awkward color on me and very sticky feeling, feel like I wasted money on this. :P Was not impressed at all. I will stick to store bought lipstick from now on.</li>
            <li> This was part of a gift basket that I put together.  It is a gorgeous fall color and great for lips of all ages.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for lipstick at all. I love lipgloss especially brown/neutral shades. I think this color works well for women of color.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister, it&#x27;s a good product and it is a bronze, not too sticky! Pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> Glaze up your smile.  Put this on top of your main color and your lips will just pop with a statement....dare to come close and kiss me with passionate hunger and wish I were yours.  Well that&#x27;s what I think my lips looked like (smile)</li>
            <li> This is going to be my new every day lip gloss.  I love everything about it - it goes on so smoothly, the bronz color is great, and it&#x27;s very inexpensive.  I am African American, and about Michelle Obama&#x27;s complexion, and it&#x27;s perfect for me.  I also think it will go with a lot of different ethnicities/complexions.</li>
            <li> good, excellent, I like</li>
            <li> Finally found a great lippy and it gets discontinued.  Always happens to me.  This is the best most versatile color.  Goes with everything and still looks natural.  At least I found a stash on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this so far. It just arrived today. I will update more about consistency and wear later. I wanted to post about the color. It is a bit more red than I had expected, rather than the brown/pink/golden that I was looking for. But, the red is not necessarily bad--and it does a golden tint to it.</li>
