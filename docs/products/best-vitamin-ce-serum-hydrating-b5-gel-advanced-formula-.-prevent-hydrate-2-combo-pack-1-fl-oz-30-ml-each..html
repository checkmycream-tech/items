            <li>It goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel great.    </li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Hydrating B5 Gel is also an excellent follow-on treatment as it contains hylauronic acid and really hydrates the skin.    </li>
            <li>I have been amazed and pleased with thequality and delighted to save the money.</li>
            <li>Once I paid it with Neutragena&#x27;s Hydr-boost I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Highly effective products.</li>
            <li>The product is formulated with a perfect pH and is high quality.</li>
            <li>The serum is very easy to apply.    </li>
            <li>I am thrilled and love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;And once I got the products and really liked them, I wanted to know more about each one.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, tried something different, my face feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you my skin feels very smooth and silky....</li>
            <li>I will be using these products for many years to come.</li>
            <li>have used this before- love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>I love these product.</li>
            <li>I love what it has done for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I need more time to see the difference or result.</li>
            <li>I love the results and don&#x27;t be fooled by the price THEY WORK.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found Cosmetic Solutions.</li>
            <li>I had used 2 Combo and 3 more of Hydrating B5 Gel.  </li>
            <li>I already used the C+E serum for more than a week now</li>
            <li>The combo packs they offer are fantastic!</li>
            <li>This product is now a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>Both my products arrived safely and were packed correctly.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have finally found a company that I can trust!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 1/3 of the way thru the bottle and my good skin has gone to GREAT skin.</li>
            <li>I found the products and love them.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels and how my makeup goes on after using C+E and the hydragel.</li>
            <li>You see results almost immediately -which doesn&#x27;t happen with most creams.</li>
            <li>I love using this in the summer, but the smell is a bit off-putting...fyi.</li>
            <li>c+e serum is a Lot more runny than skinceuticals</li>
            <li>Like the title, I just want to say I love these products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 and get many comments on my &#x27;lovely&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Because the price was so good this was the first time I have purchased the Hydrating B5 Gel, also.   </li>
            <li>I am not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>The serums absorb very quickly and are Non-greasy at all...</li>
            <li>And they are so easy to travel</li>
            <li>Having the combination of C, E, as well as Ferulic is a must for me as these work in synergy with each other to provide excellent protection against free radical damage, aging, etc.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and even toned.  </li>
            <li>These product kept my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and hydrated with no irritation problems.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>They sent me two bottles for free and claimed that they should stay as gel, not turning into waterlike.  </li>
            <li>I use this product on top of my C serum, and it leaves my face feeling so moisturized,  fresh feeling and looking.</li>
            <li>Its the antioxidants in the solution to fight free radical damage control.</li>
            <li>I will say that SOMETHING is making my skin look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I honestly was tired of trying product after product to find the one that worked best for me.    </li>
            <li>They worked perfectly for my skin and are obviously gentle enough to work with any skin type.</li>
            <li>You will notice a difference right away, I love how my skin feels when it is on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with most of these other brands.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just good to have some real life previews and feedback before buying a higher end cosmetic or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well worth it!</li>
            <li>They have now since changed that to a 50% restock fee and will not honor the original statement they had on their website when I placed the order.  </li>
            <li>People even comment on how fresh my face looks!</li>
            <li>They are customer friendly and a generous company.</li>
            <li>More cost effective than obagi and feels the same on my face.</li>
            <li>They always respond to my emails and questions with a friendly and quick response.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth and wrinkle free.  Fades brown spots and with consistent use they almost disappear.</li>
            <li>However, I have been using Cosmetic Skin Solutions&#x27; formula (C E serum and B5 Gel) for over 6 months and the results have been amazing so far.</li>
            <li>So far loving these two products</li>
            <li>They promised a 100% satisfaction or a full refund.</li>
            <li>The company shipped it perfectly (very well packed, which is a must for a potent vitamin C product)</li>
            <li>love these products and really like the company.</li>
            <li>Again, companies formulate their products differently and thus you need a product that is stable and a company that is trustworthy - one that will mail you product formulated with a good pH level as well as a company that will mail you fresh product that hasn&#x27;t oxidized.</li>
            <li>I use them together each morning and would highly recommend them for adding a healthy glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>The concentration of vitamin C is the right percentage and is still gentle on the skin (appropriate for any skin type).</li>
            <li>I am disappointed because I hoped to have the successful results that so many others experienced.</li>
            <li>and I dont mind spending the money as long as its a good product.</li>
            <li>I use less make up now because my skin looks so great.  </li>
            <li>the bottle I received in the mail was fresh and had no odor or coloring.</li>
            <li>First of all this brand, Cosmetic Solutions, is the EXACT same thing as the more expensive(much more expensive)one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t or rarely need a moisturizer</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell of the vitamin c.</li>
            <li>And my skin absorbed it immediately......</li>
            <li>and Hydragel was the right thing.</li>
            <li>I use the serum right after cleansing my face but before putting on a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have yellow-brown skin tone, and am particularly concerned with preventing more wrinkles and age spots.)  </li>
            <li>And for me, this is pretty much the first time I am taking care of it in the right way with the right skin</li>
            <li>I had my doubts at first since I had been using comparable products that cost a ton more, but I am definitely converted (and my pocketbook is much happier!).  </li>
            <li>There are other products out there which are MUCH better for boosting moisture in your skin!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have reviewed a product on-line.</li>
            <li>if I had the same results I would be much more upset.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have purchased thru this company.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely repurchase it again.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the Vitamin C+E Ferulic Serum has l-ascorbic acid - thisis the only form of vitamin C I will buy now!    </li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement after the first weekIt&#x27;s smoother with fewer wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>skin care products, and I enjoy shopping at their site directly as well.</li>
            <li>And you&#x27;ll save so much money!</li>
            <li>I feel like I am really taking care of my skin the right way.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue buying this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants a more radiant and even-toned complexion.</li>
            <li>I find them to be just as good as the more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li>the fact that the YouTube lady I watch recommended these, that pretty much sealed it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love snow, but winter time is always dry air.</li>
            <li>This product is a good one to try if your one of those that&#x27;s skin is hard to please...</li>
            <li>highly recommended !</li>
            <li>About effectiveness I cannot say much as rusults are not visible yet (or already)).</li>
            <li>First the price was amazing, the shipping was unbelievable fast.   </li>
            <li>I also really like the Hydrating B5 gel.  </li>
            <li>The gel become watery very soon.</li>
            <li>Please spend the money to buy the real stuff or DIY.</li>
            <li>These two serums work very well together.  </li>
            <li>So I went straight to the Cosmetic Skin Solutions website and read up on each product so I could see how to use it and</li>
            <li>but I think there using to much...</li>
            <li>It will build up if you use to much ...</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really appreciate the difference.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Absorb fast.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s done anything or not.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>I saw a local Dermatologist was having a special on these products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When applied, my skin actually looks better and, over the weeks, my skin actually has improved.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I even tried these products was because a gal that does videos on YouTube highly recommended using C+E with ferulic for optimal skincare.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this product for a few days and seriously my skin looks awesome already.</li>
            <li>Cosmetic Skin Solutions sent me a fresh supply of the Vitamin C serum; this is essential as l-ascorbic acid can oxidize, etc.</li>
            <li>I get more hydration from usng a few drops of hyaluronic acid with my regualar moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Im not seeing a difference nor is the &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; a serum.. its very liquid-y and runs down my face quickly.</li>
            <li>The fine lines are less noticeable and the skin appear smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li>However, these products changed my outlook completely!    </li>
            <li>I love the B5 gel so much, I apply one drop before my make up everyday and it makes my make up last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I especially like the combination together since I live in a fairly dry area and the moisturizing gel makes my face feel pleasantly hydrated without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have the normal skin of a 29 year old, blemishes from time to time &amp; im aging slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>Great products with affordable price compare to expensive brand but the same quality.</li>
            <li>Vitamin c serum clear..</li>
            <li>Cosmetic Skin Solutions sell this at a fraction of the price of SkinCeuticals and as far as I can tell, there is no difference in the quality/effectiveness of the product.    </li>
            <li>I thought I would save money and try this to see if it really was the same or another inferior immitation.</li>
            <li>They made my skin soft and moist even in the  winter time in PA this year.</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old</li>
            <li>but after I used about 5 times, it turned into complete waterlike, ALL FOUR BOTTLES of B5 Hydrating Gel.  </li>
            <li>The 4th bottle that I just opened was just complete water.  </li>
            <li>I really want my momey back.  </li>
            <li>but with the one drop of B5 gel before make up, the drugstore foundation last whole day on my face too.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any reviews that indicate this as a side effect though, so perhaps I am just sensitive to the product.</li>
            <li>You can either use the B5 gel as a moisturizer or like me, I use an Olay sensitive skin product.</li>
            <li>I used to use high end foundation to make it last the longer</li>
            <li>I watch her videos regularly because she also reviews the high end beauty products</li>
            <li>I am finally at the point where once again I can walk out of the house with little to no make up and feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>i use the clarisonic daily and with this new stuff I feel like i hit the jackpot.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, especially with the Hydrating gel, and both products sink into the skin immediately, leaving my skin feeling healthy and moisturized, with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>from some further reading on the internet, I found out that these really are the must have products for proper skin care, especially for those who are wanting anti aging</li>
            <li>My skin looks much younger and hydrated (I am 30 years old, male).</li>
            <li>I would rate it higher if I could get a smaller bottle for less money because I don&#x27;t finish the bottle before it has degraded.  </li>
            <li>Love this CE Ferulic (far less expensive than another well-known brand) and a real improvement in the texture and tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use a few drops of the C+E Ferulic first, then follow with the B5 Gel.</li>
            <li>so place the drops slowly  on your face and rub in quickly ....</li>
            <li>My C+E Ferulic sample from the spa gave off a \\&quot;hot dog\\&quot; smell and was slightly brown - probably due to old age -</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Hydrating B5 Gel is also an excellent follow-on treatment as it contains hylauronic acid and really hydrates the skin.    </li>
            <li> I have been amazed and pleased with thequality and delighted to save the money.</li>
            <li> Once I paid it with Neutragena&#x27;s Hydr-boost I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Highly effective products.</li>
            <li> The product is formulated with a perfect pH and is high quality.</li>
            <li> The serum is very easy to apply.    </li>
            <li> I am thrilled and love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;And once I got the products and really liked them, I wanted to know more about each one.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, tried something different, my face feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you my skin feels very smooth and silky....</li>
            <li> I will be using these products for many years to come.</li>
            <li> have used this before- love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I love these product.</li>
            <li> I love what it has done for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I need more time to see the difference or result.</li>
            <li> I love the results and don&#x27;t be fooled by the price THEY WORK.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found Cosmetic Solutions.</li>
            <li> I had used 2 Combo and 3 more of Hydrating B5 Gel.  </li>
            <li> I already used the C+E serum for more than a week now</li>
            <li> The combo packs they offer are fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product is now a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Both my products arrived safely and were packed correctly.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to have finally found a company that I can trust!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 1/3 of the way thru the bottle and my good skin has gone to GREAT skin.</li>
            <li> I found the products and love them.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels and how my makeup goes on after using C+E and the hydragel.</li>
            <li> You see results almost immediately -which doesn&#x27;t happen with most creams.</li>
            <li> I love using this in the summer, but the smell is a bit off-putting...fyi.</li>
            <li> c+e serum is a Lot more runny than skinceuticals</li>
            <li> Like the title, I just want to say I love these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 and get many comments on my &#x27;lovely&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Because the price was so good this was the first time I have purchased the Hydrating B5 Gel, also.   </li>
            <li> I am not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> The serums absorb very quickly and are Non-greasy at all...</li>
            <li> And they are so easy to travel</li>
            <li> Having the combination of C, E, as well as Ferulic is a must for me as these work in synergy with each other to provide excellent protection against free radical damage, aging, etc.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and even toned.  </li>
            <li> These product kept my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and hydrated with no irritation problems.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> They sent me two bottles for free and claimed that they should stay as gel, not turning into waterlike.  </li>
            <li> I use this product on top of my C serum, and it leaves my face feeling so moisturized,  fresh feeling and looking.</li>
            <li> Its the antioxidants in the solution to fight free radical damage control.</li>
            <li> I will say that SOMETHING is making my skin look fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I honestly was tired of trying product after product to find the one that worked best for me.    </li>
            <li> They worked perfectly for my skin and are obviously gentle enough to work with any skin type.</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference right away, I love how my skin feels when it is on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with most of these other brands.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just good to have some real life previews and feedback before buying a higher end cosmetic or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well worth it!</li>
            <li> They have now since changed that to a 50% restock fee and will not honor the original statement they had on their website when I placed the order.  </li>
            <li> People even comment on how fresh my face looks!</li>
            <li> They are customer friendly and a generous company.</li>
            <li> More cost effective than obagi and feels the same on my face.</li>
            <li> They always respond to my emails and questions with a friendly and quick response.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and wrinkle free.  Fades brown spots and with consistent use they almost disappear.</li>
            <li> However, I have been using Cosmetic Skin Solutions&#x27; formula (C E serum and B5 Gel) for over 6 months and the results have been amazing so far.</li>
            <li> So far loving these two products</li>
            <li> They promised a 100% satisfaction or a full refund.</li>
            <li> The company shipped it perfectly (very well packed, which is a must for a potent vitamin C product)</li>
            <li> love these products and really like the company.</li>
            <li> Again, companies formulate their products differently and thus you need a product that is stable and a company that is trustworthy - one that will mail you product formulated with a good pH level as well as a company that will mail you fresh product that hasn&#x27;t oxidized.</li>
            <li> I use them together each morning and would highly recommend them for adding a healthy glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> The concentration of vitamin C is the right percentage and is still gentle on the skin (appropriate for any skin type).</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I hoped to have the successful results that so many others experienced.</li>
            <li> and I dont mind spending the money as long as its a good product.</li>
            <li> I use less make up now because my skin looks so great.  </li>
            <li> the bottle I received in the mail was fresh and had no odor or coloring.</li>
            <li> First of all this brand, Cosmetic Solutions, is the EXACT same thing as the more expensive(much more expensive)one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t or rarely need a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell of the vitamin c.</li>
            <li> And my skin absorbed it immediately......</li>
            <li> and Hydragel was the right thing.</li>
            <li> I use the serum right after cleansing my face but before putting on a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have yellow-brown skin tone, and am particularly concerned with preventing more wrinkles and age spots.)  </li>
            <li> And for me, this is pretty much the first time I am taking care of it in the right way with the right skin</li>
            <li> I had my doubts at first since I had been using comparable products that cost a ton more, but I am definitely converted (and my pocketbook is much happier!).  </li>
            <li> There are other products out there which are MUCH better for boosting moisture in your skin!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have reviewed a product on-line.</li>
            <li> if I had the same results I would be much more upset.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have purchased thru this company.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely repurchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the Vitamin C+E Ferulic Serum has l-ascorbic acid - thisis the only form of vitamin C I will buy now!    </li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement after the first weekIt&#x27;s smoother with fewer wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> skin care products, and I enjoy shopping at their site directly as well.</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;ll save so much money!</li>
            <li> I feel like I am really taking care of my skin the right way.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue buying this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants a more radiant and even-toned complexion.</li>
            <li> I find them to be just as good as the more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li> the fact that the YouTube lady I watch recommended these, that pretty much sealed it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love snow, but winter time is always dry air.</li>
            <li> This product is a good one to try if your one of those that&#x27;s skin is hard to please...</li>
            <li> highly recommended !</li>
            <li> About effectiveness I cannot say much as rusults are not visible yet (or already)).</li>
            <li> First the price was amazing, the shipping was unbelievable fast.   </li>
            <li> I also really like the Hydrating B5 gel.  </li>
            <li> The gel become watery very soon.</li>
            <li> Please spend the money to buy the real stuff or DIY.</li>
            <li> These two serums work very well together.  </li>
            <li> So I went straight to the Cosmetic Skin Solutions website and read up on each product so I could see how to use it and</li>
            <li> but I think there using to much...</li>
            <li> It will build up if you use to much ...</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really appreciate the difference.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Absorb fast.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s done anything or not.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a local Dermatologist was having a special on these products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When applied, my skin actually looks better and, over the weeks, my skin actually has improved.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I even tried these products was because a gal that does videos on YouTube highly recommended using C+E with ferulic for optimal skincare.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a few days and seriously my skin looks awesome already.</li>
            <li> Cosmetic Skin Solutions sent me a fresh supply of the Vitamin C serum; this is essential as l-ascorbic acid can oxidize, etc.</li>
            <li> I get more hydration from usng a few drops of hyaluronic acid with my regualar moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Im not seeing a difference nor is the &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; a serum.. its very liquid-y and runs down my face quickly.</li>
            <li> The fine lines are less noticeable and the skin appear smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> However, these products changed my outlook completely!    </li>
            <li> I love the B5 gel so much, I apply one drop before my make up everyday and it makes my make up last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I especially like the combination together since I live in a fairly dry area and the moisturizing gel makes my face feel pleasantly hydrated without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have the normal skin of a 29 year old, blemishes from time to time &amp; im aging slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> Great products with affordable price compare to expensive brand but the same quality.</li>
            <li> Vitamin c serum clear..</li>
            <li> Cosmetic Skin Solutions sell this at a fraction of the price of SkinCeuticals and as far as I can tell, there is no difference in the quality/effectiveness of the product.    </li>
            <li> I thought I would save money and try this to see if it really was the same or another inferior immitation.</li>
            <li> They made my skin soft and moist even in the  winter time in PA this year.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old</li>
            <li> but after I used about 5 times, it turned into complete waterlike, ALL FOUR BOTTLES of B5 Hydrating Gel.  </li>
            <li> The 4th bottle that I just opened was just complete water.  </li>
            <li> I really want my momey back.  </li>
            <li> but with the one drop of B5 gel before make up, the drugstore foundation last whole day on my face too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any reviews that indicate this as a side effect though, so perhaps I am just sensitive to the product.</li>
            <li> You can either use the B5 gel as a moisturizer or like me, I use an Olay sensitive skin product.</li>
            <li> I used to use high end foundation to make it last the longer</li>
            <li> I watch her videos regularly because she also reviews the high end beauty products</li>
            <li> I am finally at the point where once again I can walk out of the house with little to no make up and feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> i use the clarisonic daily and with this new stuff I feel like i hit the jackpot.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, especially with the Hydrating gel, and both products sink into the skin immediately, leaving my skin feeling healthy and moisturized, with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> from some further reading on the internet, I found out that these really are the must have products for proper skin care, especially for those who are wanting anti aging</li>
            <li> My skin looks much younger and hydrated (I am 30 years old, male).</li>
            <li> I would rate it higher if I could get a smaller bottle for less money because I don&#x27;t finish the bottle before it has degraded.  </li>
            <li> Love this CE Ferulic (far less expensive than another well-known brand) and a real improvement in the texture and tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops of the C+E Ferulic first, then follow with the B5 Gel.</li>
            <li> so place the drops slowly  on your face and rub in quickly ....</li>
            <li> My C+E Ferulic sample from the spa gave off a \\&quot;hot dog\\&quot; smell and was slightly brown - probably due to old age -</li>
            <li> I stored the CE Ferulic in the refrigerator and it remained clear, so there wasn&#x27;t an issue with it spoiling as some other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I also like buying directly from the companies because they sometimes have samples and promos as well that aren&#x27;t always offered at other sites.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if not stored in the right conditions and it&#x27;s obvious to me that this company takes their products and manufacturing standards seriously.</li>
            <li> Once degraded (it shows a dark yellow color instead of clear)</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t find a combo pack that includes the serums you would like, all you have to do is ask to switch out one product for another; as long as it&#x27;s the same value as what you are trading out for.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled but skeptical when I found this line, but it appears to be the same product for about half the price!  </li>
            <li> have recently bought the little sample box from Cosmetic Skin Solutions directly.</li>
            <li> In other words, it has maintained my skin just the way the more expensive brand had been doing.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this product because I was scared it was a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> Iv looked around for a long time I&#x27;m 50 and at my age things change...</li>
            <li> I have also noticed not only an overall improvement in the appearance of my skin complexion, but a slight reduction in the wrinkles around eyes and cheek area&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My test was to see if using these serums would make my skin worse (since I had been using a much more expensive and highly recommended comparable product) and there has been no change.  </li>
            <li> Beware of similar products made by other manufacturers that don&#x27;t consider the pH; these can irritate and/or dry out the skin.    </li>
            <li> I had really dry, flaky skin and bought it to try to fix that</li>
            <li> and i have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I started using the ce ferulic &amp; b-5 combo two weeks ago and with each day, my skin feels and looks dehydrated and dry.</li>
            <li> Usually I buy the more expensive Vitamin C, but this seems for work just as well.  </li>
            <li> It has taken a few months for this stuff to work, because I only use it in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> I am over 40 and have absolutely no wrinkles on my face.  </li>
            <li> Please be careful what to buy.  </li>
            <li> I used both products until bottles were empty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days</li>
            <li> This arrived at the expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a fan.</li>
            <li> I agree with one reviewer who said, \\&quot; a little goes a long way.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> While the dry, tight skin subsided, I never felt or saw any improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> But after four bottles of water, not gels, I feel cheated and most of all, disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have tried products from other manufacturers that did not deliver.</li>
            <li> My overly active oil producing glands still produce oil, just not at the rate they used to.  </li>
            <li> Little goes a long ways Iv read that people are having some trouble..</li>
            <li> I would suggest that if a product come&#x27;s in a dark bottle, keep it refrigerated to extend the freshness.  </li>
            <li> I have a few of they&#x27;re Items, Iv commented on them on my other reviews,..</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend these products to anyone who is serious about holding back the years and/or looking to improve existing skin damage and ageing.</li>
            <li> I still have the forehead lines, but they are not as pronounced as they previously were.</li>
            <li> The Combo pack is half the price of its competitors and works just as well.  </li>
            <li> The price on those branded products is outrageous and was thrilled to find this comparable product for so much less.</li>
            <li> Though it burned like hell... and dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brand.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with C + E Ferulic.  </li>
            <li> I have never used the similar Skinceuticals products so I am unable to compare both.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s with combination skin that tends to look dull and blotchy.</li>
            <li> They are much less expensive than skinceuticals brand for much less money!</li>
            <li> I e-mailed Cosmetic Skin Solutions to inquire if the dryness was a common side effect</li>
            <li> As a previous skinceuticals user I was skeptical about these products.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it was since it is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> In fact, after washing and drying my face, the skin is extremely tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that the price is so low.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not as good as Skinceuticals.  </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed with Cosmetic Skin Solutions and would recommend them for their quality and low prices.</li>
            <li> They were too drying or too irritating, etc.    </li>
            <li> They made up lies and sent false documentation to my credit card company to get their way.  </li>
            <li> SC was just too expensive.  </li>
            <li> But unfortunately, all 4 bottles of gel wasn&#x27;t gel at all.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with these products.  </li>
            <li> This company,Cosmetic Skin Solutions, has horrible, unethical customer service.  </li>
            <li> Its a horrible product.</li>
            <li> its not that bad..!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and wrinkle free.  Fades brown spots and with consistent use they almost disappear.</li>
            <li> Great products with affordable price compare to expensive brand but the same quality. highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s with combination skin that tends to look dull and blotchy. I have been using the C+E Ferulic and B5 Gel for several weeks now. I use a few drops of the C+E Ferulic first, then follow with the B5 Gel. I am very impressed - I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive Skinceutical line and can see no difference between the two except in price. A little bit goes a long way, especially with the Hydrating gel, and both products sink into the skin immediately, leaving my skin feeling healthy and moisturized, with no greasy residue. I will definitely continue buying this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants a more radiant and even-toned complexion.</li>
            <li> I too have been using SkinCeuticals for years and when I run out I notice the difference in my skin.  SC was just too expensive.  I was thrilled but skeptical when I found this line, but it appears to be the same product for about half the price!  I am thrilled and love it - hoping I can continue using and they won&#x27;t raise their prices</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend these products to anyone who is serious about holding back the years and/or looking to improve existing skin damage and ageing. C+E Ferulic is one of the best skin products on the cosmoceutical market - your skin will thank you for it - if you use nothing else, then use C&amp;E Ferulic.  Cosmetic Skin Solutions sell this at a fraction of the price of SkinCeuticals and as far as I can tell, there is no difference in the quality/effectiveness of the product.    Hydrating B5 Gel is also an excellent follow-on treatment as it contains hylauronic acid and really hydrates the skin.    A must have in your anti-ageing arsenal!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased I gave these products a try! I had my doubts at first since I had been using comparable products that cost a ton more, but I am definitely converted (and my pocketbook is much happier!).  My test was to see if using these serums would make my skin worse (since I had been using a much more expensive and highly recommended comparable product) and there has been no change.  In other words, it has maintained my skin just the way the more expensive brand had been doing.  (I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have yellow-brown skin tone, and am particularly concerned with preventing more wrinkles and age spots.)  I especially like the combination together since I live in a fairly dry area and the moisturizing gel makes my face feel pleasantly hydrated without feeling heavy.  I will be using these products for many years to come.</li>
            <li> have used this before- love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> After spending over $100.00 for this type skin anti-aging serum for over 15 years, I discovered the product on Amazon. I thought I would save money and try this to see if it really was the same or another inferior immitation. I have been amazed and pleased with thequality and delighted to save the money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this product because I was scared it was a cheap knock off. I use Skinceuticals and IS Clinical products and I dont mind spending the money as long as its a good product. Ive been using this product for a few days and seriously my skin looks awesome already. I have the normal skin of a 29 year old, blemishes from time to time &amp; im aging slowly but surely. i use the clarisonic daily and with this new stuff I feel like i hit the jackpot. well worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this CE Ferulic (far less expensive than another well-known brand) and a real improvement in the texture and tone of my skin.  LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> The spa where I recieved a facial recommended I use SkinCeuticals. I found this for a fraction of the price. I have used it for 2 weeks and have noticed a change in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I read about the competitor&#x27;s product in a magazine.  When I researched it on Amazon, I saw this in the similar products link.  I was persuaded by the reviews to give it a try.  I am not disappointed!  It has taken a few months for this stuff to work, because I only use it in the mornings.  But, it has made a drastic difference in the texture and tone of my face.  I am over 40 and have absolutely no wrinkles on my face.  My face is smooth and even toned.  I had pores you could see from 3 blocks away that have minimized.  I still have the forehead lines, but they are not as pronounced as they previously were. My overly active oil producing glands still produce oil, just not at the rate they used to.  (I won&#x27;t complain about that though).  I agree with one reviewer who said, \\&quot; a little goes a long way.\\&quot;  After applying the gels, I follow them up with moisturizer that has spf 15 sunscreen.  Then, I&#x27;m all set for the day.  Great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Usually I buy the more expensive Vitamin C, but this seems for work just as well.  I use it with the Hydrating B Gell and have even put it around my eyes with no adverse reaction.  Not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  Definetely plan on purchasing again</li>
            <li> I love these product. They made my skin soft and moist even in the  winter time in PA this year. I love snow, but winter time is always dry air. These product kept my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00196UB1M 2 Combo pack - C+E Ferulic and Hydrating B5 Gel - 1fl oz/30mL each - Antioxidant serum and moisturizing gel]]</li>
            <li> The Combo pack is half the price of its competitors and works just as well.  My skin is smooth and hydrated with no irritation problems.  Have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> C+E Ferulic is a great product and people who I&#x27;ve recommended it to all love it as well. However, I wouldn&#x27;t buy the Hydrating B5 Gel again. I had really dry, flaky skin and bought it to try to fix that but it didn&#x27;t do anything at all. There are other products out there which are MUCH better for boosting moisture in your skin!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have reviewed a product on-line. These products are amazing. Don&#x27;t let the cost fool you. These products deliver, and at a fraction of the cost of $kinceutical$.  I have seen an almost immediate improvement in the tone and texture of my skin. I would suggest that if a product come&#x27;s in a dark bottle, keep it refrigerated to extend the freshness.  If you use or have been considering the more expensive products, then you must give these products a try. Think of all the things you can do with the savings!!!</li>
            <li> So far loving these two products</li>
            <li> Product looks the sama as SkinCeuticals one but cheaper. I&#x27;m 27. About effectiveness I cannot say much as rusults are not visible yet (or already)). I&#x27;m happy that I didn&#x27;t buy SkinCeuticals: if I had the same results I would be much more upset.</li>
            <li> I dont think the Vitamin C serum is doing anything for my skin. Im not seeing a difference nor is the &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; a serum.. its very liquid-y and runs down my face quickly. I used to use skinsceuticals and saw immediate results. Was hoping this brand would as well. I use this product twice every day since Ive received it.</li>
            <li> I have been using C+E Ferulic that I purchased from my Dr for about a year now.  This is the first time that I have purchased thru this company.  First the price was amazing, the shipping was unbelievable fast.   Because the price was so good this was the first time I have purchased the Hydrating B5 Gel, also.   Now I understand why they sell these two together, they are amazing.  I love what it has done for my skin.  Any woman over 30 should use this product, my only reget is that I didn&#x27;t start it earlier!   You will notice a difference right away, I love how my skin feels when it is on.</li>
            <li> The C+E ferulic serum irritated my left eye.  It made the eye bag area twitched.  As soon as I washed it off, the twitching was gone.  I will try to use it on my neck only.    The hydrating B5 serum did not irritate my eyes. I need more time to see the difference or result.</li>
            <li> This company,Cosmetic Skin Solutions, has horrible, unethical customer service.  They promised a 100% satisfaction or a full refund. They have now since changed that to a 50% restock fee and will not honor the original statement they had on their website when I placed the order.  They made up lies and sent false documentation to my credit card company to get their way.  The sunscreeen they make is like trying to smear white mud on your skin. Its a horrible product.</li>
            <li> I find both these serums are brilliant, they are well-priced and pleasant to use. I use them together each morning and would highly recommend them for adding a healthy glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> I use skinceuticals products for several years. When I come across this brand in Amazon, I thought their products will not be the same, but I was totally wrong, I have been using them now for 8 months and my skin at 48 looks better than ever. I love the results and don&#x27;t be fooled by the price THEY WORK. Just keep using them.</li>
            <li> After worshiping the sun for years, I was told to start using the Skinceuticals C+E Ferulic and Hydrating B5 Gel.  The price on those branded products is outrageous and was thrilled to find this comparable product for so much less. After using the samples from my esthetician after a facial, I purchased these products in the hopes they would perform as well and I am happy to say that they do! My pores have minimized and my overall complexion is glowing.  I am finally at the point where once again I can walk out of the house with little to no make up and feel fabulous. I am 35 years old and I look and feel like I am in my 20&#x27;s again.     The product was shipped to me IMMEDIATELY and packaged well. My C+E Ferulic sample from the spa gave off a \\&quot;hot dog\\&quot; smell and was slightly brown - probably due to old age - the bottle I received in the mail was fresh and had no odor or coloring. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Some wonderful things to say about these products.  First of all this brand, Cosmetic Solutions, is the EXACT same thing as the more expensive(much more expensive)one.  Since I have been using this C+E Serum my skin looks FANTASTIC.  My complexion is bright, glowing and refreshed.  My friends have noticed.  I use less make up now because my skin looks so great.  I also really like the Hydrating B5 gel.  It feels great on.  You might not think you are getting any hydration because it does not feel like a cream but your skin will be well hydrated because it soaks in.  But it is not meant to replace moisturizer.  I am so glad I found Cosmetic Solutions.</li>
            <li> I had used 2 Combo and 3 more of Hydrating B5 Gel.  I was not satisfied with C + E Ferulic.  I wanted to let people know about B5 Gel though.  The bottle said \\&quot;Gel\\&quot; but after I used about 5 times, it turned into complete waterlike, ALL FOUR BOTTLES of B5 Hydrating Gel.  I did contacted the seller about this gel.  They sent me two bottles for free and claimed that they should stay as gel, not turning into waterlike.  But unfortunately, all 4 bottles of gel wasn&#x27;t gel at all.  The 4th bottle that I just opened was just complete water.  Before I opened it, I looked at the flow of the content, it didn&#x27;t look like gel at all.  So I did open just to see it.  It wasn&#x27;t gel but water.    So I contacted the seller the second time to see what they are going to do.  I haven&#x27;t heard anything yet. I really want my momey back.  I was really disappointed with these products.  They are not what they are as the seller/manufacturer claimed.  Please be careful what to buy.  Before I bought these products, I read the review and lots of them said \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot;.  So I decided to buy them.  But after four bottles of water, not gels, I feel cheated and most of all, disappointed.  I wanted them to be good as they claimed.</li>
            <li> I ordered these products with scepticism but am very pleased with them. I would order them again. They are much less expensive than skinceuticals brand for much less money! The ingredients are basically the same.</li>
            <li> I use this product on top of my C serum, and it leaves my face feeling so moisturized,  fresh feeling and looking. People even comment on how fresh my face looks!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. They are not the same as skinceuticals. The gel become watery very soon. Please spend the money to buy the real stuff or DIY.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in my wrinkles in a month! Though it burned like hell... and dried my skin out. Once I paid it with Neutragena&#x27;s Hydr-boost I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I have never used the similar Skinceuticals products so I am unable to compare both. However, I have been using Cosmetic Skin Solutions&#x27; formula (C E serum and B5 Gel) for over 6 months and the results have been amazing so far. My skin looks much younger and hydrated (I am 30 years old, male).</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments on my skin.  People think I&#x27;m 10 years younger and ive have been asked if I&#x27;ve had a face lift</li>
            <li> I love the B5 gel so much, I apply one drop before my make up everyday and it makes my make up last a lot longer. I used to use high end foundation to make it last the longer but with the one drop of B5 gel before make up, the drugstore foundation last whole day on my face too. I love it and will definitely repurchase it again. For the C+E serum, I don&#x27;t like to use it before make up because the formula is too oily. I already used the C+E serum for more than a week now, I apply it every morning and followed by sunscreen, but till now I still haven&#x27;t see any result yet, I will not buy the C+E serum again.</li>
            <li> CSS has done it again! I can not tell you how in love I am with their products! The combo packs they offer are fantastic! If you don&#x27;t find a combo pack that includes the serums you would like, all you have to do is ask to switch out one product for another; as long as it&#x27;s the same value as what you are trading out for. I am a CSS customer for life!</li>
            <li> I have been using the CE Serum and B5 gel for 7 years (since turning 50) My skin is in amazing shape, and I dont do without it. I don&#x27;t or rarely need a moisturizer and i have dry skin. Its the antioxidants in the solution to fight free radical damage control. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the combo pack for over two months and notice improvements on my skin. The fine lines are less noticeable and the skin appear smoother and healthier. I&#x27;m very pleased and will buy again.</li>
            <li> The products made by Cosmetic Skin Solutions are unmatched in terms of their quality and low price. I never thought I could get a vitamin C product, not to mention also hydrating vitamin B5 serum included at this low a price.    The Vitamin C+E Ferulic serum by Cosmetic Skin Solutions, is incredible as is their Hydrating B5 Gel!    The serum is very easy to apply.    This product is now a favorite of mine. It goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel great.    I am shocked that the price is so low. The product is formulated with a perfect pH and is high quality. The company shipped it perfectly (very well packed, which is a must for a potent vitamin C product) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.    I will definitely buy the C+E Ferulic Serum from Cosmetic Skin Solutions again! I also use their Hydrating B5 Gel which is also excellent. I encourage you to check it out as it is also an excellent addition to anyone&#x27;s skincare routine.    The concentration of vitamin C is the right percentage and is still gentle on the skin (appropriate for any skin type). Beware of similar products made by other manufacturers that don&#x27;t consider the pH; these can irritate and/or dry out the skin.    Having the combination of C, E, as well as Ferulic is a must for me as these work in synergy with each other to provide excellent protection against free radical damage, aging, etc. The vitamin C used is in my opinion the only form of vitamin C people should be looking at: l-ascorbic acid.    Thank you Cosmetic Skin Solutions for quality products at low prices!    I have tried products from other manufacturers that did not deliver. They were too drying or too irritating, etc.    I honestly was tired of trying product after product to find the one that worked best for me.    However, these products changed my outlook completely!    They worked perfectly for my skin and are obviously gentle enough to work with any skin type. I love the fact that the Vitamin C+E Ferulic Serum has l-ascorbic acid - thisis the only form of vitamin C I will buy now!    Cosmetic Skin Solutions sent me a fresh supply of the Vitamin C serum; this is essential as l-ascorbic acid can oxidize, etc. if not stored in the right conditions and it&#x27;s obvious to me that this company takes their products and manufacturing standards seriously. Both my products arrived safely and were packed correctly.    I left a review for the Hydrating Vitamin B5 Gel on another page (where it isn&#x27;t bundled with another product):    Hydrating B5 Gel page with my review: Hydrating B5 Gel by Cosmetic Skin Solutions    The Hydrating B5 Gel is wonderfully hydrating and is fabulous to use before moisturizer as it enhances the hydration. Because the product is a gel, it obviously is oil-free and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I would recommend the B5 Hydrating Gel as well as the C+E Ferulic Serum to everyone.    I will definitely purchase products in the future from Cosmetic Skin Solutions! I&#x27;m very happy to have finally found a company that I can trust!    Again, companies formulate their products differently and thus you need a product that is stable and a company that is trustworthy - one that will mail you product formulated with a good pH level as well as a company that will mail you fresh product that hasn&#x27;t oxidized. I have not been disappointed with Cosmetic Skin Solutions and would recommend them for their quality and low prices.</li>
            <li> I started using the ce ferulic &amp; b-5 combo two weeks ago and with each day, my skin feels and looks dehydrated and dry. I use as directed and apply moisturizer afterward, but it hasn&#x27;t helped. In fact, after washing and drying my face, the skin is extremely tight and uncomfortable. I haven&#x27;t seen any reviews that indicate this as a side effect though, so perhaps I am just sensitive to the product. I am disappointed because I hoped to have the successful results that so many others experienced. Will try to use for another 2 weeks if I can stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 4/27/12  I used both products until bottles were empty. I e-mailed Cosmetic Skin Solutions to inquire if the dryness was a common side effect and they responded promptly and advised me that it is not. While the dry, tight skin subsided, I never felt or saw any improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance. I stored the CE Ferulic in the refrigerator and it remained clear, so there wasn&#x27;t an issue with it spoiling as some other reviewers have mentioned. I will not be purchasing these products again. For the price, I didn&#x27;t observe any appreciable benefit. I get more hydration from usng a few drops of hyaluronic acid with my regualar moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This C E Ferulic Combination antioxidant serum and Hydrating B5 is the Best!  I have been using this 2 combo pack for over a month now.....  I use it daily in the morning followed with the Hydrating B5 serum....Wow!!! Let me tell you my skin feels very smooth and silky....The serums absorb very quickly and are Non-greasy at all...These two serums work very well together.  Also, the hyaluronic acid in the Hydrating B5 feels as if it is also tightening my skin after applying it.  I have also noticed not only an overall improvement in the appearance of my skin complexion, but a slight reduction in the wrinkles around eyes and cheek area&#x27;s.  I am a person in my mid 40&#x27;s....and bc this product is meeting my expectations, I&#x27;d have to give it 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> I bought the B5 based on customer reviews.  I&#x27;ve used Obagi, SkinCeuticals, Murad etc.  I&#x27;ve been happy with most of these other brands.  However, the results I&#x27;ve seen for the price of the B5 Gel is unmatched!  I&#x27;m only 1/3 of the way thru the bottle and my good skin has gone to GREAT skin. I noticed an improvement after the first weekIt&#x27;s smoother with fewer wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes. Today I&#x27;m ordering their Resurfacing Formula.  Try this, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Not comparable to Skinceuticals. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought these 2 products via Amazon and had a GREAT experience. I also like buying directly from the companies because they sometimes have samples and promos as well that aren&#x27;t always offered at other sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I even tried these products was because a gal that does videos on YouTube highly recommended using C+E with ferulic for optimal skincare. Her facialist/esthetician uses it regularly on her and she was liking how her skin was turning out with C+E and Hydragel B5.  I watch her videos regularly because she also reviews the high end beauty products and it&#x27;s just good to have some real life previews and feedback before buying a higher end cosmetic or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And from some further reading on the internet, I found out that these really are the must have products for proper skin care, especially for those who are wanting anti aging products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to try the ones at skin cueticals but the video lady compared them both and it seemed like getting the CSS brand of C+E and Hydragel was the right thing. I don&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since estheticians were using the C+E with Ferulic and the Hydragel B5 for facials at salons, it seemed like it was a skin care ingredient preapproved by experts and I didn&#x27;t need to shop around anymore once I heard that it was used at those places.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the fact that the YouTube lady I watch recommended these, that pretty much sealed it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once I got the products and really liked them, I wanted to know more about each one. So I went straight to the Cosmetic Skin Solutions website and read up on each product so I could see how to use it and what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I found the products and love them. I love how my skin feels and how my makeup goes on after using C+E and the hydragel. I feel like I am really taking care of my skin the right way. And for me, this is pretty much the first time I am taking care of it in the right way with the right skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently bought the little sample box from Cosmetic Skin Solutions directly. It has seven CSS skin  product vials in them and I have been using them as well. There is plenty in each dropper for several uses considering they are sample sizes.  And they are so easy to travel with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these products and really like the company. They are customer friendly and a generous company. They always respond to my emails and questions with a friendly and quick response.&lt;br /&gt;Good skin care products, and I enjoy shopping at their site directly as well.</li>
            <li> The product is very good and a good value.  The nature of this product is to degrade once it is processed.  I would rate it higher if I could get a smaller bottle for less money because I don&#x27;t finish the bottle before it has degraded.  Once degraded (it shows a dark yellow color instead of clear) it should be discontinued from using.  It is regressive at that point...so my research has stated.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, the amount remains the same and the price continues to rise (and now shipping is charged, also).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days and I like the products. Not crazy about the smell of the vitamin c.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using it for a couple of years. You see results almost immediately -which doesn&#x27;t happen with most creams. I&#x27;ve been told I look 8 years younger.</li>
            <li> Just as good as skinceuticals at a fraction of the cost. I love using this in the summer, but the smell is a bit off-putting...fyi.</li>
            <li> This arrived at the expected delivery date.  Packaged and well sealed. Vitamin c serum clear..good sign of freshness.  I find these products work just as well as the skinceuticals brand</li>
            <li> As a previous skinceuticals user I was skeptical about these products. The vitamin c+e serum is a Lot more runny than skinceuticals so place the drops slowly  on your face and rub in quickly ....&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin b5 worked well, it&#x27;s about the same consistency as skinceuticals.... And my skin absorbed it immediately...... I still use skinceuticals sunblock because its just the best.....after 3 weeks of daily use I can say that the products work...... My skin spots are diminishing and my skin is softer and supple. This will save me a lot of money ...... So if your deciding between skinceuticals and this brand .... Give this product a chance ..... U won&#x27;t regret it ... And you&#x27;ll save so much money!</li>
            <li> These work together for your skin. I saw a local Dermatologist was having a special on these products.&lt;br /&gt;I figured if he was selling them they must work. They do. My skin looks amazing. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Like the title, I just want to say I love these products. I use the serum right after cleansing my face but before putting on a moisturizer. You can either use the B5 gel as a moisturizer or like me, I use an Olay sensitive skin product. Either way, it&#x27;s a good combination. I use the B5 for my eyes and upper lip. For the price and quality, these are my go-to face products.</li>
            <li> Cosmetic Skin Solutions is a good product... I have a few of they&#x27;re Items, Iv commented on them on my other reviews,.. Iv looked around for a long time I&#x27;m 50 and at my age things change...YEAHHH, but if you find good stuff to help you along.. its not that bad..!!! This product is a good one to try if your one of those that&#x27;s skin is hard to please... Like mine...It may just be my age but this stuff helps.. Little goes a long ways Iv read that people are having some trouble.. but I think there using to much...It will build up if you use to much ... Remember use just a drop... Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  When applied, my skin actually looks better and, over the weeks, my skin actually has improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad with this product. Excellent relationship between quality and price. I&#x27;ve started to use it two years ago and I&#x27;ve really appreciate the difference. It&#x27;s a must for me!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my skin. been useing 2 weeks. I will finish product purchase and report again if I think I plan to re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Highly effective products. Absorb fast. Skin glows and feels great. I will buy Skinceuticals next to compare.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s done anything or not.  I started my skincare routine all at once (Retinol/Vit C and Hyaluronic Acid)  I will say that SOMETHING is making my skin look fantastic.  I believe it is the Retinol at night and Vitamin C Serum in the mornings. As for the Hydrating B5 Gel with Hyaloruonic Acid, meh....I&#x27;m not much of a fan.</li>
            <li> Have been using these two products in my face wash routine for 6 years on the recommendation of my esthetician. I find them to be just as good as the more expensive versions.  The B5 helps maintain moisture in your skin and the C&amp;E helps skin stay supple Plus adds a bit of sun protection which never hurts.  I&#x27;m 58 and get many comments on my &#x27;lovely&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Unfortunately not as good as Skinceuticals.  I was hoping it was since it is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, tried something different, my face feels wonderful. More cost effective than obagi and feels the same on my face. I will definitely purchase again to save money.</li>
