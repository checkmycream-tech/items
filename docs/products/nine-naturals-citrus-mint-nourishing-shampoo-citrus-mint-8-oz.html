            <li>so I could rest assured that I was doing my best to keep toxic chemicals out of my system.</li>
            <li>:D</li>
            <li>I even tried rinsing with Apple Cider Vinegar, which felt great but made my head smell like vinegar for DAYS, even after rewashing it out.</li>
            <li>This clears it up and makes the itching stop, and it smells and feels great.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo because it has great ingredients</li>
            <li>and it does a great job cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair smells amazing and it makes my hair shine!</li>
            <li>but the combination just does not smell good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved using Nine Naturals Nourishing shampoo and conditioner during both of my pregnancies.</li>
            <li>Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this company&#x27;s Mandarin + Ginger Conditioner, though, and wish there was a matching shampoo with that scent!</li>
            <li>Love the product but a bit pricey!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these products!</li>
            <li>but after using it, I just don&#x27;t find it smells good and leaves my hair too filled with product.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>
            <li>I am 4.5 months pregnant and this is the absolute best pregnancy-safe shampoo I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the conditioner...  </li>
            <li>I like peppermint oil and love citrus</li>
            <li>I love love love this product</li>
            <li>I often use it on my kiddo too because I trust that it&#x27;s safe and nontoxic.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, lather, and clean of this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I am now so turned off by chemical-ridden products and this is just such an effective, safe, well-made product that makes you look and feel great.</li>
            <li>It gets my fine hair clean without stripping the color (safe for highlights!  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of going chemical free, but my hair felt like straw after using and I ended up putting my hair into a pony tail immediately after blow drying because I couldn&#x27;t deal with it.</li>
            <li>Nine Naturals lathers like a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo and has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I am generally pleased with Nine Naturals products and feel safe about using them as shower replacement products now that I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li>Cosmetics Database that were easy to order</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally fine if you&#x27;re going to be leaving it put in your shower, but I warn you-</li>
            <li>Non pregnant women should use this as a luxurious and safe cleanser for their color-treated hair....</li>
            <li>It has a great fragrance (even when pregnant and somewhat sensitive to smells) and left my hair looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li>And it makes my hair smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Thank you for creating such an awesome, high quality product!</li>
            <li>Thanks for creating such a wonderful line of products!</li>
            <li>I first bought this as a gift for my pregnant sister in law and ended up loving the product myself.  </li>
            <li>the result is great, especially for safe, more natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>I love the whole product line!  </li>
            <li>So far, I love it!  </li>
            <li>During the first trimester of my pregnancy, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of anything, except for this mild scented, refreshing shampoo.  </li>
            <li>after watching the Dateline special on hormone disrupters.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a shampoo that isn&#x27;t full of chemicals</li>
            <li>(most were really obscure and cost a fortune in shipping).</li>
            <li>I got this product after finding out I was pregnant</li>
            <li>I really value the peace of mind I get from knowing the line is all natural and safe for me and my baby, never mind the fact I love using the products.</li>
            <li>The big plus is that the shampoo smells great, and makes my hair (thick/wavy) manageable without leaving it feeling \\&quot;stripped.\\&quot;  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I read about it in Vogue and have tried very much cheaper shampoos, from Burts Bees to Hugo&#x27;s Naturals and others</li>
            <li>Love it, just wish the bottle was bigger</li>
            <li>Not only do I love your products, my husband does too.</li>
            <li>I have loved using this gentle and delicious-smelling shampoo throughout the first half of my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>The citrus mint scent is pleasant, not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t really linger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The performance is better than any other natural haircare I have tried, and the scents are so gentle and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the high price.</li>
            <li>I used regular shampoo and conditioner with my first child and she turned out fine.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t have much of a lather, but I don&#x27;t think anything without the sulfates you&#x27;re avoiding</li>
            <li>I recommended Nine Naturals&#x27; Shea butter lotion to my girlfriend who is pregnant with twins; she is particularly concerned about stretch marks, and so far she&#x27;s had none using this.</li>
            <li>This is such a fantastic product, especially during pregnancy and nursing.</li>
            <li>It gets sudsy enough and cleans my hair pretty well.  </li>
            <li>For a non-sulfate shampoo, the lather even feels pretty close to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>Note - the bottle is TINY though, so you don&#x27;t get much shampoo for your money with each bottle!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to find Nine Naturals about half way through my pregnancy</li>
            <li>In addition to being totally natural, it also made my hair look shinier and healthier than the product I was using before.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my 17-month old.</li>
            <li>and it made my hair feel shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant the first time around in 2010, it was really hard to find shampoos and conditioners that were rated well on the Environmental Working Group (EWG)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m by no means a purist, but since I eat organic, and generally care about what I put in my body, it made sense to switch to beauty products that are also all natural and do not contain known hormone disrupters like phthalates and BPA.  </li>
            <li>Not the normal size of regular shampoo/conditioner you may be used to.</li>

            <li> It smells absolutely amazing--especially for an all-natural shampoo because the all-natural shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried before usually have a medicinal smell.</li>

            <li> I was hoping to go the &#x27;healthier&#x27; route with the second, but I&#x27;ll look to cut out the chemicals in other products.</li>
            <li> The problem comes when it is combined with the restorative conditioner, as my hair ends up being tangled, frizzy, and dry.  </li>
            <li> The other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried do not lather and leave my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> My baby is due any day now</li>
            <li> only complaint is the bottle itself-</li>
            <li> It does feel a little difficult to spread around your hair without using large amounts.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and complementary conditioner (although I&#x27;m not pregnant)</li>
            <li> The bottles for both the shampoo and conditioner are surprisingly small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought from Sprouts and Whole Foods, but all of them made my scalp itchy and feel like my hair was still very dirty.</li>
            <li> Also, be warned - these bottles are VERY small.</li>
            <li> It actually makes me nauseous. :(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten my family addicted!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this product after finding out I was pregnant so I could rest assured that I was doing my best to keep toxic chemicals out of my system. In addition to being totally natural, it also made my hair look shinier and healthier than the product I was using before. I&#x27;m still using this shampoo now that I&#x27;m nursing and I get tons of compliments on my hair--I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a shampoo that isn&#x27;t full of chemicals and this is the winner! The other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried do not lather and leave my hair feeling greasy. Nine Naturals lathers like a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo and has a nice fresh scent. My baby is due any day now but I plan to continue using this shampoo long after she arrives!</li>
            <li> I like it better than the conditioner...  It gets sudsy enough and cleans my hair pretty well.  The problem comes when it is combined with the restorative conditioner, as my hair ends up being tangled, frizzy, and dry.  The bottles for both the shampoo and conditioner are surprisingly small.</li>
            <li> I am generally pleased with Nine Naturals products and feel safe about using them as shower replacement products now that I&#x27;m pregnant. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t have much of a lather, but I don&#x27;t think anything without the sulfates you&#x27;re avoiding is likely to. It does feel a little difficult to spread around your hair without using large amounts. The citrus mint scent is pleasant, not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t really linger.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the bottle itself-it&#x27;s totally fine if you&#x27;re going to be leaving it put in your shower, but I warn you-DO NOT pack this in a travel bag. The shampoo (as well as the conditioner and body wash bottles) leaked everywhere in my toiletries on my last trip. I tried using plastic wrap to seal the tops on my return with no luck. Transport product to another bottle if traveling.</li>
            <li> but after using it, I just don&#x27;t find it smells good and leaves my hair too filled with product. It actually makes me nauseous. :(</li>
            <li> I am 4.5 months pregnant and this is the absolute best pregnancy-safe shampoo I&#x27;ve found. I read about it in Vogue and have tried very much cheaper shampoos, from Burts Bees to Hugo&#x27;s Naturals and others I&#x27;ve bought from Sprouts and Whole Foods, but all of them made my scalp itchy and feel like my hair was still very dirty. I even tried rinsing with Apple Cider Vinegar, which felt great but made my head smell like vinegar for DAYS, even after rewashing it out. This clears it up and makes the itching stop, and it smells and feels great. For a non-sulfate shampoo, the lather even feels pretty close to regular shampoo. Definitely worth the high price. Note - the bottle is TINY though, so you don&#x27;t get much shampoo for your money with each bottle!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because it has great ingredients and it does a great job cleaning my hair. I just don&#x27;t like the scent. I like peppermint oil and love citrus but the combination just does not smell good. I love this company&#x27;s Mandarin + Ginger Conditioner, though, and wish there was a matching shampoo with that scent!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, lather, and clean of this shampoo! Combined with the conditioner the result is great, especially for safe, more natural shampoos.</li>

            <li> Love it, just wish the bottle was bigger</li>
            <li> I love love love this product and I&#x27;ve gotten my family addicted!  I first bought this as a gift for my pregnant sister in law and ended up loving the product myself.  My sister in law has already given birth but continues to use the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.  Thank you for creating such an awesome, high quality product!</li>
            <li> I have loved using this gentle and delicious-smelling shampoo throughout the first half of my pregnancy.  It gets my fine hair clean without stripping the color (safe for highlights!  Non pregnant women should use this as a luxurious and safe cleanser for their color-treated hair....no stripping!).  I even use it on my 17-month old. She loves the smell and it&#x27;s much safer on her delicate scalp vs. shampoos with phalates and synthetics.  I love the whole product line!  I recommended Nine Naturals&#x27; Shea butter lotion to my girlfriend who is pregnant with twins; she is particularly concerned about stretch marks, and so far she&#x27;s had none using this.</li>
            <li> Used this product while I was pregnancy and it made my hair feel shiny and soft. I would recommend this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> My hair did not agree with these products. I love the idea of going chemical free, but my hair felt like straw after using and I ended up putting my hair into a pony tail immediately after blow drying because I couldn&#x27;t deal with it. Also, be warned - these bottles are VERY small. Not the normal size of regular shampoo/conditioner you may be used to. At $20 a bottle ($40 for both), I would expect to go through a bunch of these before my pregnancy was done. I used regular shampoo and conditioner with my first child and she turned out fine. I was hoping to go the &#x27;healthier&#x27; route with the second, but I&#x27;ll look to cut out the chemicals in other products. I&#x27;m going back to my Pantene ProV!</li>
            <li> My hair smells amazing and it makes my hair shine!</li>
            <li> Love the product but a bit pricey!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these products! I really value the peace of mind I get from knowing the line is all natural and safe for me and my baby, never mind the fact I love using the products. The performance is better than any other natural haircare I have tried, and the scents are so gentle and refreshing. I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved using Nine Naturals Nourishing shampoo and conditioner during both of my pregnancies. I often use it on my kiddo too because I trust that it&#x27;s safe and nontoxic.  It has a great fragrance (even when pregnant and somewhat sensitive to smells) and left my hair looking and feeling great. Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was pregnant the first time around in 2010, it was really hard to find shampoos and conditioners that were rated well on the Environmental Working Group (EWG) Cosmetics Database that were easy to order (most were really obscure and cost a fortune in shipping). I was really excited to find Nine Naturals about half way through my pregnancy and I am psyched that I can now buy it on Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and complementary conditioner (although I&#x27;m not pregnant) after watching the Dateline special on hormone disrupters.  So far, I love it!

            <li> This is such a fantastic product, especially during pregnancy and nursing. I am now so turned off by chemical-ridden products and this is just such an effective, safe, well-made product that makes you look and feel great.</li>
