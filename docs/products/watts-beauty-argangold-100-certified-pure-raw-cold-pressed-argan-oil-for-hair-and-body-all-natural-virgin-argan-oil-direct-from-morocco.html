            <li>In my opinion this is a great product for the hair.</li>

            <li>I paid significantly more for both and was very happy with both of them.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a good product for skin and hair</li>
            <li>I have used it as face moisturizer and loved it too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Morrocan Oil before with good results.</li>
            <li>The dispenser pump is much better than using the medicine dropper style most bottles have because it dispenses the perfect amount every time.</li>
            <li>AND I SHALL CONTINUE MOST HAPPILY TO ORDER FROM THEM.  </li>
            <li>It has made my hair and skin more attractive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found Watts Beauty as a resource!</li>
            <li>, people tell me my hair looks healthy!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Still love it!</li>
            <li>It works great and makes my hair so smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing amazing now that I have been using this morning and night under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>good price point - much better than competitors on shopping channels..</li>
            <li>so i could try the josie maran one to see if its better, more higher-quality even though this one is great</li>
            <li>The product gives incredible moisture to my face, and is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely on the skin and smells so good that I&#x27;m tempted to taste it.</li>
            <li>I started using a much more costly  brand 3 years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>Nice feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li>This oil is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried and the price is super.</li>
            <li>but something more along the line of dimethicone oil.  </li>
            <li>For hair &#x3D; Outstanding.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think Mastey could be better</li>
            <li>skin &#x3D; Outstanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re in love too.</li>
            <li>Olive oil, though it wouldn&#x27;t leave me with a flaky scalp, wasn&#x27;t perfect either; it made my hair feel grimy later in the day like I needed to wash it.  </li>
            <li>But it was better then putting nothing on at all.  </li>
            <li>Watts Argan Oil for my hair felt to me like using olive oil but in a more concentrated form.  </li>
            <li>It would moisturize ok but make my hair feel grimy.  </li>
            <li>Until a month ago I was using a very pricy product line (La mer) which I thought worked great for my skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks healthy and elastic all day</li>
            <li>Sounds like this product was better in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mostly, it seems par for the price.</li>
            <li>Not horrible, but no praises to sing compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Watts is 100% argan oil and works so much better.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>I prefer push top as opposed to the dropper.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for oily skin.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Great Product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Have not had any adverse reactions since buying a couple weeks ago and plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>My thoughts: It mostly stays in my bag and my closet</li>
            <li>and i love it also.</li>
            <li>my skin is just much better.</li>
            <li>i wish i had more money</li>
            <li>and im a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>This argan oil absorbs into your skin and leaves a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>The cheaper the oil the more times the nuts have been pressed.  </li>
            <li>I wonder why there was no seal at the top or anything.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, no hassle :)</li>
            <li>(just make sure they are 100%...</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of oil products because I have quite unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST product I have ever used, the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it, and I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>There is no comparison between Watts odorless argan and my recent purchase which has the most naturally wonderful nutty-sweet scent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i just love this product received it as a gift</li>
            <li>so i order more and will continue to do so.5 stars</li>
            <li>I love the fact that Watts is also affordable.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me; and because I like it so much for use with my problem hair, I have happily recommended it to others, who like the person who recommended it to me also uses it on their skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different brands of Argan oil and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair more body without making it look greasy.</li>
            <li>wonderful on the skin, not super greasy and really smoothes the skin and evens tone over time...smells good too, which is a plus!</li>
            <li>What I am saying is it&#x27;s a great, natural product with more than one use.</li>
            <li>I am curious to see if the effect will be as impressive as for my skin.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s better as pre-wash treatment for my hair, rather than an after wash light oil.</li>
            <li>I hope that with the passage of time comes more fabulous looking skin.</li>
            <li>So, far they have all worked great</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s soft and happy.</li>
            <li>Awesome and great quality compared to more expensive named brands.</li>
            <li>Very light but still rich.</li>
            <li>I love the pump top as it was a pain to use a dropper when fresh out of the shower and hands have lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li>The bottle it comes in is easy to use without wasting the oil.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, odorless, high qualty oil.</li>
            <li>instead of using silicone products for dry hair or flyaways, use this, its healthier and is a very good treatment.</li>
            <li>I find my hair is too fine to use argan oil on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it can be used in many different ways, but my hair drinks this oil up and feels very healthy as a result.</li>
            <li>Update: very easy return and didn&#x27;t have to pay postage which I believe is very responsible, and may be an Amazon thing.</li>
            <li>smooth.....</li>
            <li>I did use more Eucerin, 4x more at most, but still a 16.9 oz pump bottle of Eucerin at $10, will go as far as a 4 oz bottle of Watts at  $</li>
            <li>I have never had such great hair beyond the 1st day before I began using this argan oil.  </li>
            <li>My makeup goes on so smoothly after using my Watts Argan oil.</li>
            <li>This is my second order and this oil is great.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, this is a great buy if you like multitasking products or need intensive moisturizing for your skin and/or hair.</li>
            <li>but it does smooth it out.</li>
            <li>, it is much more economical.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>time I ordered the 2 ounce bottle, thinking I was just getting more  of a good thing, and...it was a completely different in look and smell...</li>
            <li>and Im so glad to go back to my beloved almond oil.  </li>
            <li>I love delivered right to your door.</li>
            <li>I order a lot of things from Amazon but very rarely do I even bother to leave a review.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>I hope my experience continues to be this successful with Argan oil and future purchases.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li>I have hair products with argan oil in them, but I get better results using the pure stuff.</li>
            <li>I use 100% Pure organic Almond on my sking after showering and let me tell you, that stuff works a lot better that this watts oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the large bottle of this oil.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered the product the oil was almost scent free and light.  </li>
            <li>all around good basic</li>
            <li>then I put my make up on (the full monty: foundation, blush, powder...)</li>
            <li>It provides a great base every day before applying my makeup and truly makes my face feel and look flawless makeup free.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of moisturizing the skin, but I don&#x27;t recommend using this in the morning on your face if you have oily skin because it will only make it oilier.</li>
            <li>This is really the most teling aspect: I couldn&#x27;t smell anything at all.</li>
            <li>I do mix with jojoba oil or almond oil sometimes but overall it is a good oil.</li>
            <li>Other brands offer a more fragrant oil that, when used on the skin, seems more potent.</li>
            <li>This particular brand had a most inviting price.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin moist for longer than just a couple hours.  </li>
            <li>so I tend to use it up fast and wanted something more economical...</li>
            <li>Does a nice job I do miss the smell of the Morocoon Oil...but far better to have all natural!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair with dry ends, and I find the best way is to put a couple of drops in my hand, rub my palms together</li>
            <li>I am very very pleased with this product and definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of argan oils, I&#x27;m pretty open-minded about the cheaper ones because...</li>
            <li>The new bottle is BETTER than what I got the first time, so everyone keep a pulse on what you get!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to get frizzy if not treated with the oil and blown out straight.  </li>
            <li>Then, I apply a dab of sunscreen, and I&#x27;m ready for eye makeup and maybe a light powder to finish.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s mostly absorbed, and then run my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li>A 4 oz squirt bottle has lasted me over a year, so it is economical as well.</li>
            <li>This oil is of good quality to me, working well as I&#x27;ve expected.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>It came right on time.</li>
            <li>I will be seraching for the right brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My makeup doesn&#x27;t go on right if I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>As for my dry winter hands, most lotions do a fine job of moisturizing, but the dryness would eventully come back.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>For my dry hands, again it does a good job of moisturizing like most lotions, but left my hands oily.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, one of the only &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; items I have consistently bought and cannot go a day without.</li>
            <li>Watts Argan oil will help, as with most products costing a lot less, so I was undecided whether I wanted to give it 3 stars for its ok effectiveness or 2 stars for</li>
            <li>argan oil is supposed to absorb quickly, and the whole point is that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>Almost 2 months later the item is everything I first thought and more.</li>
            <li>This is my first try of argan oil</li>
            <li>Only are much better as leave-in treatments.</li>
            <li>I started by trying One and Only argan oil blend, which was ok.  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE!  </li>
            <li>When I finally run out, I will probably buy more from Watts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any desire to have one mixed with silicone like so many of the others out there are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product before, and will absolutely order it again!</li>
            <li>Exactly the date that the seller estimated.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s my first time to try argan oil and went with this seller because of the price and how it was described.</li>
            <li>Will continue my prior better brand</li>
            <li>I ordered the 4 oz pump bottle and it arrived one day before it was scheduled to arrive, so I was pretty darn</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this product (close to a year now), I was told by many that I look much younger and my pimples are gone.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had read the newest reviews - there are many others who are claiming the same thing about this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it straight as a facial moisturizer at night and my skin ALWAYs looks better in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Quality seems to be good, but we don&#x27;t know enough about how it&#x27;s actually working.</li>
            <li>i guess my skin has calmed down now using this pure oil and not any stuff that is supposed to reduce oil; when really it exacerbates the problem because then ur skin just feels it needs to make more oil, and then u just get more acne because of more oil on ur face (google: oil- cleansing method for more info).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also have been using african black soap w/ this which u can use all over ur body</li>
            <li>Not sure product was any good.</li>
            <li>The seller has package well and easy to open also on time.</li>
            <li>This brand you can also use on your face because it is 100% pure.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the WattsBeauty Argan Gold 100% Certified Pure Argan Nut Oil a try...</li>
            <li>I have heard so much about argon oil, and its positive effects on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This product does everything that the more expensive brands do for a better value!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also a huge fan of extra virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li>2 drops was too much.</li>
            <li>you get to control where you use it and how much you use.</li>
            <li>Or a tiny bit to smooth out frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Give it 5-10 minutes to absorb and you won&#x27;t feel oily at all (unless you use too much).  </li>
            <li>Bless them for giving us the real deal.</li>
            <li>I wonder if I was getting the real mccoy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using argan oil based products for a while now and decided to try the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Products like Moroccan oil or Agadir or One n</li>
            <li>the oil is much thicker .  </li>
            <li>Too much  of this product on the roots may make the hair look a bit oily.</li>
            <li>It should smell nutty, and absorb much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was trial and error to see how much I needed, used 4 pumps for example and it looked greasy.</li>
            <li>Using argan oil, my skin has returned back to being supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>(I ordered some from Elma &amp; Sana that really stank, might have been rancid.)</li>
            <li>This argan nut oil is the real deal.</li>
            <li>But, I use argan oil on my whole body</li>
            <li>It styles well and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I really do use it every time that I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>It works very well moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>and then I do two-strand twists in sections all over and my hair is wonderful for at least 3 days longer if I wear the twists for a day or two before taking down.  </li>
            <li>I took this out of the package and could see, even through the dark brown bottle, how it looked thinner and more watery.  </li>
            <li>Less is more.  </li>
            <li>The bottle it comes in is brown, but plastic, so I will need to be careful so that it doesn&#x27;t get easily contaminated.  </li>
            <li>Better than previously used product without the added dyes/preservatives, etc..</li>
            <li>I mix with conditioner and it makes my hair super soft...(african American).</li>
            <li>highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.........use on body, neck and face....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I purchased from a highly respected herb source in the NW U.S.</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>This is a great and inexpensive argan oil that performs just as well as expensive argan oil - I&#x27;ve used Josie Maran before and it seems identical to this one.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this product in the smaller size in the past, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>just ordered the Elma&amp;Sana Golden Argan Oil, I will post my review in the next week or so.</li>
            <li>I normally like this oil and have ordered it a number of times</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be emailing Watts, will update post if new info comes to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They refunded me and also sent a new bottle.</li>
            <li>I will say that I use this 1st on clean wet hair, followed by conditioner and a curling cream</li>
            <li>I use natural oil for my hair products specially before blow dry and works like charm.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that i bought a bigger bottle for daily use and going to keep the small bottle for my travel.</li>
            <li>The next time I got to a mirror I could see 5 little bright red dots that had not been there before.  </li>
            <li>My face is clear like a baby!</li>
            <li>Or if it&#x27;s hot &amp; humid already, I&#x27;ll just add a drop or two to my regular face moisturizer day or night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging - this is light brown bottle versus dark tinted which is supposed to protect the oil from sunlight.</li>
            <li>with any beauty product, consistent use is key.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday because my hair is pretty oily already and, because my hair is also fine, I only have to use one</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive to start with and especially so in recent years, since I use tretinoin.  </li>
            <li>I did my research and found this pure, organic (the only way to go) resource.</li>
            <li>I compared Watts Argan with Eucerin Original Moisturizing Lotion on my dry white flaky knees, placing the Watts and Eucerin on separate knees.  </li>
            <li>After what I&#x27;ve read on how much work it takes to produce one litre, it&#x27;s hard to believe that it can be this cheap without having added something.  </li>
            <li>I would like to look into having this company checked out to see if there is anything that can be done about what is a clear case of fraud on this company&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil I purchased from Watt&#x27;s is a clear liquid that looks suspiciously like mineral oil.  </li>
            <li>Repeat if necessary, but this way you don&#x27;t make the mistake of putting too much in your hair.</li>
            <li>My skin drinks it in and becomes so soft.</li>
            <li>I put a couple squirts in my leave in conditioners and shake it up very well to use daily.</li>
            <li>makes my hair look and feel healthier, shinier and soft.</li>
            <li>(I bought  the natural scent version).</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long</li>
            <li>RX didn&#x27;t help much, it would just return soon enough.  </li>
            <li>This product was in a cheap bottle that leaked after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I will apply this to the ends of my hair after showering and it makes the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>For a few months I&#x27;ve been using another brand of \\&quot;pure\\&quot; argan oil as my primary moisturizer in the morning and evening.  </li>
            <li>I washed it off and put on some oil from my old bottle,</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s too early to say about any results.</li>
            <li>It really helped with the dryness, thinness and split ends I had as a result of years of countless color treatments.</li>
            <li>and i use it on my face leaves it feeling sooooooooooo soft for hours works well with watts mineral make-up too.i use to get ache from store face creams alot,not now the oil has improved the look of my skin</li>
            <li>, the packaging of this producted is not cheap cold-pressed oil should be kept in a brown or colored glass bottle to protect it from light especially from sunlight and a dropper is much easier to use.love</li>
            <li>Either way, spend the extra money for the real thing.  </li>
            <li>The other two (Shea Terra Organics and Elma &amp; Sanna) absorbed within 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I also apply it to my face at night when it&#x27;s feeling dry, wash off with gentle cleanser (Cetaphil) in the morning.</li>
            <li>Besides that little detail, it does not absorb quickly unlike other pure oils.</li>
            <li>I just get a small dab (just one or two pumps), rub my hands together and apply  it on the lengths and ends of my clean hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks now, so I&#x27;m so so excited to see the long-term difference.</li>
            <li>My hair type is thick, fine and wavy.  </li>
            <li>If it were first cold pressed you can be sure they&#x27;d let us know because that is something to brag about.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time to purchase this Argan Oil from Watts via Direct 2U.  </li>
            <li>Only con so far is the price.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at the other reviewers posts about the high quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>It was the only &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; non perfume added argon oil i could find, its not cheap, (especially when u need it for pouring on your bulldog everyday to help her dry skin that isn&#x27;t helped by her head butting open the bathroom door and jumping in the tub/shower every single time someone is bathing) gotta order another bottle already,  then purest thing i could find prior to this was just as much $$ and mixed with mineral oil, which actually clogs pores and stops the skin from absorbing the Moroccan oil, the good stuff.</li>
            <li>I am african american and have naturally curly 3b-c hair.</li>
            <li>After the first squirt, I became very skeptical about this product, even more after applying it on my legs.</li>
            <li>My hair is much less dry, my skin has significantly less flaking, my nails are no longer peeling and when used on a minor burn or scrape, I notice they heal more quickly and with less scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I experimented with olive oil on my dry hair because the hair products I&#x27;ve tried would make my hair look good for a few hours, but later in the day would dry up and leave me with stiff hair and a flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li>If that were what I wanted I could add a few drops of this to a cheap silicone based hair serum and have the same thing for a fraction of what those other brands are charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes my cuticles soft and restores the look of my manicure, and does the job when my hands are too dry for coconut oil.</li>
            <li>The price of the Watt&#x27;s is very reasonable for a raw, undeodorized argan oil.</li>
            <li>Also, like some other reviewers mention,this argan oil had hardly no smell to it, so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you want beautiful hair you want this product in your beauty box of tricks.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This oil works very good though the quality isn&#x27;t as good as Jose Maran</li>
            <li> Hair is shiny and looks great.</li>
            <li> Great on skin and hair.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is a great product for the hair.</li>

            <li> I paid significantly more for both and was very happy with both of them.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a good product for skin and hair</li>
            <li> I have used it as face moisturizer and loved it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Morrocan Oil before with good results.</li>
            <li> The dispenser pump is much better than using the medicine dropper style most bottles have because it dispenses the perfect amount every time.</li>
            <li> AND I SHALL CONTINUE MOST HAPPILY TO ORDER FROM THEM.  </li>
            <li> It has made my hair and skin more attractive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found Watts Beauty as a resource!</li>
            <li> , people tell me my hair looks healthy!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Still love it!</li>
            <li> It works great and makes my hair so smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing amazing now that I have been using this morning and night under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> good price point - much better than competitors on shopping channels..</li>
            <li> so i could try the josie maran one to see if its better, more higher-quality even though this one is great</li>
            <li> The product gives incredible moisture to my face, and is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely on the skin and smells so good that I&#x27;m tempted to taste it.</li>
            <li> I started using a much more costly  brand 3 years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried and the price is super.</li>
            <li> but something more along the line of dimethicone oil.  </li>
            <li> For hair &#x3D; Outstanding.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think Mastey could be better</li>
            <li> skin &#x3D; Outstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re in love too.</li>
            <li> Olive oil, though it wouldn&#x27;t leave me with a flaky scalp, wasn&#x27;t perfect either; it made my hair feel grimy later in the day like I needed to wash it.  </li>
            <li> But it was better then putting nothing on at all.  </li>
            <li> Watts Argan Oil for my hair felt to me like using olive oil but in a more concentrated form.  </li>
            <li> It would moisturize ok but make my hair feel grimy.  </li>
            <li> Until a month ago I was using a very pricy product line (La mer) which I thought worked great for my skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks healthy and elastic all day</li>
            <li> Sounds like this product was better in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mostly, it seems par for the price.</li>
            <li> Not horrible, but no praises to sing compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Watts is 100% argan oil and works so much better.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better.  </li>
            <li> I prefer push top as opposed to the dropper.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for oily skin.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Great Product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Have not had any adverse reactions since buying a couple weeks ago and plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> My thoughts: It mostly stays in my bag and my closet</li>
            <li> and i love it also.</li>
            <li> my skin is just much better.</li>
            <li> i wish i had more money</li>
            <li> and im a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> This argan oil absorbs into your skin and leaves a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> The cheaper the oil the more times the nuts have been pressed.  </li>
            <li> I wonder why there was no seal at the top or anything.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, no hassle :)</li>
            <li> (just make sure they are 100%...</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of oil products because I have quite unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I have ever used, the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it, and I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison between Watts odorless argan and my recent purchase which has the most naturally wonderful nutty-sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> i just love this product received it as a gift</li>
            <li> so i order more and will continue to do so.5 stars</li>
            <li> I love the fact that Watts is also affordable.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me; and because I like it so much for use with my problem hair, I have happily recommended it to others, who like the person who recommended it to me also uses it on their skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different brands of Argan oil and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair more body without making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> wonderful on the skin, not super greasy and really smoothes the skin and evens tone over time...smells good too, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> What I am saying is it&#x27;s a great, natural product with more than one use.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see if the effect will be as impressive as for my skin.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s better as pre-wash treatment for my hair, rather than an after wash light oil.</li>
            <li> I hope that with the passage of time comes more fabulous looking skin.</li>
            <li> So, far they have all worked great</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s soft and happy.</li>
            <li> Awesome and great quality compared to more expensive named brands.</li>
            <li> Very light but still rich.</li>
            <li> I love the pump top as it was a pain to use a dropper when fresh out of the shower and hands have lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li> The bottle it comes in is easy to use without wasting the oil.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, odorless, high qualty oil.</li>
            <li> instead of using silicone products for dry hair or flyaways, use this, its healthier and is a very good treatment.</li>
            <li> I find my hair is too fine to use argan oil on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it can be used in many different ways, but my hair drinks this oil up and feels very healthy as a result.</li>
            <li> Update: very easy return and didn&#x27;t have to pay postage which I believe is very responsible, and may be an Amazon thing.</li>
            <li> smooth.....</li>
            <li> I did use more Eucerin, 4x more at most, but still a 16.9 oz pump bottle of Eucerin at $10, will go as far as a 4 oz bottle of Watts at  $</li>
            <li> I have never had such great hair beyond the 1st day before I began using this argan oil.  </li>
            <li> My makeup goes on so smoothly after using my Watts Argan oil.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and this oil is great.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, this is a great buy if you like multitasking products or need intensive moisturizing for your skin and/or hair.</li>
            <li> but it does smooth it out.</li>
            <li> , it is much more economical.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li> time I ordered the 2 ounce bottle, thinking I was just getting more  of a good thing, and...it was a completely different in look and smell...</li>
            <li> and Im so glad to go back to my beloved almond oil.  </li>
            <li> I love delivered right to your door.</li>
            <li> I order a lot of things from Amazon but very rarely do I even bother to leave a review.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I hope my experience continues to be this successful with Argan oil and future purchases.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> I have hair products with argan oil in them, but I get better results using the pure stuff.</li>
            <li> I use 100% Pure organic Almond on my sking after showering and let me tell you, that stuff works a lot better that this watts oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the large bottle of this oil.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered the product the oil was almost scent free and light.  </li>
            <li> all around good basic</li>
            <li> then I put my make up on (the full monty: foundation, blush, powder...)</li>
            <li> It provides a great base every day before applying my makeup and truly makes my face feel and look flawless makeup free.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of moisturizing the skin, but I don&#x27;t recommend using this in the morning on your face if you have oily skin because it will only make it oilier.</li>
            <li> This is really the most teling aspect: I couldn&#x27;t smell anything at all.</li>
            <li> I do mix with jojoba oil or almond oil sometimes but overall it is a good oil.</li>
            <li> Other brands offer a more fragrant oil that, when used on the skin, seems more potent.</li>
            <li> This particular brand had a most inviting price.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin moist for longer than just a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> so I tend to use it up fast and wanted something more economical...</li>
            <li> Does a nice job I do miss the smell of the Morocoon Oil...but far better to have all natural!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair with dry ends, and I find the best way is to put a couple of drops in my hand, rub my palms together</li>
            <li> I am very very pleased with this product and definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of argan oils, I&#x27;m pretty open-minded about the cheaper ones because...</li>
            <li> The new bottle is BETTER than what I got the first time, so everyone keep a pulse on what you get!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tends to get frizzy if not treated with the oil and blown out straight.  </li>
            <li> Then, I apply a dab of sunscreen, and I&#x27;m ready for eye makeup and maybe a light powder to finish.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s mostly absorbed, and then run my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> A 4 oz squirt bottle has lasted me over a year, so it is economical as well.</li>
            <li> This oil is of good quality to me, working well as I&#x27;ve expected.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> It came right on time.</li>
            <li> I will be seraching for the right brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My makeup doesn&#x27;t go on right if I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> As for my dry winter hands, most lotions do a fine job of moisturizing, but the dryness would eventully come back.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> For my dry hands, again it does a good job of moisturizing like most lotions, but left my hands oily.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, one of the only &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; items I have consistently bought and cannot go a day without.</li>
            <li> Watts Argan oil will help, as with most products costing a lot less, so I was undecided whether I wanted to give it 3 stars for its ok effectiveness or 2 stars for</li>
            <li> argan oil is supposed to absorb quickly, and the whole point is that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> Almost 2 months later the item is everything I first thought and more.</li>
            <li> This is my first try of argan oil</li>
            <li> Only are much better as leave-in treatments.</li>
            <li> I started by trying One and Only argan oil blend, which was ok.  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE!  </li>
            <li> When I finally run out, I will probably buy more from Watts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any desire to have one mixed with silicone like so many of the others out there are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before, and will absolutely order it again!</li>
            <li> Exactly the date that the seller estimated.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s my first time to try argan oil and went with this seller because of the price and how it was described.</li>
            <li> Will continue my prior better brand</li>
            <li> I ordered the 4 oz pump bottle and it arrived one day before it was scheduled to arrive, so I was pretty darn</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product (close to a year now), I was told by many that I look much younger and my pimples are gone.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had read the newest reviews - there are many others who are claiming the same thing about this product.  </li>
            <li> I use it straight as a facial moisturizer at night and my skin ALWAYs looks better in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Quality seems to be good, but we don&#x27;t know enough about how it&#x27;s actually working.</li>
            <li> i guess my skin has calmed down now using this pure oil and not any stuff that is supposed to reduce oil; when really it exacerbates the problem because then ur skin just feels it needs to make more oil, and then u just get more acne because of more oil on ur face (google: oil- cleansing method for more info).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also have been using african black soap w/ this which u can use all over ur body</li>
            <li> Not sure product was any good.</li>
            <li> The seller has package well and easy to open also on time.</li>
            <li> This brand you can also use on your face because it is 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the WattsBeauty Argan Gold 100% Certified Pure Argan Nut Oil a try...</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about argon oil, and its positive effects on the skin.  </li>
            <li> This product does everything that the more expensive brands do for a better value!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also a huge fan of extra virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li> 2 drops was too much.</li>
            <li> you get to control where you use it and how much you use.</li>
            <li> Or a tiny bit to smooth out frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Give it 5-10 minutes to absorb and you won&#x27;t feel oily at all (unless you use too much).  </li>
            <li> Bless them for giving us the real deal.</li>
            <li> I wonder if I was getting the real mccoy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using argan oil based products for a while now and decided to try the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Products like Moroccan oil or Agadir or One n</li>
            <li> the oil is much thicker .  </li>
            <li> Too much  of this product on the roots may make the hair look a bit oily.</li>
            <li> It should smell nutty, and absorb much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was trial and error to see how much I needed, used 4 pumps for example and it looked greasy.</li>
            <li> Using argan oil, my skin has returned back to being supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> (I ordered some from Elma &amp; Sana that really stank, might have been rancid.)</li>
            <li> This argan nut oil is the real deal.</li>
            <li> But, I use argan oil on my whole body</li>
            <li> It styles well and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I really do use it every time that I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It works very well moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> and then I do two-strand twists in sections all over and my hair is wonderful for at least 3 days longer if I wear the twists for a day or two before taking down.  </li>
            <li> I took this out of the package and could see, even through the dark brown bottle, how it looked thinner and more watery.  </li>
            <li> Less is more.  </li>
            <li> The bottle it comes in is brown, but plastic, so I will need to be careful so that it doesn&#x27;t get easily contaminated.  </li>
            <li> Better than previously used product without the added dyes/preservatives, etc..</li>
            <li> I mix with conditioner and it makes my hair super soft...(african American).</li>
            <li> highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.........use on body, neck and face....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased from a highly respected herb source in the NW U.S.</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This is a great and inexpensive argan oil that performs just as well as expensive argan oil - I&#x27;ve used Josie Maran before and it seems identical to this one.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product in the smaller size in the past, and loved it.  </li>
            <li> just ordered the Elma&amp;Sana Golden Argan Oil, I will post my review in the next week or so.</li>
            <li> I normally like this oil and have ordered it a number of times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be emailing Watts, will update post if new info comes to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They refunded me and also sent a new bottle.</li>
            <li> I will say that I use this 1st on clean wet hair, followed by conditioner and a curling cream</li>
            <li> I use natural oil for my hair products specially before blow dry and works like charm.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that i bought a bigger bottle for daily use and going to keep the small bottle for my travel.</li>
            <li> The next time I got to a mirror I could see 5 little bright red dots that had not been there before.  </li>
            <li> My face is clear like a baby!</li>
            <li> Or if it&#x27;s hot &amp; humid already, I&#x27;ll just add a drop or two to my regular face moisturizer day or night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging - this is light brown bottle versus dark tinted which is supposed to protect the oil from sunlight.</li>
            <li> with any beauty product, consistent use is key.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday because my hair is pretty oily already and, because my hair is also fine, I only have to use one</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive to start with and especially so in recent years, since I use tretinoin.  </li>
            <li> I did my research and found this pure, organic (the only way to go) resource.</li>
            <li> I compared Watts Argan with Eucerin Original Moisturizing Lotion on my dry white flaky knees, placing the Watts and Eucerin on separate knees.  </li>
            <li> After what I&#x27;ve read on how much work it takes to produce one litre, it&#x27;s hard to believe that it can be this cheap without having added something.  </li>
            <li> I would like to look into having this company checked out to see if there is anything that can be done about what is a clear case of fraud on this company&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil I purchased from Watt&#x27;s is a clear liquid that looks suspiciously like mineral oil.  </li>
            <li> Repeat if necessary, but this way you don&#x27;t make the mistake of putting too much in your hair.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks it in and becomes so soft.</li>
            <li> I put a couple squirts in my leave in conditioners and shake it up very well to use daily.</li>
            <li> makes my hair look and feel healthier, shinier and soft.</li>
            <li> (I bought  the natural scent version).</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long</li>
            <li> RX didn&#x27;t help much, it would just return soon enough.  </li>
            <li> This product was in a cheap bottle that leaked after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I will apply this to the ends of my hair after showering and it makes the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> For a few months I&#x27;ve been using another brand of \\&quot;pure\\&quot; argan oil as my primary moisturizer in the morning and evening.  </li>
            <li> I washed it off and put on some oil from my old bottle,</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s too early to say about any results.</li>
            <li> It really helped with the dryness, thinness and split ends I had as a result of years of countless color treatments.</li>
            <li> and i use it on my face leaves it feeling sooooooooooo soft for hours works well with watts mineral make-up too.i use to get ache from store face creams alot,not now the oil has improved the look of my skin</li>
            <li> , the packaging of this producted is not cheap cold-pressed oil should be kept in a brown or colored glass bottle to protect it from light especially from sunlight and a dropper is much easier to use.love</li>
            <li> Either way, spend the extra money for the real thing.  </li>
            <li> The other two (Shea Terra Organics and Elma &amp; Sanna) absorbed within 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I also apply it to my face at night when it&#x27;s feeling dry, wash off with gentle cleanser (Cetaphil) in the morning.</li>
            <li> Besides that little detail, it does not absorb quickly unlike other pure oils.</li>
            <li> I just get a small dab (just one or two pumps), rub my hands together and apply  it on the lengths and ends of my clean hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks now, so I&#x27;m so so excited to see the long-term difference.</li>
            <li> My hair type is thick, fine and wavy.  </li>
            <li> If it were first cold pressed you can be sure they&#x27;d let us know because that is something to brag about.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time to purchase this Argan Oil from Watts via Direct 2U.  </li>
            <li> Only con so far is the price.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the other reviewers posts about the high quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> It was the only &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; non perfume added argon oil i could find, its not cheap, (especially when u need it for pouring on your bulldog everyday to help her dry skin that isn&#x27;t helped by her head butting open the bathroom door and jumping in the tub/shower every single time someone is bathing) gotta order another bottle already,  then purest thing i could find prior to this was just as much $$ and mixed with mineral oil, which actually clogs pores and stops the skin from absorbing the Moroccan oil, the good stuff.</li>
            <li> I am african american and have naturally curly 3b-c hair.</li>
            <li> After the first squirt, I became very skeptical about this product, even more after applying it on my legs.</li>
            <li> My hair is much less dry, my skin has significantly less flaking, my nails are no longer peeling and when used on a minor burn or scrape, I notice they heal more quickly and with less scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I experimented with olive oil on my dry hair because the hair products I&#x27;ve tried would make my hair look good for a few hours, but later in the day would dry up and leave me with stiff hair and a flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li> If that were what I wanted I could add a few drops of this to a cheap silicone based hair serum and have the same thing for a fraction of what those other brands are charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes my cuticles soft and restores the look of my manicure, and does the job when my hands are too dry for coconut oil.</li>
            <li> The price of the Watt&#x27;s is very reasonable for a raw, undeodorized argan oil.</li>
            <li> Also, like some other reviewers mention,this argan oil had hardly no smell to it, so</li>
            <li> Flat iron now takes minutes instead of 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> use this as a hair moisturizer, facial moisturizer, nails moisturizer and a treatment for minor burns and scrapes.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Greasy, pale (almost clear), and it smells like lube!!</li>
            <li> (I make the lotion last 2x as long this way!)</li>
            <li> I bought the pump bottle - it squirts a little wild, but, I think it&#x27;s probably neater than the dropper, who knows!</li>
            <li> Just a tiny amount of this product, and the dry patches are gone.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve tried a little bit of it</li>
            <li> so I only use this on my face at night, and usually only in the winter when my skin is especially dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive oils from hair salons and cheap oils from the discount grocery store...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a couple of bottles of this, even though each lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long, there is no need to reapply it and has no odor at all</li>
            <li> No clear winner here.</li>
            <li> I wonder how a company can get away with falsely advertising a product as 100% pure when it is so obviously not.  </li>
            <li> read some other reviews about similar experience.</li>
            <li> This had no smell which to me means that this was either refined or contained a mixture of some other oils such as jojoba.</li>
            <li> I refuse to buy any other brand and constantly refer my friends to this brand.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with clogged pores or reactions, the small patches of acne that I had prior to using this product are actually diminishing in size and aren&#x27;t as red and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small bottles last me 6 months, this big one could last well over a year.</li>
            <li> cold pressed argan oil should have a yellowishy cloudy colour to it and a smell that&#x27;s kind of nutty or a little rubbery.  </li>
            <li> I am left to wonder exactly what Watts is selling - and always wondered how the product could be raw, cold pressed and yet contain no hint of the qualities of the nut so evident in the product I now have.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face when my skin is dry</li>
            <li> After reading rave reviews about argan oil working wonders, I had to try it for my dry brittle frizzy hair and my dry winter chapped hands.  </li>
            <li> I have stopped using it because it seems to dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the drier months, I suffer from patches of dry skin on my face and my hands get very dry as well.</li>
            <li> Just remember a little goes a long way, and this bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry, tight, problematic, itchy facial skin</li>
            <li> Extremely affordable, especially compared to other argon oil brands.  </li>
            <li> A small size amount of Watts Argan oil felt the same as double the amount of olive oil in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Half that bottle (8 oz/$3.50) would go the same distance as 4 oz of Watts Argan oil at</li>
            <li> the argan oil makes it even better,i&#x27;ve narural curly hair that use to be very dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry due to eczema.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be going back to my expensive, but real, stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real argan oil.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it absorbes quickly&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I have no comparison with Watts Argan Oil to other brands of argan oils, but I will compare it to other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update - I just did a test on my leg with 2 other argan oils.</li>
            <li> I add a small squirt to my facial moisturizer or to my hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> really disappointed because I made sure to get a product that was labeled as \\&quot;100</li>
            <li> I also cannot use the coconut oil on my face due to it causing me breakouts, which I never have a problem with when I use the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two products are priced the same, though I paid for shipping this time - a small price for the quality.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t spread like the other Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried (Josie Maran, Saadia).  </li>
            <li> I have battled with my extremely oily skin all my life.  </li>
            <li> Still, I decided to try a different source for raw cold-pressed argan, because every other variety of raw, cold-pressed oil I&#x27;ve purchased has some characteristic scent and color while this had none.</li>
            <li> There are other reviews that claim the quality has gone down, and I have to agree.</li>
            <li> i been using this for 3 years and ever since then my skin has been glowing, looks healthier, i havent worn make-up(cover-up) in years, and also cant remember having any cystic pimples either (the huge, painful ones).</li>
            <li> It comes in a dark plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about the oil itself, and Watts brand is fresh and odorless, as advertised.</li>
            <li> 1 drop does the trick on my mid length, thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz down,  not to oily, I also use it on my neck and hands.</li>
            <li> This one has less smell,</li>
            <li> less greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used about almost half of the bottle (on my legs) for about a week</li>
            <li> my hair is thick and long and needs a lot of this</li>
            <li> The smell is just a little less nutty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sent to you by tight bubble wrapping envelope.  </li>
            <li> Again a little goes a looooong way.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like grass, which I don&#x27;t mind, but that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s supposed to smell.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have used cold pressed argan oil before and it had a certain nutty smell.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops to each bottle.  </li>
            <li> I could tell the result after few hours.</li>
            <li> All natural, faint smell.   </li>
            <li> I tested it on my cheeks and within a few minutes they felt itchy.  </li>
            <li> Smells different, thin, doesn&#x27;t absorb at all.</li>
            <li> I have been reading reviews about people who have been using argan oil on their skin for a few months now, and I found out about Watts from a beauty forum.</li>
            <li> This oil gives my hair a shine without being heavy.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 4oz pump bottle of Watts in Nov. 2011 and ran out of it a few months ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also supposed to absorb within a few minutes (2 minutes in my experience) of application and leave no residual smell.  </li>
            <li> Those usually run a little thinner, maybe less nutrient dense.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;100% Pure, Raw Cold Pressed Argan Oil\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> So the way I look at it, I can get a small half litre (16.9 oz.)bottle of olive oil for about $7.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used argan oil for the past 7 months and wanted to try one that was less</li>
            <li> /&gt;Travel - I wish the cap was twist so that i would not easily come out and accidentally spilling the oil.</li>
            <li> It had a faint, barely</li>
            <li> The fact that it is raw and organic appeals to me.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil in my hair for the past five years or so.  </li>
            <li> I use on my face and neck, on my body and a small amount on my hair.</li>
            <li> no more itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With that said, I&#x27;m not sure what the quality or content of this bottle is??</li>
            <li> Would recommend it, no more frizzy hair days.</li>
            <li> This was NOT pure, raw argan oil, I don&#x27;t care what anybody says!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, baby fine and curly - the big three of lousy, terrible to style hair.</li>
            <li> My hair became stringy and oily, covered in a thick coating of oil which required me to have to re-wash in the kitchen sink to get this stuff out.  </li>
            <li> (Note that very little is needed at any one time!)  </li>
            <li> I went from having bleached, dried, broken hair into having people compliment me on my hair - seriously</li>
            <li> 27 dollars WASTED!!</li>
            <li> Notice the description says \\&quot;cold pressed\\&quot; not \\&quot;First cold pressed\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I knew I had to find something less expensive and in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Watts doesn&#x27;t tell us so the question is...is their argan oil 2nd cold pressed, 3rd cold pressed, 4th cold pressed??</li>
            <li> Tired of being ripped off.</li>
            <li> buy the least expensive 100% certified argan oil.  </li>
            <li> My son no longer suffers from the skin conditions he&#x27;s had in the past.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I just opened the bottle and missed the window of return.  </li>
            <li> I am skeptical of the quality control in this company now and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I have the worst dry skin on the planet.</li>
            <li> It smells almost like raw sewage!!!!  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is quite expensive!</li>
            <li> The smell is faint and pleasant-not overpowering!</li>
            <li> False advertising!!</li>
            <li> I have used very expensive Moroccan oil as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bad cost value.  </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed with Watts Beauty Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I hate stinky stuff</li>
            <li> is a all oil base shampoo to start</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil in my hair for the past five years or so.  I have fine hair that tends to get frizzy if not treated with the oil and blown out straight.  I decided to give this product a try and put it in my damp hair as I do each time I wash it.  I could tell immediately that this product is not argan oil but something more along the line of dimethicone oil.  My hair became stringy and oily, covered in a thick coating of oil which required me to have to re-wash in the kitchen sink to get this stuff out.  I wonder how a company can get away with falsely advertising a product as 100% pure when it is so obviously not.  I really wish I had read the newest reviews - there are many others who are claiming the same thing about this product.  It&#x27;s not real argan oil.  I would like to look into having this company checked out to see if there is anything that can be done about what is a clear case of fraud on this company&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a couple of bottles of this, even though each lasts me a long time. I put it on my face when my skin is dry (it does not make me break out). I put it on my hands &amp; cuticles, and I use it on my hair. Sometimes I use it to take off my makeup, including mascara. I have hair products with argan oil in them, but I get better results using the pure stuff. I have long, fine hair with dry ends, and I find the best way is to put a couple of drops in my hand, rub my palms together so it&#x27;s mostly absorbed, and then run my hands through my hair. Repeat if necessary, but this way you don&#x27;t make the mistake of putting too much in your hair. I also saturate the ends of my hair and leave it in over night from time to time.</li>
            <li> For hair &#x3D; Outstanding. 2 drops was too much. 1 drop does the trick on my mid length, thick curly hair. Frizz instantly gone on a rainy day! Flat iron now takes minutes instead of 1/2 hour. Hair is shiny and looks great. I have control over my hair. Big deal that is. Totally sold. I&#x27;m giving this product to all the girls on my Xmas list.  I use Mastey creme shampoo and conditioner. I added a few drops to each bottle.  I didn&#x27;t think Mastey could be better but It is. If you want beautiful hair you want this product in your beauty box of tricks.&lt;br /&gt;For skin &#x3D; Outstanding. My skin drinks it in and becomes so soft. Again a little goes a looooong way. A couple of drops for my face, hands, arms, calves.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Almost 2 months later the item is everything I first thought and more. I&#x27;m so glad I found it. I&#x27;ve turned friends on to it and they&#x27;re in love too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.........use on body, neck and face....helps the lines on the chest and keeps your skin moist&lt;br /&gt;and smooth.....good price point - much better than competitors on shopping channels..all around good basic must&lt;br /&gt;for beauty regime.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about argon oil, and its positive effects on the skin.  This product makes my skin feel and look softer.  I use it on my face and arms, planning to use it on my legs also.  This particular brand had a most inviting price.  Extremely affordable, especially compared to other argon oil brands.  This is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Yes, folks. This is the \\&quot;Moroccan oil\\&quot; that is all over the market place in all kinds of products now.  Don&#x27;t fall for the mass-marketed nonsense.  They put a miniscule amount in the product so they can claim it on the label.  I did my research and found this pure, organic (the only way to go) resource. And best of all- you get to control where you use it and how much you use. I use it straight as a facial moisturizer at night and my skin ALWAYs looks better in the morning.  Or if it&#x27;s hot &amp; humid already, I&#x27;ll just add a drop or two to my regular face moisturizer day or night. I add 3-4 drops to my body moisturizer, or I put on a \\&quot;coat\\&quot; of it (mixed with a couple of drops of water) before I \\&quot;seal\\&quot; it in with my moisturizer. (I make the lotion last 2x as long this way!) I put a drop or two in my drying-out mascara and under-eye concealer so I don&#x27;t throw away still viable product left on the sides of the container.  I occasionally put some in my hair when it&#x27;s super-dry. Or a tiny bit to smooth out frizzies.  This is the greatest, lightest oil on the planet!  Give it 5-10 minutes to absorb and you won&#x27;t feel oily at all (unless you use too much).  Less is more.  I&#x27;m so glad I found Watts Beauty as a resource! Bless them for giving us the real deal.</li>
            <li> I order a lot of things from Amazon but very rarely do I even bother to leave a review. If you are looking into buying Moroccon Oil/Argan Oil for you hair... you have found the best product. I put a couple squirts in my leave in conditioners and shake it up very well to use daily. I also apply a couple drops to my palms and rub together, apply to my ends before bed. It has truly transformed my hair. I went from having bleached, dried, broken hair into having people compliment me on my hair - seriously, people tell me my hair looks healthy! Never heard that before. I also apply it to my face at night when it&#x27;s feeling dry, wash off with gentle cleanser (Cetaphil) in the morning. Worth the purchase! Haven&#x27;t even put a dent in the bottle and I&#x27;ve had it for well over a month. I bought the pump bottle - it squirts a little wild, but, I think it&#x27;s probably neater than the dropper, who knows!</li>
            <li> After reading rave reviews about argan oil working wonders, I had to try it for my dry brittle frizzy hair and my dry winter chapped hands.  It works to some extent, but so does olive oil and a plethora of hair groom products and skin lotions.  I experimented with olive oil on my dry hair because the hair products I&#x27;ve tried would make my hair look good for a few hours, but later in the day would dry up and leave me with stiff hair and a flaky scalp.  My shoulders would look like I took a salt shaker to them.  Olive oil, though it wouldn&#x27;t leave me with a flaky scalp, wasn&#x27;t perfect either; it made my hair feel grimy later in the day like I needed to wash it.  But it was better then putting nothing on at all.  As for my dry winter hands, most lotions do a fine job of moisturizing, but the dryness would eventully come back.&lt;br /&gt;  Well back to argan oil.  This is my first try of argan oil so I have no comparison with Watts Argan Oil to other brands of argan oils, but I will compare it to other products I&#x27;ve used. Watts Argan Oil for my hair felt to me like using olive oil but in a more concentrated form.  A small size amount of Watts Argan oil felt the same as double the amount of olive oil in my hair.  It would moisturize ok but make my hair feel grimy.  So the way I look at it, I can get a small half litre (16.9 oz.)bottle of olive oil for about $7.  Half that bottle (8 oz/$3.50) would go the same distance as 4 oz of Watts Argan oil at $25.&lt;br /&gt;  For my dry hands, again it does a good job of moisturizing like most lotions, but left my hands oily.  I compared Watts Argan with Eucerin Original Moisturizing Lotion on my dry white flaky knees, placing the Watts and Eucerin on separate knees.  After 3 days, I can see some dryness starting to come back on both knees but both were still somewhat moisturized.  No clear winner here. But then again  you have to look at the cost factor.  I did use more Eucerin, 4x more at most, but still a 16.9 oz pump bottle of Eucerin at $10, will go as far as a 4 oz bottle of Watts at  $25.&lt;br /&gt;  Watts Argan oil will help, as with most products costing a lot less, so I was undecided whether I wanted to give it 3 stars for its ok effectiveness or 2 stars for it&#x27;s bad cost value.  Because the avg. total customer rating I think is over rated at 4 stars, I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;  Also, like some other reviewers mention,this argan oil had hardly no smell to it, so I wonder if I was getting the real mccoy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good product for skin and hair however I do not recommend it as a leave-in treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using argan oil based products for a while now and decided to try the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Products like Moroccan oil or Agadir or One n&#x27; Only are much better as leave-in treatments. They actually make your hair smoother and easier to manage/style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am not contesting the actual quality of the product I definitely do not recommend this for a hair that you want to style afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s excellent for your skin though and you can use it along with your conditioner and then rinse it off.</li>
            <li> A must for all. Great on skin and hair. Softens and smooths both. A little goes a long way and it absorbes quickly&lt;br /&gt; Will keep using this for years to come.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Watts Argan Oil. The first time I ordered the product the oil was almost scent free and light.  This second bottle has a putrid odour that smells of manure and the oil is much thicker .  Unfortunately I just opened the bottle and missed the window of return.  I will have to throw it out.</li>
            <li> Until a month ago I was using a very pricy product line (La mer) which I thought worked great for my skin. After 10 days using Argan oil (Watts), I decided to stop using my La mer moisturizing cream. I use Argan oil morning and evening. I give the oil 10 minutes to penetrate in the morning then I put my make up on (the full monty: foundation, blush, powder...) and my skin looks healthy and elastic all day (I am 50).&lt;br /&gt;I do not plan in using anything else from now on. Now I am trying it on my hair about twice a week and on my nails every evening. I am curious to see if the effect will be as impressive as for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am african american and have naturally curly 3b-c hair. I have only purchased argan oil from Watts Beauty so I have nothing to compare it to.  I will say that I use this 1st on clean wet hair, followed by conditioner and a curling cream and then I do two-strand twists in sections all over and my hair is wonderful for at least 3 days longer if I wear the twists for a day or two before taking down.  I have never had such great hair beyond the 1st day before I began using this argan oil.  I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is a great product for the hair. I just get a small dab (just one or two pumps), rub my hands together and apply  it on the lengths and ends of my clean hair. It nourishes and  smooths my hair, controls frizz, makes my hair look and feel healthier, shinier and soft. It lasts all day long, there is no need to reapply it and has no odor at all (I bought  the natural scent version). Too much  of this product on the roots may make the hair look a bit oily. I am very very pleased with this product and definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of argan oils, I&#x27;m pretty open-minded about the cheaper ones because... they&#x27;re cheaper. Those usually run a little thinner, maybe less nutrient dense. But I just got this bottle of Watts, and it&#x27;s suspicious to me. Greasy, pale (almost clear), and it smells like lube!! It should smell nutty, and absorb much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this a mixture?? Is it just this bottle?? I&#x27;ll be emailing Watts, will update post if new info comes to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just read some other reviews about similar experience. Sounds like this product was better in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Update - I just did a test on my leg with 2 other argan oils. I put 1 drop of each on on my leg and rubbed into separate circles (with different fingers). The Watts DID NOT ABSORB. It was a greasy circle on my leg. The other two (Shea Terra Organics and Elma &amp; Sanna) absorbed within 30 seconds. Ended up wiping off Watts with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real argan oil is supposed to absorb quickly, and the whole point is that it&#x27;s not greasy. Red flag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Update #2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent me a replacement bottle this week. The new bottle is BETTER than what I got the first time, so everyone keep a pulse on what you get! This one has less smell, less greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed my rating from 1 to 2 stars. It&#x27;s still not that impressive to me... doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;arganny\\&quot; and I can&#x27;t put my finger on it. Maybe the lack of a nutty smell? Slower rate of absorption? Mostly, it seems par for the price. Not horrible, but no praises to sing compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very responsive customer service. They refunded me and also sent a new bottle. There you have it.</li>
            <li> This a must buy!  It works great and makes my hair so smooth and shiny.  I just found out about argan oil recently.  I started by trying One and Only argan oil blend, which was ok.  Watts is 100% argan oil and works so much better.  My hair looks so much better.  I have been getting lots of compliments since using.  My hair type is thick, fine and wavy.  A little of this goes a long way.  My hair is pretty long and I use only 2 pumps on damp hair.  It was trial and error to see how much I needed, used 4 pumps for example and it looked greasy. This brand you can also use on your face because it is 100% pure. You can&#x27;t beat Watt&#x27;s argan oil, the price is great, and a reliable seller.</li>
            <li> This is my second time to purchase this Argan Oil from Watts via Direct 2U.  Both experience pleasant, timely delivery and excellent packaging.  It&#x27;s sent to you by tight bubble wrapping envelope.  It comes in a dark plastic bottle. I prefer push top as opposed to the dropper.  In my opinion this product is superb!  I used to have dry, tight, problematic, itchy facial skin no matter what moisturizer I use which made applying my makeup a chore.  My son also had eczema and white patches on his skin that he&#x27;s had for years.  RX didn&#x27;t help much, it would just return soon enough.  Using argan oil, my skin has returned back to being supple and smooth.  My son no longer suffers from the skin conditions he&#x27;s had in the past.  I actually envy his baby&#x27;s bottom like skin.  I hope my experience continues to be this successful with Argan oil and future purchases.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe the product I received was in any way \\&quot;100% Pure, Raw Cold Pressed Argan Oil\\&quot;. This product was in a cheap bottle that leaked after a few uses. Also, I have used cold pressed argan oil before and it had a certain nutty smell. This had no smell which to me means that this was either refined or contained a mixture of some other oils such as jojoba. As soon as I opened it, I felt in my heart that this was not what it claimed. False advertising!! 27 dollars WASTED!! I won&#x27;t order from this company again. This was NOT pure, raw argan oil, I don&#x27;t care what anybody says!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product for oily skin.  It actually moisturizes and controls the oil on my face.  As an added bonus it decreases the amount of time drying my hair!  Wish I would have know about this product years ago.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product multiple times!  I love it!  I add a small squirt to my facial moisturizer or to my hair conditioner.  Your hair and skin absorb it so well, so there&#x27;s no greasiness afterward.  My makeup goes on so smoothly after using my Watts Argan oil.</li>
            <li> HAVE BECOME JUST ADICTED TO THIS PRODUCT.  iT DOES WONDERS FOR MY NAILS AND CUTICLES JUST OUT OF THE DROPPER. fOR FACE AND BODY, i ADD 1 OR 2 DROPS TO MOSTURIZER,  IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE!  WATTS IS AN EXCELLENT SOURCE AND I SHALL CONTINUE MOST HAPPILY TO ORDER FROM THEM.  WOULD ADVISE ANYONE, MALE OR FEMALE TO TRY IT AND SEE.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Watts Beauty Argan oil as a daily regime for over two years and I absolutely love it. I refuse to buy any other brand and constantly refer my friends to this brand. I use it as my daily face moisturizer, add it to the tips of my hair, use it for burns, healing wounds, etc- it doesn&#x27;t go on greasy or feel so once you use it. It provides a great base every day before applying my makeup and truly makes my face feel and look flawless makeup free. Honestly, one of the only &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; items I have consistently bought and cannot go a day without. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and this oil is great. a little goes a long way. I mix with conditioner and it makes my hair super soft...(african American).</li>
            <li> wonderful on the skin, not super greasy and really smoothes the skin and evens tone over time...smells good too, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> Great Product and fast shipping. This product is amazing. I could tell the result after few hours. I used it with my daily cream and lotion. I can&#x27;t wait to tell my friends and sisters. Thanks</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful for moisturizing hair, body and cuticles. Just remember a little goes a long way, and this bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li> I use to use Moroccon Oil but I thought I&#x27;d try this. Does a nice job I do miss the smell of the Morocoon Oil...but far better to have all natural! I have stopped using it because it seems to dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product in the smaller size in the past, and loved it.  It had a faint, barely there(pleasant scent).&lt;br /&gt;This time I ordered the 2 ounce bottle, thinking I was just getting more  of a good thing, and...it was a completely different in look and smell...It smells almost like raw sewage!!!!  Absolutely gross, I had to throw it away.  I am skeptical of the quality control in this company now and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love my Argan oil but after dropping not one, but two expensive glass bottles of it I knew I had to find something less expensive and in a plastic bottle. This product does everything that the more expensive brands do for a better value! This was a reorder since I was getting low from my initial order over a year ago - yes, over a year! A little goes along way!</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry due to eczema.  I add a couple drops of the oil to a lotion (Gold Bond or Curel) and then apply. It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin moist for longer than just a couple hours.  Have not had any adverse reactions since buying a couple weeks ago and plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> I use natural oil for my hair products specially before blow dry and works like charm. I have used it as face moisturizer and loved it too. I loved it so much that i bought a bigger bottle for daily use and going to keep the small bottle for my travel. I have used very expensive Moroccan oil as well. The difference I see is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging - this is light brown bottle versus dark tinted which is supposed to protect the oil from sunlight. My thoughts: It mostly stays in my bag and my closet so I am not paying premium for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel - I wish the cap was twist so that i would not easily come out and accidentally spilling the oil. I carry it in extra ziplock as precaution.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in an internet tutorial and decided to try it. I use it on my hair and it adds moisture and shine. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because my hair is pretty oily already and, because my hair is also fine, I only have to use one (1) pump of this product to get the desired result. I have not been disappointed with Watts Beauty Argan Oil. The fact that some of the money goes back to the Moroccan people was an encouraging bonus. When I finally run out, I will probably buy more from Watts.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and 100% certified organic.  I use it for cleaning my face (50/50 with Castor Oil and several drops of lavender) and also on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about the oil itself, and Watts brand is fresh and odorless, as advertised. (I ordered some from Elma &amp; Sana that really stank, might have been rancid.) The dispenser pump is much better than using the medicine dropper style most bottles have because it dispenses the perfect amount every time. I would have preferred it in a glass bottle, though, just because I try to avoid plastics when possible.</li>
            <li> This is a great and inexpensive argan oil that performs just as well as expensive argan oil - I&#x27;ve used Josie Maran before and it seems identical to this one. I use this oil as a facial moisturizer, cuticle oil, and hair treatment. It is great for all those purposes. I have oily skin so I only use this on my face at night, and usually only in the winter when my skin is especially dry. It does a good job of moisturizing the skin, but I don&#x27;t recommend using this in the morning on your face if you have oily skin because it will only make it oilier. It makes my cuticles soft and restores the look of my manicure, and does the job when my hands are too dry for coconut oil. I will apply this to the ends of my hair after showering and it makes the hair soft and shiny. I will apply a few pumps throughout my hair (you don&#x27;t need a lot, I only use that much because I have waist length hair), put my hair in a bun, and leave it to absorb for a couple days. When I wash my hair out its softness and shine is restored. Ultimately, this is a great buy if you like multitasking products or need intensive moisturizing for your skin and/or hair. Buying Josie Maran definitely isn&#x27;t necessary!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I break out from everything, not this.  I use it on hair face body. All natural, faint smell.   I hate stinky stuff and this is not at all. Won&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> i been using this for 3 years and ever since then my skin has been glowing, looks healthier, i havent worn make-up(cover-up) in years, and also cant remember having any cystic pimples either (the huge, painful ones). i still do get acne but not the cystic ones i would get all the time. i guess my skin has calmed down now using this pure oil and not any stuff that is supposed to reduce oil; when really it exacerbates the problem because then ur skin just feels it needs to make more oil, and then u just get more acne because of more oil on ur face (google: oil- cleansing method for more info).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also have been using african black soap w/ this which u can use all over ur body and i love it also. my skin is just much better. also argan oil is very good for ur hair. instead of using silicone products for dry hair or flyaways, use this, its healthier and is a very good treatment. i wish i had more money so i could try the josie maran one to see if its better, more higher-quality even though this one is great and im a satisfied customer. i hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> Great to use on face or body.  Not greasy at all.  This argan oil absorbs into your skin and leaves a healthy glow.  A 4 oz squirt bottle has lasted me over a year, so it is economical as well.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I use on my face and neck, on my body and a small amount on my hair.</li>
            <li> Notice the description says \\&quot;cold pressed\\&quot; not \\&quot;First cold pressed\\&quot;.  If it were first cold pressed you can be sure they&#x27;d let us know because that is something to brag about.  The cheaper the oil the more times the nuts have been pressed.  Watts doesn&#x27;t tell us so the question is...is their argan oil 2nd cold pressed, 3rd cold pressed, 4th cold pressed??</li>
            <li> I ordered this two days ago and it already arrived, so thumbs up there, but within 30 minutes of putting this on my cheeks I was breaking out.  My skin is pretty sensitive to start with and especially so in recent years, since I use tretinoin.  For a few months I&#x27;ve been using another brand of \\&quot;pure\\&quot; argan oil as my primary moisturizer in the morning and evening.  I took this out of the package and could see, even through the dark brown bottle, how it looked thinner and more watery.  I took off the pump and searched intently for the distinctive nutty smell that I was used to.  This is really the most teling aspect: I couldn&#x27;t smell anything at all. I tested it on my cheeks and within a few minutes they felt itchy.  The next time I got to a mirror I could see 5 little bright red dots that had not been there before.  I washed it off and put on some oil from my old bottle, no more itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed because I made sure to get a product that was labeled as \\&quot;100% pure.\\&quot;  There are tons of argan oil \\&quot;treatments\\&quot; out there, but I didn&#x27;t want something with argan oil in it, and then a bunch of silicones or preservatives, too, I wanted *only* argan oil.</li>
            <li> This is my third 4 oz bottle of this liquid gold. It&#x27;s just that good! The price of the Watt&#x27;s is very reasonable for a raw, undeodorized argan oil. I don&#x27;t have any desire to have one mixed with silicone like so many of the others out there are. If that were what I wanted I could add a few drops of this to a cheap silicone based hair serum and have the same thing for a fraction of what those other brands are charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a hair moisturizer, facial moisturizer, nails moisturizer and a treatment for minor burns and scrapes. It&#x27;s worked wonderfully for all these applications. My hair is much less dry, my skin has significantly less flaking, my nails are no longer peeling and when used on a minor burn or scrape, I notice they heal more quickly and with less scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a huge fan of extra virgin coconut oil. Which can actually help reduce protein loss in your hair. However, it&#x27;s better as pre-wash treatment for my hair, rather than an after wash light oil. Which is how I use the argan oil. I also cannot use the coconut oil on my face due to it causing me breakouts, which I never have a problem with when I use the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not touting this as a miracle product. What I am saying is it&#x27;s a great, natural product with more than one use.</li>
            <li> Started using oil of argan on my skin eight years ago, and have never again looked at manufactured moisturizer. That oil is the best you can do for your skin and hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is of good quality to me, working well as I&#x27;ve expected.  The seller has package well and easy to open also on time.</li>
            <li> my hair is thick and long and needs a lot of this but it does smooth it out. I rub it into my scalp as well</li>
            <li> The product gives incredible moisture to my face, and is quickly absorbed.  (Note that very little is needed at any one time!)  I&#x27;ve ordered this product before, and will absolutely order it again!</li>
            <li> No complaints with the product. Quality seems to be good, but we don&#x27;t know enough about how it&#x27;s actually working. Only con so far is the price. Argan oil is quite expensive!</li>
            <li> It came right on time. Exactly the date that the seller estimated. It was packaged well with bubble wrap, but the bottle itself was not sealed. I wonder why there was no seal at the top or anything. Hmmm? Well, it&#x27;s my first time to try argan oil and went with this seller because of the price and how it was described. So far, I&#x27;ve tried a little bit of it so it&#x27;s too early to say about any results. So far it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> It was the only &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; non perfume added argon oil i could find, its not cheap, (especially when u need it for pouring on your bulldog everyday to help her dry skin that isn&#x27;t helped by her head butting open the bathroom door and jumping in the tub/shower every single time someone is bathing) gotta order another bottle already,  then purest thing i could find prior to this was just as much $$ and mixed with mineral oil, which actually clogs pores and stops the skin from absorbing the Moroccan oil, the good stuff.</li>
            <li> This argan nut oil is the real deal. It feels great on my hair and hands. It doesn&#x27;t burn when I touch my eyes accidentally. The smell is faint and pleasant-not overpowering!</li>
            <li> I have the worst dry skin on the planet. I use oils on my face because creams don&#x27;t work and they irritate my skin. This oil works very good though the quality isn&#x27;t as good as Jose Maran, it is much more economical. I do mix with jojoba oil or almond oil sometimes but overall it is a good oil.</li>
            <li> Update: very easy return and didn&#x27;t have to pay postage which I believe is very responsible, and may be an Amazon thing. IDK. Otherwise, no hassle :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try a different brand for comparison. I don&#x27;t know what this stuff is but it is not argon oil. Smells different, thin, doesn&#x27;t absorb at all. Will continue my prior better brand ***. Tired of being ripped off. Ridiculous. Can&#x27;t use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product for any skin, but great for aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Watts for years I love delivered right to your door.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous. I have been reading reviews about people who have been using argan oil on their skin for a few months now, and I found out about Watts from a beauty forum. I ordered the 4 oz pump bottle and it arrived one day before it was scheduled to arrive, so I was pretty darn excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the drier months, I suffer from patches of dry skin on my face and my hands get very dry as well. Just a tiny amount of this product, and the dry patches are gone. I have not had any problems with clogged pores or reactions, the small patches of acne that I had prior to using this product are actually diminishing in size and aren&#x27;t as red and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any beauty product, consistent use is key. I hope that with the passage of time comes more fabulous looking skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mogador and the Pura dor.  I paid significantly more for both and was very happy with both of them.  But, I use argan oil on my whole body so I tend to use it up fast and wanted something more economical...so I tried Watts.  I have been very happy with it as well.  Bottom line:  buy the least expensive 100% certified argan oil.  So, far they have all worked great (just make sure they are 100%...I saw lots of products that called themselves argan oil but had additives in them)</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of oil products because I have quite unmanageable hair. I&#x27;ve bought expensive oils from hair salons and cheap oils from the discount grocery store... This is the BEST product I have ever used, the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it, and I won&#x27;t use anything else. My hair is thin, baby fine and curly - the big three of lousy, terrible to style hair. This oil gives my hair a shine without being heavy. It styles well and looks so much healthier. And as an added bonus, after I run it through my hair, I rub the remainder on my elbows. They&#x27;re soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Morrocan Oil before with good results. It really helped with the dryness, thinness and split ends I had as a result of years of countless color treatments. I decided to give the WattsBeauty Argan Gold 100% Certified Pure Argan Nut Oil a try... After the first squirt, I became very skeptical about this product, even more after applying it on my legs. I could not use it on my face arms or hair just because the smell of it reminded me of lubricant oil, yes lube! Besides that little detail, it does not absorb quickly unlike other pure oils. I use 100% Pure organic Almond on my sking after showering and let me tell you, that stuff works a lot better that this watts oil.  With that said, I&#x27;m not sure what the quality or content of this bottle is?? I used about almost half of the bottle (on my legs) for about a week, I did not notice anything different on my skin and Im so glad to go back to my beloved almond oil.  I won&#x27;t give up on the argan oil because I know it works. I will be seraching for the right brand.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the Elma&amp;Sana Golden Argan Oil, I will post my review in the next week or so.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the other reviewers posts about the high quality of this product.  I was not impressed.  Other brands offer a more fragrant oil that, when used on the skin, seems more potent.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 4oz pump bottle of Watts in Nov. 2011 and ran out of it a few months ago. It remained odorless (no rancidity) the entire time I used it. Still, I decided to try a different source for raw cold-pressed argan, because every other variety of raw, cold-pressed oil I&#x27;ve purchased has some characteristic scent and color while this had none. My eyes and nose have been opened. There is no comparison between Watts odorless argan and my recent purchase which has the most naturally wonderful nutty-sweet scent. I am left to wonder exactly what Watts is selling - and always wondered how the product could be raw, cold pressed and yet contain no hint of the qualities of the nut so evident in the product I now have. I purchased from a highly respected herb source in the NW U.S. The two products are priced the same, though I paid for shipping this time - a small price for the quality. It&#x27;s lovely on the skin and smells so good that I&#x27;m tempted to taste it. There&#x27;s no going back to Watts.</li>
            <li> Good quality, odorless, high qualty oil. I really do use it every time that I wash my hair. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> My hair and skin did not feel softer. I put this oil in all my moisturising products and didnt notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the large bottle of this oil. I started using a much more costly  brand 3 years ago and loved it. My skin looks so radiant, pores reduced and people comment on it. I find my hair is too fine to use argan oil on it. I use it on my face , neck and chest. I also use makeup that has argan and hair products too. I know I could add this oil to any beauty product but it just happens the hair brand that works for me has argan in it as does the makeup. This oil is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried and the price is super. I love the pump top as it was a pain to use a dropper when fresh out of the shower and hands have lotion on my hands. Now I can share with hubby and he might just use it if he doesn&#x27;t have to unscrew the lid! Small bottles last me 6 months, this big one could last well over a year.</li>
            <li> Awesome and great quality compared to more expensive named brands.</li>
            <li> my skin loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;yeah, sometimes it sprays around, but so what, it&#x27;s yummy to my skin.</li>
            <li> I normally like this oil and have ordered it a number of times however, this bottle went rancid.  There are other reviews that claim the quality has gone down, and I have to agree.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product (close to a year now), I was told by many that I look much younger and my pimples are gone. My face is clear like a baby! Thank you for maintaining the integrity of your product!</li>
            <li> Nice feeling on the skin. After I shower,I apply the oil on my face and sometimes on my body. I have notice a smoothness to my face. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My makeup doesn&#x27;t go on right if I don&#x27;t use it.  Makes a big different.  I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> i just love this product received it as a gift 8 monthes ago i put some in my shampoo(it is a all oil base shampoo to start with)but the argan oil makes it even better,i&#x27;ve narural curly hair that use to be very dry and frizzy now it&#x27;s soft and happy. and i use it on my face leaves it feeling sooooooooooo soft for hours works well with watts mineral make-up too.i use to get ache from store face creams alot,not now the oil has improved the look of my skin, the packaging of this producted is not cheap cold-pressed oil should be kept in a brown or colored glass bottle to protect it from light especially from sunlight and a dropper is much easier to use.love this oil so i order more and will continue to do so.5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used argan oil for the past 7 months and wanted to try one that was less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;100% cold pressed argan oil should have a yellowishy cloudy colour to it and a smell that&#x27;s kind of nutty or a little rubbery.  It&#x27;s also supposed to absorb within a few minutes (2 minutes in my experience) of application and leave no residual smell.  According to what I&#x27;ve read online, it should also come in a brown glass bottle so that it&#x27;s preserved properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil I purchased from Watt&#x27;s is a clear liquid that looks suspiciously like mineral oil.  It smells a little like grass, which I don&#x27;t mind, but that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s supposed to smell.  It also doesn&#x27;t spread like the other Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried (Josie Maran, Saadia).  The bottle it comes in is brown, but plastic, so I will need to be careful so that it doesn&#x27;t get easily contaminated.  My guess is that there is argan oil in it, but it&#x27;s been cut with some cheaper stuff to save money, which quite frankly should&#x27;ve given it away for me by the price (I bought the 2 x 2 oz pumps for $24.95).  I spread this on my hands 10 minutes ago and there is still some residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it a second star is bc I put this on my friend&#x27;s baby&#x27;s rash last night and by morning it was much improved, although we&#x27;ll have to see what happens in the next few days to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will email the company to see if it is indeed mineral oil, and where that comes from.  Could be baby oil, could be the one that&#x27;s derived from petroleum and therefore carcinogenic. Either way, spend the extra money for the real thing.  After what I&#x27;ve read on how much work it takes to produce one litre, it&#x27;s hard to believe that it can be this cheap without having added something.  I&#x27;ll be going back to my expensive, but real, stuff.</li>
            <li> I recently order this product for the third time. It works very well moisturizing my skin. I apply it alone to my face and neck at night time. In the morning, it goes under a day cream with SPF.</li>
            <li> Not sure product was any good. Oily and but saw no actual results as to what the product promises to do</li>
            <li> I have purchased argan oil from Watts for over a year now.  I find it so nourishing to my skin.  I love the fact that Watts is also affordable.  I do not need to pay for fancy packaging and advertisement.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Better than previously used product without the added dyes/preservatives, etc..&lt;br /&gt;Better than anticipated. Would recommend it, no more frizzy hair days.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz down,  not to oily, I also use it on my neck and hands. Helps with dryness in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I have battled with my extremely oily skin all my life.  Powders, blotting papers and drying products have done nothing to curb my midday sheen.  Enter Watts Argan oil - it seemed counterintuitive to add oil to combat oil but it has done  the trick.  My skin looks amazing amazing now that I have been using this morning and night under my makeup.  I am hooked for life!</li>
            <li> I like the way Watts Argan oil feels and smells. The fact that it is raw and organic appeals to me. The bottle it comes in is easy to use without wasting the oil.  It has made my hair and skin more attractive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it can be used in many different ways, but my hair drinks this oil up and feels very healthy as a result. I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks now, so I&#x27;m so so excited to see the long-term difference. Quality oil, great price, thank you!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me; and because I like it so much for use with my problem hair, I have happily recommended it to others, who like the person who recommended it to me also uses it on their skin.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about this product not being the same. I agree it&#x27;s slightly different than the last bottle I ordered here, but it works just the same. The smell is just a little less nutty. Still love it! Bought a big bottle this time.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used argan oil for your hair... you haven&#x27;t used the best product for hair every made.  One drop a day rubbed into your scalp and you will see a drastic  difference in the health of your hair, and this price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different brands of Argan oil and this is one of the best. Very light but still rich. Gives hair a great shine.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hair and face. It gives my hair more body without making it look greasy. Every morning I apply two squirts of this oil to my hands and rub it on my face. Then, I apply a dab of sunscreen, and I&#x27;m ready for eye makeup and maybe a light powder to finish. This is my second bottle, but it lasts a long time. I will buy again when this one runs out.</li>
