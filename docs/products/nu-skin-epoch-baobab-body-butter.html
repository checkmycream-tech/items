            <li> You&#x27;ll not believe how soft your hands will feel.</li>
            <li> I know that we all have different skin, so this product may not be for you, but I have never had another body butter, lotion, cream, etc. make my skin feel as wonderful as this does. I have dryish body skin and after 2-3 days of application, this body butter makes my skin feel so soft, smooth and yummy. I think it&#x27;s on the expensive side for how much you get, so I don&#x27;t use it everyday. But I do for sure when I&#x27;m leading up to a special occasion. I would highly recommend it for the results you get!</li>
            <li> Great Product, I have been using this product for a long time, I bought it from another company, but could only get it by being on an automatic shipping program. I decided to check Amazon to see if they had it, and they did, and I&#x27;m not forced to buy it when I don&#x27;t want it. This product keeps my skin moist and prevents it from drying out. It is really a great product, I recommend it to everyone, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but worth every penny.  Skin feels soft and silky after use.</li>
            <li> The best body cream.  Stays on your skin.  LOVE IT!!</li>

            <li> Love this body cream.  Use on both legs and feet which for dry skin.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Nice lotion.  Originally purchased at a salon but found it here for a much better price.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this body butter. Softens and hydrates skin, long lasting, great scent. I first saw and purchased this body butter when I was getting a pedicure at a local korean shop/nail salon. I fell in love with the way it made my skin feel and look, so I just had to have it...even though it was overpriced at a whopping $35 for this 4.4 oz jar. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here for such a great price! Will definitely be purchasing my body butters here from this day forth.</li>
            <li> Product is great for dry and chapped skin on legs, arms, and feet. It only takes a small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Product works very well! It feels good and is lightweight. Smells very good as well. Love it! That is it.</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing non-greasy butter! It just takes a very small amount to make my skin glow!  I am happy I tried this!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Makes my skin feel so soft and it smells soft not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves this stuff.She said this is the best cream she has found for her skin type.</li>
            <li> This body butter is amazing!</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my first pregnancy and after.  I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks until my 9th month, and 4 months later they are definitely lighter than before.  Not sure if it&#x27;s because of this cream or not, but I love the way it feels and smells.</li>
            <li> I use along with the Liquid Body Lufra and it moisturizes so good. You must buy both for the harsh winter months!</li>
            <li> Very highly perfumed and scent won&#x27;t wash off. Gave me a whopper headache.</li>
            <li> Good produc , fast shipping excellent thankyou</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  For any skin type!</li>
            <li> Use a a moisture for my legs and arms.  I like it, and will be on my 3rd container.</li>
            <li> I love the light and soft smell.  IT also goes on smooth and makes  your skin so soft and smooth. I have very dry skin and this body butter works great</li>
            <li> Feels great on your skin</li>
            <li> Love the results I received.</li>
            <li> this is the creamiest, richest cream I&#x27;ve ever used that does not feel greasy.  It feels wonderful and stays on skin for a long time.  My pedicurist used it on my feet and legs and they stayed soft for days. I&#x27;ve also heard it is a good natural insect repellant.  Love it!  Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Have used this for more than a year and really like it</li>
            <li> LOVE this cream! Goes on easily and does not feel sticky at all. There are no ingredients in it that react with my skin to cause darkness around rings, etc. A little expensive  but well worth it!</li>
            <li> smells soooooo good...the ingredients..well...maybe not the most natural but it feels and smells great</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin feel very soft and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Not only does it smells goods, it&#x27;s not greasy but it provides moisture to the body.</li>
            <li> Best body butter EVER! Very creamy, not greasy at all. Rubs in easily, leaving skin as soft as can be. Pleasent, but not overpowering scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, I received this in a sweepstakes win and loved it so much had to buy it when I ran out.</li>
            <li> By skin epoch baobab body butter is working great. I would refer it to someone if I get</li>
            <li> I like the lotion, just wish it was a bit thicker. Overall it is good.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in bigger tubs, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! As described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time at a local nail shop they were selling it for $30. They gave me a little bit to try and I fell in love! I logged in to amazon and was excited to see they had it and for half the price! It works and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This was worth $20, nail salon charges $10 for just one application.  It almost feels like cashmere.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this, but my skin is always so thirsty, I&#x27;m constantly searching for a nice smelling, non greasy lotion. This body butter has it all! It has a light, sweet smell (not overpowering!), is thick and creamy (but isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy on your skin!) and is super hydrating! It absorbed quickly and when I applied it my skin immediately looked better. I&#x27;m sold &amp; will purchase more Nu Skin products in the future :)</li>
