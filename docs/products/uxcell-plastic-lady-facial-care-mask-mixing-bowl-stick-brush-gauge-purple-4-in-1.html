            <li>Cheap plastic set,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to wait a month for something that is that cheap.</li>
            <li>But, doesn&#x27;t seem cheap or anything.  </li>

            <li>Great  price for a cute little mask set!</li>
            <li>Spatula is also great for mixing the ingredients for your mask easily without making a mess.  </li>
            <li>I was Ã¼ber excited about the price but the quality wasn&#x27;t as great as other reviewers had mentioned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for 1 or 2 people.</li>
            <li>I can easily blend and apply mask thanks to this set.</li>
            <li>This little bowl is great.  </li>
            <li>I think this little kit is great in serving its purpose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was looking for a cheap little kit to go with some facial products I bought, and was impressed by the quality of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging</li>
            <li>It took a while to receive, but was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>And to be fair, it should&#x27;ve been expected on my part because i knew it was plastic when i bought it.  </li>
            <li>Equipment comes in handy for facial.</li>
            <li>Assumed these were for adult use, seemed more for girls&#x27; play.</li>
            <li>The brush and bowl are super small, but as a gift for a couple young ladies in my family, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>The set is very easy to clean and dry.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good kit.</li>
            <li>The brush was broke right out of the package.</li>
            <li>It went right in the trash.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>That is how insignificant this product was when I saw it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>have ordered more of these to do a girls&#x27; night facial party!</li>
            <li>Exactly as disc rinsed.</li>
            <li>Exact value for the money paid.</li>
            <li>Exactly what is pictured.</li>
            <li>Although the brush is completely useless, everything else was wonderful</li>
            <li>Woulda liked it in the purple, but whatever, pink works too.</li>
            <li>The brush broke on the first day of use .</li>
            <li>Although it was a tad smaller than expected, I agree with others who say its great for Aztec clay masks.  </li>
            <li>Nice little device and just the right size.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very small but perfect for mixing hair or facial potions...as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only notable since the seller sent it in a soft mailer, which may have permanently indented the bowl in very, very</li>
            <li>This is a handy little set, but it has gotten scratched up and discolored in the scatch marks from mixing mud masks.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great little set.</li>
            <li>I think this little set is great for mixing up facial masks at home.</li>
            <li>- but then again do you really need directions to use this?  </li>
            <li>The brush part started to come off the handle all ready.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints on this product, better quality than expected for the money.</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well</li>
            <li>I wanted my 16 year old to become more independent with her skincare.</li>
            <li>this is a super cute little set if you like doing masks at home (which you should!).  </li>
            <li>The measuring spoons make it easy to measure out my portions and the cup is just large enough to make enough mixture for my face and across the top of my back.</li>
            <li>Does look pretty cheaply made and is pretty small, but it&#x27;s the right size for what I&#x27;m gonna use it for</li>
            <li>The bowl is quiet small, but it&#x27;s just perfect for me to put enough amount of masks, won&#x27;t waste any :)</li>
            <li>I was so excited when this arrived that I tried it out immediately with a new clay mask I purchased at the same time.</li>
            <li>Although the product is good, I ordered a purple yet it came as pink but looks tinier than what picture is expected to be.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The mixer is perfect for the Aztec clay mask, which can be a little hard to mix, and I&#x27;m just pleased as punch with this little purchase!</li>
            <li>The brush is amazing for applying thick masks.</li>
            <li>The quality is pretty good like the expensive paint brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, but enough for mask and good for storage.</li>
            <li>This gets the job done and is a cute little set!</li>
            <li>However, the vendor was very clear with the shipping expectations.  </li>
            <li>Small measurement and cute.</li>
            <li>Worth the LONG delivery.   </li>
            <li>Pretty good set, the bowl is small &amp; not very deep, but it works for using products such as Aztec Indian Healing Clay which I purchased around the same time.</li>
            <li>its held up this far with all the at home scrubs and facials i do.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t visualize it being THAT tiny!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, says firmly in your hand while you whip up your clay or whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is very cheap and after the first time using it, it won&#x27;t be long till it is no good.</li>
            <li>cause first of all, theyre too big and second</li>
            <li>/&gt;The little measuring cups are made from regular cheap plastic material but</li>
            <li>but mine was just white with a clear handle.</li>
            <li>The bowl and measuring spoons are handy but the brush and spachula are useless.</li>
            <li>It is very small and extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li>The bowl is SUPER small, but I have realized that you need a smaller bowl to perform facials...</li>
            <li>Before I found out about this little gem, I bought similar components separately at the Dollar store and spent more for less.</li>
            <li>Bowl is much smaller than I expected but other than that it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Decent price too!..the only down side is the brush part.</li>

            <li> And to be fair, it should&#x27;ve been expected on my part because i knew it was plastic when i bought it.  </li>
            <li> Equipment comes in handy for facial.</li>
            <li> Assumed these were for adult use, seemed more for girls&#x27; play.</li>
            <li> The brush and bowl are super small, but as a gift for a couple young ladies in my family, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> The set is very easy to clean and dry.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a good kit.</li>
            <li> The brush was broke right out of the package.</li>
            <li> It went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> That is how insignificant this product was when I saw it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> have ordered more of these to do a girls&#x27; night facial party!</li>
            <li> Exactly as disc rinsed.</li>
            <li> Exact value for the money paid.</li>
            <li> Exactly what is pictured.</li>
            <li> Although the brush is completely useless, everything else was wonderful</li>
            <li> Woulda liked it in the purple, but whatever, pink works too.</li>
            <li> The brush broke on the first day of use .</li>
            <li> Although it was a tad smaller than expected, I agree with others who say its great for Aztec clay masks.  </li>
            <li> Nice little device and just the right size.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small but perfect for mixing hair or facial potions...as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only notable since the seller sent it in a soft mailer, which may have permanently indented the bowl in very, very</li>
            <li> This is a handy little set, but it has gotten scratched up and discolored in the scatch marks from mixing mud masks.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great little set.</li>
            <li> I think this little set is great for mixing up facial masks at home.</li>
            <li> - but then again do you really need directions to use this?  </li>
            <li> The brush part started to come off the handle all ready.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints on this product, better quality than expected for the money.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well</li>
            <li> I wanted my 16 year old to become more independent with her skincare.</li>
            <li> this is a super cute little set if you like doing masks at home (which you should!).  </li>
            <li> The measuring spoons make it easy to measure out my portions and the cup is just large enough to make enough mixture for my face and across the top of my back.</li>
            <li> Does look pretty cheaply made and is pretty small, but it&#x27;s the right size for what I&#x27;m gonna use it for</li>
            <li> The bowl is quiet small, but it&#x27;s just perfect for me to put enough amount of masks, won&#x27;t waste any :)</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this arrived that I tried it out immediately with a new clay mask I purchased at the same time.</li>
            <li> Although the product is good, I ordered a purple yet it came as pink but looks tinier than what picture is expected to be.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The mixer is perfect for the Aztec clay mask, which can be a little hard to mix, and I&#x27;m just pleased as punch with this little purchase!</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing for applying thick masks.</li>
            <li> The quality is pretty good like the expensive paint brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, but enough for mask and good for storage.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done and is a cute little set!</li>
            <li> However, the vendor was very clear with the shipping expectations.  </li>
            <li> Small measurement and cute.</li>
            <li> Worth the LONG delivery.   </li>
            <li> Pretty good set, the bowl is small &amp; not very deep, but it works for using products such as Aztec Indian Healing Clay which I purchased around the same time.</li>
            <li> its held up this far with all the at home scrubs and facials i do.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t visualize it being THAT tiny!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, says firmly in your hand while you whip up your clay or whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is very cheap and after the first time using it, it won&#x27;t be long till it is no good.</li>
            <li> cause first of all, theyre too big and second</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little measuring cups are made from regular cheap plastic material but</li>
            <li> but mine was just white with a clear handle.</li>
            <li> The bowl and measuring spoons are handy but the brush and spachula are useless.</li>
            <li> It is very small and extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li> The bowl is SUPER small, but I have realized that you need a smaller bowl to perform facials...</li>
            <li> Before I found out about this little gem, I bought similar components separately at the Dollar store and spent more for less.</li>
            <li> Bowl is much smaller than I expected but other than that it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Decent price too!..the only down side is the brush part.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 stars is that the shipping is 3 weeks long</li>
            <li> This is a small set, I think the picture made it look big, so don&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not professional  </li>
            <li> I see a lot of complaints about the size but my goodness how big do you need it to mix up a little facial?</li>
            <li> Only down size is the brush, I wish it were fan styled.</li>
            <li> A little smaller.</li>
            <li> Strangely enough, I didn&#x27;t get the purple spoon showed in the picture, just the 3 little ones and the brush.</li>
            <li> It arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I got this in pink and the picture showed a brush with pink at the end</li>
            <li> I was expecting the bowl to be of a harder plastic.</li>
            <li> The measuring spoons, bowl, and stirrer work as expected, but the brush broke as soon as I swiped it across my face.</li>
            <li> The quality is that of a dollar store item, which is to be expected at this price point.  </li>
            <li> was Pink.</li>
            <li> bowl is very small, soft and flexible.  </li>
            <li> Shipping took FOREVER for such a small item...  UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> All I&#x27;d like to say is , although it shipped as promised, I was anxious and hoped it would come earlier.</li>
            <li> Mixing stick is a little difficult to use, but for the price, not a bad little kit.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I ordered the purple set but received the orange bowl and spoon.</li>
            <li> I use the little bowl for everything.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate all the little utensils it comes with.</li>
            <li> looks just a little girl toy...</li>
            <li> , i didnt want to mix clay mask with everyday food.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch or waste plastic bags for mixing their clay.</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the quality... for a few bucks what can you expect?</li>
            <li> I also use the small gauge for cooking.</li>
            <li> -small- way that doesn&#x27;t affect function but does affect the look somewhat.</li>
            <li> perfectly small mixing bowl....</li>
            <li> REALLY small.  </li>
            <li> I expected bigger bowls and was disappointed those bowls were kid stuff  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand negative reviewers.</li>
            <li> Prepare for slow shipping</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Pretty good set, the bowl is small &amp; not very deep, but it works for using products such as Aztec Indian Healing Clay which I purchased around the same time. This set had free shipping so it didn&#x27;t show up for about a month though...</li>
            <li> Small measurement and cute. It&#x27;s good enough for 1 or 2 people. I use it often to DIY my own mask. I used the brush once and it&#x27;s easy to use and clean. The quality is pretty good like the expensive paint brush. I also use the small gauge for cooking. It works well.</li>
            <li> I use it to measure my clay mask. I can easily blend and apply mask thanks to this set.</li>
            <li> Just right brush is good quality</li>
            <li> This is a small set, I think the picture made it look big, so don&#x27;t be surprised. It&#x27;s very small but perfect for mixing hair or facial potions...as it&#x27;s advertised. Lots of chemicals react to aluminum and call for plastic, this will be a great choice!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for... Except... A little smaller.</li>
            <li> Comes with everything it says it does! I use the little bowl for everything. It&#x27;s really a perfect little bowl for my masks and I appreciate all the little utensils it comes with.</li>
            <li> Smart ideal for using my Indian Healing Clay in. Good quality and very Innovated.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Pretty small. I&#x27;ve used it to make clay masks and it works well.</li>
            <li> This actually looks like a doll set.  It is very small and extremely cheap.  In fact, I don&#x27;t even remember where I put it in my home.  That is how insignificant this product was when I saw it for the first time.  But, this is a case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> love it comes handy to mix my oils great buy</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> Planning to buy another one</li>
            <li> The bowl and measuring spoons are handy but the brush and spachula are useless. The brush was broke right out of the package. It went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> very cheap but good for kids spa parties!</li>
            <li> No complaints! This set is easy to use, easy to clean, etc. I use it to mix my Aztec Clay mask.</li>
            <li> This little bowl is great.  It is perfect to use when applying facial masks.  The spoons, spatula and brush are perfect for your facial needs.  The bowl is made of plastic/rubber so it is pliable.</li>
            <li> This is such a great little set.If you make your own facials/masks at home, you need this!  The brush is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used for masks (when blew me away for the price). The bowl is big enough to mix up enough for 3 masks. And it is really nice to have a dedicated set of measuring spoons for my clays, rather than borrowing my kitchen ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: Delivery time on this was about a month (as the estimate said). So if you need it in a hurry, this may not be the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered more of these to do a girls&#x27; night facial party!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly as disc rinsed. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> I was Ã¼ber excited about the price but the quality wasn&#x27;t as great as other reviewers had mentioned. pro tip- when using with Aztec Clay mask be sure to clean it right after use!</li>
            <li> This is good product to use if you make a lot of face masks. The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 stars is that the shipping is 3 weeks long and it takes forever to receive it...But otherwise the product is great itself, it has the measuring spoons which comes in handy when you measure your clay/powder, the mixing spatula and the brush is OK too to apply your mask. I have 2 of these products one for me and one for my daughter which we enjoy it a lot.</li>
            <li> Bought this for an easy measurements for a clay mask, didnt want to use my measuring cups, cause first of all, theyre too big and second, i didnt want to mix clay mask with everyday food. It does its job...damn well! Decent price too!..the only down side is the brush part. its coming off after quite some uses. but nothing super glue cant fix!! Had this for about 5 months!</li>
            <li> Value for money. Came in a nice package. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I think that the size is perfect for applying your masks on.  The measuring spoons are sturdy; perfect for measuring your powders in the bowl.  The brush is perfect for applying your mask and does not feel cheap and washes out very well and the bristles have not fallen apart after washing.  Spatula is also great for mixing the ingredients for your mask easily without making a mess.  Overall, I was happy with purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It arrived quicker than expected. Exact value for the money paid.</li>
            <li> Cheap-ish product, but also a cheap cost. I use it to mix my Aztec Miracle Healing Clay. The measuring spoons make it easy to measure out my portions and the cup is just large enough to make enough mixture for my face and across the top of my back. Cleans out easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a fancy bowl or set, and it&#x27;s not meant to be. I would recommend this for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch or waste plastic bags for mixing their clay.</li>
            <li> This is fine for mixing diy face mask but the bowl is the size of the palm of my hand. I got this in pink and the picture showed a brush with pink at the end but mine was just white with a clear handle. The spoon is not a spoon it&#x27;s just a stick Over all it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic set, but I don&#x27;t need anything fancy to mix a face mask. It took over a month to arrive from China though, I didn&#x27;t realize that before I purchased or I never would have. I don&#x27;t need to wait a month for something that is that cheap.</li>
            <li> The brush and bowl are super small, but as a gift for a couple young ladies in my family, it&#x27;s perfect. I would even use myself. It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I expected bigger bowls and was disappointed those bowls were kid stuff  that&#x27;s not professional  mixing bowls&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I&#x27;m ok</li>
            <li> I was expecting the bowl to be of a harder plastic. It&#x27;s only notable since the seller sent it in a soft mailer, which may have permanently indented the bowl in very, very -small- way that doesn&#x27;t affect function but does affect the look somewhat.</li>
            <li> Although it was a tad smaller than expected, I agree with others who say its great for Aztec clay masks.  Before I found out about this little gem, I bought similar components separately at the Dollar store and spent more for less. The best thing I found out is that this set is very easy to clean and store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, if you prefer to do your own facials (as I do) this set is an inexpensive must have!</li>
            <li> I wish the bowl was bigger though. Strangely enough, I didn&#x27;t get the purple spoon showed in the picture, just the 3 little ones and the brush. The brush is amazing for applying thick masks.</li>
            <li> Perfect size n all accessories are good. Exactly what is pictured.</li>
            <li> perfectly small mixing bowl....its held up this far with all the at home scrubs and facials i do. i would recommend it. Its just the perfect size for at home use. the cup fits in the palm of my hands.</li>
            <li> Although the product is good, I ordered a purple yet it came as pink but looks tinier than what picture is expected to be. Overall I still use it every week for my facials</li>
            <li> Nice little device and just the right size.  I use it for masks and highlighting hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, but enough for mask and good for storage. I like the brush, it&#x27;s very soft and easy to use. Love the set.</li>
            <li> this is a super cute little set if you like doing masks at home (which you should!).  it functions perfectly, and well, what else can one say about such a thing?</li>
            <li> Wonderful item! It took a while to receive, but was worth the wait.  I used this for my Aztec clay mask and the brush was perfect. Each item cleaned up well, with no residue or odor remaining.  I would purchase from this seller again in the future</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect, I loved it. Only down size is the brush, I wish it were fan styled. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good kit.</li>
            <li> This is the most perfect little set and finally all of my kitchen ramekins can stay in the kitchen where they belong!  The mixer is perfect for the Aztec clay mask, which can be a little hard to mix, and I&#x27;m just pleased as punch with this little purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a handy little set, but it has gotten scratched up and discolored in the scatch marks from mixing mud masks.  And to be fair, it should&#x27;ve been expected on my part because i knew it was plastic when i bought it.  Would be nice if the bowl was glass or made of something scratch resistant.</li>
            <li> very cheap, even for $2</li>
            <li> Prepare for slow shipping but you can&#x27;t beat the price! Some people complain about the quality... for a few bucks what can you expect? I think this little set is great for mixing up facial masks at home.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this arrived that I tried it out immediately with a new clay mask I purchased at the same time. The measuring spoons, bowl, and stirrer work as expected, but the brush broke as soon as I swiped it across my face. What a bummer!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> I think this little kit is great in serving its purpose. It&#x27;s sturdier than I thought it would be and the size is perfect for the use that I need. Definitely a must-have if working with facial clays and masks.</li>
            <li> Everything I need to mix my facial mask.  Just perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect addition to my Indian Healing Clay.  I was using a plate and hair color applicator brush to apply my mask.  This is so much better.  I use every last item from the mixing tool to mix my clay up to the applicator brush to the measuring spoons.</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixing ingredients to do a facial. Easy to clean and cute. Great price for everything your getting and it is sturdy.</li>
            <li> Great set for DIY masks! Although the brush is completely useless, everything else was wonderful</li>
            <li> Equipment comes in handy for facial.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of complaints about the size but my goodness how big do you need it to mix up a little facial? Lol. Yes it is smaller than I thought but it&#x27;s perfect! Haven&#x27;t used the brush yet because I already had one but the rest is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute. The bowl is quiet small, but it&#x27;s just perfect for me to put enough amount of masks, won&#x27;t waste any :)</li>
            <li> I wanted my 16 year old to become more independent with her skincare. She now has the tools to mix that mask with accuracy.</li>
            <li> Love this. Very useful. A must-have.</li>
            <li> Mixing stick is a little difficult to use, but for the price, not a bad little kit.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t visualize it being THAT tiny!!</li>
            <li> Very good deal! Brush is kinda cheap but still gets a nice thin/med coat applied. Perfect size for mixing your own face masks!</li>
            <li> Assumed these were for adult use, seemed more for girls&#x27; play. Size and quality could have been better.</li>
            <li> Brush had fallen apart, mixer spatula was bent.</li>
            <li> The quality is that of a dollar store item, which is to be expected at this price point.  It serves its purpose and is the perfect size for an at home mud mask.  Be prepared for the color to be a surprise; I ordered purple but received blue.</li>
            <li> REALLY small.  But, doesn&#x27;t seem cheap or anything.  Seems durable, but will give update once I use brush. Shipping took FOREVER for such a small item...  UPDATE:  Now a 5-star product to me after use.  The bowl is SUPER small, but I have realized that you need a smaller bowl to perform facials...this helps you with not wasting any product.  It is perfect really...I love it...Worth the LONG delivery.   If you need something like this, then try this!! It really is perfect! And, the brush is holding up nicely as well!</li>
            <li> When I received this item, it wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting - it was better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is very small, soft and flexible.  It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, says firmly in your hand while you whip up your clay or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;The little measuring cups are made from regular cheap plastic material but they go good with the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a cheap little kit to go with some facial products I bought, and was impressed by the quality of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging wasn&#x27;t in English (Japanese maybe?) - but then again do you really need directions to use this?  I think not.</li>
            <li> Not good!It is not value!you should it buy!</li>
            <li> Bowl is much smaller than I expected but other than that it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for what I bought it for: measures, mixes well and the brush work wonderfully applying my facial masks. The set is very easy to clean and dry. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a nice size for what I wanted it for. The brush is very cheap and after the first time using it, it won&#x27;t be long till it is no good. The brush part started to come off the handle all ready. Also I did order a purple and the color I got was Pink. I do not recommend this at all. Go to your craft store for your brush.</li>
            <li> Great  price for a cute little mask set!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I ordered the purple set but received the orange bowl and spoon.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> It took a while to receiveâ¦almost 3 weeks.  However, the vendor was very clear with the shipping expectations.  For the price and quality, I can&#x27;t complainâ¦.I use this daily nowâ¦.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints on this product, better quality than expected for the money. All I&#x27;d like to say is , although it shipped as promised, I was anxious and hoped it would come earlier.</li>
            <li> cute lil set does it purpose well</li>
            <li> Works fine to use with my clay mask and makes it easy to mix, measure and clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for the bathroom cabinet. I like the idea that it comes with a measuring spoon. I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Does what it needs to! It&#x27;s the perfect size for combining my facial mask ingredients. I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured. I don&#x27;t understand negative reviewers. What are you expecting when you pay such a low price? This gets the job done and is a cute little set!</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well</li>
            <li> Woulda liked it in the purple, but whatever, pink works too. Does look pretty cheaply made and is pretty small, but it&#x27;s the right size for what I&#x27;m gonna use it for so I can&#x27;t complain. Got what I paid for, but I&#x27;m not dissatisfied by any means. There&#x27;s just different lighting between the pictures, but I wanted to do sort of a comparison for size.</li>
            <li> Does the job well and it&#x27;s only for masks</li>
            <li> The brush broke on the first day of use .</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister, it makes mixing your own clay masques very easy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not purple and it&#x27;s simple plastic like a kids toy! Don&#x27;t buy this also it took a month to get to me..</li>
            <li> looks just a little girl toy... I do not recommend this product.</li>
