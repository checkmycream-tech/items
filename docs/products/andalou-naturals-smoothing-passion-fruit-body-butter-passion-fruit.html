            <li>Great smell and amazing result.</li>

            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that I did.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad with this choice!</li>
            <li>I think it has nice ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>I liked what I saw in the ingredients and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Not at all greasy and smells so nice.</li>
            <li>It nourishes and moisturizes even better than my own product.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I noticed today how healthy my skin looks again.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that parabens and sulfates are NOT part of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>In fact, most of the ingredients are plant based.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this brand and this body butter is no exception :)</li>
            <li>(I love cocoa / chocolate scents) and I am at peace knowing that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li>I used to make my own body butter as it was significantly cheaper to do myself</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly, absorbs quickly, scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>Fine by me, but if you do not like that you may not like the smell.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best body moisturizer I&#x27;ve used to date, out of all natural moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing after each use and it seems to keep my skin hydrated very well.</li>
            <li>I recently returned from a tropical climate and my skin was tanned and happy in the humidity.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth, not greasy, and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>This lotion has done a fairly good job of keeping my pregnancy dry skin at bay but the scent of it is a bit overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li>I have originally bought this at a shop to try it out.  </li>
            <li>It is great for dry skin, and it will not make your skin oily.</li>
            <li>Smells great/ gets absorbed by skin without feeling greasy/ decent score on EWG.org website for toxicity - love it!</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat, like a cookie.</li>
            <li>This cream is so nice on the skin, makes my already soft skin even softer.</li>
            <li>Seems to stay on my skin even after a quick rinse off shower after running.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, not strong, made with plant stem cells,</li>
            <li>Not only is it extremely nourishing, but it has a very pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Style your hair exactly how you want it and then spray.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell very well.  </li>
            <li>this body butter really helped combat that.</li>
            <li>It really protects from humidity and frizz way.</li>
            <li>So I went to my local health store to pick a more natural product.</li>
            <li>It is super moist, mostly suitable for feet and elbows (at least on me) and absorbs well into skin.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s all natural, the cocoa scent is too much for me.</li>
            <li>I came across this product while reviewing the Andalou Naturals face care line of products to try something new.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the only lotions that is lighter (than pure shea) that makes a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>and I found I can get almost 3 months use out of one tube, which makes it very affordable compared to other body butters.  </li>
            <li>Do need to work it out at the end, bending the tube in half to get all of the butter out, and I was surprised how much was left in there.  </li>

            <li> This lotion has done a fairly good job of keeping my pregnancy dry skin at bay but the scent of it is a bit overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li> Great smelling and moisturizing body butter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell very well.  If I&#x27;d tried it in the store, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 jars of this stuff now. It goes on nice and smooth, not greasy, and it absorbs fast. It has a bit of a chocolately or mocha smell. I do not notice it however after I rub it in. Fine by me, but if you do not like that you may not like the smell. I think it has nice ingredients in it. I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer and smells great!  No great improvement in the looks of my skin though.</li>
            <li> I used to make my own body butter as it was significantly cheaper to do myself and I could control the ingredients.  I came across this product while reviewing the Andalou Naturals face care line of products to try something new.  I liked what I saw in the ingredients and decided to give it a try.  I am very pleased that I did.  It nourishes and moisturizes even better than my own product.  Goes on very smoothly, absorbs quickly, scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  There is a cocao aroma when first applied, but it is neither overpowering or unpleasant.  My skin looks amazing after each use and it seems to keep my skin hydrated very well.

A little goes a long way and I found I can get almost 3 months use out of one tube, which makes it very affordable compared to other body butters.  Do need to work it out at the end, bending the tube in half to get all of the butter out, and I was surprised how much was left in there.  Made it about two weeks longer than I thought I would.  A glass jar would make it easier to get the product out, but the tube doesn&#x27;t make it impossible.</li>
            <li> great body butter and smells yummy. not greasy or sticky yet thick and mosturizing. just like a good body butter should! but I would not use it during summer.</li>
            <li> Smells great/ gets absorbed by skin without feeling greasy/ decent score on EWG.org website for toxicity - love it!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin in the winter and this body butter really helped combat that. I recently returned from a tropical climate and my skin was tanned and happy in the humidity. as soon as I returned to NYC, my skin started to feel and look dry. I started using this religiously and I noticed today how healthy my skin looks again.</li>
            <li> Love. love. love. Thank you- will purchase again from you!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product:  excellent moisturizer, perhaps the best I&#x27;ve ever used; plus, it just feels and smells heavenly! :)</li>
            <li> The moment I put it on I knew it was not my thing. Although it&#x27;s all natural, the cocoa scent is too much for me. It is super moist, mostly suitable for feet and elbows (at least on me) and absorbs well into skin. I am going to give this away to a friend who likes chocolate!</li>
            <li> This is one of the only lotions that is lighter (than pure shea) that makes a big difference in my skin. It makes my skin glow. It smells good enough to eat, like a cookie. I have ordered this 3 times, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have originally bought this at a shop to try it out.  Not only is it extremely nourishing, but it has a very pleasant smell.  I love the fact that parabens and sulfates are NOT part of the ingredients.  It also does not contain any mineral oil.  In fact, most of the ingredients are plant based.  It is great for dry skin, and it will not make your skin oily.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brand and this body butter is no exception :)</li>
            <li> Not at all greasy and smells so nice.</li>
            <li> Great smell and amazing result.</li>
            <li> I buy this body butter from my local health food store. What a wonderful body moisturizer. I have very dry skin in the winter, but I hate to use regular commercial moisturuzers due to toxic ingredients. So I went to my local health store to pick a more natural product. I am so glad with this choice! It smells awesome (I love cocoa / chocolate scents) and I am at peace knowing that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my skin. I think this is the best body moisturizer I&#x27;ve used to date, out of all natural moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried so far. None of them were as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Love this body , best I&#x27;ve ever used. I like the cocoa smell.</li>
            <li> This cream is so nice on the skin, makes my already soft skin even softer. Great smell, not strong, made with plant stem cells, good price. I like this company&#x27;s products a lot.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a great finishing spray!  It really protects from humidity and frizz way. Here&#x27;s the best way to use it. Style your hair exactly how you want it and then spray. Try not to touch it until it sets. It smells like hairspray but it&#x27;s not sticky or anything like that.</li>
