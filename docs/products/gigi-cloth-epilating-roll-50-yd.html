            <li>This is way better then using muslin.</li>

            <li>It is very useful to do wax at home.</li>
            <li>Product is good or better than expected.</li>
            <li>its good quality, but paper all the same.</li>
            <li>This works much better than the precut strips since you can control exactly how much you use.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper than buying the pre made strips!!</li>
            <li>Love buying this by the roll, as it makes it so easy to get only what you need.</li>
            <li>These clothes do not allow wax to seep through, my fingers stayed wax free the whole time.  </li>
            <li>Pain in the butt to cut this up in strips but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Hair sticks right to it</li>
            <li>Vendor was very fast.</li>
            <li>This is the paper type used in hot waxing.</li>

            <li>Pulled wax off very well.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it says it works great, doesnt leave behind any residue and doesnt tear when pulled</li>
            <li>But i have noticed that this one makes my skin tingle a bit more than the other cloth, and i think the reason is because it picks up ALL of the hair in one shot.</li>
            <li>BUT, as many other reviewers mentioned, this will not let the wax seep thru, and you will not end up with Sticky fingers.</li>
            <li>So glad I read the other reviews and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I LOVE how this roll just grabs everything and rips it off without leaving a mess unlike their muslin roll.</li>

            <li> Love it. Way better than the cloth ones.</li>
            <li> IT really pick up the hair, weather it&#x27;s coarse or thin. But i have noticed that this one makes my skin tingle a bit more than the other cloth, and i think the reason is because it picks up ALL of the hair in one shot. BUT, as many other reviewers mentioned, this will not let the wax seep thru, and you will not end up with Sticky fingers. Over all, i would recommend it. Try it, it works</li>
            <li> Works great with the GiGi Honey wax!</li>
            <li> This is the paper type used in hot waxing. its good quality, but paper all the same. i was under the impression i was getting the fabric/cloth type. Next time ill be sure to look for Muslin specifically.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find good cloths to wax with. This cloth works great and does not leave residue behind.</li>
            <li> Basically you are getting epilating (non-woven) strips for 10.7 cents per foot rather than buying the precut (100 count) package for 15.3 cents per ounce. Granted, you will have to cut strips to your desired length, a blessing and possibly obnoxious if you run out of strips that you prepared for your procedure. However, it&#x27;s 2/3rds the cost, so ya might as well!</li>
            <li> Product is good or better than expected. Vendor was very fast. I ordered it on a weekday night, it shipped the same day and got to my house within 3 days.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, good price, cut to fit your needs!</li>
            <li> This works much better than the precut strips since you can control exactly how much you use.  Plus buying in bulk is much more cost effective.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about buying these over the regular muslin strips that I&#x27;m used to using. I decided to try after reading the reviews. I&#x27;m so glad that I took a chance! They remove more hair and leave behind a lot less wax residue. These clothes do not allow wax to seep through, my fingers stayed wax free the whole time.  I will definitely buy this product again and I encourage others to try these strips.</li>
            <li> The new texture unravels even less.  I like it before; I like it even better now.  No more to say.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time as promised.</li>
            <li> Great but. Has literally lasted for more than a year! &amp; i still have TONS left over!</li>
            <li> Much much much better than the cloth muslin.  So glad I read the other reviews and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Pulled wax off very well. Hair sticks right to it :) I really enjoyed that it can be cut to size, so it works for any body area.</li>
            <li> great service and product thank you</li>
            <li> I LOVE how this roll just grabs everything and rips it off without leaving a mess unlike their muslin roll. The wax doesn&#x27;t bleed through and you can use one strip twice before throwing it away. For crying out loud don&#x27;t use that sorry excuse off wax clothes called muslin roll. That thing is a pain in the &amp;$@!%.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and it worked great. I would definitely recommend this product and will purchase it again. No complaints.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than buying the pre made strips!!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and excellent product!</li>
            <li> Soft cloth epilating roll that will last me at least a year!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting muslin strip fabric and I was not expecting this type of cloth material.  But it works great!  Better than the muslin.  It does not seep through or leaves wax behind.</li>
            <li> The product works great for soft wax.</li>
            <li> Love buying this by the roll, as it makes it so easy to get only what you need.</li>
            <li> Love Gigi products &amp; this doesn&#x27;t disappoint either! You can simply cut whatever size you need! Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Pain in the butt to cut this up in strips but well worth it.</li>

            <li> best cloth epilator i have used so far in 10 years</li>
