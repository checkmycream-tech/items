            <li>Amazon has the best price as the salons are double.</li>

            <li>After just one application I got soft silky hair with an incredible shine.</li>
            <li>I tried many other brands but this is the perfect one.</li>
            <li>I am still waiting to get my full refund!  </li>
            <li>Product arrived fine but pumps didn&#x27;t come in package.</li>
            <li>and it was advertised as salt free.  </li>
            <li>love it; certainly would purchase this again, and again!</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best price I&#x27;ve seen on this shampoo (my local beauty store sells 200 mL for $20).</li>
            <li>I love it, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I will ever use because it works perfect to maintain my Keratin treated hair for a very long time Months.</li>
            <li>Soft and gentle and one of the better conditioners I find for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It was shipped right alway.</li>
            <li>because I wasn&#x27;t using the right product.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is good and works like any other shampoo but the conditioner is only ok.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast.  </li>
            <li>Leaves very smooth and very shiny hair, definitely recommend, It is a really good product, I usually put  on the ends of hair, because I dont want to get oily hair.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the cleaning ability of the shampoo, but wish the conditioner was little thicker.  </li>
            <li>At my local beauty supply she said they sell out of this very quickly.</li>
            <li>They are large so are cumbersome in the shower.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t detangle very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the product</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on here than any store I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, as others have mentioned the bottle isn&#x27;t as comfortable as the smaller ones that this shampoo comes in, but I didn&#x27;t it a bother at all!</li>
            <li>I had pretty healthy hair and after the first use, it completely dried it out.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new shampoo and conditioner for the first time in almost 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Most shampoo that dont contain that are more difficult to lather, but not this one.</li>
            <li>I realized I was going through the product rather quickly, so I looked for a larger container.</li>
            <li>I color frequently and this helps my color stay vibrant.</li>
            <li>I am sure this is just a result of me being used to using the same super thick conditioner for years, for that reason</li>
            <li>but the condition doesn&#x27;t leave the hair very soft like others conditions.</li>
            <li>, It leave my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Nothing makes my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>This product completely damaged my hair!  </li>
            <li>Recommended by professional to help preserve color or accent added to your hair.  </li>
            <li>Always makes you have soft hair if that is your pleasure.</li>
            <li>Its quality keeps my hair soft and protects my color.</li>
            <li>My hair was wreaked and all their products fixed it up.</li>
            <li>Redken All Soft lover until I smelled this at my salon while getting my hair washed.  </li>
            <li>but I do believe that this shampoo is gentle on my fragile hair.  </li>
            <li>Good &#x27; but too expensive for the amount .</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve dropped on a few times and luckily missed my feet.</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle very convenience, since last for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and the color is lasting longer than before without getting brassy.</li>
            <li>Louise Newhagen&lt;br /&gt;author of Sand Dollar and Pieces of Eight, tales of old Key West</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the heavy perfume in these.</li>
            <li>I developed a skin reaction: dry flaky skin that ITCHED!  </li>

            <li> I disagree with the previous review... that person must be allergic or sensitive to an ingredient in Alfaparf products.</li>

            <li> There is a reason why this product is half the price</li>
            <li> I have the feeling a lot of the conditioner will get wasted because it won&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> This has never happened with a shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy my shampoo and conditioner from my hairdresser but it went out of stock</li>
            <li> I have been a die hard</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect shampoo and conditioner if you want to use sulfate free product! Smells great too. Since I start using this product I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo/conditioner on recommendation from my hairstylist since she colors my hair with the same brand and thought the color would last for a longer period of time. I developed a skin reaction: dry flaky skin that ITCHED!  This has never happened with a shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Unfortunately the company would not take back the product (so much for customer satisfaction), and I&#x27;m stuck with a large and expense product that I wouldn&#x27;t let anyone in my family use. I would not recommend  purchasing unless you&#x27;ve used this product before without a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good because doesn&#x27;t have salt and doesn&#x27;t make damage to my hair but the condition doesn&#x27;t leave the hair very soft like others conditions. I&#x27;ll continue buying it because I have a treatment in my hair that needs a shampoo and condition without salt.</li>
            <li> The shampoo I received smells like the one used in my salon. The conditioner, however, smells like men&#x27;s cologne and definitely not like the shampoo received or like the conditioner used in my salon. There is a reason why this product is half the price it is everywhere else and I think it&#x27;s either because it&#x27;s a fake or a substitute. Returning it immediately.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this color protection shampoo and conditioner for me because I&#x27;m in the sun a lot and in and out of the pool, too. The products are great. My hair has never been so soft and the color is lasting longer than before without getting brassy. The products are expensive, but they&#x27;re worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Louise Newhagen&lt;br /&gt;author of Sand Dollar and Pieces of Eight, tales of old Key West</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best.  My colorist does color thinking it is going to fade.  Mine doesn&#x27;t using this shampoo.  The color I leave with is the same color I come back with 6 weeks later, except for the roots of course.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and what a savings..... love it; certainly would purchase this again, and again!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who had a keratin treatment. It is a fabulous product ! My hairdresser recommended it to me and I love it !</li>
            <li> I got the wrong product! I order the color protection and received the white bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by professional to help preserve color or accent added to your hair.  Soft and gentle and one of the better conditioners I find for fine hair.  Always makes you have soft hair if that is your pleasure.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my shampoo and conditioner from my hairdresser but it went out of stock so I search the web hopping to find this excellent product. I&#x27;m so glad I found it. Its quality keeps my hair soft and protects my color. Plus their great service and fast shipping. Totally satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I had used other products before for my hair, but this one excel my expectations, It leave my hair very soft and manageable.The size of the bottle very convenience, since last for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair and is very difficult to maintain. I tried many other brands but this is the perfect one. My hair is shiny, soft and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Great purchase experience... Thank you</li>
            <li> I love it, I highly recommend it. It was shipped right alway. I rated it good, I love the way my hair feels after i use these products.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fine but pumps didn&#x27;t come in package. Help. Send me the pumps.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good and works like any other shampoo but the conditioner is only ok. It doesn&#x27;t detangle very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is heavy so a pump is very well needed.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the only product I will ever use because it works perfect to maintain my Keratin treated hair for a very long time Months. it&#x27;s a must have if you keratin your hair.</li>
            <li> I had a brazillian blowout done to my hair and it required me to use a shampoo and conditioner that contained no sulfate or sodium. Most shampoo that dont contain that are more difficult to lather, but not this one. Lather and smell are awesome. Only wish it came with dispensing pumps</li>
            <li> These shampoo  and  conditioners set  are  the  best  they  help  your  hair  and makes  your  hair straighter  than  before  it is a breeze  to iron  your  hair  after they  are  used</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had a recent keratin treatment and it was advertised as salt free.  It is not.  The shampoo and conditioner work well and smell lovely though.  I really like the product but my keratin was out within a month or so because I wasn&#x27;t using the right product.</li>
            <li> Nothing makes my hair so soft and shiny! I color frequently and this helps my color stay vibrant. Try it!!</li>
            <li> Leaves very smooth and very shiny hair, definitely recommend, It is a really good product, I usually put  on the ends of hair, because I dont want to get oily hair.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the heavy perfume in these.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. At my local beauty supply she said they sell out of this very quickly. I have tried all high end shampoos and conditioners for my thick, wavy, dry hair. I finally found the product!! Much cheaper on here than any store I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I love this product and discovered it at my salon. I realized I was going through the product rather quickly, so I looked for a larger container. This seller had a great deal for both the shampoo and conditioner. The product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Good &#x27; but too expensive for the amount . Great for hair smell awesome &#x27; everyone told me my hair looks amazing</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives my hair wonderful body and helps my color last longer. It takes just a dab of conditioner to maintain color and shine. The aroma is wonderful</li>
            <li> Very nice quality sulfate free shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been using for years.  Amazon has the best price as the salons are double.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair care product for hair that has been chemically processed.  It leaves your hair shiny, silky and smelling fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love this anything I every tried from alfaparf was great. My hair was wreaked and all their products fixed it up.</li>
            <li> I bought a new shampoo and conditioner for the first time in almost 20 years.  I have been a die hard Redken All Soft lover until I smelled this at my salon while getting my hair washed.  DELICIOUS!  So fragrant, almost like a perfume, but not overbearing at all.  I am very pleased with the cleaning ability of the shampoo, but wish the conditioner was little thicker.  I am sure this is just a result of me being used to using the same super thick conditioner for years, for that reason, I&#x27;m still giving this product 5 stars.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I highly recommend it. Delivery was super fast.  5 star SELLER!! THANK YOU ^_^</li>
            <li> I do like this product but I find the bottles difficult. They are large so are cumbersome in the shower. When your hands are wet it&#x27;s hard to handle the big bottles, I&#x27;ve dropped on a few times and luckily missed my feet. It&#x27;s also difficult getting the product out. I have the feeling a lot of the conditioner will get wasted because it won&#x27;t come out. If you find smaller bottles I would get those instead.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair which I used to bleach/highlight, it doesn&#x27;t get too oily too quickly.  I started using this shampoo to protect my highlights, not sure if I believe in that a shampoo can actually do that, but I do believe that this shampoo is gentle on my fragile hair.  An added bonus is a wonderful scent.  This is definitely the best price I&#x27;ve seen on this shampoo (my local beauty store sells 200 mL for $20). Very happy with the product, wish I found this seller sooner rather than spending all that money at the beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as others have mentioned the bottle isn&#x27;t as comfortable as the smaller ones that this shampoo comes in, but I didn&#x27;t it a bother at all! (It&#x27;s just a regular opening like you would find on a soda bottle.) I suppose if it bothers you, you could just get a pump.</li>
            <li> This product completely damaged my hair!  I had pretty healthy hair and after the first use, it completely dried it out.  I am still waiting to get my full refund!  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Great efficient service and product</li>
            <li> I disagree with the previous review... that person must be allergic or sensitive to an ingredient in Alfaparf products. This shampoo/conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have used many high-end products over the years. Alfaparf provides great color protection. In addition, it tames my frizzy hair, cleanses well without drying, doesn&#x27;t build up over time, and smells wonderful. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I got this product from my hair dresser. I am coloring my hair since years. The water here in Florida contains lots of chemicals, my hair was always dry. After just one application I got soft silky hair with an incredible shine. I am loving it!</li>
