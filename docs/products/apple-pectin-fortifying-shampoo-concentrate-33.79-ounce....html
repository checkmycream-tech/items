            <li>so that makes me happy.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying using this shampoo!!  </li>
            <li>Really really amazing product, can&#x27;t beat the scent!</li>
            <li>Been using it for 20  plus years great product good for the hair smells good.</li>
            <li>A GOOD PRODUCT, BUT PICTURED AS TWO ITEMS.</li>
            <li>A fraction of the price of Lamaur and in our opinion, just as good.  </li>
            <li>Very happy, so glad it is still available and service is always great.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s beautiful hair is even more so after using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>So happy to be able to order it here now.  </li>
            <li>Ordered it again - and my family fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product was ordered for my husband as he has always liked to use an apple shampoo product.  </li>
            <li>The fact is that his hair line is almost gone, but he still likes a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as I remember when LaMaur made it.  </li>
            <li>We both thought it did not smell strongly of Apple Pectin, the pleasant fragrance remembered.</li>
            <li>and I have never found a shampoo I liked better.  </li>
            <li>According to her it lathered up fairly well, but didn&#x27;t feel clean, so she rinsed that out and used more to lather again.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped it quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li>and I love the way this shampoo lathers and it cleans so well without leaving buildup, but it doesnt strip it either.  </li>
            <li>I used to LOVE this shampoo</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I was so glad that I was able to find it though Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love hair products that smell fruity and this one smells like apples.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it makes my hair so shiny and I&#x27;am</li>
            <li>and they love it.there also used to be a condtioner that i wish i could find.</li>
            <li>Since the shampoo is not runny, it was okay.</li>
            <li>I unscrewed the top, thinking it probably had a safety seal, and that was what prevented it from leaking.</li>
            <li>Would love to get the original LaMaur version again!</li>
            <li>The fragrance wasn&#x27;t nearly as strong and it did not perform well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>What it WILL do is make your hair strong and reduce breakage.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li>Having used Apple Pectin shampoo many years ago my mom remembered liking it very much.</li>
            <li>Not quite as thick as the original that I used 30 years ago, but smells just as great!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel and look full of body.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for my hair, not too heavy and really gets it clean.  </li>
            <li>Apple Pectin Shampoo used to have this bold apple smell, this product does not.</li>
            <li>Same amazing smell and feel as ever.  </li>
            <li>Then it felt as if she had used Prell or something that really stripped the hair squeeky clean, and she knew she would absolutly have to put a conditioner on her hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is every bit as good as the more expensive shampoos like Paul Mitchell and Matrix.  </li>
            <li>glad i found it.my daughters have the long hair now</li>
            <li>I can use it year round regardless of the season and it never fails to give my hair that natural shine and bounce that so many shampoos these days seem</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.  </li>
            <li>The concentrate is strong, you only need a small amount to get a full and complete lather.  </li>
            <li>Also, the aroma is a soft and mellow with a hint of apple that does not linger.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not as great as I remember it used to be.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is every bit as good as the more expensive shampoos like Paul Mitchell and Matrix.  I have used them all and I love the way this shampoo lathers and it cleans so well without leaving buildup, but it doesnt strip it either.  I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy!  I used to LOVE this shampoo and now I found it again!  :)</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.  I began using Apple Pectin Shampoo in the 1970&#x27;s and I have never found a shampoo I liked better.  The concentrate is strong, you only need a small amount to get a full and complete lather.  Also, the aroma is a soft and mellow with a hint of apple that does not linger.  The larger bottles used to come in a \\&quot;pump\\&quot; bottle so you didn&#x27;t have to wait for the shampoo to come out - I wish they still had that system.</li>
            <li> We have used Apple Pectin Shampoo for years.  My supplier no longer carry&#x27;s it.  I was so glad that I was able to find it though Amazon.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 20  plus years great product good for the hair smells good. Wish it would come with a pump</li>
            <li> A GOOD PRODUCT, BUT PICTURED AS TWO ITEMS.</li>
            <li> USED PRODUCT FOR YEARS COULD NOT FIND TILL NOW.THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Not quite as thick as the original that I used 30 years ago, but smells just as great!</li>
            <li> My husband likes this.  His remembers using it when he was a teenager and it is still the same.  My boys like it as well.</li>
            <li> I used this as a teen- Loved it! Ordered it again - and my family fell in love with it! Sadly- it isn&#x27;t all mine anymore- but will order again!</li>
            <li> I have dry, baby-fine hair and this stuff totally works for me.  I can use it year round regardless of the season and it never fails to give my hair that natural shine and bounce that so many shampoos these days seem to lack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is amazing.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using this shampoo!!  I had also ordered some conditioner from Amazon which works well in conjunction with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this since I was a child.  Smells so good!</li>
            <li> my husband and son swear by this so when our hair dresser closed her salon, I had to locate another supplier.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product years ago and then it got to be hard to find.  I purchased this item thru Amazon and have only used it a couple of times.  The fragrence that I remember from Apple Pectin Shampoo just isn&#x27;t the same. Apple Pectin Shampoo used to have this bold apple smell, this product does not. Disappointed in the product, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> Very happy, so glad it is still available and service is always great.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product. I thought it was the same as I has used back in the 70&#x27;s.  The fragrance wasn&#x27;t nearly as strong and it did not perform well on my hair.  Not much lather and left my hair dry. I am using it for dog shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It works perfectly for my hair, not too heavy and really gets it clean.  The seller shipped it quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li> I love hair products that smell fruity and this one smells like apples.  It makes my hair feel and look full of body.</li>
            <li> This product was ordered for my husband as he has always liked to use an apple shampoo product.  The fact is that his hair line is almost gone, but he still likes a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it makes my hair so shiny and I&#x27;am in my 60&#x27;s so that makes me happy. I have been using it for 3 years and will not do without it.</li>
            <li> A fraction of the price of Lamaur and in our opinion, just as good.  My wife&#x27;s beautiful hair is even more so after using this shampoo.  We love it!</li>
            <li> found this back in the 70&#x27;s and used faithfully for years then lost track of sources.so glad i found it.my daughters have the long hair now and they love it.there also used to be a condtioner that i wish i could find.</li>
            <li> This shampoo will NOT soften or detangle your hair.  What it WILL do is make your hair strong and reduce breakage.  I just started using it about a month ago and it&#x27;s been great! !</li>
            <li> Having used Apple Pectin shampoo many years ago my mom remembered liking it very much. I ordered a bottle of it for her and it arrived today. Fortunatly, it did not ooze out of the bottle, because the pop open lid was raised. Since the shampoo is not runny, it was okay. I unscrewed the top, thinking it probably had a safety seal, and that was what prevented it from leaking. However, there was no safety seal.&lt;br /&gt;She was so disappointed. We both thought it did not smell strongly of Apple Pectin, the pleasant fragrance remembered. According to her it lathered up fairly well, but didn&#x27;t feel clean, so she rinsed that out and used more to lather again. Then it felt as if she had used Prell or something that really stripped the hair squeeky clean, and she knew she would absolutly have to put a conditioner on her hair. Her thought was, Oh no, I have 33.8 oz of this stuff left that I don&#x27;t even like...I wonder if I can donate it to somebody!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years after it being used in a salon.  Same amazing smell and feel as ever.  So happy to be able to order it here now.  Really really amazing product, can&#x27;t beat the scent!</li>
            <li> Not as nice as I remember when LaMaur made it.  Has an odd chemical smell to it.  Would love to get the original LaMaur version again!</li>
