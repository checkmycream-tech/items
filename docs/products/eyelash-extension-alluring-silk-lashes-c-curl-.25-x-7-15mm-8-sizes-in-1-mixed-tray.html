            <li>I ordered these so I would have an assortment of sizes to use when contouring eyelash extensions to someone&#x27;s natural eye shape.</li>
            <li>The longer they&#x27;re on, the more irritating they are.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are good but this size is very thick and because it is a C curve the lashes are heavy and can turn.</li>

            <li> I ordered these so I would have an assortment of sizes to use when contouring eyelash extensions to someone&#x27;s natural eye shape. I love them.

They are also really glossy and shiny, as well as pretty soft. I love these.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the company, but I didn&#x27;t like the C Curl 25.  The 25&#x27;s are a little too stiff and not comfortable on your lashes.  Removed them and went back to C Curl 20.</li>
            <li> The lashes hold their shape very well.  If you are like me and do not want to use Mink lashes because you want to use animal friendly products then the silk lashes are a great alternative.  Caution, it is VERY difficult to use individual lashes on your own.  You should consider cluster lashes as an alternative if you are inexperienced.</li>
            <li> These are heavy &amp; plastic like, going to purchase Mink next ... hopefully they are lighter and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> These lashes are good but this size is very thick and because it is a C curve the lashes are heavy and can turn. It is important to coat the whole lash with adhesive so that the natural lash can adhere well and completely.  When attached correctly they are very lush and lovely.</li>
            <li> They are a little stiff. Do not feel real... But then again they aren&#x27;t. lashes lashes lashes lashes. They are doable with the right glue..</li>
            <li> I did not like it too harsh</li>
            <li> Great starter lashes.</li>

            <li> Lashes were great. Good selection of different lengths. Also the material was not  to synthetic or unrealistic. overall a great product and highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have worn individual lashes for 30 years, and these are the best I have ever tried.  I like the varying lengths, and they peel off easily from the tray.  One application can last for a month.  The tray will easily be enough lashes for practically a year.  I will need to reorder by then, as I do not use all lengths on the tray.  There is even a length you can use on your lower lashes for special occasions.  Use lash-tite or a similar product to adhere the lashes to your own lashes.  Use it sparingly-a little goes a long way, and they will be easier to remove.</li>
            <li> I have never worn eyelash extensions before so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. They are very hard individual lashes (almost plastic like). Nothing silky about them. They do look great on though. I loved that they&#x27;re were so many lengths to choose from so you can blend them all together for a very natural yet stunning look.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very hard and very plastic-like.  I was super excited for all the sizes but when I put them on, almost immediately they started to feel as if they were jabbing me in the eye..  And yes, I put them on correctly... Definitely not for long wear.  Also not flexible like \\&quot;real\\&quot; lashes should be as there was little to no give.  These would be good for maybe a night out, at most. The longer they&#x27;re on, the more irritating they are.  I was planning on wearing mine until they fell out but after three days I had enough and pulled them out.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel silly at all,which is what I was trying to shoot for...honestly haven&#x27;t tried because the feel is to hard</li>
            <li> This product is not great. Too hard to have it long period of time on your eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Should be softer. I coudn&#x27;t wash my face with this eyelashes so I just took off right after I put it on. I will buy softer one next time.</li>
