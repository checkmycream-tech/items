            <li>This has great sticking power, but is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, easy to use and most of all</li>
            <li>the price of the product was great, and the quality is fine too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, and kept my lashes intact, and on my lash line, and not in the chip bowl.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this stuff was amazing.</li>
            <li>this one works nicely for strip lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice glue-liner for falsies.  </li>
            <li>I worked a 12hrs shift, and got compliments from coworkers about how good my lashes looked throughout the day:)</li>
            <li>Again this product is great but for first time users not so good.</li>
            <li>so it has a good grip and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It is watery and very strong fumed.</li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect, but only after I rolled the tube in-between my palms to warm it, and blend all the ingredients together.</li>
            <li>True, a Tsunami could not blow your flash eyelashes off if you use this stuff but good luck removing it too.  </li>
            <li>I have had better lash glue.  </li>
            <li>The adhesive is by Ardell&#x27;s and is the top of the line.  </li>
            <li>is ok</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>just dab on let get tacky  for one minute and apply on upper or lower lash and welcome to girly town, no haters allowed, good glue</li>
            <li>Excellent product and the only one I trust.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>THEY BETTER</li>
            <li>STAY PUT, this glue makes sure of that</li>
            <li>I love this product and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>great product and fast</li>
            <li>ok so i got an e mail saying your item has been shipped</li>
            <li>my daughters were gonna gave a beauty nite :)</li>
            <li>I usually love this product but my experience with this shipment and shipper didn&#x27;t go so well.</li>
            <li>Love it she is teaching me how to use it.</li>
            <li>I think I could of bought a better adhesive though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>to get tacky and it holds the lashes but not for more than two days.</li>
            <li>I defiantly would recommend this product I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>This product was good and came very fast.</li>
            <li>This adhesive works great holds great and dries the color of my black eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Sticks pretty good</li>
            <li>Anyway I&#x27;m happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li>glue makes lashes stick wonderfully, cant get wet even though it says water proof its not</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it really did a good job.</li>
            <li>other than that, great all day glue, makes my lashes stay in place!</li>
            <li>the glue comes off easily on the strip lash as well.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and handle.</li>
            <li>made a difference, worked well, easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a bit too easy for me.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It also comes off easily for when I smudge some.</li>
            <li>Easy to take off at the end of the day also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It does not hold like Duo and it not as strong and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li>The fumes in it was so strong that I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li>The dark color allows the lashes to blend into my liner perfectly.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use makeup remover and it works just as fine.</li>
            <li>Everything seemed to be fine until I opened the box to retrieve the product.</li>
            <li>I suck at putting on lashes, but on the occassions I get them on this works just fine.</li>
            <li>so it works with eyeliner just fine.</li>
            <li>Super grip!</li>
            <li>The product came fast and I love it!</li>
            <li>Best one I have used so far, but my eyes are slightly sensitive to eyelash glue</li>
            <li>clean lines and easy to apply and remove.  </li>
            <li>Considering the price and free shipping</li>
            <li>, I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, can hold for a long time and is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Lashgrip is right!  </li>
            <li>The item is good dry&#x27;s very quick and the lashes wont fall</li>
            <li>all was ok thanks</li>
            <li>Throw it out and think good thoughts such as: &amp;#34;I am still living&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s a good lash glue</li>
            <li>It shipped really quick, and worked well.</li>
            <li>Sticks quickly and stays where you put it.  </li>
            <li>but the product is super runny.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely happy to find eyelash adhesive in the dark color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to peel off without ripping my real lashes.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to makeup, it might not be the product for you because the glue does get black if your eyes water, but otherwise a great product!</li>
            <li>THE CLEAR DUO IS MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>A must my beauty Divas so much better then the clear glue.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have my moneys worth though..</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good product thanks for sending back to me</li>
            <li>it looks more natural</li>
            <li>Which is great with black lashes!</li>
            <li>It works great and you cannot see the glue because it turns black and blends in with your eyeliner/mascara!</li>
            <li>, sticks my eyelashes right on my eyes like it should.</li>
            <li>I bought two tubes, and I think it was a great decision because it&#x27;s a small tube.</li>
            <li>good eyelash glue dries great,dries black witch</li>
            <li>and you cant use very much</li>
            <li>However, the glue adheres all day, easy to apply, dries just quick enough.</li>
            <li>The following morning I had to replace most of my lashes.</li>
            <li>best lash glue ever, i dont wear fake lashes often</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered lashes ever I didn&#x27;t know what to get and this glue was recommended</li>
            <li>It smells like a hair relaxer, and that made me cautious at first to put on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a more convenient route, but I&#x27;ll pack up the kids and grab a tube at the local beauty shop before ordering lash glue online again.</li>
            <li>Makes applying lashes so much easier and quicker!</li>
            <li>It dries fast but not so fast that you can&#x27;t make quick adjustments.</li>
            <li>this product worked very well and it came pretty fast !</li>
            <li>It sticks very wekk but is not difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>the dark adhesive is nice but can ruin your eyeshadow if you smudge it a lot.</li>
            <li>Dries nice and dark</li>
            <li>It dries black which makes it blend in nicely with my make up</li>
            <li>It just takes like 30 seconds or more to dry</li>
            <li>it works fine the only thing i was like,what?!?</li>
            <li>My main purpose for them is gluing rhinestones to my face for festivities!</li>
            <li>you have to work fast</li>
            <li>it stick really well</li>
            <li>In a truly important I would use the white.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product</li>
            <li>The edges of the eyelash started to curl in and they were very solid/scratchy.</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>Works but smells really wierd.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li>I give this product four stars instead of five because it takes more than 30 sec.</li>
            <li>They stuck really well, too, and held the whole time.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased eyelash glue so maybe that is normal</li>
            <li>So much easier to cover up and deal with when continuing to apply the rest of your eye</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>great to use when using false lashes...holds until you take off...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, it lasts all day long and is black</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very gently on your natural lashes.</li>
            <li>with was the color it was like a light grey color</li>
            <li>I love that it is the dark adhesive</li>
            <li>The dark adhesive glue is perfect for my black individual lashes.</li>
            <li>More gray than black...</li>
            <li>so i orderd this thinking the glue was black to match my eyeliner but its more grayish</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my lashes lifting or slipping.</li>
            <li>Love the black glue.  </li>
            <li>This particular brand is one I always use when doing my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I have only used white for many years.</li>
            <li>luckily* two days later!)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the tube very easily, and it doesn&#x27;t come with anything to apply it with, so I use a small brush, but</li>
            <li>It also comes off well with normal eye make up remover.</li>
            <li>Love the black adhesive!</li>
            <li>I simply wash my face during my shower at night and my \\&quot;falsies\\&quot; slip right off -</li>
            <li>its okay for a back up do not like useing black its very liquidly</li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT A MORE NATURAL LOOK, YOU CAN USE CLEAR AND USE A BLACK PENCIL OVER IT.</li>
            <li>And I love that so far my bottle hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34; up with any dried liner.</li>
            <li>It dries black and, holds strong all day.</li>
            <li>and I love the value of the dark !!</li>
            <li>Not to mention if this stuff gets on your other makeup: don&#x27;t even try to clean it up.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my lashes, and I couldnt get them to stick, I am going to play around with it, but it really wasnt working like the normal white adhesive.</li>
            <li>Great product, i used to use the clear, but the Black is completely invisible when dry and seems to be much better, especially if you buy the black strip lashes, and wear black eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy clear eyelash glue from now on.  </li>
            <li>so gonna try the clear one</li>
            <li>I ordered the clear drying glue and use that one.</li>
            <li>I will only buy from this seller because they can be trusted 100%, not to mention where can you really get this price?</li>
            <li>Love this lash adhesive especially in dark.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but the smell throws me completely off.</li>
            <li>No matter which type of lash you prefer (soft or thick) you will spend more time cleaning this goop up than wearing the lashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis for lashes simply because it does stick TOO much that i find it  damaging my lashes when i take them off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wearing false lashes and this adhesive is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Will not be going back to clear-</li>
            <li>It is a pretty dark gray.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful to not put on to much</li>
            <li>It takes an hour to get the glue to adhere to the lash and another hour to clean up the mess!!</li>
            <li>At least the cheap lashes I recently purchased sticked.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been trying to wear fake eyelashes for over a year and the glue always failed, but this is one is the best one so far</li>
            <li>as in never seemed to dry entirely clear anyway</li>
            <li>I REALLY DID NOT CARE FOR THIS ADHESIVE--PARTICULARLY BECAUSE ITS BLACK.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing lashes for a few years now and normally use the clear glue, but from the reviews on this glue</li>
            <li>If you like to use false eyelashes to dress up for events, this glue works fantastic, it dries fast and black.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it does dry black and for a first timer it might not work for you.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry so fast that you cant anchor your lashes properly but doesn&#x27;t take so long to dry that they come off on your fingers.</li>

            <li> It is watery and very strong fumed.</li>
            <li> The consistency is perfect, but only after I rolled the tube in-between my palms to warm it, and blend all the ingredients together.</li>
            <li> True, a Tsunami could not blow your flash eyelashes off if you use this stuff but good luck removing it too.  </li>
            <li> I have had better lash glue.  </li>
            <li> The adhesive is by Ardell&#x27;s and is the top of the line.  </li>
            <li> is ok</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> just dab on let get tacky  for one minute and apply on upper or lower lash and welcome to girly town, no haters allowed, good glue</li>
            <li> Excellent product and the only one I trust.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> THEY BETTER</li>
            <li> STAY PUT, this glue makes sure of that</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> great product and fast</li>
            <li> ok so i got an e mail saying your item has been shipped</li>
            <li> my daughters were gonna gave a beauty nite :)</li>
            <li> I usually love this product but my experience with this shipment and shipper didn&#x27;t go so well.</li>
            <li> Love it she is teaching me how to use it.</li>
            <li> I think I could of bought a better adhesive though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> to get tacky and it holds the lashes but not for more than two days.</li>
            <li> I defiantly would recommend this product I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> This product was good and came very fast.</li>
            <li> This adhesive works great holds great and dries the color of my black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Sticks pretty good</li>
            <li> Anyway I&#x27;m happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> glue makes lashes stick wonderfully, cant get wet even though it says water proof its not</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it really did a good job.</li>
            <li> other than that, great all day glue, makes my lashes stay in place!</li>
            <li> the glue comes off easily on the strip lash as well.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and handle.</li>
            <li> made a difference, worked well, easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit too easy for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It also comes off easily for when I smudge some.</li>
            <li> Easy to take off at the end of the day also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove.</li>
            <li> It does not hold like Duo and it not as strong and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> The fumes in it was so strong that I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> The dark color allows the lashes to blend into my liner perfectly.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use makeup remover and it works just as fine.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed to be fine until I opened the box to retrieve the product.</li>
            <li> I suck at putting on lashes, but on the occassions I get them on this works just fine.</li>
            <li> so it works with eyeliner just fine.</li>
            <li> Super grip!</li>
            <li> The product came fast and I love it!</li>
            <li> Best one I have used so far, but my eyes are slightly sensitive to eyelash glue</li>
            <li> clean lines and easy to apply and remove.  </li>
            <li> Considering the price and free shipping</li>
            <li> , I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, can hold for a long time and is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> Lashgrip is right!  </li>
            <li> The item is good dry&#x27;s very quick and the lashes wont fall</li>
            <li> all was ok thanks</li>
            <li> Throw it out and think good thoughts such as: &amp;#34;I am still living&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s a good lash glue</li>
            <li> It shipped really quick, and worked well.</li>
            <li> Sticks quickly and stays where you put it.  </li>
            <li> but the product is super runny.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely happy to find eyelash adhesive in the dark color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to peel off without ripping my real lashes.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to makeup, it might not be the product for you because the glue does get black if your eyes water, but otherwise a great product!</li>
            <li> THE CLEAR DUO IS MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li> A must my beauty Divas so much better then the clear glue.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have my moneys worth though..</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good product thanks for sending back to me</li>
            <li> it looks more natural</li>
            <li> Which is great with black lashes!</li>
            <li> It works great and you cannot see the glue because it turns black and blends in with your eyeliner/mascara!</li>
            <li> , sticks my eyelashes right on my eyes like it should.</li>
            <li> I bought two tubes, and I think it was a great decision because it&#x27;s a small tube.</li>
            <li> good eyelash glue dries great,dries black witch</li>
            <li> and you cant use very much</li>
            <li> However, the glue adheres all day, easy to apply, dries just quick enough.</li>
            <li> The following morning I had to replace most of my lashes.</li>
            <li> best lash glue ever, i dont wear fake lashes often</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered lashes ever I didn&#x27;t know what to get and this glue was recommended</li>
            <li> It smells like a hair relaxer, and that made me cautious at first to put on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a more convenient route, but I&#x27;ll pack up the kids and grab a tube at the local beauty shop before ordering lash glue online again.</li>
            <li> Makes applying lashes so much easier and quicker!</li>
            <li> It dries fast but not so fast that you can&#x27;t make quick adjustments.</li>
            <li> this product worked very well and it came pretty fast !</li>
            <li> It sticks very wekk but is not difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> the dark adhesive is nice but can ruin your eyeshadow if you smudge it a lot.</li>
            <li> Dries nice and dark</li>
            <li> It dries black which makes it blend in nicely with my make up</li>
            <li> It just takes like 30 seconds or more to dry</li>
            <li> it works fine the only thing i was like,what?!?</li>
            <li> My main purpose for them is gluing rhinestones to my face for festivities!</li>
            <li> you have to work fast</li>
            <li> it stick really well</li>
            <li> In a truly important I would use the white.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the product</li>
            <li> The edges of the eyelash started to curl in and they were very solid/scratchy.</li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> Works but smells really wierd.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> I give this product four stars instead of five because it takes more than 30 sec.</li>
            <li> They stuck really well, too, and held the whole time.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased eyelash glue so maybe that is normal</li>
            <li> So much easier to cover up and deal with when continuing to apply the rest of your eye</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> great to use when using false lashes...holds until you take off...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it lasts all day long and is black</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very gently on your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> with was the color it was like a light grey color</li>
            <li> I love that it is the dark adhesive</li>
            <li> The dark adhesive glue is perfect for my black individual lashes.</li>
            <li> More gray than black...</li>
            <li> so i orderd this thinking the glue was black to match my eyeliner but its more grayish</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my lashes lifting or slipping.</li>
            <li> Love the black glue.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand is one I always use when doing my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I have only used white for many years.</li>
            <li> luckily* two days later!)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube very easily, and it doesn&#x27;t come with anything to apply it with, so I use a small brush, but</li>
            <li> It also comes off well with normal eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> Love the black adhesive!</li>
            <li> I simply wash my face during my shower at night and my \\&quot;falsies\\&quot; slip right off -</li>
            <li> its okay for a back up do not like useing black its very liquidly</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT A MORE NATURAL LOOK, YOU CAN USE CLEAR AND USE A BLACK PENCIL OVER IT.</li>
            <li> And I love that so far my bottle hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34; up with any dried liner.</li>
            <li> It dries black and, holds strong all day.</li>
            <li> and I love the value of the dark !!</li>
            <li> Not to mention if this stuff gets on your other makeup: don&#x27;t even try to clean it up.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my lashes, and I couldnt get them to stick, I am going to play around with it, but it really wasnt working like the normal white adhesive.</li>
            <li> Great product, i used to use the clear, but the Black is completely invisible when dry and seems to be much better, especially if you buy the black strip lashes, and wear black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy clear eyelash glue from now on.  </li>
            <li> so gonna try the clear one</li>
            <li> I ordered the clear drying glue and use that one.</li>
            <li> I will only buy from this seller because they can be trusted 100%, not to mention where can you really get this price?</li>
            <li> Love this lash adhesive especially in dark.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but the smell throws me completely off.</li>
            <li> No matter which type of lash you prefer (soft or thick) you will spend more time cleaning this goop up than wearing the lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis for lashes simply because it does stick TOO much that i find it  damaging my lashes when i take them off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing false lashes and this adhesive is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Will not be going back to clear-</li>
            <li> It is a pretty dark gray.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful to not put on to much</li>
            <li> It takes an hour to get the glue to adhere to the lash and another hour to clean up the mess!!</li>
            <li> At least the cheap lashes I recently purchased sticked.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been trying to wear fake eyelashes for over a year and the glue always failed, but this is one is the best one so far</li>
            <li> as in never seemed to dry entirely clear anyway</li>
            <li> I REALLY DID NOT CARE FOR THIS ADHESIVE--PARTICULARLY BECAUSE ITS BLACK.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing lashes for a few years now and normally use the clear glue, but from the reviews on this glue</li>
            <li> If you like to use false eyelashes to dress up for events, this glue works fantastic, it dries fast and black.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it does dry black and for a first timer it might not work for you.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry so fast that you cant anchor your lashes properly but doesn&#x27;t take so long to dry that they come off on your fingers.</li>
            <li> wooo hooo now just need the lashes to give it a try-fyi i am turning ummmm older in a few weeks and decided me n</li>
            <li> Just have to be prepared for the dark instead of the clear</li>
            <li> very unsatisfied with this product which I did not expect because I usually buy eyelash products from this brand , but this glue is too gooey and does not stick well.</li>
            <li> I go to school for 7 hours, so I need a product that will last just as long.</li>
            <li> So I only use it when I know I will be dancing and out long because I know they will stay on.</li>
            <li> Last a long time without redoing.</li>
            <li> Durable, long lasting.</li>
            <li> Long lasting!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for first timers because it goes on black and stays black.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this false lash adhesive is black!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and a dark color, so I don&#x27;t have to wait until the glue dries like I do with white adhesives.</li>
            <li> Lashes stay on for as long as desired.</li>
            <li> but I usually start outside of the end of my eye unlike the traditional starting at the inner corner of the eye.</li>
            <li> my eyeliner is really black but only in pic but for daily use</li>
            <li> Not too sticky to the point where I can&#x27;t get it off after a long day, and not too loose to the point that it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but it dry gray for me and</li>
            <li> I waited an entire month for this to arrive and it was not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> You just need a thin line and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li> inside of that bag was a empty little box someone stole the glue and put the empy box back inside the mail bag and mail it !!</li>
            <li> Dries clear so if you&#x27;re a little messy, no one will know but you.</li>
            <li> It was to messy and I am just having a very hard time getting lashes on right.</li>
            <li> Absolutely No where, from what i can tell.5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> The bottle also lasts long if you use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> glue was sooo hard to get off my eyes and left the area around my eyes dry.</li>
            <li> Be really careful when you use this stuff!</li>
            <li> Be really careful!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;alot of other products</li>
            <li> Although a little goes a long way (I still have from my previous order)</li>
            <li> Works as well as other products on the shelf, but, has dark color adhesive.</li>
            <li> This product works really well with my fake eyelashes, I&#x27;ve used other eyelash glue before and they don&#x27;t work so well</li>
            <li> This adhesive is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I proceeded to twist the cap and found that it was already exposed to air so the pigmentation was already dark and the glue was tacky to the touch.</li>
            <li> It blended in well with my dark eyelashes, and makeup.</li>
            <li> Other than that it holds well!</li>
            <li> The black intensifies the dark lashes.</li>
            <li> and i thought it was suppose to be black or dark brown...</li>
            <li> AND IT DOESNT GET RUNNY BLACK STREEKS</li>
            <li> I DONT KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO PURCHASE THE BLACK COLOR.</li>
            <li> This is black and stays black and gets on your eyelid and makes your makeup look like it&#x27;s messed up.  </li>
            <li> Trying to get them off was a nightmare, although I don&#x27;t typically use a adhesive remover to get eyelashes off.</li>
            <li> then black</li>
            <li> Upon inspection, the bottom portion of the tube had black smears on it.</li>
            <li> And virtually fool proof since it dries black to match the lash line and liner</li>
            <li> you will have a mess and your lids will be glued.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never put lashes on this glue might not be the one for you because if you mess up (as we all do)</li>
            <li> If you wear lashes this dark tone adhesive is the way to go!</li>
            <li> AS FOR ME, ILL CONTINUE TO BUY THE DUO CLEAR ADHESIVE.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money</li>
            <li> but it gets messy it should of came with something to make it easier to put on lashes</li>
            <li> I always wear thick black eyeliner with them and the black glue works well with that.</li>
            <li> This adhesive works very well with a set of your false lashes!!  </li>
            <li> Bad to use, and more expensive than price shops, expensive one third, regret the s</li>
            <li> IN tube was very little .</li>
            <li> hard to use and is messy</li>
            <li> Smells awful, just ok I guess.  </li>
            <li> It creates glue balls from hell which probably could kill your small pets and cause corneal damage if they get in your eye.  </li>
            <li> but it clings to your eyelids, so hard to get off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to just wipe off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to alot of things and have sensitive skin, so when I used this I knew the risks I could face (ugly rash?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to get off your lids after use though, but it&#x27;s lasted me forever!</li>
            <li> This is a must if you wear false lashes.</li>
            <li> It also wrecks the false eyelashes which at $4.00 a pair I have learned to wear a week each.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone that uses false lashes.</li>
            <li> very small though, so don&#x27;t lose it!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry awkwardly!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this glue.</li>
            <li> I think maybe they sent the wrong one.</li>
            <li> it can b difficult at times to apply, all in all its not that bad.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> This glue makes my eyes react to it really bad.</li>
            <li> the smell was bad</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awful!!</li>
            <li> It smelled just like hair extension glue, and if you have smelled that before, you will understand how horrible it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it gets the job done and for this price , I&#x27;d  probably purchase it again. the dark adhesive is nice but can ruin your eyeshadow if you smudge it a lot.</li>
            <li> This lash glue does what it says ... Very good quality, easy to use and most of all it&#x27;s very gently on your natural lashes. It definitely has staying power (no shifting or touch-ups during the day at all); considering this it&#x27;s surprising that the removal is so easy!! I simply wash my face during my shower at night and my \\&quot;falsies\\&quot; slip right off - the glue comes off easily on the strip lash as well. Loveeesss it!! Although a little goes a long way (I still have from my previous order) I still went ahead and re-ordered and I&#x27;m awaiting my second order now!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE: 27 July 2013 - I NEVER got this SECOND order!! Placed it but NEVER got it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awful!! No matter which type of lash you prefer (soft or thick) you will spend more time cleaning this goop up than wearing the lashes. It takes an hour to get the glue to adhere to the lash and another hour to clean up the mess!! Did they not test this product???? Please ladies, makeup artist etc...STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> More gray than black...</li>
            <li> I have had better lash glue.  this one works nicely for strip lashes.  you have to work fast or they won&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li> its okay for a back up do not like useing black its very liquidly and you cant use very much</li>
            <li> This particular brand is one I always use when doing my eyelashes.  The adhesive is by Ardell&#x27;s and is the top of the line.  So if you are ooking to make a chane to something that is dependable Ardell&#x27;s should be your 1st option.</li>
            <li> The black intensifies the dark lashes.</li>
            <li> Love the black adhesive! Will not be going back to clear- as in never seemed to dry entirely clear anyway and I would have to reapply eyeliner to cover. This adhesive works great holds great and dries the color of my black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> it stick really well but it dry gray for me and my eyeliner is really black but only in pic but for daily use is ok</li>
            <li> This is the only glue I would use for my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing false lashes and this adhesive is really easy to use. It dries fast but not so fast that you can&#x27;t make quick adjustments.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m searching on it !!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good and I love the value of the dark !!</li>
            <li> The product came fast and I love it! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this glue. EVER. It&#x27;s long lasting and a dark color, so I don&#x27;t have to wait until the glue dries like I do with white adhesives. I go to school for 7 hours, so I need a product that will last just as long. It does! It&#x27;s also easy to peel off without ripping my real lashes. Sometimes I use makeup remover and it works just as fine. Not too sticky to the point where I can&#x27;t get it off after a long day, and not too loose to the point that it&#x27;s strength weakens during my school day.. The bottle also lasts long if you use a little at a time. You just need a thin line and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li> The best lash adhesive!</li>
            <li> Love this item. Works as well as other products on the shelf, but, has dark color adhesive. Which is great with black lashes!</li>
            <li> I REALLY DID NOT CARE FOR THIS ADHESIVE--PARTICULARLY BECAUSE ITS BLACK. ITS ALSO RUNNY AND DOESNT HOLD UP WELL. THE CLEAR DUO IS MUCH BETTER AND IT DOESNT GET RUNNY BLACK STREEKS ALL OVER YOUR FACE LIKE THIS ONE DOES. I DONT KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO PURCHASE THE BLACK COLOR. IF YOU WANT A MORE NATURAL LOOK, YOU CAN USE CLEAR AND USE A BLACK PENCIL OVER IT. AS FOR ME, ILL CONTINUE TO BUY THE DUO CLEAR ADHESIVE.</li>
            <li> If you like to use false eyelashes to dress up for events, this glue works fantastic, it dries fast and black. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely fashion. The Ardell Lash Glue line has always been one of my favorites because it does work. Lashes stay on for as long as desired. Must be applied as directed.</li>
            <li> This lash adheisive is good. It is a pretty dark gray. You have to be careful to not put on to much you will have a mess and your lids will be glued.</li>
            <li> Does the job! Dries nice and dark so you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery. I have only used white for many years. Good color but it clings to your eyelids, so hard to get off. In a truly important I would use the white.</li>
            <li> good eyelash glue dries great,dries black witch helps a lot,easy to put on and stay put just dab on let get tacky  for one minute and apply on upper or lower lash and welcome to girly town, no haters allowed, good glue</li>
            <li> ITS  RUNNY AND DOESNT HOLD UP WELL.TERRIBL SMELL.I DIDN&#x60;T RECOMMEND IT.AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT I HAVE EYES ACH AND THEY GOT RED .STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Great product, i used to use the clear, but the Black is completely invisible when dry and seems to be much better, especially if you buy the black strip lashes, and wear black eyeliner. Lashes stay till i take them off, which at times can be over night.I will only buy from this seller because they can be trusted 100%, not to mention where can you really get this price? Absolutely No where, from what i can tell.5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> Be really careful when you use this stuff! Be really careful!</li>
            <li> my package tube was open , when I resev. My package tube was open , when I resev. IN tube was very little .</li>
            <li> I think maybe they sent the wrong one. Did not come in a squeeze tube but a glass jar. I got some on my eyelashes and it would not come off.</li>
            <li> A must my beauty Divas so much better then the clear glue. Easy to apply and handle. You can apply any way you want but I usually start outside of the end of my eye unlike the traditional starting at the inner corner of the eye. Its optional I just feel like its easier for me to handle and set</li>
            <li> It sticks really great. I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis for lashes simply because it does stick TOO much that i find it  damaging my lashes when i take them off. So I only use it when I know I will be dancing and out long because I know they will stay on. My main purpose for them is gluing rhinestones to my face for festivities!</li>
            <li> It works really great and had no problems at all ...very good product!! I would buy again. Thanks for the product</li>
            <li> I like this product! It works great and you cannot see the glue because it turns black and blends in with your eyeliner/mascara!</li>
            <li> This product works really well with my fake eyelashes, I&#x27;ve used other eyelash glue before and they don&#x27;t work so well, I&#x27;ve been trying to wear fake eyelashes for over a year and the glue always failed, but this is one is the best one so far, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> My daughter went to apply this for her dance revue and the glue did not work, thank goodness we had an extra tube of eyelash glue on hand.</li>
            <li> Love this lash adhesive especially in dark. It tends to blend in with the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for and could not find in the stores!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality of this glue. It dries black and, holds strong all day. This is a must if you wear false lashes.</li>
            <li> all was ok thanks, I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more</li>
            <li> Super grip! I never have to worry that these lashes are going to come off or out of place. The dark color allows the lashes to blend into my liner perfectly. Excellent product and the only one I trust.</li>
            <li> It is a darker color, but dries okay. It&#x27;s really hard to get off your lids after use though, but it&#x27;s lasted me forever!</li>
            <li> I am not too enthused about this product. I prefer Duo lash adhesive as this lash grip is not that good. It does not hold like Duo and it not as strong and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> The adhesive takes approx 15 to 20 seconds to have the perfect consistency before apply to my eyes. It dries black which makes it blend in nicely with my make up</li>
            <li> We bought 4 and received one</li>
            <li> The dark adhesive glue is perfect for my black individual lashes. But it did not last for 24 hours. The following morning I had to replace most of my lashes.</li>
            <li> Smells awful, just ok I guess.  I think I should had purchased the DUO instead, those have been reviewed with great comments.  Will use it up, but will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> this is good glue. it doesn&#x27;t dry so fast that you cant anchor your lashes properly but doesn&#x27;t take so long to dry that they come off on your fingers. I would recommend this glue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy clear eyelash glue from now on.  This is black and stays black and gets on your eyelid and makes your makeup look like it&#x27;s messed up.  It&#x27;s hard to just wipe off.  You have to get a Q-tip with makeup remover on it to get it off.</li>
            <li> best lash glue ever, i dont wear fake lashes often so when i wear them THEY BETTER STAY PUT, this glue makes sure of that</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be ordering again. When it dries it looks just like eye liner. It sticks very wekk but is not difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> great product and fast</li>
            <li> very unsatisfied with this product which I did not expect because I usually buy eyelash products from this brand , but this glue is too gooey and does not stick well.</li>
            <li> Very good when appyling good lashes</li>
            <li> Works good ,sticks well .</li>
            <li> I love this glue, I put it on eyelashes and it lasted all day, very effective. If you are sensitive to makeup, it might not be the product for you because the glue does get black if your eyes water, but otherwise a great product!</li>
            <li> This is a nice glue-liner for falsies.  clean lines and easy to apply and remove.  You will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> This glue works great.... For awhile. It was like it died up on my face. The edges of the eyelash started to curl in and they were very solid/scratchy. Trying to get them off was a nightmare, although I don&#x27;t typically use a adhesive remover to get eyelashes off.</li>
            <li> so i orderd this thinking the glue was black to match my eyeliner but its more grayish then black so gonna try the clear one</li>
            <li> Bad to use, and more expensive than price shops, expensive one third, regret the s*** out of me.</li>
            <li> Bad quality. Don&#x27;t waste money</li>
            <li> ok so i got an e mail saying your item has been shipped boy had it ever i got it the very next day wooo hooo now just need the lashes to give it a try-fyi i am turning ummmm older in a few weeks and decided me n my daughters were gonna gave a beauty nite :) falsh lashes and all.. I CANNOT WAIT...</li>
            <li> It shipped really quick, and worked well. It also comes off well with normal eye make up remover. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I did not like this lash glue at all. I have been wearing lashes for a few years now and normally use the clear glue, but from the reviews on this glue I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glue was sooo hard to get off my eyes and left the area around my eyes dry. It smelled just like hair extension glue, and if you have smelled that before, you will understand how horrible it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not order this again.</li>
            <li> Best one I have used so far, but my eyes are slightly sensitive to eyelash glue so that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars. However, the glue adheres all day, easy to apply, dries just quick enough.</li>
            <li> This glue makes my eyes react to it really bad. It is watery and very strong fumed. The fumes in it was so strong that I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered lashes ever I didn&#x27;t know what to get and this glue was recommended so I purchased it. The product itself is great, can hold for a long time and is easy to remove.  The only downside is that it does dry black and for a first timer it might not work for you. If you&#x27;ve never put lashes on this glue might not be the one for you because if you mess up (as we all do) when it dries it leaves evidence in places you might not want it i.e. your lids, or brow area. I ordered the clear drying glue and use that one. But have both. Again this product is great but for first time users not so good.</li>
            <li> the price of the product was great, and the quality is fine too. I use lashes for photo shoots here and there and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> This adhesive is not worth it.  It is one of the lowest quality lash adhesives I have ever tried.  Does not hold anything.</li>
            <li> It was to messy and I am just having a very hard time getting lashes on right. I have used this type of product before with no problems/</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy to find eyelash adhesive in the dark color.  Ardell is a great brand with products that deliver.</li>
            <li> this product worked very well and it came pretty fast !&lt;br /&gt;alot of other products im still waiting for from over 4 weeks ago !!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it but I&#x27;m sure it works great. I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it would be have to give 5 without actually using this product. The package was squished but that is probably just my mail mans fault. Anyway I&#x27;m happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> contains formaldehyde</li>
            <li> I like this product, but the smell throws me completely off. It smells like a hair relaxer, and that made me cautious at first to put on my eyes. Other than that it holds well! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for first timers because it goes on black and stays black.</li>
            <li> when i recieved this item in the mail the item was in a mail bag .. inside of that bag was a empty little box someone stole the glue and put the empy box back inside the mail bag and mail it !!</li>
            <li> Good consistency!  Sticks quickly and stays where you put it.  I am happy with the feel of the product. Yes.</li>
            <li> works wonderfully, lashes stay on perfectly the whole day.  Just have to be prepared for the dark instead of the clear</li>
            <li> great to use when using false lashes...holds until you take off...a must have when wearing falsies...better than all the rest in my opinion</li>
            <li> Everything seemed to be fine until I opened the box to retrieve the product. Upon inspection, the bottom portion of the tube had black smears on it. I proceeded to twist the cap and found that it was already exposed to air so the pigmentation was already dark and the glue was tacky to the touch. I usually love this product but my experience with this shipment and shipper didn&#x27;t go so well. I waited an entire month for this to arrive and it was not worth the time or money. I thought this was a more convenient route, but I&#x27;ll pack up the kids and grab a tube at the local beauty shop before ordering lash glue online again.</li>
            <li> It will rip your eyelashes out.  True, a Tsunami could not blow your flash eyelashes off if you use this stuff but good luck removing it too.  It also wrecks the false eyelashes which at $4.00 a pair I have learned to wear a week each.  It creates glue balls from hell which probably could kill your small pets and cause corneal damage if they get in your eye.  Not to mention if this stuff gets on your other makeup: don&#x27;t even try to clean it up.  Throw it out and think good thoughts such as: &amp;#34;I am still living&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> glue makes lashes stick wonderfully, cant get wet even though it says water proof its not but over then that it looks great makes lashes look amazing just use liquid eyeliner over it.</li>
            <li> hard to use and is messy</li>
            <li> Was very pleased.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about white glue messing up my eyeliner cause these add to the liner.</li>
            <li> This has great sticking power, but is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD A CHANCE TO USE THIS PRODUCT YET AS I AM STILL WAITING ON THE EYE LASHES I ORDERED.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. Does its job and even tho it can b difficult at times to apply, all in all its not that bad.</li>
            <li> like this product my mother used it a lot when she was younger. Love it she is teaching me how to use it. she is putting on my lashes for me</li>
            <li> made a difference, worked well, easy to use.</li>
            <li> At least the cheap lashes I recently purchased sticked. I think I could of bought a better adhesive though. I give 3 stars</li>
            <li> Lashgrip is right!  This is the best lash adhesive I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It is easy to apply and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my lashes lifting or slipping. The lashes stay on until I take them off.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It just takes like 30 seconds or more to dry so you have to hold it there so it doesn&#x27;t dry awkwardly!</li>
            <li> it works very well. the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> Works but smells really wierd.</li>
            <li> Very good. Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> I suck at putting on lashes, but on the occassions I get them on this works just fine. User errors</li>
            <li> it works fine the only thing i was like,what?!? with was the color it was like a light grey color and i thought it was suppose to be black or dark brown... it came in a tube and everything.....</li>
            <li> This eye lash glue is the best i have ever used. I would recommend it to anyone that uses false lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but it&#x27;s too runny, but it blends good with the eyeliner and stays on so it has a good grip and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I give this product four stars instead of five because it takes more than 30 sec. to get tacky and it holds the lashes but not for more than two days. I do like how it&#x27;s easier to remove the lashes but it&#x27;s a bit too easy for me. Considering the price and free shipping I feel like I have my moneys worth though.. If you want your lashes to last a week this is not the glue for you. overall it&#x27;s a good lash glue especially if your a beginner with falses.</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to become tacky.</li>
            <li> the smell was bad and I don&#x27;t think it really did a good job.</li>
            <li> Love the black glue.  You don&#x27;t need to put eyelinger on your lashes. Last a long time without redoing. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the best eyelash-putter-oner but this glue is awesome. I always wear thick black eyeliner with them and the black glue works well with that. It also comes off easily for when I smudge some. They stuck really well, too, and held the whole time.</li>
            <li> This product was good and came very fast. It works really well, sticks my eyelashes right on my eyes like it should.</li>
            <li> The seller is great! but the product is super runny.  My box was bent and the whenI opened the adhesive there was no aluminum or anything so all the product dripped out runny! this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased eyelash glue so maybe that is normal but I spilled like have the contents just by opening it.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube very easily, and it doesn&#x27;t come with anything to apply it with, so I use a small brush, but other than that, great all day glue, makes my lashes stay in place! Easy to take off at the end of the day also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very small though, so don&#x27;t lose it! (Lost it the day I opened the package. Found it *luckily* two days later!)</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Durable, long lasting. And virtually fool proof since it dries black to match the lash line and liner (if you use liner). Long lasting!! Easy to remove. And I love that so far my bottle hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34; up with any dried liner. Makes applying lashes so much easier and quicker!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my lashes, and I couldnt get them to stick, I am going to play around with it, but it really wasnt working like the normal white adhesive.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this false lash adhesive is black!  So much easier to cover up and deal with when continuing to apply the rest of your eye make up.  This adhesive works very well with a set of your false lashes!!  Seller was a pleasure to do business with!  Thank you!!  Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I use this to apply my lashes, and I love it! I love that it is the dark adhesive so it blends in well with my lashes and eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I really like it, it&#x27;s a good product thanks for sending back to me love this product make your eye look perfect wit out no color!</li>
            <li> If you wear lashes this dark tone adhesive is the way to go! I love this product!</li>
            <li> Finally a adhesive others can&#x27;t see. It blended in well with my dark eyelashes, and makeup. The consistency is perfect, but only after I rolled the tube in-between my palms to warm it, and blend all the ingredients together. It&#x27;s amazing, and kept my lashes intact, and on my lash line, and not in the chip bowl.</li>
            <li> Sticks pretty good but it gets messy it should of came with something to make it easier to put on lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to alot of things and have sensitive skin, so when I used this I knew the risks I could face (ugly rash? swelling? who knows?) Anyway, this stuff was amazing. It lasts all day! Dries clear so if you&#x27;re a little messy, no one will know but you. Best part, I didn&#x27;t get any reactions and this stuff comes off easily with eye makeup remover (I use Almay&#x27;s).  I worked a 12hrs shift, and got compliments from coworkers about how good my lashes looked throughout the day:)</li>
            <li> I really like this product it looks more natural and I got complements when I used it I defiantly would recommend this product I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> The item is good dry&#x27;s very quick and the lashes wont fall off.love it will defenetly purchase again and would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> this glue is good to use, when it drys it&#x27;s kinda of gummy so you can remove the eyelashes at any time but they will stay in place until you want to take them off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it lasts all day long and is black so it works with eyeliner just fine. I bought two tubes, and I think it was a great decision because it&#x27;s a small tube.</li>
    </ol>
