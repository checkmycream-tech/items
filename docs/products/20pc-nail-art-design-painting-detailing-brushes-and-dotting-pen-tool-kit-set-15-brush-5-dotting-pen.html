            <li>Gift for a friend and by far best gift ever she loves it.</li>
            <li>Great little set for a great price!  </li>
            <li>Brushes came and look okay</li>
            <li>she is only using the dotting tools now, but her dot come out perfect.</li>
            <li>Love them they are my fav for when I do nail art</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I can find something better.</li>
            <li>As an artist, someone is generally as good as their tools and these are very much worth it.</li>
            <li>but so far it doesn&#x27;t look like that great of quality.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my daughter, she&#x27;s having fun making creative nail designs.</li>
            <li>but it delivered in a cheap plastic envelope that doesn&#x27;t separate or protect the brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are great and do what they are supposed to, but the absence of the dotting tools upset me.</li>
            <li>I found these brushes to be very useful.</li>
            <li>Makes for a lot of fun time with my niece!</li>
            <li>my daughter really like these, its actually more than she needed</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Also the dotting tools don&#x27;t very much in size.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>I need one more larger size</li>
            <li>(She doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to anyone interested in detail painting of the nails.</li>
            <li>The first time using one of the brushes the head came off.</li>
            <li>Many different sizes dotters and brushes with a holder that&#x27;s also pretty nifty.  </li>
            <li>She mainly wanted the dotting tools so it really doesn&#x27;t matter, but one of the brushes were bent.</li>
            <li>Was only able to use the doters; no extra large one, given multiples of the same sizes.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to the person who wants to do their nails at home!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s and easy fix with a little glue</li>
            <li>Ok not very good quality</li>
            <li>If your looking for a legitimate professional nail art kit, I would not recomend this one for this price.</li>
            <li>but the brushes and dotting tools get messy quick and it very hard to clean them!</li>
            <li>only negative I could see was one of the brush tips fell off, but was easily glued back on.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> There are a few dupes of sizes but there should be enough variety to make a desired manicure/pedicure.</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow, as international shipping tends to be.</li>
            <li> but others I use for clearing built up dust in small crevices.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> You literally cannot go wrong with this price.</li>
            <li> have asked whether or not she has fake nails.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Brushes are worthless.  </li>

            <li> Great little set for a great price!  Bought these for my daughter, she&#x27;s having fun making creative nail designs.</li>
            <li> brushes are low quality but get the job done, had to reglue the metal part to the wood handle but they work as expected</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to use them! very cheap and good quality</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted...</li>

            <li> Brushes came and look okay but I purposely bought this set as it came with the case...but it delivered in a cheap plastic envelope that doesn&#x27;t separate or protect the brushes.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> I found these brushes to be very useful. Some my daughter uses to paint her nails yes, but others I use for clearing built up dust in small crevices. (Sewing machine, keyboard etc)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get one of the sizes I wanted.  I need one more larger size so now I have to buy another set.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these</li>
            <li> I think this is an ok product! They work well but the brushes and dotting tools get messy quick and it very hard to clean them!</li>
            <li> my daughter really like these, its actually more than she needed she is only using the dotting tools now, but her dot come out perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my teenage daughter and she hasn&#x27;t stopped using it yet!&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I could see was one of the brush tips fell off, but was easily glued back on.&lt;br /&gt;She has been very happy with the tools and her friends have asked whether or not she has fake nails. (She doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to anyone interested in detail painting of the nails.</li>
            <li> I only received the 15 brushes. Unless I misread something I thought it came with 5 dotting tools also. The brushes are great and do what they are supposed to, but the absence of the dotting tools upset me.</li>
            <li> Ok not very good quality</li>
            <li> I just got them and went to pull one out and it broke. I know ibonly paid $7 but come on I haven&#x27;t used it and it broke.</li>
            <li> The first time using one of the brushes the head came off. :/</li>
            <li> 20 pc nail art design painting detailing brushes &amp; dotting pen was excellent &amp; for the price I love will order from here again</li>
            <li> Bought this for my tween daughter who is into nail art and she loves it.  Many different sizes dotters and brushes with a holder that&#x27;s also pretty nifty.  She loves having an assortment and has spent hours upon hours creating different designs for her nails.  Quality of the dotters are excellent and the quality of the brushes are pretty good as well.  For the price and variety, this was a great buy!!</li>
            <li> Love them they are my fav for when I do nail art</li>
            <li> Great value. Shipping was slow, as international shipping tends to be. Arrived just as described. Can&#x27;t beat this set!</li>
            <li> does what they are meant to do!!!! Makes for a lot of fun time with my niece! I would recommend to girls of all ages.</li>
            <li> I have not had an opportnity to try out all the brushes but they seem... ok. I was looking through them, not to long after I got it (not even used once yet) and the brush part seperated from the wood. It&#x27;s and easy fix with a little glue but so far it doesn&#x27;t look like that great of quality. Also the dotting tools don&#x27;t very much in size. There are a few dupes of sizes but there should be enough variety to make a desired manicure/pedicure. If your looking for a legitimate professional nail art kit, I would not recomend this one for this price. It will work for me untill I can find something better.</li>
            <li> Love these! Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my best friend who loves to do nails, she recently got a chance to use them on me and it turned out incredible! As an artist, someone is generally as good as their tools and these are very much worth it.</li>
            <li> Gift for a friend and by far best gift ever she loves it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Girlfriend&#x27;s birthday gift. She mainly wanted the dotting tools so it really doesn&#x27;t matter, but one of the brushes were bent. Its not that big of a deal, she loves it so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful 21 piece if you include the fancy case. My classmates and I waited patiently for this to arrive. Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> very happy with my brushes</li>
            <li> This is a great buy for yourself or as a gift. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great price and great assortment but the end of the brushes fall off. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not glued on well. Bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Brushes are worthless.  Was only able to use the doters; no extra large one, given multiples of the same sizes.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, and my granddaughter seems to be very happy with the product. Seems to be a successful purchase.</li>
