    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This one just seems to be the best of both worlds for us.  </li>
            <li>Perfect sunscreen for lifeguarding.</li>
            <li>I checked the EWG site and this receives the best rating if 1 for safety.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful too.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The best sunscreen ever.  </li>
            <li>(And he has very fair skin)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really incredible when you think about it.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen smells great and wears great!  </li>
            <li>Best safe sunscreen we&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li>Great for a day at the zoo or a trip to the park.</li>
            <li>- this stayed great all day -</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Thank you Honest Company!</li>
            <li>I do love the honest company though!!</li>
            <li>Sun protection seemed good too, she didn&#x27;t get burned even after playing in the water for around an hour when I took a break to reapply.  </li>
            <li>But I LOVED the fact of no chemicals, and that your baby could not have a allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>The sun protection afforded by this sunscreen is good.  </li>
            <li>We both enjoyed beautiful tans and no burn, no peeling.</li>
            <li>If honest company can improve texture it would be a good one too, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again as it is now.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients!</li>
            <li>Make sure to give it time to soak in before going to the beach, or your child will look like a piece of sandpaper!</li>
            <li>I am sob glad I decided to try this!</li>
            <li>We love this sunscreen - we even use it on our dog&#x27;s noses!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the best precaution against the sun is covering up, so now I first cover up sleeves and head and save the sunscreen for the exposed areas.</li>
            <li>My sister had Babyganics Mineral Based spray on sunscreen that I used and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Honest...</li>
            <li>I like the Honest company but this tube leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked everything else that we&#x27;ve purchased from them as well.  </li>
            <li>The product works well, but the texture is kind of ick.</li>
            <li>However, not the case with The Honest Company sunscreen.</li>
            <li>A great product and eco friendly.</li>
            <li>But for infants and toddlers, this is the most amazing sunscreen you&#x27;ll try.</li>
            <li>We were extremely pleased with Honest Co. Sunscreen 30.</li>
            <li>Amazing natural sunblock, perfect on your skin, lasts longer than most</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this sunscreen on my daughter (19 months) after hearing about the Honest company products - albeit from the Honest company&#x27;s own advertisement/website.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy and stay healthy!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love the way I can see the water bead up on the skin, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honest company zinc-based block was ok.</li>
            <li>We applied it to both of our kids (5 and 8) before heading to the pool yesterday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because I would not trust this product on my kids now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greasy, but isn&#x27;t most sunscreen greasy?</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m at the beach that what I&#x27;m expecting, and it&#x27;s ok with me.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>To top things off</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen, because I wanted to keep the environment safe from chemicals.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the ingredients are non-detrimental to one&#x27;s health,  However, the best sunscreen for me, is one that I am willing to use, and this is not it.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural sunscreen and this is a great option for a healthy sunscreen BUT not for adults in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Have wet wipes handy so you can wipe your hands after applying!! :)</li>
            <li>I used to use BurnOut  because it rubbed in so easily.  </li>
            <li>admire the company for putting out products for environmentally and health conscious consumers, but make sure the product is safe and is effective.</li>
            <li>We were heading into the yard for some playing, while I did some planting on one of the first warm and sunny days this year.  </li>
            <li>thought that Honest sunscreen would be a good substitute since it&#x27;s sold in several retail locations and is currently available at Costco.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine</li>
            <li>It is fine for use on the face as well as the body.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of the lotion is perfectly fine and blends into the skin.  </li>
            <li>so I switched to a different brand (researched at EWG) that I&#x27;m extremely happy with.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have light and fair skin and wore it on a 3 hour bike ride in the summer where I perspired heavily.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that over this Honest Company goop... unless you enjoy having every grain of sand stick to you on the beach.</li>
            <li>so I checked out the environmental working group highly recommended blocks, and settled on 3 to experiment with: burnout kids, honest company, and</li>
            <li>It feels as though you are applying some clay-based product, and does not wash off easily in the shower (good if you have kids playing in the water outside, I suppose).</li>
            <li>I live in a warm humid climate</li>
            <li>The current price listed on Amazon is obscene, but Honest offers it at a fair price.</li>
            <li>I bought this product directly from the Honest Company&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>This is fine for a child, but most adult women would not find it acceptable.  </li>
            <li>There is now a new spray and stick which may be better</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and have had many burns in the past.  </li>
            <li>It is not my favorite but at least it is pretty easy to apply and it has really good ingredients...</li>
            <li>But, as an avid outdoors person with fair skin, sunscreen is a must, so I left it on.</li>
            <li>This I suppose would make it great for a water park, but for everyday use, I need to find something else.</li>
            <li>it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Reiterating the similar comments - it&#x27;s effective, but so so greasy.</li>
            <li>but I would also definitely use the Honest one again.</li>
            <li>I honestly believe that this is the same as their hand cream (which I like when I use it at night before bed) but with zinc oxide in to provide SPF.  </li>
            <li>I love their products that I&#x27;ve tried so far...</li>
            <li>SPF 30 is high enough for me, and I trust that its ingredients are good for you.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to be happy with this product as I am trying to be mindful of the harmful ingredients in the skin care products I use, but this was simply not worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy but spreads on fine and rubs in easily, albeit leaving a bit of a glistening sheen - again, like most sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>We went in and it took a good amount of soap and scrubbing to get this goopy mess off her and</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>After a recent trip, we discovered that nothing was better than what we had taken with us.</li>
            <li>I used again in whistler several weeks later on a bright sunny day and didn&#x27;t burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li>This product only received 3 stars because its natural and although new to the honest company ( this was in my first subscription bundle from their website)</li>
            <li>The sun is quite strong, even though the temperature is in the low 80s that time of year.  </li>
            <li>When we got home, they were both bright pink on all of their exposed skin and red and complaining of burning, itchy skin by dinner time.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Immediately upon applying it, it was very sticky and &#x27;goopy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>So, so much.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen didn&#x27;t come off, but I ended up with a very splotchy sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about what goes on and in my children and this makes the cut.  </li>
            <li>I have never broken out from sunscreen in my life.  </li>
            <li>Most store bought sunscreens seem to make the burn worse instead of better.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not greasy, and I&#x27;ve not been either when I&#x27;ve used it, and we&#x27;re not white, which is what I also find with many of the other natural sunscreens, but I&#x27;ll use them any way if that&#x27;s what it takes to stay safe.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite expensive, kind of greasy and ran out very quickly</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty clear.</li>
            <li>I also used the Honest Company stick for face and small body parts.</li>
            <li>Very sticky, hard to rub in, and smells kind of blah.</li>
            <li>I wait until the last possible minute before leaving the house to put it on my kids, and then follow them around to make sure they don&#x27;t touch any of the furniture on the way out.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find (only on-line and in pharmacies), but has excellent results .  </li>
            <li>No weird chemicals and if applied as directed, no weird white look!</li>
            <li>My husband did make the mess of this stuff that many reviewers mention but one</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The kind of sticky that hand wash has a hard time of removing with just one pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and soft.</li>
            <li>I had no issues with white residue, I found that even when using an ample amount the white rubs in and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>Thick and does not rub in very easy.  </li>
            <li>product is VERY VERY sticky and leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li>No one in our family has ever burned, it soaks in easily, lasts for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Used this on my 6 month old son in FL on vacation and he didn&#x27;t burn once!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Burnout kids was by far my favorite...extremely easy to rub in, left no residual whiteness, didn&#x27;t feel sticky, and stayed on even after long snorkels or pedal boating.  </li>
            <li>I am accustomed to more natural physical blockers, so I know how to properly apply them and can appreciate the white greasy glow they leave.</li>
            <li>and there are no harsh chemical in it.</li>
            <li>No rashes, no irritated eczema and no sun burns, regardless of how sensitive your baby&#x27;s skin is.</li>
            <li>Used on my 1 year old who has sensitive skin and had no breakouts or issues.</li>
            <li>but I would not buy it again because it is very oily (oil stained my shirt) and gives a freakish white tinge to your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a non-chemical sunblock that was easy to rub in, didn&#x27;t turn you white, and didn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky/tacky  with no success for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Works good, very low chemical rating by EWG.org - but doesn&#x27;t dry as &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; as I would like it to on the face - have to rub it in a little too long.</li>
            <li>Typically, even with reapplying a normal sunscreen, I&#x27;d get a bit of pinkness the first day or 2 in the sun.</li>
            <li>Might not be concerning to women used to applying make up but for most men, not a good look.</li>
            <li>I am a redhead and for the first time ever in forever i spent the day on the and did NOT burn at all.</li>
            <li>This product goes on very greasy, hard to apply evenly and turned our skin super white!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed some of The Honest Company products but so far this has been the worst.  </li>
            <li>I bought my 4 year old a couple of these for school and while she is never burned, she looks like a big grease ball.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it is a healthy alternative to most sunscreens, which contain active ingredients that are allegedly bad for one&#x27;s health.  </li>
            <li>(sorry, I hope that&#x27;s not gross) and two because he tried to use too much, which is more likely the culprit.  </li>
            <li>I actually like that it&#x27;s a little greasy when you first rub it in</li>
            <li>The texture is not thick as other natural products I have tried but it is definitely the greasiest sunscreen I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>No, I wouldn&#x27;t spread this all over my face and/or body and go out on a casual day around town, but for the beach it&#x27;s totally fine!  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy but spreads on fine and rubs in easily, albeit leaving a bit of a glistening sheen - again, like most sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> We went in and it took a good amount of soap and scrubbing to get this goopy mess off her and</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> After a recent trip, we discovered that nothing was better than what we had taken with us.</li>
            <li> I used again in whistler several weeks later on a bright sunny day and didn&#x27;t burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li> This product only received 3 stars because its natural and although new to the honest company ( this was in my first subscription bundle from their website)</li>
            <li> The sun is quite strong, even though the temperature is in the low 80s that time of year.  </li>
            <li> When we got home, they were both bright pink on all of their exposed skin and red and complaining of burning, itchy skin by dinner time.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well.  </li>
            <li> Immediately upon applying it, it was very sticky and &#x27;goopy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> So, so much.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen didn&#x27;t come off, but I ended up with a very splotchy sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what goes on and in my children and this makes the cut.  </li>
            <li> I have never broken out from sunscreen in my life.  </li>
            <li> Most store bought sunscreens seem to make the burn worse instead of better.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not greasy, and I&#x27;ve not been either when I&#x27;ve used it, and we&#x27;re not white, which is what I also find with many of the other natural sunscreens, but I&#x27;ll use them any way if that&#x27;s what it takes to stay safe.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive, kind of greasy and ran out very quickly</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty clear.</li>
            <li> I also used the Honest Company stick for face and small body parts.</li>
            <li> Very sticky, hard to rub in, and smells kind of blah.</li>
            <li> I wait until the last possible minute before leaving the house to put it on my kids, and then follow them around to make sure they don&#x27;t touch any of the furniture on the way out.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find (only on-line and in pharmacies), but has excellent results .  </li>
            <li> No weird chemicals and if applied as directed, no weird white look!</li>
            <li> My husband did make the mess of this stuff that many reviewers mention but one</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The kind of sticky that hand wash has a hard time of removing with just one pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and soft.</li>
            <li> I had no issues with white residue, I found that even when using an ample amount the white rubs in and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> Thick and does not rub in very easy.  </li>
            <li> product is VERY VERY sticky and leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li> No one in our family has ever burned, it soaks in easily, lasts for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Used this on my 6 month old son in FL on vacation and he didn&#x27;t burn once!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Burnout kids was by far my favorite...extremely easy to rub in, left no residual whiteness, didn&#x27;t feel sticky, and stayed on even after long snorkels or pedal boating.  </li>
            <li> I am accustomed to more natural physical blockers, so I know how to properly apply them and can appreciate the white greasy glow they leave.</li>
            <li> and there are no harsh chemical in it.</li>
            <li> No rashes, no irritated eczema and no sun burns, regardless of how sensitive your baby&#x27;s skin is.</li>
            <li> Used on my 1 year old who has sensitive skin and had no breakouts or issues.</li>
            <li> but I would not buy it again because it is very oily (oil stained my shirt) and gives a freakish white tinge to your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a non-chemical sunblock that was easy to rub in, didn&#x27;t turn you white, and didn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky/tacky  with no success for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Works good, very low chemical rating by EWG.org - but doesn&#x27;t dry as &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; as I would like it to on the face - have to rub it in a little too long.</li>
            <li> Typically, even with reapplying a normal sunscreen, I&#x27;d get a bit of pinkness the first day or 2 in the sun.</li>
            <li> Might not be concerning to women used to applying make up but for most men, not a good look.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and for the first time ever in forever i spent the day on the and did NOT burn at all.</li>
            <li> This product goes on very greasy, hard to apply evenly and turned our skin super white!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed some of The Honest Company products but so far this has been the worst.  </li>
            <li> I bought my 4 year old a couple of these for school and while she is never burned, she looks like a big grease ball.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it is a healthy alternative to most sunscreens, which contain active ingredients that are allegedly bad for one&#x27;s health.  </li>
            <li> (sorry, I hope that&#x27;s not gross) and two because he tried to use too much, which is more likely the culprit.  </li>
            <li> I actually like that it&#x27;s a little greasy when you first rub it in</li>
            <li> The texture is not thick as other natural products I have tried but it is definitely the greasiest sunscreen I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li> No, I wouldn&#x27;t spread this all over my face and/or body and go out on a casual day around town, but for the beach it&#x27;s totally fine!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; with no scent, limited ingredients, and highly rated by the EWG.  </li>
            <li> kids have sensitive skin and break out into a rash with other sunscreen products (except water babies by coppertone)</li>
            <li> The new forumla I received this summer had cut the amount of zinc oxide in the tube over half.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even keep it on long enough to see if it worked.</li>
            <li> Typically, as long as I use sunscreen, I do not get burned.</li>
            <li> However, I find myself not wanting to use it, because it&#x27;s main ingredient is non-nano zinc oxide, which is very thick, and leaves a definite white residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s certainly not a &amp;#34;super sheer, can&#x27;t feel it lotion&amp;#34; like some other ones advertise.  </li>
            <li> It was like I&#x27;d rubbed her down with solid crisco.  </li>
            <li> If you have a baby in the house, use THC&#x27;s bundle option and get some of their other items and load up on sunscreen using their 5 items a month deal (get all sunscreen now!) and diapers and such in the colder months and save yourself a ton.  </li>
            <li> so I need sunscreens that are dry!</li>
            <li> , her skin is dry and just SOAKS it up!</li>
            <li> Used all day at a track meet last weekend, skin that usually burns like crazy was protected and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, Honest Company.</li>
            <li> it does make your skin turn a little white</li>
            <li> I spent 7 days kayaking in Belize and did not get burned.</li>
            <li> However, it did feel greasier than I expected to.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve had absolutely no issues.  </li>
            <li> Not too thick, no scent to bother sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is extremely greasy and does not soak in.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I might try other brands</li>
            <li> This is similar to other &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; sunscreens I have used in the past though.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very careful about what we put on our skin and on our pets.</li>
            <li> This is a mineral sunscreen - meaning it goes on white, thick, and sticky, and stays that way.  </li>
            <li> The thick and sticky feeling did not go away, and my skin stayed white.  </li>
            <li> I felt gross and uncomfortable until I finally gave in and went inside and showered to remove it and reapplied another brand.</li>
            <li> Sadly it left me so sticky and white and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Both of my kids know at this point in the game of expensive sunscreens that they don&#x27;t need to use a ton, but not too little either, to make full coverage</li>
            <li> Even though it does not leave you looking shiny, your skin feel oily and a little sticky in a way.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy but what sunscreen isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a little sticky, but again, that&#x27;s just what I&#x27;m expecting from a sunscreen</li>
            <li> However, it has a little strange smell but not strong at all, the consistency reminds me of thick vaseline.</li>
            <li> And it only got worse.  </li>
            <li> If i had reapplied as the instructions stated this may not have been an issue, but I need a sunscreen that can withstand sweat and/or water for a few hours, so I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sticky and heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> To be honest, this is the worst sunscreen I have ever used!</li>
            <li> We went down to Florida this past summer and hung out at the beach</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> it made me itchy all day and break out on my chest (prior to me noticing how bad I burned the next day).</li>
            <li> the worst of it is that that after just 20 minutes outside, she was already a bit red when we came back in.  </li>
            <li> At most I&#x27;d give 3 stars, not for lack of efficacy, but the texture is terrible.</li>
            <li> It had the most disgusting smell - will never buy again.  </li>
            <li> Without a horrible white greesy mess, your child will smell edible and have soft skin too.</li>
            <li> we are very pale)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what a mess she would be at the beach with sand in this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> We used this sunscreen as instructed, placing it on our skin at least 10 minutes before sun exposure.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid to try them for fear they will be the same.</li>
            <li> Applied as directed and despite the white/greasy appearance all over my body I burned badly, my wife also burned and got a rash the next day.</li>
            <li> You get it on them, and within minutes, the poor things are coated in sand.</li>
            <li> I hated the smell, and the greasy feel it left on you and your baby after rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> It was even difficult to get it off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this sunscreen, but was sadly disappointed upon using it at the beach this past weekend.</li>
            <li> And despite being covered by the white sandy coating (which is reapplied twice in our 3 hour visit to the beach), I burned horribly - as in all over my body.</li>
            <li> (everything is very expensive in Bora Bora)....</li>
            <li> This product was particularly bad in that it was so greasy I was covered in sand on the beach today</li>
            <li> I bought this at a retail store before I saw all the bad reviews on amazon, so I almost returned it but decided to try it out myself</li>
            <li> this is just awful!</li>
            <li> Horribly greasy and sticky.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> Terrible sunscreen.</li>
            <li> terrible stuff, stay away.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I am a redhead and for the first time ever in forever i spent the day on the and did NOT burn at all. it does go on white and you have to rub it in a bit however it did not irritate my skin or break out my face like some sunblocks do and there are no harsh chemical in it.</li>
            <li> It worked really well.  I am fair skinned and have had many burns in the past.  I spent 7 days kayaking in Belize and did not get burned.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does smell like ameretto, but I like that. I would not use it for myself, if I was going to spend the day sweating. But for infants and toddlers, this is the most amazing sunscreen you&#x27;ll try. No rashes, no irritated eczema and no sun burns, regardless of how sensitive your baby&#x27;s skin is. Great for a day at the zoo or a trip to the park. Without a horrible white greesy mess, your child will smell edible and have soft skin too. The current price listed on Amazon is obscene, but Honest offers it at a fair price.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good sunscreen. I love the ingredients! However, it has a little strange smell but not strong at all, the consistency reminds me of thick vaseline. Even though it does not leave you looking shiny, your skin feel oily and a little sticky in a way. It goes on pretty clear. It is not my favorite but at least it is pretty easy to apply and it has really good ingredients...</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this sunscreen on my daughter (19 months) after hearing about the Honest company products - albeit from the Honest company&#x27;s own advertisement/website.  We were heading into the yard for some playing, while I did some planting on one of the first warm and sunny days this year.  Immediately upon applying it, it was very sticky and &#x27;goopy&#x27;.  I was hoping it would soak in some while we got her dressed, but no luck.  It was like I&#x27;d rubbed her down with solid crisco.  Once outside, everything that touched her skin stuck. She tripped in the grass and when she got up, grass clippings and etc stuck to her skin and I could not get them off (aside from picking off each one).  I can&#x27;t imagine what a mess she would be at the beach with sand in this stuff!!  Yikes. We went in and it took a good amount of soap and scrubbing to get this goopy mess off her and the worst of it is that that after just 20 minutes outside, she was already a bit red when we came back in.  Not only is the product gross but it also doesn&#x27;t work.  Yikes Honest... this is just awful!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and soft. Make sure to give it time to soak in before going to the beach, or your child will look like a piece of sandpaper! Love the way I can see the water bead up on the skin, so I know it&#x27;s waterproof!</li>
            <li> I like the Honest company but this tube leaves a lot to be desired. It&#x27;s quite expensive, kind of greasy and ran out very quickly so I switched to a different brand (researched at EWG) that I&#x27;m extremely happy with. Honestly, the best precaution against the sun is covering up, so now I first cover up sleeves and head and save the sunscreen for the exposed areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a non-chemical sunblock that was easy to rub in, didn&#x27;t turn you white, and didn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky/tacky  with no success for quite a while. We were heading to Hawaii for 10 days in December (from Seattle, by dec we are very pale) so I checked out the environmental working group highly recommended blocks, and settled on 3 to experiment with: burnout kids, honest company, and blue lizard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest company zinc-based block was ok. At most I&#x27;d give 3 stars, not for lack of efficacy, but the texture is terrible. Very sticky, hard to rub in, and smells kind of blah. It worked fine but they need to improve the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burnout kids was by far my favorite...extremely easy to rub in, left no residual whiteness, didn&#x27;t feel sticky, and stayed on even after long snorkels or pedal boating.  Typically, even with reapplying a normal sunscreen, I&#x27;d get a bit of pinkness the first day or 2 in the sun. I did not burn at all with burnout kids. I used again in whistler several weeks later on a bright sunny day and didn&#x27;t burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue lizard works well too, although because I inadvertently bought a non-waterproof one, I have tested only in the sun in whistler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burnout kids will now be my go-to sunblock...it is definitely worth it. If honest company can improve texture it would be a good one too, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again as it is now.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was disappointed with this product. SPF 30 is high enough for me, and I trust that its ingredients are good for you. However, it did feel greasier than I expected to. I guess that&#x27;s the water-resistant part of it at work, though.</li>
            <li> I bought my 4 year old a couple of these for school and while she is never burned, she looks like a big grease ball. Her teachers tend to get some in her hair and nothing short of 3 washes with dish soap gets this stuff out of hair. It&#x27;s really incredible when you think about it. This I suppose would make it great for a water park, but for everyday use, I need to find something else.</li>
            <li> My husband and I vacationed in Barbados during Easter Week 2014. The sun is quite strong, even though the temperature is in the low 80s that time of year.  We used this sunscreen as instructed, placing it on our skin at least 10 minutes before sun exposure. We both enjoyed beautiful tans and no burn, no peeling. It is fine for use on the face as well as the body.  We still have our tans 3 weeks later. The consistency of the lotion is perfectly fine and blends into the skin.  We were extremely pleased with Honest Co. Sunscreen 30.</li>
            <li> Let me start my review by stating that while I strive to minimize the chemicals that I come in contact with, there are items in which I make an exception.  I think that sunscreen is one of those items.  This is a mineral sunscreen - meaning it goes on white, thick, and sticky, and stays that way.  I put it on, and immediately wanted to take it off.  So, so much.  But, as an avid outdoors person with fair skin, sunscreen is a must, so I left it on. And it only got worse.  The thick and sticky feeling did not go away, and my skin stayed white.  It was even difficult to get it off in the shower.  It also did not prevent sunburn.  To be fair, I have light and fair skin and wore it on a 3 hour bike ride in the summer where I perspired heavily.  The sunscreen didn&#x27;t come off, but I ended up with a very splotchy sunburn.  If i had reapplied as the instructions stated this may not have been an issue, but I need a sunscreen that can withstand sweat and/or water for a few hours, so I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this sunscreen, but was sadly disappointed upon using it at the beach this past weekend. It was SO sticky!! I felt gross and uncomfortable until I finally gave in and went inside and showered to remove it and reapplied another brand. Even in the shower it took multiple soap applications to remove the greasy, sticky residue. I really wanted to be happy with this product as I am trying to be mindful of the harmful ingredients in the skin care products I use, but this was simply not worth it. My sister had Babyganics Mineral Based spray on sunscreen that I used and it was amazing. I would highly recommend that over this Honest Company goop... unless you enjoy having every grain of sand stick to you on the beach.</li>
            <li> Reiterating the similar comments - it&#x27;s effective, but so so greasy. I wait until the last possible minute before leaving the house to put it on my kids, and then follow them around to make sure they don&#x27;t touch any of the furniture on the way out. And don&#x27;t even think about applying it on the beach. You get it on them, and within minutes, the poor things are coated in sand.</li>
            <li> Used on my 1 year old who has sensitive skin and had no breakouts or issues. No sunburns either. It is a little greasy but what sunscreen isn&#x27;t. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> This sunblock for me was too greasy and leaves your skin white. I live in a warm humid climate so I need sunscreens that are dry!</li>
            <li> Not too thick, no scent to bother sensitive skin. Goes on well, need some moisturizer with product but will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this sunscreen.  We have been using  Vanicream Sport since our kids were babies. It is difficult to find (only on-line and in pharmacies), but has excellent results .  No one in our family has ever burned, it soaks in easily, lasts for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film.  It&#x27;s extremely &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; with no scent, limited ingredients, and highly rated by the EWG.  I buy 8 tubes at the beginning of every summer to leave in each of our swim bags, at home, and in the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that Honest sunscreen would be a good substitute since it&#x27;s sold in several retail locations and is currently available at Costco.  This sunscreen is extremely greasy and does not soak in.  We applied it to both of our kids (5 and 8) before heading to the pool yesterday. When we got home, they were both bright pink on all of their exposed skin and red and complaining of burning, itchy skin by dinner time.  We will return what we bought and not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I would give this product a zero if I could because it simply did not work. I am accustomed to more natural physical blockers, so I know how to properly apply them and can appreciate the white greasy glow they leave. This product was particularly bad in that it was so greasy I was covered in sand on the beach today that I could not wipe away or rinse off. And despite being covered by the white sandy coating (which is reapplied twice in our 3 hour visit to the beach), I burned horribly - as in all over my body. This product did nothing to protect my skin from the sun.  I actually bought it for my kids but wanted to try it myself before I put it on them - I&#x27;m glad I did because I would not trust this product on my kids now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what goes on and in my children and this makes the cut.  I&#x27;ll admit to ordering this through THC with one of their bundle deals (which made it a TON cheaper than it is here on Amazon) just to try it out and after seeing that it&#x27;s just a 1 this year on EWG&#x27;s sunscreen rating I&#x27;m sold.  My husband did make the mess of this stuff that many reviewers mention but one, I think it&#x27;s in part because he&#x27;s hairy (sorry, I hope that&#x27;s not gross) and two because he tried to use too much, which is more likely the culprit.  Both of my kids know at this point in the game of expensive sunscreens that they don&#x27;t need to use a ton, but not too little either, to make full coverage and we&#x27;ve had absolutely no issues.  They&#x27;re not greasy, and I&#x27;ve not been either when I&#x27;ve used it, and we&#x27;re not white, which is what I also find with many of the other natural sunscreens, but I&#x27;ll use them any way if that&#x27;s what it takes to stay safe.  This one just seems to be the best of both worlds for us.  If you have a baby in the house, use THC&#x27;s bundle option and get some of their other items and load up on sunscreen using their 5 items a month deal (get all sunscreen now!) and diapers and such in the colder months and save yourself a ton.  I&#x27;ve liked everything else that we&#x27;ve purchased from them as well.  Enjoy and stay healthy!</li>
            <li> I bought this at a retail store before I saw all the bad reviews on amazon, so I almost returned it but decided to try it out myself and I was pleasantly surprised! I think it depends on what you&#x27;re expecting this to be.  No, it&#x27;s certainly not a &amp;#34;super sheer, can&#x27;t feel it lotion&amp;#34; like some other ones advertise.  And p.s. if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, you&#x27;re going to be buying a boatload of chemicals.  No, I wouldn&#x27;t spread this all over my face and/or body and go out on a casual day around town, but for the beach it&#x27;s totally fine!  It&#x27;s greasy, but isn&#x27;t most sunscreen greasy? If I&#x27;m at the beach that what I&#x27;m expecting, and it&#x27;s ok with me.  It&#x27;s thick and creamy but spreads on fine and rubs in easily, albeit leaving a bit of a glistening sheen - again, like most sunscreens.  I had no issues with white residue, I found that even when using an ample amount the white rubs in and absorbs easily.  I guess it&#x27;s a little sticky, but again, that&#x27;s just what I&#x27;m expecting from a sunscreen and it doesn&#x27;t bug me or my daughter.  Sun protection seemed good too, she didn&#x27;t get burned even after playing in the water for around an hour when I took a break to reapply.  All in all, I might try other brands but I would also definitely use the Honest one again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Perfect sunscreen for lifeguarding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural sunscreen and this is a great option for a healthy sunscreen BUT not for adults in my opinion. Sadly it left me so sticky and white and uncomfortable. I couldn&#x27;t wash it off in the shower either. I do love the honest company though!! I just hope they improve their sunscreen. I would try it on kids considering the sticky texture/white color might not bother them. Eeek</li>
            <li> Works good, very low chemical rating by EWG.org - but doesn&#x27;t dry as &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; as I would like it to on the face - have to rub it in a little too long. But I bought a 2nd one.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of sunscreens and this one works! I checked the EWG site and this receives the best rating if 1 for safety.  I don&#x27;t want to put harmful chemicals on my daughter.  I used this on my daughter and myself this last week in vacation in sunny 100+ weather. It worked like a charm. No burns and it stayed on.  It rubs in so you don&#x27;t look white.  I used to use BurnOut  because it rubbed in so easily.  The only problem was it also came off when we got in the water.  I could see it rolling off if my body.  I also used the Honest Company stick for face and small body parts. It is wonderful too. I am sob glad I decided to try this!</li>
            <li> Used this on my 6 month old son in FL on vacation and he didn&#x27;t burn once! (And he has very fair skin) I&#x27;ll be &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; though- I hated the smell, and the greasy feel it left on you and your baby after rubbing it in. But I LOVED the fact of no chemicals, and that your baby could not have a allergic reaction to it. I will be using it again next summer since it worked so well! Have wet wipes handy so you can wipe your hands after applying!! :)</li>
            <li> Best safe sunscreen we&#x27;ve used!  Works well, and stays on.  Also doesn&#x27;t leave a bluish tint like all the others do.</li>
            <li> Efficient sunscreen but I would not buy it again because it is very oily (oil stained my shirt) and gives a freakish white tinge to your face. Might not be concerning to women used to applying make up but for most men, not a good look.</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from the Honest Company&#x27;s website. It smells like a mix between rancid oils and dirt. Not something I want to smear all over my skin and smell all day, that&#x27;s for sure. Also, I&#x27;ve had it on my arm for about an hour now and it&#x27;s still sticky and heavy feeling. Gross. I can&#x27;t imagine putting this stuff on my face. I&#x27;m returning this product.</li>
            <li> Not greasy as was indicated by some.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Horribly greasy and sticky.  The texture is not thick as other natural products I have tried but it is definitely the greasiest sunscreen I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li> it does make your skin turn a little white</li>
            <li> It worked, but it is too oily. When you perspire it gets slimy.</li>
            <li> No weird chemicals and if applied as directed, no weird white look! This sunscreen smells great and wears great!  I would recommend for kids and adults.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells horrible.  I couldn&#x27;t even keep it on long enough to see if it worked. It had the most disgusting smell - will never buy again.  Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> way too oily on your skin!</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen ever.  We went down to Florida this past summer and hung out at the beach - this stayed great all day - no burns at all.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you with that &amp;#34;greased up&amp;#34; feeling either.  A great product and eco friendly.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen - we even use it on our dog&#x27;s noses!  Has everything in it you need for protection and none of the chemicals you don&#x27;t need.  We like that! We&#x27;re very careful about what we put on our skin and on our pets. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed some of The Honest Company products but so far this has been the worst.  It is like smearing petroleum jelly on but thicker and stickier.  I honestly believe that this is the same as their hand cream (which I like when I use it at night before bed) but with zinc oxide in to provide SPF.  There is now a new spray and stick which may be better but I&#x27;m afraid to try them for fear they will be the same.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but the texture is kind of ick. This is similar to other &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; sunscreens I have used in the past though. It feels as though you are applying some clay-based product, and does not wash off easily in the shower (good if you have kids playing in the water outside, I suppose).</li>
            <li> Terrible sunscreen. Applied as directed and despite the white/greasy appearance all over my body I burned badly, my wife also burned and got a rash the next day. I have never burned before with SPF 30. To top things off it made me itchy all day and break out on my chest (prior to me noticing how bad I burned the next day). I have never broken out from sunscreen in my life.  Me and my wife had to buy a $30 bottle of the non-healthy stuff for the rest of our honeymoon (everything is very expensive in Bora Bora)....terrible stuff, stay away. We both used all-terrain brand  in stick form on our faces and had no issues with that brand.</li>
            <li> *** Edited 9/2015: The new forumla I received this summer had cut the amount of zinc oxide in the tube over half. I can no longer recommend this item as my kids burned with it&#x27;s use. Very disappointing, Honest Company. ***   Most store bought sunscreens seem to make the burn worse instead of better. After a recent trip, we discovered that nothing was better than what we had taken with us. However, not the case with The Honest Company sunscreen. Used all day at a track meet last weekend, skin that usually burns like crazy was protected and healthy looking. Thank you Honest Company!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it is a healthy alternative to most sunscreens, which contain active ingredients that are allegedly bad for one&#x27;s health.  The sun protection afforded by this sunscreen is good.  However, I find myself not wanting to use it, because it&#x27;s main ingredient is non-nano zinc oxide, which is very thick, and leaves a definite white residue on the skin. This is fine for a child, but most adult women would not find it acceptable.  I don&#x27;t have the patience to rub it in sufficiently to leave no residue, if, indeed, that is even possible.  The price is reasonable and the ingredients are non-detrimental to one&#x27;s health,  However, the best sunscreen for me, is one that I am willing to use, and this is not it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very gross! It leaves you oily and sticky. It&#x27;s so greasey!</li>
            <li> This product only received 3 stars because its natural and although new to the honest company ( this was in my first subscription bundle from their website) I love their products that I&#x27;ve tried so far...well except this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is VERY VERY sticky and leaves a white residue. The kind of sticky that hand wash has a hard time of removing with just one pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased as a daily sunscreen for my kids but will only use when they go outside for hours playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they adjust the formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids have sensitive skin and break out into a rash with other sunscreen products (except water babies by coppertone) I&#x27;ve tried but not this one. I still prefer this to the &#x27;water babies by coppertone&#x27; as they both leave white residue but this one is way stickier.</li>
            <li> Thick and does not rub in very easy.  It does seem to do the job protecting skin from a sunburn though.</li>
            <li> Amazing natural sunblock, perfect on your skin, lasts longer than most</li>
            <li> This is the only sunblock we use on our daughter...I actually like that it&#x27;s a little greasy when you first rub it in, her skin is dry and just SOAKS it up!</li>
            <li> To be honest, this is the worst sunscreen I have ever used! Typically, as long as I use sunscreen, I do not get burned. I bought this sunscreen, because I wanted to keep the environment safe from chemicals. Instead, I put myself in harms way by using this product. I even reapplied every 1-2 hours. Still got severely burned. I would give it zero stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;I admire the company for putting out products for environmentally and health conscious consumers, but make sure the product is safe and is effective.</li>
            <li> This product goes on very greasy, hard to apply evenly and turned our skin super white! Spend your money on a different brand instead!</li>
