    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Beautiful stand, well made and works wonderfully with the brush and razor</li>
            <li>It is great for a brush holder.</li>
            <li>It looks great and does what I need it to do.  </li>
            <li>This may not be the case for a cartridge razor, but since I don&#x27;t own one of these, I haven&#x27;t tried this.</li>
            <li>The build quality is nice, but not overstated.</li>
            <li>However, it is nice and works for my brush just fine.</li>
            <li>I bought instead an omega stand that works much better.</li>
            <li>own problem for not finding a better brush and went with a cheap on you pay for what you  get.</li>
            <li>My brush fit nicely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna get 5 bucks worth of Legos and build my own stand.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>Will fit a Merkur 34C</li>
            <li>If you try to bend it toward the brush side to stabilize it, the cheap screws underneath will pull out and strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit well either.</li>
            <li>but since it has its own spot by the sink it isn&#x27;t much of an issue.</li>
            <li>Then to the razor, a beautiful Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>I received the stand, excitedly opened the box, unwrapped the stand, set it on my bathroom sink and</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this package in the mail and opened it immediately.</li>
            <li>Dangles nicely and securely for proper drying.  </li>
            <li>Glad it allows me to display my razor and brush but will need to by a new brush that fits.</li>
            <li>I only mention this because a lot of people find this particular model of razor very popular here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but had to for this product.</li>
            <li>The first night my husband used it and hung his razor on it, it fell apart.  </li>
            <li>use this stand if you have anything more than a short handle razor.</li>
            <li>Some other reviews state that it fits nicely, but</li>
            <li>The stand fits a standard Tweezerman shaving brush just fine.  </li>
            <li>The whole stand wobbles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was cheaper than many other stands here on Amazon, so I can&#x27;t fault it too much.</li>
            <li>Nice stand, only problem is they do not give the dimensions and my razor (Muhle R89) is too long for the stand, have to just lean it on the stand.  </li>
            <li>The razor arm snapped off the first time it fell over due to a cheap weld.</li>
            <li>Also, the picture makes it seem a little more bronze than it is--the real product is completely chrome.</li>
            <li>Amazon was nothing short of awesome as usual and had it replaced within just a few days.  </li>
            <li>The stand fits a standard shaving brush fine, but if you have a DE razor of any appreciable weight on the other hook, you must pick up the razor first, or else it tips over.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, once it&#x27;s broken, the wire is quite easy to adjust with a gentle squeeze with some pliers, and it glued back on fairly easily with some polyurethane glue.</li>
            <li>so my brush would fit in it and the back broke off when I tried to do the same for the razor.</li>
            <li>I had the exact opposite problem.  </li>
            <li>It might be great for a short handle safety razor, but is no good for a long handle.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to buy a stand for both brush and razor, steer clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not tall enough for the Style of straight razor handle that I bought.  </li>
            <li>main problem with this stand is the half-hearted razor holder on the back.</li>
            <li>Medium to long handles will hit the ground and/or weigh so much that it will tip over even with the brush in the brush</li>
            <li>This is possibly due to the weight of the razor I have chosen, for example - when shaving, the razor needs to be removed from the stand first or it will tip over.  </li>
            <li>The first one would not hold my brush due to the circumference of the arms on the stand.  </li>
            <li>The arms don&#x27;t extend far enough to hold my razor and it will either dangle precariously (after spending a couple minutes trying to balance it on the prongs) or it will just decide to fall</li>
            <li>I bent it forward slightly to hold the razor a little better.  </li>
            <li>I gave this to my son for Christmas and he likes it a lot because it keeps his shaving brush and razor together and allows the brush to air dry in its natural shape.</li>
            <li>the bottom of the stand is not flat.  </li>

            <li> Anything but a short handled one will be too long</li>

            <li> The long handle will not hang in the place for the razor.  </li>
            <li> I have a Parker 99R long handled razor and it was too long for the stand.</li>
            <li> I had to flip mine over and it dangles nicely with the cutting head down.  </li>
            <li> Pretty poor processing and  quality control in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The other side was a problem for my Merkur 180 long handled razor.  </li>
            <li> Somehow I expected it to be one piece or</li>

            <li> Too small for the brush tongs and too big for the razor tongs.</li>
            <li> I have read some other reviews here stating that the stand would not accommodate their brushes.  </li>
            <li> As it is, though, I have a hard time recommending it with anything approaching sincerity to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I could imagine with manufacturing inconsistancies that some other ones might not fit at all.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the only bad thing I can say about it.  </li>
            <li> Also the area used to hold the razor was pointed slightly downward causing my razor to fall out often.  </li>
            <li> Mine broke by the brush stand - the half circle that acts as the brush holder was just glued to the stand and broke off.</li>
            <li> It will fall over if it is bumped just slightly</li>
            <li> After a few months on my countertop I noticed a slight discoloration where it had been sitting.</li>
            <li> If the razor holder was angled upward a little like the brush holder, it would resolve this for my situation.  </li>
            <li> and it would not fit.  </li>
            <li> It holds the brush quite well, but my razor is too heavy to keep the stand upright.  </li>
            <li> When I inspected the area of the weld there were two round voids where it looks like air bubbles were trapped.</li>
            <li> Please do yourself a favor and find another stand, don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> The u&#x27;s are to small for my brush and d/e razor.</li>
            <li> I solved this by applying some double-sided adhesive to the bottom of the stand, but I should not have had to go to that effort, small though it was, in order for the product to function as it should.  </li>
            <li> This little stand came broken in shipping.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the base of this stand is not heavy enough to keep it standing.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad for the price I paid for it, and because of that I have a hard time justifying the effort and wait time of sending it back and ordering something else that also may or may not work.  </li>
            <li> If you try to put the razor in cutting head up, it wont stay due to the longer handle.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointing, but not worth returning.</li>
            <li> The stand isn&#x27;t very big, but the base is weighted to help keep it upright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a bad one but</li>
            <li> Issue solved with a little weight added to the base.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the felt under this part of the stand will be gone after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of the Wells were haphazardly done and sloppy.  </li>
            <li> the base of the stand is not sturdy causing it to tumble with the slightest movement.  </li>
            <li> The screws in the base were stripped too.</li>
            <li> Had the holders been reversed and the razor (rather than the brush) been made to hang over the base</li>

            <li> The plating was rough, almost sharp. The stand tips over if I put a safety razor in the holder and take out the brush. Really disappointing, but not worth returning.</li>
            <li> It might be great for a short handle safety razor, but is no good for a long handle.  The long handle will not hang in the place for the razor.  It is great for a brush holder.</li>
            <li> The first night my husband used it and hung his razor on it, it fell apart.  So he glued it and now it leans.</li>
            <li> The u&#x27;s are to small for my brush and d/e razor. Had to bend open the front so my brush would fit in it and the back broke off when I tried to do the same for the razor.</li>
            <li> This little stand came broken in shipping.  Amazon was nothing short of awesome as usual and had it replaced within just a few days.  Now on to why I gave it four instead five stars.  The stand fits a standard Tweezerman shaving brush just fine.  Dangles nicely and securely for proper drying.  The other side was a problem for my Merkur 180 long handled razor.  Some other reviews state that it fits nicely, but this is inaccurate.  If you try to put the razor in cutting head up, it wont stay due to the longer handle.  I had to flip mine over and it dangles nicely with the cutting head down.  I could imagine with manufacturing inconsistancies that some other ones might not fit at all.  A little gentle squeeze with some pliers might correct it&#x27;s holding the long handle of the merkur 180.  I only mention this because a lot of people find this particular model of razor very popular here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a bad one but the base of the stand is not sturdy causing it to tumble with the slightest movement.  Also the area used to hold the razor was pointed slightly downward causing my razor to fall out often.  All of the Wells were haphazardly done and sloppy.  Overall this didn&#x27;t perform any of the basic functions I needed it to.  I bought instead an omega stand that works much better.</li>
            <li> Nice stand, only problem is they do not give the dimensions and my razor (Muhle R89) is too long for the stand, have to just lean it on the stand.  Will fit a Merkur 34C just fine.</li>
            <li> Literally broke the second day. The razor arm snapped off the first time it fell over due to a cheap weld. The screws in the base were stripped too. It&#x27;s also too short to accommodate a merkur 180. Avoid. I&#x27;m gonna get 5 bucks worth of Legos and build my own stand.</li>
            <li> Mine broke by the brush stand - the half circle that acts as the brush holder was just glued to the stand and broke off. Somehow I expected it to be one piece or welded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note - I have a Parker 99R long handled razor and it was too long for the stand. Anything but a short handled one will be too long I think. I even tried hanging the excess of the handle over the sink&#x27;s contours but it wasnt enough.</li>
            <li> I have a Merkur extra-long safety razor and bought this product... not the brightest idea. However, it is nice and works for my brush just fine. Also, the picture makes it seem a little more bronze than it is--the real product is completely chrome.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand to properly store my shaving products, but it is unbalanced and will not remain upright when the brush is removed and razor is left on stand.  Somewhat defeats the purpose when you have to remove both the razor and the brush to prevent it from falling over.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the base of this stand is not heavy enough to keep it standing. When I put my razor on it just tipped over, making it unusable.</li>
            <li> Why do I give this only two stars? The stand fits a standard shaving brush fine, but if you have a DE razor of any appreciable weight on the other hook, you must pick up the razor first, or else it tips over. This may not be the case for a cartridge razor, but since I don&#x27;t own one of these, I haven&#x27;t tried this. If you try to bend it toward the brush side to stabilize it, the cheap screws underneath will pull out and strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once it&#x27;s broken, the wire is quite easy to adjust with a gentle squeeze with some pliers, and it glued back on fairly easily with some polyurethane glue. Unfortunately, the felt under this part of the stand will be gone after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use this stand if you have anything more than a short handle razor. Medium to long handles will hit the ground and/or weigh so much that it will tip over even with the brush in the brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be going with a center-mounted model of stand in the future to prevent the above issues.</li>
            <li> This holds my Tweezerman brush well enough so it dries properly. After a few months on my countertop I noticed a slight discoloration where it had been sitting. This could be because of the rubber/foam pad on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem with this stand is the half-hearted razor holder on the back. The arms don&#x27;t extend far enough to hold my razor and it will either dangle precariously (after spending a couple minutes trying to balance it on the prongs) or it will just decide to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was cheaper than many other stands here on Amazon, so I can&#x27;t fault it too much. If you&#x27;re looking to buy a stand for both brush and razor, steer clear. If you only want to hang your brush, this is simple and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I received this stand today.  I am sending it back today. I received the stand, excitedly opened the box, unwrapped the stand, set it on my bathroom sink and the bottom of the stand is not flat.  The whole stand wobbles. I figured I could fix that so started to put the brush (an \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; brush and it would not fit.  Too small for the brush tongs and too big for the razor tongs. Then to the razor, a beautiful Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor. It doesn&#x27;t fit well either. $26.00 is not a lot of money, but this is not made well enough to warrant even that.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my son for Christmas and he likes it a lot because it keeps his shaving brush and razor together and allows the brush to air dry in its natural shape.The stand isn&#x27;t very big, but the base is weighted to help keep it upright. It also needs a flat, level surface. It will fall over if it is bumped just slightly but since it has its own spot by the sink it isn&#x27;t much of an issue.</li>
            <li> Beautiful stand, well made and works wonderfully with the brush and razor, my only issue is the balance of this piece.  This is possibly due to the weight of the razor I have chosen, for example - when shaving, the razor needs to be removed from the stand first or it will tip over.  Issue solved with a little weight added to the base.</li>
            <li> Only Fits some brusheds but does work...... Glad it allows me to display my razor and brush but will need to by a new brush that fits. own problem for not finding a better brush and went with a cheap on you pay for what you  get.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the only bad thing I can say about it.  It&#x27;s not tall enough for the Style of straight razor handle that I bought.  The build quality is nice, but not overstated.</li>
            <li> It looks great and does what I need it to do.  I bent it forward slightly to hold the razor a little better.  On my sink the razor was susceptible to sliding off.  If the razor holder was angled upward a little like the brush holder, it would resolve this for my situation.  YMMV</li>
            <li> I have read some other reviews here stating that the stand would not accommodate their brushes.  I had the exact opposite problem.  This was the second brush/razor combo that I purchased.  The first one would not hold my brush due to the circumference of the arms on the stand.  I sent it back and got this one instead.  It holds the brush quite well, but my razor is too heavy to keep the stand upright.  If I try to place the razor itself on the stand with the brush it topples over.  I solved this by applying some double-sided adhesive to the bottom of the stand, but I should not have had to go to that effort, small though it was, in order for the product to function as it should.  Had the holders been reversed and the razor (rather than the brush) been made to hang over the base I think that it would have worked quite well.  As it is, though, I have a hard time recommending it with anything approaching sincerity to anyone.  It isn&#x27;t bad for the price I paid for it, and because of that I have a hard time justifying the effort and wait time of sending it back and ordering something else that also may or may not work.  I&#x27;ll just keep the DS adhesive on the bottom and let things be.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but had to for this product. I was excited to get this package in the mail and opened it immediately. My brush fit nicely but when I put my razor on, the weld holding the smaller hook broke. When I inspected the area of the weld there were two round voids where it looks like air bubbles were trapped. Pretty poor processing and  quality control in my opinion. Please do yourself a favor and find another stand, don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
