            <li>Or for anyone for that matter Excellent Price too</li>
            <li>time to figure out how to best hold it when using it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent finger Nail Clippers Ideal for those that have weekness in their Hands.</li>
            <li>and they work great.</li>
            <li>Good find.</li>
            <li>Nice grip to them</li>
            <li>Service was fast and I was very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying two more pairs after writing this .</li>
            <li>I tried this to check the functionality of the intent, but I got what I paid for, maybe something more strudy.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>and so much more precise.</li>
            <li>so easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use as advertised</li>
            <li>Good enough for the wang is good enough for me I guess.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Took a bit to be delivered but it was worth the wait .</li>
            <li>Wish they offered a left and right angle, would be better.</li>
            <li>This is one of those inventions that makes you wonder why  you didn&#x27;t think of it first....</li>
            <li>This clipper is very strong and makes trimming the old nails no longer a major challenge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a senior citizen and found this round handle nail clipper to be the perfect answer to those older clippers always slipping away from my fingers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scissor-like handles on these allow them to be grasped at many angles, without risk of them flying (or slipping) out of your fingers.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>Rosallini Silver Tone Metal Round Handle Pedicure File Trimmer Nail Clipper is okay.  </li>
            <li>The first time I squeezed down on it, the end of one of the clipping blades broke right off.</li>
            <li>They are almost exactly like the ones I paid close to ten dollars for.</li>
            <li>Very cheap quality and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li>I will add that I got a similar item and even though you can reach your toes, if you can&#x27;t see what you cutting its still not all that great.</li>
            <li>went back to the old fashioned version.</li>
            <li>When using this on my own toes, I found it difficult to do.  </li>
            <li>This was a major disappointment, I have arthritis in my thumb which makes it hard to use regular clippers, so I thought this would be perfect.</li>

            <li> Took a bit to be delivered but it was worth the wait . I only used them for my nails on one hand but they worked like they should . I&#x27;m buying two more pairs after writing this . They are almost exactly like the ones I paid close to ten dollars for. Good find.</li>
            <li> rusted when soaked in bleach</li>

            <li> This was a major disappointment, I have arthritis in my thumb which makes it hard to use regular clippers, so I thought this would be perfect.

            <li> the loop on the handle doesn&#x27;t loop all the way around and it cuts into my fingers making it very uncomfortable to use. I will keep looking. I have toenail clippers that are the same design and they work great.</li>
