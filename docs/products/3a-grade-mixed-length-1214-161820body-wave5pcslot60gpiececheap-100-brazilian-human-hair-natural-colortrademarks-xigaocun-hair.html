            <li>Hair looks cheap, feel cheap and you get what you pay for..........</li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>Otherwise so far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good</li>
            <li>I loved the hair, it was really soft and rarely shed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give another feed back in 2 weeks but for right now I&#x27;m a happy Camper.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t really full.</li>
            <li>Soft , nice wave.  </li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it takes colour very well.</li>
            <li>There was no smell and hair is true to length.</li>
            <li>To have a full look all bundles are not needed whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This is really what it is, cheap hair.</li>
            <li>Shreds a lot but is useful for a time in need.</li>
            <li>I must admit for the price it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>the packaging was basic and it looked and felt nice</li>
            <li>Only good thing is the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>This hair is a 4 Natural brown with a hint of red in the sun which i LOVE, I like the hair better straight</li>
            <li>I gave this 5stars based off of first opening the pack and viewing thee hair&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
            <li>and it came out so pretty.</li>
            <li>I was at first a bit sceptical about purchasing because of the reviews.</li>
            <li>But once I did I fell in love with my hair that I purchased a second for my mom.</li>
            <li>1 lot is more than enough!</li>
            <li>only had it in for two days but will see how it works out:-)</li>
            <li>its ok especially for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i only gave it a 4 star because the hair was pretty fast in getting her in afghanistan, it feels soft and the lengths seems pretty accurate and for the price i love it</li>
            <li>The texture is amazing and very minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>The natural pattern is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Does not shed much.</li>
            <li>I would not wear this hair personally, but if someone want to go cheap, I would buy and re-sell.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>But then it became very oily &amp; synthetic like</li>
            <li>Other than that it was ok</li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the hair makes a full head</li>
            <li>The hair was soft when I first got it.</li>
            <li>IS ENOUGH FOR THE FULL HAIR</li>
            <li>It sheds a little bit but besides that so far it&#x27;s pretty good especially for the price I paid for it !</li>
            <li>I will say, to the seller&#x27;s credit, that I still had 2 bundles left over after a full head sew-in, so it really is a decent amount of hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment hair soft havent installed so</li>
            <li>The hair is not as thick as i would have liked</li>
            <li>So less than 1 week later, I am pretty sure that I have lost 25% of the hair that I had sewn in through tangling and shedding.</li>
            <li>The hair sheds a bit more than necessary not worth dying</li>
            <li>I Just ordered another bundle deal and the sew in is in now after one week the hair is completely tangled.</li>
            <li>and i will never waste my money again.</li>
            <li>I installed it and wore it natural for about a week or so &amp; then went to the salon and got it styled..</li>
            <li>the same as some cheap $15.99 hair from your local beauty supply store with white plastic bags that say &amp;#34;THANK YOU&amp;#34; over and over again.</li>
            <li>I sold back this hair, so I really can&#x27;t say if it tangles or shed.</li>
            <li>The hair is really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>i just got it today and its really soft .</li>
            <li>Still soft and silky though.  </li>
            <li>NOT EVEN BRUSHED OR REAL</li>
            <li>Flat ironed curls only last for 24 hour but returned to original curl pattern.</li>
            <li>Pretty obvious this hair was from a different distributor.</li>
            <li>Hair is really soft, shedding is minimal and not too much tangling.  </li>
            <li>I must say the shipping was really fast got it before the expected delivery.</li>
            <li>and I have curled it several times and so far no tangles or shedding.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if this bundle can do for a full head style, you may need 2 bundles.</li>
            <li>I ordered natural black but the hair is really about a #2.  </li>
            <li>The bundles were very small was definitely not enough for a full sew in.</li>
            <li>Use only oil sheen as too much grease can weigh the hair down giving it a flat look.</li>
            <li>Not any good hair sheds and tangle really bad</li>

            <li> I mean when I took out the package the hair was VERY soft .</li>
            <li> Some shedding but minimal.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is 100% human.</li>
            <li> ( : but other than that no problems</li>
            <li> but that really not that much of a problem so ill just Walsh</li>
            <li> /&gt;it sheds a little bit but not much that i can see yet.</li>
            <li> THIS BRAND IS NOT A GOOD BRAND FOR DURABLE HUMAN HAIR.</li>
            <li> The hair could be a little thicker</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a little scared about ordering \\&quot;brazilian\\&quot; hair online</li>
            <li> it sheds heavily and its damn there breaking combs...</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of money..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t claim to be, but in my haste, I failed to see that it was &amp;#34;brazilian hair&amp;#34;, but not necessarily virgin.</li>
            <li> Hair is too thin and cannot be dyed or bleached the lengths are not accurate shorter than I expected not a good quality hair</li>
            <li> ...I will listen to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The only problem is , is that it kinda stinks</li>
            <li> Worst hair ever spent so much time styling for it not to stay.</li>
            <li> and the bundles are thin</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star because the ends are thin.</li>
            <li> But its a lil thin at the ends</li>
            <li> So yeah when it comes ill write another review.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to bleach this hair, it turned out horrible,  the hair turned grey!</li>
            <li> I just not ordered this product and im very skeptical</li>
            <li> This was an extremely bad batch of hair</li>
            <li> , mine will be different.&amp;#34; This hair sheds SOOOOOOOO badly.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft,but the ends look like really bad split ends.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I WAS  SO DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> ALMOST 100 DOLLARS FOR THIS CRAP.</li>
            <li> Horrible</li>
            <li> This hair was horrible ..</li>
            <li> Horrible hair.</li>
            <li> BUT BIT WAS THE WORST HAIR  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Hair is too thin and cannot be dyed or bleached the lengths are not accurate shorter than I expected not a good quality hair I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> The hair could be a little thicker</li>
            <li> Came super quick, feels really good. Got it installed and had it in my hair for about 4 days and the hair is still good.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the hair makes a full head but it isn&#x27;t really full. Otherwise so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love this hair good quality.</li>
            <li> I got this same hair August 2014 and it lasted through two seperate sew installs and regular weekly washes until January 2015. I Just ordered another bundle deal and the sew in is in now after one week the hair is completely tangled. Pretty obvious this hair was from a different distributor. Horrible and i will never waste my money again. $100 for a week hair style! What a rip off</li>
            <li> Shreds a lot but is useful for a time in need. I have it on for 1 month now and washed it a couple of times</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to bleach this hair, it turned out horrible,  the hair turned grey! Other than that it was ok</li>
            <li> This hair is beautiful!! Soft , nice wave.  Its perfect!!</li>
            <li> I gave this 5stars based off of first opening the pack and viewing thee hair&lt;br /&gt;Soft&lt;br /&gt;Length as advertised&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping! (4stars alone from me)👏👏&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is a GREAT DEAL!&lt;br /&gt;I will review this hair on my social media sites for my followers.&lt;br /&gt;Update will be posted in a week&lt;br /&gt;Thanks 😊</li>
            <li> The hair was soft when I first got it. It didn&#x27;t shed and it didn&#x27;t tangle. After I washed it, I sewed it to a mesh cap. After it was on my head, it did tangle and shed.I cut my wefts.  But with argin oil it was find. IOver all I do love it.</li>
            <li> Not any good hair sheds and tangle really bad and the bundles are thin i will never order hair again</li>
            <li> This was my second batch of hair an it Got nappy too fast after a few weeks having it in. This was an extremely bad batch of hair</li>
            <li> It sheds a little bit but besides that so far it&#x27;s pretty good especially for the price I paid for it !</li>
            <li> i only gave it a 4 star because the hair was pretty fast in getting her in afghanistan, it feels soft and the lengths seems pretty accurate and for the price i love it but i have yet to install it and see how it holds up...but so far so good</li>
            <li> This hair looks good when you take it out the package and run your hands through it doesn&#x27;t tangle or sheds once i installed the hair the 20 inch tangles in the back allot and it sheds but, i cut the tracks that the only reason . I have washed and i have flat iron it and it came out so pretty. This hair is a 4 Natural brown with a hint of red in the sun which i LOVE, I like the hair better straight that&#x27;s just me. Its not the best but, its ok</li>
            <li> I must admit for the price it is well worth it. Does not shed much. Great feel. I&#x27;ve had the hair in for a week and I love it so far. I did not use all bundles I will reuse and install all five later. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment hair soft havent installed so dont know how it will holdhope its enough for a sewin other i love it</li>
            <li> I give this hair 4 stars.. I ordered this hair and it came within two days after I ordered it! It was not 1 or 1b like I thought it would be but it is a darker shaded brown and ok with me.. It was 5 neat bundles and the hair felt great.. I installed it and wore it natural for about a week or so &amp; then went to the salon and got it styled.. I told the beautician about the price I paid and she was surprised because of how great the hair was.. It sheds some but I expect that out of all hair . #LoveIt &amp; I am now at the time ordering more ((;</li>
            <li> Worst hair ever spent so much time styling for it not to stay. Im a stylist and even if you pay a lot of money doesn&#x27;t make the product better. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> ...I will listen to the negative reviews. I won&#x27;t think to myself &amp;#34;but that is their experience, mine will be different.&amp;#34; This hair sheds SOOOOOOOO badly. I had a hunch that I should seal it, but I didnt have the time. So less than 1 week later, I am pretty sure that I have lost 25% of the hair that I had sewn in through tangling and shedding. Also, please be advised that this is NOT VIRGIN HAIR. It doesn&#x27;t claim to be, but in my haste, I failed to see that it was &amp;#34;brazilian hair&amp;#34;, but not necessarily virgin. It looks nice in the package on the FIRST DAY, but that&#x27;s where it ends. I will say, to the seller&#x27;s credit, that I still had 2 bundles left over after a full head sew-in, so it really is a decent amount of hair. Bottom line, do not buy this hair. It tangles and sheds...the same as some cheap $15.99 hair from your local beauty supply store with white plastic bags that say &amp;#34;THANK YOU&amp;#34; over and over again.</li>
            <li> This is really what it is, cheap hair. Hair looks cheap, feel cheap and you get what you pay for.......... cheap. I would not wear this hair personally, but if someone want to go cheap, I would buy and re-sell. Not sure if this bundle can do for a full head style, you may need 2 bundles. I sold back this hair, so I really can&#x27;t say if it tangles or shed.</li>
            <li> I was at first a bit sceptical about purchasing because of the reviews. But once I did I fell in love with my hair that I purchased a second for my mom. The texture is amazing and very minimal shedding. Tips # damp hair before brushing and brush hair from tips to root. Use only oil sheen as too much grease can weigh the hair down giving it a flat look. I also love the fact that it takes colour very well. Please note if u want d colour to last longer after bleaching d hair and adding the colour rinse that u desire do not rinse hair dry it under d dryer and it will last alot longer. Also when going to bed plait hair or flex rods to keep from tangling.  Overall a beautiful hair n I must say the shipping was really fast got it before the expected delivery. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Had it installed for about two days. There was no smell and hair is true to length. The natural pattern is very pretty. The hair is really soft and shiny. To have a full look all bundles are not needed whatsoever. Great hair for the price.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!!! Thumbs up! No issues so far. Love the hair, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but after ordering myself hair and loving it I ordered some for a family member and their bundles are just as nice as mine! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> This hair was horrible ..after like 4 days the hair was matted and brittle at the ends...it sheds heavily and its damn there breaking combs... the packaging was basic and it looked and felt nice but it was a waste of money..Im pissed that even took a chance and ordered this</li>
            <li> I purchased Brazilian hair on 4/11/2014 and received it on 4/14/2014. Hair is really soft, shedding is minimal and not too much tangling.  I installed it Moday 4/11/2014 and I must say its holding up well! I&#x27;ll give another feed back in 2 weeks but for right now I&#x27;m a happy Camper. I gave it a four star because the ends are thin. 1 lot is more than enough!</li>
            <li> Good hair but not sure if it is 100% human.</li>
            <li> I loved the hair, it was really soft and rarely shed only had it in for two days but will see how it works out:-)</li>
            <li> Great product. Some shedding but minimal. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> The hair Is grate.!!! Came 5piece just like its say with a grate price.</li>
            <li> OK, i ordered this for my daughter and she loves this hair. The hair is very soft and if it&#x27;s taken care of correctly it could last you for a little while. The hair is not as thick as i would have liked but , my daughter said its fine for her. You get a lot of hair for your money and we will purchase again.</li>
            <li> its ok especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;it sheds a little bit but not much that i can see yet. i will be making another purchase but different lengths and see how it works out.&lt;br /&gt;i will say its a bit light in terms of weight but its ok.</li>
            <li> The bundles were very small was definitely not enough for a full sew in.</li>
            <li> As described. I like the hair.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a little scared about ordering \\&quot;brazilian\\&quot; hair online considering the past reviews were pretty harsh. i love my hair i just got it today and its really soft . I have yet to install but I will write another review based on how well it holds up.</li>
            <li> It is really nice hair. I have used all 5 bundles in my hair. But its a lil thin at the ends</li>
            <li> Hair was great at first! But then it became very oily &amp; synthetic like</li>
            <li> It gets matty ends get frizzy only had it for 2weeks. The hair sheds a bit more than necessary not worth dying it is not virgin.</li>
            <li> I just not ordered this product and im very skeptical I hoped I paid good money and when It comes will let you guys now again and what I think of it. I just caught this when they dropped the price 109 to like 96. So yeah when it comes ill write another review. * fingers crossed * that&#x27;s its quality hair.&lt;br /&gt;*******************&lt;br /&gt;Okay sooo the hair just came in and I have to say it really is good hair I mean when I took out the package the hair was VERY soft . The only problem is , is that it kinda stinks but that really not that much of a problem so ill just Walsh and hopefully it waves back up I have yet to install it ( : but other than that no problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  had the hair installed for about a week now and I have curled it several times and so far no tangles or shedding.  I ordered natural black but the hair is really about a #2.  Flat ironed curls only last for 24 hour but returned to original curl pattern.Still soft and silky though.  So far so Good!</li>
            <li> Horrible hair. Do not purchase! Hair is soft,but the ends look like really bad split ends. Only good thing is the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> SHEDS LIKE CRAZZY! I WAS  SO DISAPPOINTED. DONN T EVER WASH IT OR OIL IT. I STILL GAVE IT CHANCE BUT BIT WAS THE WORST HAIR  EVER BOUGHT.  ALMOST 100 DOLLARS FOR THIS CRAP. I REQUESTED A RETURN . I ATTACHED A PICTURE OF THE SHEDDING AND THIS IS WHEN I FINGER COMBED NOT EVEN BRUSHED OR REAL COMB!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;3 IS ENOUGH FOR THE FULL HAIR&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;FALSE ADVERTIZING THERE IS A LOT OF SHEDDING AND TANGLING&lt;br /&gt;FAILED REAL HUMAN HAIR TEST.&lt;br /&gt;SHORTER THAN EXPECTED&lt;br /&gt;AGAIN SHEDS SHEDS AND SHEDS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nB: SHOULD NOT BE FULLFILLED BY AMAZON THIS BRAND IS NOT A GOOD BRAND FOR DURABLE HUMAN HAIR.</li>
