            <li>I&#x27;m planning on going cone free</li>

            <li>I have tried a lot of things, so far this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product which I have been using for the last six months.  </li>
            <li>Put it through your hair after a shower and it helps hydrate your hair, reduces frizz, keeps your hair manageable and soft, plus it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product and that it keeps my hair very silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean scented as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>Ships quickly.</li>
            <li>MyBeautyCenter attended to my concern quickly and helped me fix the issue.</li>
            <li>I like the way my hair feels and styles,  not to mention the mild fragrance that it leaves in my hair after drying and styling.  </li>
            <li>I bought the High Tide scent because I love the ocean.</li>
            <li>Smells light and pretty.</li>
            <li>doesnt weigh down hair and smells great.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this and makes your hair soft too!</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li>It smells like coconut and lime, which is nice and summery, helps me forget it&#x27;s the dead of winter : )</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, voluminous,  and healthy.  </li>
            <li>In two weeks, my skin has been improved, my hair is improved and I&#x27;m going to be only using the good old stand by that</li>
            <li>Make my some what fine hair fuller, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>And I love that your protected from the outside elements.</li>
            <li>Since he&#x27;s been using it his hair is healthy, shiny and back to life.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair that gets weighed down easily</li>
            <li>I no longer spend a half hour trying to gently comb my hair out, and it adds an amazing shine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I just cut all the damage off my hair from not using heat protectant, which I learned about after I damaged it, my friend never used it when she straighten her already straight hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I love the product, your hair looks so soft and shiny and you only need 3 squirts.</li>
            <li>I did a ton of research on this product before deciding and compared it to many other brands</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair softer, far less frizzy (can&#x27;t expect 100% smooth with the coarse hair that I have, but this makes it about 98%) and super easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I received the high tide scent thinking it would be tropical smelling (as the website says) but the smell made me nauseous.</li>
            <li>My hair combed out easily and, after allowing to dry naturally, it was soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Newly bleached out platinum hair....</li>
            <li>It makes my fine curly hair feel like silk without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a mission to get my hair back to a healthy state by not dying it repeatedly, I only wanted a simple product for my uncontrollable frizz.</li>
            <li>Wish their other products had this same light fragrance!</li>
            <li>My long fine hair is stronger than it has ever been in a very short time.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>There are only certain products that I plan on continuing to use, this and anything with argan oils, of course everything has cones in it, but I&#x27;m used to it.</li>
            <li>This product is not all natural and organic as it claims to be.</li>
            <li>I applied the product by spraying it directly onto my hair after towel drying and combed it through.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no where near the same anymore.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s no where near the same anymore.</li>
            <li> I use this as a detangler for my long hair and my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s very long hair.</li>
            <li> It is especially helpful if you have dry or chemically processed hair.  </li>
            <li> There a three girls with long curly hair in this house.</li>
            <li> I swear it somehow even reduced his grey</li>
            <li> so it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells teriffic and lasts so long!</li>
            <li> , I cross referenced other reviewers and have tried a plethora of products over the years claiming to control my frizz and make it feel silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, and frizzy, if I don&#x27;t put leave in conditioner in.</li>
            <li> This product has made my dry, frazzled straightened and lightened hair softer, healthier and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair scalp as well as my skin.</li>
            <li> have a chronic condition which creates dry skin and scalp</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every day before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium length fairly dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Then I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> So I sometimes have to put two different types, there are a few that I don&#x27;t have to use only one, this is one of them.</li>
            <li> I used a bit on damp hair, blow dried, then used a tiny bit as a final touch on the dried hair.</li>
            <li> I spray on a little on dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, very curly, very thin, lots of it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it everyday but you only need one little pump and volia, it does the trick to help reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> My husband has thick straight to wavy hair and lots of it, his hair gets a little frizzy after showers - he finds a few spritz tame his hair all day.</li>
            <li> My hair is to my waist, very thick, and I have a 2month old that loves to pull, yank, and twirl his fingers in it.</li>
            <li> The product sounded good, but I had to use an awful lot to get it to detangle my hair and it made my hair look a oily the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that&#x27;s a little past my waist, I&#x27;m working on almost tailbone length hair.</li>

            <li> It smells so good!! I bought it just for the scent after my hairdresser used it on me. Love it.</li>
            <li> I use this as a detangler for my long hair and my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s very long hair. It works great!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this leave-in product.  It is a miracle on curly, frizzy hair. Light weight with a pleasant smell. Top it off with Marrakesh Aragon oil. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I have longer hair and was looking for something that would help with the knots after the shower. This is great and the smell is very much like the verbena lime lotion from BBW.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in condition. It makes my fine curly hair feel like silk without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I order this after used for a while the Marrakesh shampoo &amp; conditioner and using this product my hair changes a lot, is more shinny and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used a lot of them, and a lot were much more expensive. Highly recommend.  Edit: something has changed in this product... It&#x27;s no where near the same anymore. Will not continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the product, your hair looks so soft and shiny and you only need 3 squirts. I will be buying another one when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, and frizzy, if I don&#x27;t put leave in conditioner in. So I sometimes have to put two different types, there are a few that I don&#x27;t have to use only one, this is one of them. And I love that your protected from the outside elements. There are only certain products that I plan on continuing to use, this and anything with argan oils, of course everything has cones in it, but I&#x27;m used to it. I have long hair that&#x27;s a little past my waist, I&#x27;m working on almost tailbone length hair. And this stuff will help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just cut all the damage off my hair from not using heat protectant, which I learned about after I damaged it, my friend never used it when she straighten her already straight hair. I have hair to my bra line and bangs, my bangs had to be cut after a year of the same length from all the damage. I don&#x27;t look good with bangs. Anyways I&#x27;m going to try this stuff out again. And maybe they&#x27;ll come out with a cone free version or maybe they have one out already? I&#x27;m planning on going cone free, I have wavy curly hair. I&#x27;ll update later one.</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome leave in and, I have used it all, even Morrocan Oil and the regular Marrakesh oil. This product has made my dry, frazzled straightened and lightened hair softer, healthier and shiny. Pairing this with the Marrakesh Kahm has made such a difference with my hair! Non-greasy and non-oily, it is hair heaven!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use it everyday. Make my some what fine hair fuller, shiny, and soft. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product which I have been using for the last six months.  It makes my hair more managable and I can add it after I shower, if I forget to use my regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> the best leave in for unruly hair! doesnt weigh down hair and smells great. i have fine curly hair and it has transformed it ! i  will be buying again and again and again!</li>
            <li> Thie product with the argon and hemp oil is the most incredible moisturizser for my hair and my skin! I have extremely dry hair scalp as well as my skin. I can buy the best that money can buy and still come back to the argon/hemp oil! My long fine hair is stronger than it has ever been in a very short time. I also use a couple pumps after doing my scalp and rub my face, arms and hands with it. In two weeks, my skin has been improved, my hair is improved and I&#x27;m going to be only using the good old stand by that is a miracle worker!&lt;br /&gt;I have a chronic condition which creates dry skin and scalp and I no longer have to wonder if my hair and skin look and feel wonderful. After a recent hospital stay, I used the oil on my IV sites and they disappeared in two days! My facial and neck wrinkles are greatly reduced! Smells teriffic and lasts so long! Prepare to spoil yourself! Argon/hemp oil will change the way you look at your hair and skin!</li>
            <li> I wanted a leave in moisturizer/detangler.  My hair is medium length but seem to tangle a lot during the day.  The product sounded good, but I had to use an awful lot to get it to detangle my hair and it made my hair look a oily the rest of the day.  My teenage daughter tried it on her hair and it didn&#x27;t detangle it at all.  I would not recommend it unless you have used it before and know that it works on your hair.</li>
            <li> There a three girls with long curly hair in this house. This stuff is good for detangling. I use it and I use it in my kids. Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> This leave-in treatment is amazingly effective. I love it! Our stylist recommended this product for my husbands dried-out, frizzy hair. Since he&#x27;s been using it his hair is healthy, shiny and back to life. I swear it somehow even reduced his grey hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has worked wonders on my hair as well. I&#x27;m on heart medications which make my hair brittle. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product with the Marrakesh shampoo and conditioner my hair is considerably healthy. Our daughter is a hair stylist and recommends both argon oil and hemp for healthy hair. Ships quickly.</li>
            <li> Newly bleached out platinum hair.... and this product saves the day! Man it&#x27;s wonderful. I used a bit on damp hair, blow dried, then used a tiny bit as a final touch on the dried hair. Smells light and pretty. No frizz! No fly always, and I have a razor cut pixie. LOVE.</li>
            <li> Works great on very tangled hair.  I just spray it on and comb it through.  All knots are gone.  The smell is very light.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and that it keeps my hair very silky. I spray on a little on dry hair and you can immediately see the difference.</li>
            <li> This product is not all natural and organic as it claims to be. It contains alcohol. I sent it back immediately.</li>
            <li> My hair is to my waist, very thick, and I have a 2month old that loves to pull, yank, and twirl his fingers in it. It became impossible to get the knots out. I bought this to help my attempt at brushing and it helped like 80%. It smells great and makes my hair sooo soft as well. I have tried a lot of things, so far this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It does exactly what it says. It nourishes, detangles, and softens my hair. I have fine curly hair that gets weighed down easily but this leave in is perfect</li>
            <li> This has to be the best hair product I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time. I have really long, wavy, thin and belligerent hair. I work outside a lot, so between the wind tangling my hair(despite braiding it) and sun damage, this stuff has done wonders for me. I no longer spend a half hour trying to gently comb my hair out, and it adds an amazing shine. Also the scent called &amp;#34;high tide&amp;#34; smells AMAZING. It smells like coconut and lime, which is nice and summery, helps me forget it&#x27;s the dead of winter : )</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of years back and i just finished it. I didn&#x27;t use it everyday but you only need one little pump and volia, it does the trick to help reduce frizz. Put it through your hair after a shower and it helps hydrate your hair, reduces frizz, keeps your hair manageable and soft, plus it smells amazing. Great product and excellent quility</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair and hate that no matter what product I use and setting I use on the hair dryer, I still end up with frizzy hair.  This product makes my hair softer, far less frizzy (can&#x27;t expect 100% smooth with the coarse hair that I have, but this makes it about 98%) and super easy to manage.  Nice smell and a little goes a long way so it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering from this company again. I received the high tide scent thinking it would be tropical smelling (as the website says) but the smell made me nauseous. Dreamsicle is where it&#x27;s at with a nice orangy scent. MyBeautyCenter attended to my concern quickly and helped me fix the issue. Definitely give them 5 stars for the product and their service.</li>
            <li> Helps to detangle my fine hair</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and makes your hair soft too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, my husband is impressed too - he started using Marrakesh regularly. I&#x27;ve been on a mission to get my hair back to a healthy state by not dying it repeatedly, I only wanted a simple product for my uncontrollable frizz. I did a ton of research on this product before deciding and compared it to many other brands, I cross referenced other reviewers and have tried a plethora of products over the years claiming to control my frizz and make it feel silky. I have been less than impressed until now. My hair is very long, very curly, very thin, lots of it and it gets quite frizzy - I use 4-5 spritz to spread through my hair evenly. When I straighten my hair with this product it feels like strands of silk without being sticky or otherwise undesirable. My husband has thick straight to wavy hair and lots of it, his hair gets a little frizzy after showers - he finds a few spritz tame his hair all day.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every day before I blow dry my hair. Not only does it smell amazing, it helps my hair not be frizzy or have static.</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate, heaven in a bottle!!! My hair is so strong now and smells amazing at all times. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS.  One of my fur babies throws cotton balls in the coat...this is amazing.  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Initially got some as a gift and was hooked!  Wish their other products had this same light fragrance!</li>
            <li> It is especially helpful if you have dry or chemically processed hair.  Keep hair looking shiny and very healthy in spite of anything else you might have done to your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have purchased Marrakesh for several years.  Love It!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I bought the High Tide scent because I love the ocean. It&#x27;s fresh and clean scented as I&#x27;d hoped. It leaves my hair shiny and manageable. My hair is pretty dry so I can use quite a bit without my hair looking oily. If you have oily hair, I&#x27;d use it sparingly. Bottom line, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Product easily detangles my hair which is color treated and medium length.  I like the way my hair feels and styles,  not to mention the mild fragrance that it leaves in my hair after drying and styling.  I was unable to find the product until I went to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used many leave-in products before trying Marrakesh.  I have medium length fairly dry hair.  I applied the product by spraying it directly onto my hair after towel drying and combed it through.  My hair combed out easily and, after allowing to dry naturally, it was soft and silky.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel and the scent is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Smells really good.  I like it.  I just prefer its a 10.</li>
            <li> Bought several of these for my wife when she couldn&#x27;t find them in any of our local stores. She&#x27;s very happy.</li>
            <li> love the smell and it does help my hair, makes it stronger</li>
            <li> Great for your hair smells good . I like original scent better</li>
            <li> This works really well in my wavy hair and its smells amazing too. Not heavy at all. Will buy some more again.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, voluminous,  and healthy.  I spray about five times evenly and comb through.  Then I blow dry.  My hair looks fabulous and I feel like I&#x27;m in one of those hair commercials! Lol!</li>
            <li> Smells good! Helps condition my hair...not the best detangler Ive used though.</li>
