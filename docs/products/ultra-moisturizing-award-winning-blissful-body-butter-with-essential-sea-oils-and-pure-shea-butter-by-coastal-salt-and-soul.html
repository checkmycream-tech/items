            <li>I absolutely love.</li>

            <li>This was my favorite of all the butters I have tried.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive a sample of Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Ocean Gardenia Body Butter.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it instantly gave my skin a silky,&lt;br /&gt;hydrated feel and the scent was light and delicious.</li>
            <li>I am very particular when it comes to skin products, but loved Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Ocean Gardenia Body Butter.</li>
            <li>It was great on my skin which can be sensitive at times.</li>
            <li>the way it left my skin feel so cool after application was wonderful.</li>
            <li>My skin immediately felt softer, more supple and completely comfortable.</li>
            <li>I particularly liked the texture because it wasn&#x27;t thick like most body butters so its perfect for summer!</li>
            <li>but it is truly like walking in a garden-- its a rich, luxurious smell that I love.</li>
            <li>In fact, it left it healthy looking as well as smelling great.</li>
            <li>My skin smelled so refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>The body butter is amazing stuff, but the entire presentation of it in the jar and the box makes it a gift you&#x27;d be thrilled to give to anyone you adore.</li>

            <li>Rarely have I used a skin product that I have fell in love with immediately.  </li>
            <li>I brought a jar of the Ocean Gardenia with me to Girls&#x27; Weekend, and everyone just raved about how fantastic it smells.  </li>
            <li>The smell was AMAZING and it absorbs into the skin really well.</li>
            <li>The body butter is so smooth and velvety that you almost don&#x27;t realize how moisturizing it is.  </li>
            <li>The texture feels like creamy, whipped butter and applies to your skin so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The best part is the scent, it not too heavy, and when my daughter hugged me she said, &amp;#34;Mom</li>
            <li>I applied the body butter at night and was so impressed with how much moisture it gave my skin back.</li>
            <li>The Ocean Gardenia scent is a beautiful combination of White Gardenia + Fresh Sea Air, and the body butter also incorporates shea butter to nourish and moisturize, and sea kelp to heal and rejuvenate.</li>
            <li>The scent is utterly unique...</li>
            <li>Even though it smells fresh and it does remind me of being somewhere lost at sea but not a scent for me!</li>
            <li>My skin feels silky soft and smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>The soft flower scent is amazing.</li>

            <li>I received samples of this last year to do product testing, and I absolutely loved all of it -</li>
            <li>but of course, who pays full price if they don&#x27;t have to?)</li>
            <li>This body butter is absolute top of the line.</li>

            <li>I not only enjoyed the light scent but</li>
            <li>Defintely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a one of a kind luxurious body butter.</li>
            <li>Like a bouquet of fresh flowers growing alongside the fresh salty ocean air.</li>
            <li>Fresh, floral with a hint of sea mist.</li>
            <li>The initial sellers and their good prices disappeared, and all we&#x27;ve got now are the high end price.</li>
            <li>It made my skin sooo soft and clean!  </li>
            <li>The butter is whipped to perfection, so smooth and absorbs quickly to leave the skin radiant and so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>After applying the body butter my skin felt hydrated but not greasy or sticky at all like I have experienced with some body butters in the past.</li>
            <li>This body butter was super hydrating and intensely scented.</li>
            <li>The package says it’s “whipped to perfection,” and it really is!</li>
            <li>a pretty severe sun burn on my arms and shoulders.</li>
            <li>My ultra-dry skin was in need of some pampering,  and it feels like I really got that with Coastal Salt and Soul Blissful Body Butter!  </li>

            <li>It leaves the skin feeling hydrated, and you feeling so pretty with the lingering scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Skin is sensitive, it was light and made my skin glow.</li>
            <li>I just thought they were trying to make this super exclusive, so that you had to go to a high end story in Manhattan to have a snooty saleswoman decide if she deigned to sell it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion an overall amazing product that has become my can&#x27;t live without, holy grail body butter.</li>
            <li>This is truly an amazing product, and I can&#x27;t wait to use some of the other items in the Coastal line.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy it on Amazon initially, because there were several sellers who were selling it at a good, discounted price.</li>
            <li>Once applied, it leaves your skin soft and full of fragrance all day.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a new way to keep my skin both hydrated and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>It left no stains and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a light floral scent so it does not compete with any fragrance you are wearing and it has Shea Butter, Sea Kelp, Irish Moss and Sea Berry to nourish, moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li>It really is that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Well, apparently they slumming on Amazon, but not when it came to the PRICE.</li>
            <li>(yeah, that sounds strange, but this really isn&#x27;t like any other scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>

            <li> I tried the Blissful Body Butter as a sample and just fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like the scent</li>
            <li> Something I would love to buy again.</li>
            <li> just fell in love with Ocean Gardenia Body Butter.</li>
            <li> I love this bodybutter.</li>
            <li> I love using it on my legs and arms before I go out.</li>
            <li> This Ocean Gardenia scent is so refreshing.</li>
            <li> It felt smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> Enticing fragrances that are light but still detectable on your skin after some time, but they do not overpower!  </li>
            <li> I love this one because it did not.</li>
            <li> recommend the Coastal Salt and Soul body butter, now you just have to decide which scent you will fall in love with.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite of all the butters I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive a sample of Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Ocean Gardenia Body Butter.</li>

            <li> I am very particular when it comes to skin products, but loved Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Ocean Gardenia Body Butter.</li>
            <li> It was great on my skin which can be sensitive at times.</li>
            <li> the way it left my skin feel so cool after application was wonderful.</li>
            <li> My skin immediately felt softer, more supple and completely comfortable.</li>
            <li> I particularly liked the texture because it wasn&#x27;t thick like most body butters so its perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> but it is truly like walking in a garden-- its a rich, luxurious smell that I love.</li>
            <li> In fact, it left it healthy looking as well as smelling great.</li>
            <li> My skin smelled so refreshing and clean.</li>

            <li> Rarely have I used a skin product that I have fell in love with immediately.  </li>
            <li> I brought a jar of the Ocean Gardenia with me to Girls&#x27; Weekend, and everyone just raved about how fantastic it smells.  </li>
            <li> The smell was AMAZING and it absorbs into the skin really well.</li>
            <li> The body butter is so smooth and velvety that you almost don&#x27;t realize how moisturizing it is.  </li>
            <li> The texture feels like creamy, whipped butter and applies to your skin so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The best part is the scent, it not too heavy, and when my daughter hugged me she said, &amp;#34;Mom</li>
            <li> I applied the body butter at night and was so impressed with how much moisture it gave my skin back.</li>
            <li> The Ocean Gardenia scent is a beautiful combination of White Gardenia + Fresh Sea Air, and the body butter also incorporates shea butter to nourish and moisturize, and sea kelp to heal and rejuvenate.</li>
            <li> The scent is utterly unique...</li>
            <li> Even though it smells fresh and it does remind me of being somewhere lost at sea but not a scent for me!</li>
            <li> My skin feels silky soft and smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> The soft flower scent is amazing.</li>

            <li> I received samples of this last year to do product testing, and I absolutely loved all of it -</li>
            <li> but of course, who pays full price if they don&#x27;t have to?)</li>
            <li> This body butter is absolute top of the line.</li>

            <li> Get ready to fall in love with Blissful Body Butter from Coastal Salt &amp; Soul. This body butter is truly unlike anything I’ve ever tried before. The package says it’s “whipped to perfection,” and it really is! The consistency of this cream is thick and luxurious. It goes on easily and absorbs into your skin to provide a lasting silky layer of light moisturizing fragrance that you’ll enjoy for hours. The Ocean Gardenia scent is a beautiful combination of White Gardenia + Fresh Sea Air, and the body butter also incorporates shea butter to nourish and moisturize, and sea kelp to heal and rejuvenate. Irish moss is in there to hydrate and soothe skin, and sea berry restores and protects. It moisturizes and softens skin, it smells delicious, but best of all it’s hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the body butter, the Coast Salt &amp; Soul family includes scented candles, salted-honey body scrub and dreamy bar soap. Gardenia not your thing? The body butter also comes in Blushing Peony (my personal favorite!) and Mediterranean Citrus scents as well.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a new way to keep my skin both hydrated and smelling fresh. I have found that in Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Body Butter. It goes on light and absorbs quickly into my skin without leaving an oily greasy feel behind. The Ocean Gardenia scent is light, refreshing, and just the perfect amount so it&#x27;s not too overpowering. It provides all day moisture and is even helping to improve the look of my skin after using it. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice moisturizer that will keep your skin hydrated and not oily.</li>
            <li> I received the Coastal Salt and Soul whipped body butter in Ocean Gardenia and it was the best body butter I have ever used! The smell was absolutely amazing and lasted for hours. My husband loved the smell as well and snuggled up  next to me as soon as I put this on. My skin felt so soft and hydrated without feeling oily. I would definitely recommend this luxurious body butter to others.</li>
            <li> This body butter is amazing. It smells incredible and when I use it my skin feels so soft and I feel like I&#x27;ve just been at a spa.</li>
            <li> Rarely have I used a skin product that I have fell in love with immediately.  My skin is&lt;br /&gt;usually dry and the summer it  is dryer than usual - but the typical lotions and creams are&lt;br /&gt;too greasy and uncomfortable for me to use.  This body butter felt good going on, had a&lt;br /&gt;terrific scent and did not feel greasy at all.  More importantly, it instantly gave my skin a silky,&lt;br /&gt;hydrated feel and the scent was light and delicious.</li>
            <li> I am very particular when it comes to skin products, but loved Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Ocean Gardenia Body Butter. It has a light floral scent so it does not compete with any fragrance you are wearing and it has Shea Butter, Sea Kelp, Irish Moss and Sea Berry to nourish, moisturize your skin. I also love that it is Hypoallergenic &amp; Dermatologist Tested. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recently received Coastal Salt &amp; Soul body butter in the Ocean Gardenia scent and I am so impressed. The day that I received the body butter I unfourtanetly was suffering from a pretty severe sun burn on my arms and shoulders. I applied the body butter at night and was so impressed with how much moisture it gave my skin back. After applying the body butter my skin felt hydrated but not greasy or sticky at all like I have experienced with some body butters in the past. The scent is a very mild floral and smells amazing. My skin tends to be somewhat sensitive and due to my sunburn it was even more sensitive at the time. This product did not irritate my skin at all and I did not peel at all! I believe the moisture this product put back in my skin saved me! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My favorite body butter to date. Lasts &#x27;ll day long. Very nice scent.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite body butter.  I brought a jar of the Ocean Gardenia with me to Girls&#x27; Weekend, and everyone just raved about how fantastic it smells.  Not overpowering at all!  I love how it hydrates my skin without that greasy feeling you get with some other body butters.  Great for summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a strange history with the Coastal Salt &amp; Soul brand. I received samples of this last year to do product testing, and I absolutely loved all of it - but I adored the body butter in this scent. Just adored it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when a company is going to introduce a product to the market, you&#x27;d think that they&#x27;d WANT people to buy it. I never saw a company like this one in my life. Emails, Facebook probes, even phone calls, all ignored. Me: &amp;#34;When will you be selling it?&amp;#34; Them: &amp;#34;Uhhhh....&amp;#34; Me: &amp;#34;Where will I be able to buy it?&amp;#34; Them: &amp;#34;Ummmm....&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company is uber artsy-fartsy (though to give them credit, many of their things are beautiful.) I just thought they were trying to make this super exclusive, so that you had to go to a high end story in Manhattan to have a snooty saleswoman decide if she deigned to sell it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when I tripped over this on Amazon. Hmmm, snooty, eh? I didn&#x27;t care. I was going to buy it on Amazon initially, because there were several sellers who were selling it at a good, discounted price. Well, apparently they slumming on Amazon, but not when it came to the PRICE. The initial sellers and their good prices disappeared, and all we&#x27;ve got now are the high end price. Hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, what the heck, I loved the body butter, so I figured I&#x27;d go for it (and I did, but not here. I found the discount sales folks, and bought it for a third less.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the product: it is probably the best body butter I&#x27;ve ever used. The scent is utterly unique...it kind of smells like a combination of beach campfire and sea air (yeah, that sounds strange, but this really isn&#x27;t like any other scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled. it&#x27;s totally addictive.) The body butter sinks into your skin and moisturizes it for an entire day. Come back in 24 hours, and your skin will feel like you just put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the frosted glass jar it comes in is gorgeous. The top looks like whitewashed driftwood. The box is also amazing - like I said, whoever does the art for this company has excellent taste. The body butter is amazing stuff, but the entire presentation of it in the jar and the box makes it a gift you&#x27;d be thrilled to give to anyone you adore. It really is that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s the other thing that gets me. This body butter IS worth the price they&#x27;re asking (but of course, who pays full price if they don&#x27;t have to?) What I don&#x27;t get is why there are so many suspicious reviews on this. So many reviews from people all in the middle of July, many of them having reviewed nothing BUT this body butter (oh, and the other scent - so why are they reviewing both? They spent $90 on two jars of body butter??) And not one that I&#x27;ve seen actually BOUGHT the body butter from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You usually get the scammy reviews from dubious sellers with inferior products. This body butter is absolute top of the line. I don&#x27;t get why they would NEED to sham it. Like I said, it&#x27;s a really weird company that just happens to make a great product. If you&#x27;re a skincare junkie like me, you&#x27;ll be thrilled. It&#x27;s a five star product, with one off for the exceptional weirdness of the company that makes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. One other thing: they make a luxurious bar of soap; again, one of the nicest bars of soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s also being sold on Amazon, and it&#x27;s also incredibly expensive at two bars for $24; if you google around, you can find it for a lot less (it only comes in two-bar boxes, one bar with this scent, and the peony one.)ewashed driftwood.

            <li> I tried the Blissful Body Butter as a sample and just fell in love with it.  It is very lightweight and luxurious.  The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and not overly sweet and it stays on your skin for hours on end.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I really fell in love with everything about this moisturizer. The scent is fantabulous and the silky texture is out of this world. I put it on just before bed and in the morning my skin still felt silky soft!</li>
            <li> This body butter was super hydrating and intensely scented. I was able to wear just a small amount and still smell the rich scent hours later. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like the scent but it is truly like walking in a garden-- its a rich, luxurious smell that I love. This would make a wonderful hostess gift, or anytime gift, or a treat for yourself.</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for a way to moisturize my skin but also leave it smelling great. I am usually reluctant to use a body butter because I instantly think it will leave my skin feeling oily. I was given a chance to try Ocean Gardenia body butter and I was so pleasantly surprised. It absorbed quickly into my skin and left it feeling so soft but not oily at all. The best part for me was the lovely scent. It did not irritate my sensitive skin so that was an added bonus!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive a sample of Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Ocean Gardenia Body Butter. My skin is sensitive and I struggle to find lotions that will not cause irritated skin.

It is quite moisturizing and nourishing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product! It smelled so delicious. Normally I would avoid anything that has the word Gardenia in the title. I assume that it will smell too flowery/grandma-ish. I WAS WRONG! It smelled great all day and left my skin so soft and not greasy.</li>

Even though it smells fresh and it does remind me of being somewhere lost at sea but not a scent for me! If it wasn&#x27;t for the smell I would of given 5 stars and would have bought this product!</li>

It is a very slight scent, but oh, so perfectly &amp;#34;just there&amp;#34;.  The body butter is so smooth and velvety that you almost don&#x27;t realize how moisturizing it is.  This is truly an amazing product, and I can&#x27;t wait to use some of the other items in the Coastal line.</li>

Even tho it has a floral  scent. The scent  is great. It makes me feel  like I&#x27;m waking  up by the ocean smelling  the blooming  flowers  and the salty  water.
