            <li>They would only look good if your nails are in perfect condition meaning if your nails have a lot of flaws on them it will show through these tips.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use them</li>

            <li>I am very happy that the order came in faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>they fall off to easily</li>
            <li>Super cute for valentines.</li>
            <li>These go on easy and are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Love this design so pretty.</li>
            <li>Received earlier then estimated delivery date, which is great and is exactly as described</li>
            <li>I purchased these tips because I thought they were really cute and the price was reasonable...</li>
            <li>These nail tips are very pretty</li>
            <li>REGULAR FINGER NAILS very easy to use and very pretty for valentines</li>
            <li>Once you have them on, they are awesome and last just like other tips.</li>
            <li>so not worth the money as they break very easy and the image came off during acrylic application!</li>
            <li>but they are very much see-through than it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li>You have to hold them very gently while gluing them on, or they may split.</li>
            <li>Some broke while filing during the initial fitting stage and others broke when I cut them to the correct lengh.</li>
            <li>I normally like this brand and have about five other types of tips, but these ones are not of good quality.</li>
            <li>So cute and organized wish I bought more shipping pretty slow ;/</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for sending them to me so fast.</li>
            <li>nice I filed them down and USED</li>
            <li>i probably won&#x27;t buy them again as the sizing of them is very differant than any i have ever bought</li>
            <li>very beautful.</li>
            <li>they break to easily when i went  to wash dishes usually other nails  </li>
            <li>These nail tips really are crystal clear.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t think it was a complete waist of money.</li>
            <li>Make sure you put a thick layer of acrylic or gel on these or the pattern will come off when you file them.</li>
            <li>Kinda thin and took a month to get here but cute for the price, if you have the time to wait.</li>

            <li> The nail were to small,my nailbed is very wide.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m return for 144pcs 3D FIMD Slice Fresh Fruit Face Nail Art Decoration Crazy Cart $1.20 From WinWinZonece.</li>
            <li> the nail art (The pink, heart design) Chipped off!!</li>
            <li> it wasnt just one or two ,all of them cracked or split in half when i push down to apply them.</li>
            <li> but if you have small to medium i wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> Not sure they are the strongest tips, as 4 of them broke within a week.</li>
            <li> Leaving the clear plastic tip behind!!  </li>
            <li> These would break with hardly any pressure.</li>
            <li> however it is hard to match up to anyone that i have tried them on at least.</li>
            <li> Too bad, they could&#x27;ve had potential.</li>
            <li> Not good to use with acrylic.</li>
            <li> some of the nail tips were broken n pieces</li>
            <li> Not happy at all</li>
            <li> Terrible, slow shipping, not as described, be careful of this seller</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> These tips are HORRIBLE!!!!</li>

            <li> These nail tips are very pretty but they are very much see-through than it appears in the picture. They would only look good if your nails are in perfect condition meaning if your nails have a lot of flaws on them it will show through these tips. I wasn&#x27;t able to use them but hopefully one day I will have a client I can them on. So I don&#x27;t think it was a complete waist of money.</li>
            <li> Love this design so pretty.</li>
            <li> some of the nail tips were broken n pieces</li>
            <li> Cute! Just like picture.</li>
            <li> These nail tips really are crystal clear. and they are beautiful .Good quality , especially considering price. These are a good value.</li>
            <li> Kinda thin and took a month to get here but cute for the price, if you have the time to wait.</li>
            <li> Received earlier then estimated delivery date, which is great and is exactly as described</li>
            <li> THEY R SO CUTE..WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE TRUE COLOR AND DESIGN….CLIENTS LOVE THEM…. MAKE SURE U ORDER PLENTY OF THEM</li>
            <li> Not good to use with acrylic.</li>
            <li> The nail were to small,my nailbed is very wide. So I&#x27;m return for 144pcs 3D FIMD Slice Fresh Fruit Face Nail Art Decoration Crazy Cart $1.20 From WinWinZonece. Please.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that the order came in faster than I expected. These go on easy and are very pretty. My clients are very happy. I will order more of these. Thank you very much for sending them to me so fast.</li>
            <li> While i do like these nails and they are gorgeous i probably won&#x27;t buy them again as the sizing of them is very differant than any i have ever bought and i have tried them on my own nails and friends and family however it is hard to match up to anyone that i have tried them on at least. So if you have really tiny nails than these might be for you but if you have small to medium i wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay on with any glue.  I have tried 3 different glues.  Too bad, they could&#x27;ve had potential.</li>
            <li> flimsy and can not use for gels............ cannot files these! so not worth the money as they break very easy and the image came off during acrylic application!</li>
            <li> These break during application. These would break with hardly any pressure. Some broke while filing during the initial fitting stage and others broke when I cut them to the correct lengh. I normally like this brand and have about five other types of tips, but these ones are not of good quality.</li>
            <li> Super cute for valentines.</li>
            <li> I just got these today but they were a big disaster. I put the glue to put them on and they cracked. Not happy at all it wasnt just one or two ,all of them cracked or split in half when i push down to apply them. Dissapointed! Not buying these kind anymore.</li>
            <li> nice I filed them down and USED AS REGULAR FINGER NAILS very easy to use and very pretty for valentines</li>
            <li> I love these tips. They look just like the picture. You have to hold them very gently while gluing them on, or they may split. Once you have them on, they are awesome and last just like other tips.</li>
            <li> These turned out great!!</li>
            <li> I will never ever order from this company again. these things melt at soon as you go to glue them on your finger. They are cheap and thin. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Make sure you put a thick layer of acrylic or gel on these or the pattern will come off when you file them. Not sure they are the strongest tips, as 4 of them broke within a week. I guess a thicker layer of acrylic will help...will try that next time. Otherwise, they are really cute!</li>
            <li> I purchased these tips because I thought they were really cute and the price was reasonable...but they are GARBAGE!!! They cracked during application!!! I had to remove and reapply the tips before I even put the gel on! After FINALLY getting them on, a week later.. A WEEK!!! the nail art (The pink, heart design) Chipped off!! Leaving the clear plastic tip behind!!  BUYERS BEWARE!!!! These tips are HORRIBLE!!!! I wouldn&#x27;t give these pieces of garbage ANY stars if that were an option!!! NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> they fall off to easily they break to easily when i went  to wash dishes usually other nails  dont fall off</li>
            <li> They are cute and packaged good</li>
            <li> So cute and organized wish I bought more shipping pretty slow ;/</li>
            <li> Terrible, slow shipping, not as described, be careful of this seller</li>
            <li> very beautful. top of the line acrylic nail tips! loved them. i would definitly recoomment these nails to friends. :)</li>
