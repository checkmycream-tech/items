            <li>Keep a bottle handy at all times.</li>
            <li>top isn&#x27;t the best, so it will leak and you&#x27;ll get oil everywhere if you are not careful and store it upright</li>
            <li>but i love love love it as an eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m still trying to discover more uses for it.</li>
            <li>There are so many uses and benefits with this oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe OK if you need to save a dollar or two and can buy it at the store-</li>
            <li>so it can be used more</li>
            <li>I trust Trader Joe&#x27;s products, as I have been shopping there for many years.</li>
            <li>It arrived safely.</li>
            <li>The snap top is easy to use without spilling.</li>
            <li>I will update when I have more info about it but as far as I know its a great product</li>
            <li>I have always loved jojoba, can&#x27;t say I see much difference with trader joes brand except for the exhorbitant price.</li>
            <li>Used this in my bath water, skin felt smooth after the bath.</li>
            <li>Great quality and has multiple uses for my scalp, hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this Jojoba Oil,&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>This oil has a light burnt smell that bothers me when I apply it to my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how it absorbs into your skin right away and does not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>After just 4 days I have noticed significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>it was pretty rare for me to get a zit!</li>
            <li>so I bought it and compared it to this one and the dessert essence was not watery and actually moisturized my hair and lasted for most of the day unlike traders Joes.</li>
            <li>I exactly what I wanted.. Arrived on time</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed &amp; was priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>I found dessert essence sold pure jojoba oil</li>
            <li>Pure Jojoba oil 4 oz liquid]]  </li>
            <li>thanks for this product</li>
            <li>feel very refreshed in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I buy this very often for myself and family members.</li>
            <li>Just as expected, even better</li>
            <li>I go through so much of this</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t even tell there is oil on top of my nails, which my other cuticle oil from Sally&#x27;s Beauty will show).</li>
            <li>This oil was ok , I definitely had to try it out because of the hype around it, it really just felt like a regular oil to me (on m scalp and skin) and it had this smell to it that i wasnt too fond of</li>
            <li>I had acne off and on and redness throughout high school and college.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very close to the natural oils in your hair and skin, so it is mainly beneficial.</li>
            <li>(I used sage oil from Whole foods and put a drop directly on it.</li>
            <li>Less sebum, smaller pores and very smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I can even wear nail polish and still moisturize my cuticles with this oil without the oil creating a dull film on top of my nail color</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>i apply this smear it around and remove with a sensitive unscented baby wipe.</li>
            <li>but it wasnt a loud a\smell, probably wont buy again</li>
            <li>So far Im liking it.</li>
            <li>More importantly it is not the same quality as the [[ASIN:B0000C0XL8</li>
            <li>I add small amounts to my daily routine, and my hair is softer and smoother, it works better than head and shoulders, and has improved the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>but buying it here is a true waste of money.  </li>
            <li>This oil has been very helpful on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>But one time I came across here in amazon to search product that will prevent my pores to get clogged with dirt, I saw this Pure Jojoba Oil, I started to use it just to try it out, and few days later I start to noticed my skin becomes clearer and softer.</li>

            <li> Nearly odorless but keeps my face moisturized and my beard looking less savage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have any instructions, so often people use too much and have negative side effects (break out, greasy hair)</li>
            <li> Made me break out and now I have three itchy dry spots on my face that aren&#x27;t going away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on me and my daughters hair and for my dry hands at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> This was because of the dry scalp problem...Came acros this product in Amazon and tried it...</li>
            <li> I bought it because my daughter has really dry hair</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, there is no need to use excess, just a tiny will do.</li>
            <li> You can literally get this same product at Trader Joe&#x27;s for half the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this oil at Trader Joe&#x27;s a few years back for about 5 or 6 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no breakouts from using this product.  </li>
            <li> About a few months of using this oil, I noticed my acne didn&#x27;t come back like it did in the past.</li>
            <li> I always had a problem with having a lot of black heads..</li>
            <li> And the black heads just automatically falling off my skin..</li>
            <li> I buy this from Trader Joes, it is about half the price.</li>
            <li> A few months of use I had less and less recurring acne</li>
            <li> Trader Joe&#x27;s I thought nothing of it, just needed a moisturizer without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to put a lot of make-up no more to cover up my skin problems now..</li>
            <li> I usually use Desert Essence jojoba oil but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be confused-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is watery and not actually organic. When I opened this product it felt watery so I immediately began looking for a different one. I found dessert essence sold pure jojoba oil and they actually have the usda certified organic sticker on the bottle so I bought it and compared it to this one and the dessert essence was not watery and actually moisturized my hair and lasted for most of the day unlike traders Joes. Traders Joes was watery and didn&#x27;t even last an hour in my hair. I do not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Trader Joe&#x27;s for about $8 for use on my nails and cuticles. So far I like it. I like that I can even wear nail polish and still moisturize my cuticles with this oil without the oil creating a dull film on top of my nail color (I can&#x27;t even tell there is oil on top of my nails, which my other cuticle oil from Sally&#x27;s Beauty will show).</li>
            <li> item as described, arrived as stated.</li>
            <li> Used this in my bath water, skin felt smooth after the bath. Will buy again. Rita</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is great for so many things, and I trust Trader Joe&#x27;s quality. I used this when traveling because one product moisturized face, body, and hair. The snap top is easy to use without spilling.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is a multi-purpose oil.  It is is wonderful for use on skin, hair, nail beds. Keep a bottle handy at all times.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is great alone....use it on my legs and sometimes mixes it with my Argan oil for my Locs.</li>
            <li> cant use it on my face because jojoba oil breaks me out but i love love love it as an eye makeup remover. i apply this smear it around and remove with a sensitive unscented baby wipe. love.</li>
            <li> Minimizes those big pores!</li>
            <li> Purchased this oil at Trader Joe&#x27;s a few years back for about 5 or 6 bucks. I had acne off and on and redness throughout high school and college. When I grabbed it off the shelf at Trader Joe&#x27;s I thought nothing of it, just needed a moisturizer without harsh chemicals. I used it every night before bed and within a week my acne was gone and skin was hydrated in the morning. About a few months of using this oil, I noticed my acne didn&#x27;t come back like it did in the past. I would get a big cystic zit once in a while. (I used sage oil from Whole foods and put a drop directly on it. Zit was flat within a day or two!) A few months of use I had less and less recurring acne it was pretty rare for me to get a zit! I also added oils such as shea, almond, and coconut, my skin loves them all.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it daily on my hair and it keeps my scalp moisturized. I found out about this product through YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> I always had a problem with having a lot of black heads.. so it made me constantly come back to have some facial. But one time I came across here in amazon to search product that will prevent my pores to get clogged with dirt, I saw this Pure Jojoba Oil, I started to use it just to try it out, and few days later I start to noticed my skin becomes clearer and softer. And the black heads just automatically falling off my skin.. I don&#x27;t have to put a lot of make-up no more to cover up my skin problems now.. thanks for this product Trader Joe&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Great quality and has multiple uses for my scalp, hair and skin. And I&#x27;m still trying to discover more uses for it.</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil! Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Made me break out and now I have three itchy dry spots on my face that aren&#x27;t going away. I&#x27;m going to a dermatologist this week.</li>
            <li> There are so many uses and benefits with this oil. I&#x27;ve used it on me and my daughters hair and for my dry hands at night before I go to bed. I love how it absorbs into your skin right away and does not leave a greasy feel. This is a great oil to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this Jojoba Oil,&lt;br /&gt;on my face at night.&lt;br /&gt;I feel very refreshed in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your cooperation,&lt;br /&gt;Monika</li>
            <li> I use it for remove make up, it is quite good.</li>
            <li> This oil was ok , I definitely had to try it out because of the hype around it, it really just felt like a regular oil to me (on m scalp and skin) and it had this smell to it that i wasnt too fond of but it wasnt a loud a\smell, probably wont buy again but I made good use out of this making y own leave in I dont think it contributed but</li>
            <li> My hair was itching even after shampooing and conditioning...This was because of the dry scalp problem...Came acros this product in Amazon and tried it...Its amazing...I m applying this once in two days and the day after hair wash...My scalp does not itch anymore...its does not leave an oily look....Im happy ... now</li>
            <li> I buy this very often for myself and family members. And everyone in my family loves the good feel of the oil</li>
            <li> Just as expected, even better</li>
            <li> Excelent !! I use on my hair and face every night</li>
            <li> I bought it because my daughter has really dry hair and I heard it was really good for the hair, So far Im liking it. I cant say a lot about it because Im trying alot of organic products on her hair and I still have a lot of work and its going to take me a while to see any difference but I have heard great thing about jojoba oil. I will update when I have more info about it but as far as I know its a great product</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Product is what was pictured. This oil has been very helpful on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Mixed it with coconut oil for beard oil. Nearly odorless but keeps my face moisturized and my beard looking less savage.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that reduces sebum in my facial skin around my nose and this product is working.  After just 4 days I have noticed significant improvement.  Less sebum, smaller pores and very smooth skin.  I have had absolutely no breakouts from using this product.  Why was I not told about this product 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> 1.  Don&#x27;t be confused- you are paying a steep price for the shipping of this item.  This retails for $6-7 at Trader Joe&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  More importantly it is not the same quality as the [[ASIN:B0000C0XL8 Desert Essence Organic Jojoba Oil, 4-Ounce Bottle]] or [[ASIN:B001428W6W Desert Essence - 100% Pure Jojoba oil 4 oz liquid]]  This oil has a light burnt smell that bothers me when I apply it to my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trader Joe&#x27;s used to carry the Desert Essence brand in their store, when they switched to private label they also switched to a different supplier and lower quality of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe OK if you need to save a dollar or two and can buy it at the store- but buying it here is a true waste of money.  Do yourself a favor, buy a cheaper version or buy a better quality or do both!</li>
            <li> I buy this from Trader Joes, it is about half the price. I consider it close to a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very close to the natural oils in your hair and skin, so it is mainly beneficial. I do know people that began using it in the summer, which caused them to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, there is no need to use excess, just a tiny will do. I add small amounts to my daily routine, and my hair is softer and smoother, it works better than head and shoulders, and has improved the look and feel of my skin. (Again, I started in winter, not summer applying it to skin). It is lighter than coconut oil so it can be used more universally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY 3 STARS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaper in store than online, it is about $7-8 dollars in the store.&lt;br /&gt;The top isn&#x27;t the best, so it will leak and you&#x27;ll get oil everywhere if you are not careful and store it upright AT ALL TIMES.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have any instructions, so often people use too much and have negative side effects (break out, greasy hair)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works great on my skin!</li>
            <li> It is what I wanted.I trust Trader Joe&#x27;s products, as I have been shopping there for many years. It arrived safely.</li>
            <li> What a ripoff.  I buy it for 7.99 at trader joes store.  I go through so much of this I thought I would save through amazon- not.</li>
            <li> Use it in my face cleaner, as a moisturizer, and as a leave in conditioner for my hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed &amp; was priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> You can literally get this same product at Trader Joe&#x27;s for half the price. If there&#x27;s not a TJ&#x27;s by you, find another brand! I usually use Desert Essence jojoba oil but decided to give this a try. It is not the same quality as Desert Essence. It&#x27;s gritty for a jojoba oil. Will be happy when my bottle is used up.</li>
            <li> I have always loved jojoba, can&#x27;t say I see much difference with trader joes brand except for the exhorbitant price. But pure jojoba oil is the best. I won&#x27;t be buying trader joe&#x27;s again. Way too expensive, but I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I exactly what I wanted.. Arrived on time</li>
