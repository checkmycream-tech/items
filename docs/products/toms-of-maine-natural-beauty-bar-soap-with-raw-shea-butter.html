            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and the amazon price is better than those in health food stores.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine soap for about a year now, and we love it.  </li>
            <li>I thought they had discontinued my favourite soap! :)</li>
            <li>When my all time favorite was discontinued, (Calendula), I had to find a replacement.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this soap!</li>
            <li>Glad I stuck with Toms&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li>I love the way this soap smells and feels.</li>
            <li>I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine bar soaps.</li>
            <li>I do find it reduces my stress a bit, and makes showers enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, I have sensitive skin and try to use all-natural products, so when I found this soap, I was uber happy.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap, makes me feel clean</li>
            <li>I figured it was probably too strong and opted to use it on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>Cleans without smelling too strongly.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best soap out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And I very much prefer the more herbla lavender scents over the more floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hands down the best cruelty free soap bar...</li>
            <li>product is available in a store in my area but each soap bar is about 4$.</li>
            <li>The lavender smell is fantastic and relaxing.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>It feels creamy, it smells very nice, and my skin feels terrific.</li>
            <li>So Thanks Amazon for selling a great product for a decent price.</li>
            <li>That in of itself is worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>It gives a nice mild lather, smells nice but not overpowering, and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this daily for your face though, but it&#x27;s good in those emergency moments.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t inexpensive compared to others, but they all smell good (I&#x27;ve tried several varieties) and leave you feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>other scents are great pals with my armpit.</li>
            <li>I like this one because it is mild and does not irritated my skin at all</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural product that was full size, smelled good, decent price and worked well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any other soap since trying this one, and it leaves my skin feeling very nice as well.</li>
            <li>So this all natural soap is perfect and works like any other soap.</li>
            <li>The subtle scent of lavender is very appealing in a warm shower before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Honestly I found this product to be drying, for not only my face but my hands as well.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Love the natural soaps.  </li>
            <li>The thing I think I like most about it is that when it sits in the soap dish in my shower, the bottom of the bar doesn&#x27;t get soggy like most other soaps.  </li>
            <li>Great lather, lasts a very long time (much longer than other soaps), and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Trying to cut out as many as humanly possible for me and my family.</li>
            <li>First off, the smell is heavenly.  </li>
            <li>you I live in Los Angeles and the weather has been pretty warm here so its not weather related.</li>
            <li>It smells nice on its own, but then something goes horribly wrong as soon as it hits my armpit.</li>
            <li>In addition, this bar lasts more than twice as long as the less-expensive soaps I buy from a big-box store.  </li>
            <li>last long smells good</li>
            <li>I am careful to NOT keep it in water when I take a bath; it does tend to turn to goop then, as most gentle soaps do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smells like real lavendar, not perfume.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like it wants me to smell like I have never showered ever in my life.</li>
            <li>The packaging and their detail philanthropy really gives off a lot of admiration for this product.</li>
            <li>They lather very well, and aren&#x27;t too slippery.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much that I&#x27;ve put it on my Subscribe &amp; Save list.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for people with sensitive skin and like mild, relaxing fragrances.</li>
            <li>Wild!!!</li>
            <li>Most other soaps cause her skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>I first started using Tom&#x27;s deodorant which has no aluminum in it (which causes Alzheimer&#x27;s) I than was looking for a really all natural soap and Toms&#x27; came to mind.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to work down square corners and edges like many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; bars.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine used to be more basic, back to nature ingredients to my recollection.  </li>
            <li>This soap is all natural, very hydrating and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I also like that they are more natural that the chemically loaded typical soap.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to chemicals and this soap does not bother my skin.  </li>
            <li>My wife has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, it moisturizes the skin (even after being in chlorine) and the lather is soft.  </li>
            <li>after just a week of use, it completely cleared up the bumps on my arms (keratosis pilaris).  </li>
            <li>That was an unexpected benefit.  </li>
            <li>However, they do get soft in the shower but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It clearly has a vendetta against me and my social life.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>not dry out skin.</li>
            <li>have sensitive and dry skin with occasional eczema and</li>

    <ol>
            <li> last long smells good</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells great, lathers good. Be careful though, cuz Amazon jacks the price up every now and then. Typical shenanigans from those guys. Buyer beware</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with quality and price</li>
            <li> my favorite soap. smells like real lavendar, not perfume.</li>
            <li> The Tom&#x27;s of Maine lavender soap is delightful. The skin care and smell are hard to find together in a natural soap.  Great work, Tom&#x27;s of Maine!</li>
            <li> Love this soap, makes me feel clean and my boyfriend tells me I smell good. That in of itself is worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine used to be more basic, back to nature ingredients to my recollection.  I don&#x27;t remember their soap having as many ingredients that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce before . . .</li>
            <li> This soap smells amazing. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5, because although it claims not to, it does dry my skin out a little bit.</li>
            <li> Very nice soap.  Love the lavender fragrance.  Good transaction.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing.  It smells wonderful, it moisturizes the skin (even after being in chlorine) and the lather is soft.  I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing...I&#x27;m always looking for scents that aren&#x27;t sicky sweet and this bar is perfect for me.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Yaaaaaaah!!!!!! Wild!!! Wow!!!%#@#%^~*my life will never be the same....how do they do it......unbelievable.....can you believe it and a written review</li>
            <li> I love lavender.  It was sudsy enough to shave my legs too!  So happy it is offered for Subscribe &amp; Save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  after just a week of use, it completely cleared up the bumps on my arms (keratosis pilaris).  That was an unexpected benefit.  I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient helped with it, but YAY!</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for lavender scents, especially in soap. And I very much prefer the more herbla lavender scents over the more floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lovely bar of soap. It is a bit soft; I don&#x27;t shower, so it undergoes less wearing that way. I am careful to NOT keep it in water when I take a bath; it does tend to turn to goop then, as most gentle soaps do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while I had found a really HARD soap with similar scents and gentleness... but it was discontinued, and this is also an excellent soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least if you like an herbal lavender!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any facial skin care products other than witch hazel, and occasional winter use of Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Visible Difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a fan of tea tree oil soap for years for face and body, however as I am aging, I find it too drying for my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome for face and body. It&#x27;s not drying, but it&#x27;s not oily.  I can use it in the morning and at night.  Since I don&#x27;t use foundation make-up, just powder, I don&#x27;t know if it will remove it, but I don&#x27;t know why it wouldn&#x27;t.  Mascara washes off with this soap. The subtle scent of lavender is very appealing in a warm shower before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made a pump version for my bathroom and kitchen sinks.</li>
            <li> We have been buying this soap for years. My husband swears by it because he has dry skin, our public water is on the hard side and using this soap keeps his skin from itching. I like it, it smells good, but I have to put on lotion no matter what I use for soap. My favorite lotion is the Aveeno baby in lavender. It&#x27;s the only lotion that keeps my skin from itching, especially in winter. I like the combination.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Unless it is the Sage variety, then I would prefer not to shower.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this soap is great. Lavender is the best. Smells great, works great, doesn&#x27;t disintegrate fast like some soaps can.&lt;br /&gt;But the SAGE!!! It makes my armpits smell worse than when they got in the shower. It smells nice on its own, but then something goes horribly wrong as soon as it hits my armpit. My husband agrees that the sage hates me. The sage loves him, he smells lovely after his sage soap shower.&lt;br /&gt;The other scents are great pals with my armpit. They make me smell so lovely all over. Like I have actually showered.&lt;br /&gt;Sage does not. It&#x27;s like it wants me to smell like I have never showered ever in my life. And it fulfills this mission every time I forget and use it.&lt;br /&gt;It clearly has a vendetta against me and my social life.&lt;br /&gt;And sadly we bought it in bulk before we knew of it&#x27;s mission to destroy me. So now it just mocks me from the pantry.&lt;br /&gt;Great soap, great brand, just skip the Sage.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of allergies and this is one of the only soaps that I can use. I am quite satisfied with the soap. I have used a number of Tom&#x27;s products, and never been disappointed in any of them.</li>
            <li> This soap is all natural, very hydrating and relaxing. I love it and I would recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best soap out there.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive and dry skin with occasional eczema and this soap is the best to wash my face and body.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It&#x27;s cruelty free and smells great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the great reviews. Honestly I found this product to be drying, for not only my face but my hands as well. I used it on my face and a few days later I noticed some dry patches and peeling. My face never does this and I have no acne or blemishes. I figured it was probably too strong and opted to use it on my bathroom sink. I am typing to you now with dry cracked hands...mind you I live in Los Angeles and the weather has been pretty warm here so its not weather related. Kind of disappointed and having to do a lot to fix my facial skin. My only advice test on your body first before you use on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and the amazon price is better than those in health food stores.</li>
            <li> It might be winter, but my skin is drying out after I started using this soap...</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine soap for about a year now, and we love it.  Amazon makes it easy to purchase the bars in bulk for a good price.  Anyways, I have sensitive skin and try to use all-natural products, so when I found this soap, I was uber happy.  My one complaint is the excess packaging they use - the soap comes wrapped in an extra plastic layer inside a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Relaxing\\&quot; is their lavender bar, btw.  The product name change threw me off for a little while there.  I thought they had discontinued my favourite soap! :)</li>
            <li> Cleans without smelling too strongly.</li>
            <li> The packaging and their detail philanthropy really gives off a lot of admiration for this product. The smell and texture that leaves on the skin is really good.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best cruelty free soap bar... LOVE lavender !</li>
            <li> I like the Tom&#x27;s of Maine soaps. When my all time favorite was discontinued, (Calendula), I had to find a replacement. I tried a few other ones and decided on this and also  the all natural bar unscented.I like this one because it is mild and does not irritated my skin at all, none of the Tom&#x27;s soaps is irritating to me. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap- good smell and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like cheap soap does.</li>
            <li> Great lather, lasts a very long time (much longer than other soaps), and smells nice.  Oh, and it cleans like you&#x27;ve come to expect from a soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap about a month and I love it. It smells wonderful and it does not dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li> excellent soap. smells like lavender and produces lots of suds.&lt;br /&gt;does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> The best soap that I have ever used. Worth every penny. I cannot apply any other soap with out getting pimples in my face except this. I will buy it again and again as long as it is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same product is available in a store in my area but each soap bar is about 4$. So Thanks Amazon for selling a great product for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this soap! I bought it based upon other reviews. I was looking for a natural product that was full size, smelled good, decent price and worked well. This is it!</li>
            <li> Love the natural soaps.  Allergic to regular soaps with scents</li>
            <li> I first started using Tom&#x27;s deodorant which has no aluminum in it (which causes Alzheimer&#x27;s) I than was looking for a really all natural soap and Toms&#x27; came to mind. It is the best natural soap with lavender oil in it. Glad I stuck with Toms&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome.  It gives a nice mild lather, smells nice but not overpowering, and lasts a long time.  The bar is roundish so you don&#x27;t have to work down square corners and edges like many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; bars.  The thing I think I like most about it is that when it sits in the soap dish in my shower, the bottom of the bar doesn&#x27;t get soggy like most other soaps.  I haven&#x27;t yet met a Tom&#x27;s of Maine product I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Toxins are every where! Trying to cut out as many as humanly possible for me and my family. Soap is a big deal because our skin absorbs! So this all natural soap is perfect and works like any other soap.</li>
            <li> Love the lavender moisturizing soap! It&#x27;s the only soap I found that I can use. I highly recommend it for people with sensitive skin and like mild, relaxing fragrances.</li>
            <li> I love the way this soap smells and feels. There is no residue. However, they do get soft in the shower but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. The lavender smell is fantastic and relaxing. I like that if I run out of face wash, I can use this and not have to worry about the harsh chemicals I may using on my face or stripping my face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this daily for your face though, but it&#x27;s good in those emergency moments.</li>
            <li> Smells great; feels great. It&#x27;s the only soap we will use from now on. I don&#x27;t know if the lavender scent is truly relaxing but it is certainly pleasant.</li>
            <li> Longer lasting than expected. Very good without leaving a coating on your skin after washing. Will continue&lt;br /&gt;to reorder this.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to chemicals and this soap does not bother my skin.  Does a good job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine bar soaps. They aren&#x27;t inexpensive compared to others, but they all smell good (I&#x27;ve tried several varieties) and leave you feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My wife said she liked the soap. She said it was a toss up between this and Yardley soap.</li>
            <li> First off, the smell is heavenly.  I do find it reduces my stress a bit, and makes showers enjoyable.  It lasts for quite a bit; with two of us using them daily they tend to last about two to three weeks.  I also like that they are more natural that the chemically loaded typical soap.  They lather very well, and aren&#x27;t too slippery.  I haven&#x27;t used any other soap since trying this one, and it leaves my skin feeling very nice as well.</li>
            <li> My wife has very sensitive skin and this is her preferred soap.  Most other soaps cause her skin irritation.  In addition, this bar lasts more than twice as long as the less-expensive soaps I buy from a big-box store.  All-in-all an excellent product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! Searched for years trying different soaps that wouldn&#x27;t dry-out skin or leave a &#x27;film&#x27; behind...this is it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else I can say about this. It feels creamy, it smells very nice, and my skin feels terrific. Fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is great soap! I like it so much that I&#x27;ve put it on my Subscribe &amp; Save list.</li>
