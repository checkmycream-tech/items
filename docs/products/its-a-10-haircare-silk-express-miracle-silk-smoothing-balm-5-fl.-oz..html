            <li>Enjoy using this product, the smell of it is great</li>
            <li>Great smell, light, but holds and provides lift.  </li>
            <li>Works well to keep split ends in line and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it right when you get out of the shower for the best results.</li>
            <li>My is very fine, and over processed with perms.  </li>
            <li>The Silk Express shampoo is my favorite of the line as it creates much more of a lather than the Miracle Shampoo with Keratin.</li>
            <li>I found that when I used the Silk Express conditioner I needed to use much more than when I use the Miracle with Keratin conditioner.</li>
            <li>However if I am straightening my hair (which is most of the time)</li>
            <li>Love Love love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i love all their products and they will get have 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li>One star for the scent, love the scent.</li>
            <li>This is okay for styling your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x60;m otherwise using the Pureology Supersmooth series, but discontinued their Smoothing Cream in favor of this, because it just works so much better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love how this gives my colored hair a glossy shine without being sticky and tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>I could see it being ok for someone who has medium/thin oily prone hair that needs a lightweight balm.</li>
            <li>Love all their products.  </li>
            <li>Love this on my hair.</li>
            <li>It worked ok but not any better than anything I have used.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell, though.  </li>
            <li>I love the matching shampoo and conditioner, so I purchased this product based on the description of what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this fabulous product for over two years now and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best product I have found to beat the frizz.</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>it is to get the smooth look I&#x60;m used to.</li>
            <li>I helps smooth my hair and softens it.  </li>
            <li>This has changed the texture of my hair into smooth and silky strands.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different hair oils and shine boosters and the best one I&#x27;ve tried by far is Matrix Oil Wonders.</li>
            <li>They are still far superior to supermarket or even salon quality</li>
            <li>Love it and coming back for more!</li>
            <li>I used to have silky fine, straight, blond hair, but the more gray hair</li>
            <li>It smells like Davidoff Cool Water, kind of masculine, and not me.</li>
            <li>I think there are much greater hair styling products out there when you start spending this much money.</li>
            <li>My wife likes this product and she was able to purchase it at a lower cost than she normally pays.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My professional used this product on my hair, so I knew I would love it.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell the difference and am now adding my older products to complete the job.</li>
            <li>I have used other Its a 10 products and loved them, not this case with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Since this was a new product I wasnt sure if it was really going to work.</li>
            <li>Like with many other cosmetic products I wish they made a fragrance free version.</li>
            <li>To start off with - I&#x27;m an avid fan of the</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I put a dime size amount in my hand as directed then applied it to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use Sebastian shampoo and a hot tools air brush with this serum.</li>
            <li>I went through twice as much conditioner in the same amount of time using the Silk Express and my hair didn&#x27;t feel any better whatsoever.</li>
            <li>positive thing I can say about it</li>
            <li>I have curly, dry hair and this product was just okay.</li>
            <li>The light fresh scent lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for for dry prone/thick hair that needs more help from styling products.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to try this particular</li>
            <li>If I want to blow my hair straight</li>
            <li>My hair absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I have to wonder if it was the real thing...</li>
            <li>I usually love all of the products from this brand but this one just didn&#x27;t do what I had expected.</li>
            <li>My hair girl is going to get me the whole line when she restocks.  </li>
            <li>(Much cheaper on Amazon.com than in her boutique.)  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair shiny and soft and the price is right.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t sticky like many other products.</li>
            <li>Bought this with a kit and wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work but leaves my hair very glossy without weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li>Less is more</li>
            <li>Decent hair serum.</li>
            <li>Leave-In Balm: The second most crucial part of my hair care regime is the leave-in smoothing balm.</li>
            <li>they do a decent job of keeping away the frizz.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Ulta and had high hopes..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love that this cuts down on drying time, too!</li>
            <li>They are both solid products and if I am leaving my hair wavy (which is rare)</li>
            <li>and I could definitely tell a difference the first time she applied it.  </li>
            <li>I used a dime size amount the first time and experimented with different amounts each use...</li>
            <li>I wish the keratin shampoo lathered better, but I need to use less conditioner with it, and that&#x27;s a big plus considering the cost of these products.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair sleek and soft.</li>
            <li>Silky, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>By the way Amazon&#x27;s price is way lower than my professional.</li>
            <li>I gave it a week worth of tries.  </li>
            <li>I spray the leave in spray first and then brush my hair, then distribute this product throughout (not my scalp) and then blow dry.</li>
            <li>My hair felt drier and less manageable than before I used it and it smelled like it was full of chemiclas.</li>
            <li>You need to get down just how much you need which isn&#x27;t much even with my waist length hair.</li>
            <li>The smoothing balm tames frizzy ends and also helps my hair dry much faster.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>My hair noticeably dried faster with a blow dryer and round brush but also feels smother and silkier and looks healthy and shiny</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and coarse and I need help getting a brush/comb through it without becoming bald.....</li>
            <li>Wow my hair does dry faster and it looks like I came from a salon.  </li>

            <li> Wow my hair does dry faster and it looks like I came from a salon.  </li>
            <li> Just remember you only need a little bit, my hair goes to the bottom of my bra strap, is fine but thick</li>
            <li> I will be reordering, but it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It maintained my curl, but left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> However if you have dry hair, like me, you will prefer the way your hair feels after shampooing when using then shampoo with keratin.</li>
            <li> , I think it takes my hair longer to dry after I apply it.</li>
            <li> I have course, dry, hair.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave it only four stars is that it leaves my hair slightly drier, and I&#x60;m not really into the fragrance for myself.</li>
            <li> I would not say it left my hair crunchy, but it was slightly firm, nothing like gel.&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is dry, I would layer the macadamia oil leave in cream over its a 10.</li>
            <li> You use so little, it will last.</li>

            <li> I have thick blonde wavy hair. Kinda like an 80&#x27;s perm. The smoothing balm tames frizzy ends and also helps my hair dry much faster. If I want to blow my hair straight I use this instead of straightening products. Leaves my hair sleek and soft. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Decent hair serum. Helps with my fizzy flyaways without being heavy or greasy. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> To start off with - I&#x27;m an avid fan of the It&#x27;s a 10 products so I&#x27;m rating the Silk Express Miracle line over other It&#x27;s a 10 products. They are still far superior to supermarket or even salon quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Silk Express Miracle Shampoo, Conditioner, and Balm as a total set for the last 6 weeks. Here is my impression of the set as compared to the Miracle with Keratin line of products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shampoo: The Silk Express shampoo is my favorite of the line as it creates much more of a lather than the Miracle Shampoo with Keratin. That&#x27;s a big plus. However if you have dry hair, like me, you will prefer the way your hair feels after shampooing when using then shampoo with keratin. I wish the keratin shampoo lathered better, but I need to use less conditioner with it, and that&#x27;s a big plus considering the cost of these products. 3 stars for the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Conditioner: To me a conditioner is the bread and butter of hair care. So this is the crucial piece for me. I found that when I used the Silk Express conditioner I needed to use much more than when I use the Miracle with Keratin conditioner. It&#x27;s partially because my hair feels less dry after using the shampoo with keratin, and I think it&#x27;s also because without the keratin the Silk Express is just an inferior conditioner. I went through twice as much conditioner in the same amount of time using the Silk Express and my hair didn&#x27;t feel any better whatsoever. 2 stars for the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Leave-In Balm: The second most crucial part of my hair care regime is the leave-in smoothing balm. Here is where I stray from the It&#x27;s a 10 line. I found that the It&#x27;s a 10 Mircale with Keratin and the It&#x27;s a 10 Silk Express balms performed about the same. They are both solid products and if I am leaving my hair wavy (which is rare) they do a decent job of keeping away the frizz. Not perfect, but decent. However if I am straightening my hair (which is most of the time) the BEST product on the market is Chi Silk Infusion. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it. 3 stars for the balm but 5 stars for Chi Silk Infusion instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I have long, medium thick, color treated, wavy hair that is quite dry.</li>
            <li> Love Love love this product.  My hair stylist used it and I decided to try it.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try this particular It&#x27;s a 10 product and it is fantastic.  My hair absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair dresser, and boy, was she spot on.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical in regards to the 10 listed potentials, but after using it I am hooked! Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> i love all their products and they will get have 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product and she was able to purchase it at a lower cost than she normally pays.</li>
            <li> Do not like, very disappointed,  all I did was just waste my money on this pricy it&#x27;s a 10 silk. One star for the scent, love the scent. This purchase makes me wanna cry.</li>
            <li> Love this! Leaves my hair silky! Shiney and looks silkey in the sun! No fragrance at all, so my husband can use it too.  I will be reordering, but it will last a long time. You use so little, it will last.</li>
            <li> The product is ok, however, I do not like the smell at all! Other products in this &#x27;It&#x27;s A 10&#x27; line are great.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hairdresser.  It was a good find for me.  Really good for taming fly away hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This is okay for styling your hair.  You just have to use a little bit or your hair will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product. As described. Will continue to purchase this product, great pricing. I use quite a few of these products</li>
            <li> Love the smell and Prost works great</li>
            <li> I had a friend recommend this product to me. I have used other Its a 10 products and loved them, not this case with this purchase. It does not leave my hair silky smooth AT ALL. in fact, I have noticed a lot of tangles after use. I have to wonder if it was the real thing...?&lt;br /&gt;only positive thing I can say about it is that it smells really good. Wish I had never purchased...</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best product I have found to beat the frizz. I used to have silky fine, straight, blond hair, but the more gray hair I get the harder it is to get the smooth look I&#x60;m used to. I&#x60;m otherwise using the Pureology Supersmooth series, but discontinued their Smoothing Cream in favor of this, because it just works so much better. The reason I gave it only four stars is that it leaves my hair slightly drier, and I&#x60;m not really into the fragrance for myself. It smells like Davidoff Cool Water, kind of masculine, and not me. Like with many other cosmetic products I wish they made a fragrance free version.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser has been using this product on me for the past year and I could definitely tell a difference the first time she applied it.  I had to order it myself so I could use it every day myself and not once every two months! I pair this with the It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in spray- the two make a great pair! I spray the leave in spray first and then brush my hair, then distribute this product throughout (not my scalp) and then blow dry. I love that this cuts down on drying time, too!</li>
            <li> I placed my Order on April, 24th and it said that it would deliever on May 5th at the latest....and GUESS WHAT? Its May 17th, I still have not yet seen my order..... I emailed the seller multiple times, and NOTHING....I mean what is it that I need to do in order to get my order that I ALREADY paid for???</li>
            <li> Nothing smoothing about this, horrible.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using this product, the smell of it is great</li>
            <li> Since this was a new product I wasnt sure if it was really going to work. It smells great and works great. I have frizzy dry hair and needed a little extra to tame my hair especially during the summer months. Makes your hair shiny and soft and the price is right. Great find!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I can definitely tell a difference in the texture of my hair from when I use it versus when I don&#x27;t. Make sure you use it right when you get out of the shower for the best results.</li>
            <li> this product is not the best from it&#x27;s a 10, I think it takes my hair longer to dry after I apply it.</li>
            <li> I love how this gives my colored hair a glossy shine without being sticky and tacky feeling. You need to get down just how much you need which isn&#x27;t much even with my waist length hair. Less is more</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected it to be.  It is sticky and when it dries it is crunchy.  If you comb/brush through it after it dries it caused my hair to frizz.  I gave it a week worth of tries.  I tried a lot, a little and it just didn&#x27;t matter.  Pretty disappointed in it.  I won&#x27;t purchase this product again, but I still will use the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Leave In&amp;#34; product.  That one is awesome.</li>
            <li> love this and use it all the time - great product for a great price.  a must for all my hair care needs :P</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fabulous product for over two years now and LOVE it. Just one squirt on wet hair and dry as usual. Leaves my hair feeling and looking silky without being heavy. Recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Its a 10 is a very nice and nice smelling product.. will order again when we run out..  Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this at Ulta and had high hopes..I was very disappointed!  My hair was less manageable than before and almost felt crunchy. I used a dime size amount the first time and experimented with different amounts each use...nothing changed. I can&#x27;t think of one thing I like except maybe the smell.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for for dry prone/thick hair that needs more help from styling products. I could see it being ok for someone who has medium/thin oily prone hair that needs a lightweight balm. I think there are much greater hair styling products out there when you start spending this much money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have course, dry, hair.  I helps smooth my hair and softens it.  This is my second bottle.  I only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Love all their products.  This has changed the texture of my hair into smooth and silky strands.</li>
            <li> Love this on my hair. The light fresh scent lasts all day long. I put this in my hair while it is still damp before I blowdry it. It keeps it from getting frizzy like it would if I didn&#x27;t use the product.  and it isn&#x27;t sticky like many other products.</li>
            <li> After shampooing and conditioning with the silk express line I used the soothing balm. I thought it would help with my frizz. It worked ok but not any better than anything I have used. So I am still looking for that miracle product. Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> Not that great. I usually love all of the products from this brand but this one just didn&#x27;t do what I had expected. I have tried many different hair oils and shine boosters and the best one I&#x27;ve tried by far is Matrix Oil Wonders. Silky, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Great smell, light, but holds and provides lift.  Not too stiff.  Does not take a lot of product and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Love it!</li>
            <li> If you want something that protects your hair from humidity; this is it!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this with a kit and wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work but leaves my hair very glossy without weighing my hair down.  Love it and coming back for more!</li>
            <li> My hair got over processed when I trusted the wrong person to do my highlights and I was terrified my hair was fried.  I went to a friend of mine and she got me a bottle of this.  I have been using it for 6 months and still have about 1/4 of a bottle. My hair has never been healthier, even after being over-bleached then colored over to correct it.  My hair girl is going to get me the whole line when she restocks.  I definitely recommend this product.  Just remember you only need a little bit, my hair goes to the bottom of my bra strap, is fine but thick and I only use one squirt.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a beauty supply in Culver City, California after the store owner raved about what an excellent, great product this was, I also bought the shampoo, S22.99 for this product and $25.99 for the silk shampoo. I tried to return it after using it once. My hair felt drier and less manageable than before I used it and it smelled like it was full of chemiclas. She wouldn&#x27;t allow me to return, said ITS a 10 doesn&#x27;t take returns. I thought the least I could do was warn everyone how awful this product is.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to frizz in damp weather. Silk Express Miracle works so well with this problem.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells really good!</li>
            <li> Works well to keep split ends in line and smells amazing. My husband thinks it is perfume... a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and coarse and I need help getting a brush/comb through it without becoming bald..... My hair stylist used this on my hair the last time I went to her.  I loved the smell, so I decided to purchase some for myself. (Much cheaper on Amazon.com than in her boutique.)  The first time I used it, I put a dime size amount in my hand as directed then applied it to my hair.  Made my hair too...dirty feeling.  I&#x27;ve lessened the amount each time that I&#x27;ve used it, but it still makes my hair feel a little differently...slightly stiff... when drying it and ironing it.  I can tell something is on it and I don&#x27;t like to feel that.  I do love the smell, though.  I&#x27;ve decided to try the leave-in conditioner along with the balm...if I continue to use the balm.  I&#x27;ll have to wait and see how they work together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the name says it all.  My professional used this product on my hair, so I knew I would love it.  My is very fine, and over processed with perms.  This product bring back the shine and tames the fizzies.  Will be buying  it again.  By the way Amazon&#x27;s price is way lower than my professional.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it gets tangled easily. I use this after every shower, before I comb through my hair. It works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Wow my hair does dry faster and it looks like I came from a salon.  I use Sebastian shampoo and a hot tools air brush with this serum.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly! I don&#x27;t go a day without using this product.</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry hair and this product was just okay. It maintained my curl, but left my hair feeling dry. I would not say it left my hair crunchy, but it was slightly firm, nothing like gel.&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is dry, I would layer the macadamia oil leave in cream over its a 10. The two products combined worked great. The It&#x27;s a 10 maintained my curls and the macadamia oil added the moisture I needed.</li>
            <li> I love the matching shampoo and conditioner, so I purchased this product based on the description of what it is supposed to do. Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell the difference and am now adding my older products to complete the job.</li>
            <li> This product was great. Used it twice already. My hair noticeably dried faster with a blow dryer and round brush but also feels smother and silkier and looks healthy and shiny</li>
