            <li>Great for fine eyelashes</li>

            <li>and my eyelashes now look amazing love love</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to easily get it from Amazon now.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I do not know if all shu uemura curler are like this or mine just suck or its not even authentic.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The products from this seller are authentic.</li>
            <li>Love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Still pulls my eyelashes out, but works a lot better than a Revlon or Mabelline curler.</li>
            <li>I got all excited because of the amazon reviews suggesting that the Shu Uemura curler is AMAZING...</li>
            <li>I was happy to get this less happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I&#x27;m happy with the results thus far.</li>
            <li>It actually curls the lashes beautifully and they stay curled.</li>
            <li>I have heard that is one issue with this curler, that no refills for the rubber/foam part is currently available.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the result, however at the end of the day the curl definitely wasn&#x27;t what it was in the beginning.</li>
            <li>That is fantastic news.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tricky the first four or five times you use it but as soon as you get used to fitting your lashes in at the right angle, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and would really recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>It came from Japan, but the seller - Mild Japan got it to me in record time.</li>
            <li>As described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>far I haven&#x27;t had this more than a couple of days</li>
            <li>Price was right and eyelash curler was delivered sooner than anticipated.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it does not pull out lashes like other curlers.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried recently another type of curler and it does a better job.</li>
            <li>It is well made and works very well.</li>
            <li>I have straight eyelashses.  </li>
            <li>Very durable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had that problem with any of the many other curlers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am not sure it is any different than what I may have purchased in store, but reviews were really good for it.</li>
            <li>I usually use my shiseido after going through a lot more cheaper curlers and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use it with very few pinches.</li>
            <li>The only curler that really works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it over anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are short and straight.</li>
            <li>I have an older generic curler that I bought and instead of buying the refills for the foam part, I decided to check out what else was out there.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for it, the curler is way too curved for my eyes and was also too long</li>
            <li>Works well, but doesn&#x27;t live up to the massive hype.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I didn&#x27;t realize it came directly from Japan</li>
            <li>This one manages to get the right shape without missing the tiny lashes near the corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if this is authentic brand, but it curls like my other drug store one.</li>
            <li>I pinched numerous times till my thumb ached and barely got a curl.</li>
            <li>and she hands down suggested this one straight off</li>

            <li> and she hands down suggested this one straight off</li>
            <li> In fact, I held it up the all my other Target purchased eyelash curlers (Revlon, etc) and it is exactly the same shape and the rubber insert is no more fancy or quality than my old ones.  </li>
            <li> The problem with this product is the space that the curler actually opens is about half the distance of the old time metal curlers.  </li>
            <li> I have very long lashes, so it&#x27;s very obvious when they get ripped out.</li>
            <li> so I had a hard time getting a really close curl.  </li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this for a long time but was hesitant.</li>
            <li> While I wish the price were a little better, I still haven&#x27;t found any other curler to give me that fake eyelash look after curling.  </li>
            <li> like I did with my previous generic curler.</li>
            <li> I had used other manufacturer&#x27;s rubber refills in the curler but they tend to split before long.  </li>
            <li> Due to the short curve, I am not able to curl my entire eye lashes and have to use my Revlon curler to get the corners of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I also kept them on for roughly 30 seconds per eye.</li>
            <li> What I expected-</li>
            <li> Solid grip, can&#x27;t go wrong, curls right and firm.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the same as all the eyelash curlers I have purchased at Target over the years that are a lot less expensive.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look longer and the shape stays, unlike the other three I have.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands but nothing works like this one.</li>
            <li> There just aren&#x27;t any other like it.  </li>
            <li> I was doubtful that this would work any better than a random drugstore brand, but it really does!</li>
            <li> Also, the opening was smaller, enough to make it more difficult to get your eyelashes through before clamping down - annoying!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear mascara everyday</li>
            <li> it is hard to clasp on to eyelash and overall not a good product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl the outer corner eye and takes some time to adjust to grab my small lashes.</li>
            <li> choose this specific retailer because it was under Prime as well as the least expensive.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Amazon for carrying this often hard to find item.</li>
            <li> It is hard and not flexible.</li>
            <li> However, this product sucks, it is clunky and the rubber is way too hard that it doesnt do anything to my lashes.</li>
            <li> If your eyelashes are not perfectly straight and even some of them end up on the wrong side of the curler and this leads to a poor result and eventually breakage.</li>
            <li> I have serious doubts about the authenticity.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best eyelash curler ever made. It actually curls the lashes beautifully and they stay curled. More importantly, it does not pull out lashes like other curlers.</li>
            <li> Shu Uemura doesn&#x27;t sell the silicone refills separately from the curler.  I had used other manufacturer&#x27;s rubber refills in the curler but they tend to split before long.  It was time to replace the curler.  The curler that was shipped was what I would call &#x27;travel size.&#x27;  The overall length was shorter than the one I purchased in a department store.  Also, the opening was smaller, enough to make it more difficult to get your eyelashes through before clamping down - annoying!</li>
            <li> very good product as it claims.</li>
            <li> best eyelash curler out there</li>
            <li> Best eye lash curler!</li>
            <li> Eh.  I was happy to get this less happy with the results.  What happened? Everyone raves about this I have long lashes and see barely any difference.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes look longer..</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> This product is always perfect. Have been buying this eyelash curler for years. Nice to be able to easily get it from Amazon now.</li>
            <li> Eyelash curler is not as curved as the Revlon eyelash curler. Due to the short curve, I am not able to curl my entire eye lashes and have to use my Revlon curler to get the corners of my eyelashes.  I prefer the Revlon curler.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful that this would work any better than a random drugstore brand, but it really does! I love it and would really recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Keeps my lashes up all day! Even without mascara.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of this eyelash curler and this is the first one that I am not satisfied with it is hard to clasp on to eyelash and overall not a good product</li>
            <li> The problem with this product is the space that the curler actually opens is about half the distance of the old time metal curlers.  If your eyelashes are not perfectly straight and even some of them end up on the wrong side of the curler and this leads to a poor result and eventually breakage.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve bought tons of masscara thinking that&#x27;s why my eyelashes never stayed up until I discovered this eyelash curler and my eyelashes now look amazing love love love it</li>
            <li> The BEST eyelash curler EVER</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for it, the curler is way too curved for my eyes and was also too long so I had a hard time getting a really close curl.  I&#x27;ve never had that problem with any of the many other curlers I&#x27;ve tried. I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler. My lashes actually stay curled now.</li>
            <li> The only curler that really works</li>
            <li> I heard so much good reviews about this product and was excited to get them for bargain. I usually use my shiseido after going through a lot more cheaper curlers and it works wonders. However, this product sucks, it is clunky and the rubber is way too hard that it doesnt do anything to my lashes. I have serious doubts about the authenticity. I do not know if all shu uemura curler are like this or mine just suck or its not even authentic.</li>
            <li> This is the best curler I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;m able to use it with very few pinches. I&#x27;d recommend it over anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference from the cheaper curlers...regret purchase</li>
            <li> I have great lashes the only problem is that they don&#x27;t curl up. I have an older generic curler that I bought and instead of buying the refills for the foam part, I decided to check out what else was out there. Knowing the trick of adding a bit of heat to my old eyelash curler with a blow dryer, I was curious about the others that would already have that feature built in. I started reading reviews and finally I decided to ask a make-up artist that I had recently worked with and she hands down suggested this one straight off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose this specific retailer because it was under Prime as well as the least expensive. There was another retailer offering the curler plus some additional refills but I decided to opt away from it since the refills weren&#x27;t the same brand. I have heard that is one issue with this curler, that no refills for the rubber/foam part is currently available. It does come with one refill in the box so I&#x27;ll open that door when I come to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far I haven&#x27;t had this more than a couple of days and I will say that I didn&#x27;t get the pinch like I did with my previous generic curler. I also kept them on for roughly 30 seconds per eye. It did an excellent job. I then applied my mascara. I was happy with the result, however at the end of the day the curl definitely wasn&#x27;t what it was in the beginning. I didn&#x27;t use my heat trick so I will give that a go and see how it does and update this review as needed. Otherwise I&#x27;m happy with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this for a long time but was hesitant. I was leery of all the hype. Well, it works! I don&#x27;t like to wear mascara everyday and I don&#x27;t have to if I use this. It makes my lashes look longer and the shape stays, unlike the other three I have. It&#x27;s tricky the first four or five times you use it but as soon as you get used to fitting your lashes in at the right angle, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but I have no idea why everyone praises this eyelash curler as though it is the best thing since sliced bread.  It works exactly the same as all the eyelash curlers I have purchased at Target over the years that are a lot less expensive.  In fact, I held it up the all my other Target purchased eyelash curlers (Revlon, etc) and it is exactly the same shape and the rubber insert is no more fancy or quality than my old ones.  I got all excited because of the amazon reviews suggesting that the Shu Uemura curler is AMAZING...it&#x27;s just the same as all the others with a premium pricetag.</li>
            <li> Best lash curler.  Tried other brands but nothing works like this one.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend asked me to get this for her. She didn&#x27;t complain. That is fantastic news.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is still the #1 curler around.  There just aren&#x27;t any other like it.  I go through an eyelash curler about every 6 months.  While I wish the price were a little better, I still haven&#x27;t found any other curler to give me that fake eyelash look after curling.  This one manages to get the right shape without missing the tiny lashes near the corners of my eyes.  Have been a fan for years, will probably always be a fan.</li>
            <li> The best eyelash curler on the market.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY curler my wife will use.  It is well made and works very well.</li>
            <li> Love it. The products from this seller are authentic.</li>
            <li> What I expected- I am not sure it is any different than what I may have purchased in store, but reviews were really good for it.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler ever!</li>
            <li> Best Eyelash Curler I ever found. My eyelashes are short and straight. Only this one works ! love it !</li>
            <li> Great product! Great transaction! Price was right and eyelash curler was delivered sooner than anticipated. I even got a piece of candy in the box.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order one for my sister and my friend.</li>
            <li> Does the job. In a great way. Solid grip, can&#x27;t go wrong, curls right and firm.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl as well without mascara</li>
            <li> Disappointed. It work the same way my Bobbi brown did.</li>
            <li> Works well, but doesn&#x27;t live up to the massive hype.</li>
            <li> Wonderful eyelash curler. It curls beautifully and holds it&#x27; s curl. It came from Japan, but the seller - Mild Japan got it to me in record time.</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Great for fine eyelashes</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is authentic brand, but it curls like my other drug store one. Doesn&#x27;t curl the outer corner eye and takes some time to adjust to grab my small lashes. I&#x27;ve tried recently another type of curler and it does a better job.</li>
            <li> Still pulls my eyelashes out, but works a lot better than a Revlon or Mabelline curler.</li>
            <li> The very BEST!  There is no comparison.  Thank you, Amazon for carrying this often hard to find item.</li>
            <li> I have straight eyelashses.  I pinched numerous times till my thumb ached and barely got a curl.</li>
            <li> The best eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Best curler I&#x27;ve ever had.  The only thing is I didn&#x27;t realize it came directly from Japan and it took around a month to get here.  I have the straightest eyelashes ever and these do the job.  I threw away all my others.</li>
            <li> These are the best eye lash curlers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Very durable and they do not pinch your eye lashes like others.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work for me. It takes a lot of work to curl my eyelash usong this curler. It is hard and not flexible. Even If I manage to curl my eyelashes, it wont stay longer.</li>
            <li> As described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Only curler I&#x27;ve ever used that hasn&#x27;t pulled out my lashes!!! I have very long lashes, so it&#x27;s very obvious when they get ripped out. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase</li>
