    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I would recommend Tom&#x27;s or Earth&#x27;s Best over BabyGanics.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been really happy with the Babyganics toothpaste (watermelon flavor).</li>
            <li>The container has lasted us quite a while, making this two-pack a great deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s my own preference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m teaching my daughter good habits and that she doesn&#x27;t fight me.  </li>
            <li>then I did of the Toms Flouride free strawberry because of the fact you need a good amount to get bubbles.</li>
            <li>Safe to swallow</li>
            <li>My kids love the taste and can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li>I find I use a LOT more of it</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll be going through it faster and spending more money in the end.</li>
            <li>My kids love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I love babyganics products, but this one didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li>My 3 kids (10, 6, 3yo) initially liked this flavor but after a couple weeks preferred Tom&#x27;s of Maine Strawberry Flouride Free Paste.</li>
            <li>We also like their sunscreen - great on my kids sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it tastes like a very mild non-artificial watermelon.  </li>
            <li>but this is easily remedied by wetting the toothbursh before brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ teeth appear fine</li>
            <li>I like that this toothpaste is organic and flouride free, but it is WAY more sweet tasting than would I prefer to give my child.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I like the fact that it&#x27;s dye &amp; flouride free</li>
            <li>/&gt;We use several Babyganics products and I am proud to add this to the line up.</li>
            <li>The flavor is pretty mild, which is nice for a toddler who is just being introduced to brushing teeth.</li>
            <li>I do not like the smell of this product - it smells chemical and sweet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want her to get a sweet tooth from brushing her teeth.  </li>
            <li>are clean without seeing the bubbles;)</li>
            <li>, which is good since she&#x27;s not ready to spit yet.</li>
            <li>I like that they sell this in 4 oz packages as so many of the fluoride free baby toothpastes seem to only come in 0.5 to 2 oz packages.</li>
            <li>Almost as if you were drinking watermelon juice out of the bowl of a fresh sliced watermelon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste previously at local BRU and my kids liked it</li>
            <li>After using the product she got a burnt spot right under her lip.</li>
            <li>+ 2 year old takes it just fine</li>
            <li>In fact, he is constantly asking for more when he brushes his teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel toothpaste, so it&#x27;s definitely runnier than the paste form most of us are used to.</li>
            <li>It makes him more likely to brush his teeth every day without a struggle.</li>
            <li>The smell if very pleasant, not at all a fake chemical smell of watermelon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He loves it, and pretty much would drink it if I let</li>
            <li>I am willing to pay for a product line that seeks to educate kids about taking care of themselves and the world they live in though.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ easy to apply, stays on brush just long enough&lt;br</li>
            <li>due to my special needs child not able to spit out his toothpaste, this is great for him especially to not get that fluoride in his system</li>
            <li>I was little worried that my kids (1.5 years and 3 years) wouldn&#x27;t like the watermelon flavor, but they love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- doesn&#x27;t seem to foam up like normal toothpaste, perhaps kids ones don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural!</li>
            <li>We did not love the strawberry flavor, but somehow got through the tube--watermelon is much better.  </li>
            <li>him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is dye free, and the consistency is a bit thinner than typical toothpaste but will stay on the tooth brush if not tipped a lot.</li>
            <li>and so far this toothpaste is living up to the brand-standard.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact it&#x27;s natural and no fluoride.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old loves this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s so runny, I occasionally squirt too much onto the toothbrush and have to rinse some of it off.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old son loves the flavor of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Even though she has only 3 teeth so far!</li>
            <li>It is a much larger bottle than the major brands and safer to use.</li>
            <li>The other drawback is that unless I&#x27;m REALLY careful, way too much comes out of the tube at once for what I want on my 17 month old&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>

            <li> My kids like the taste of this toothpaste! I like that it is all natural! I will definitely keep buying!</li>
            <li> I am so sad we purchased this product. We bought others, thank goodness, in our search for flouride-free toothpaste. I do not like the smell of this product - it smells chemical and sweet. My little one does not like the taste. I dislike that it has Stevia as a sweetener and it also contains methyl- something which is a synthetic not organic chemical. After using the product she got a burnt spot right under her lip. It was raw for a number of days. Something in this product is bad news. I would recommend Tom&#x27;s or Earth&#x27;s Best over BabyGanics.</li>
            <li> I will say I continue to adore this brand and so far this toothpaste is living up to the brand-standard.  We did not love the strawberry flavor, but somehow got through the tube--watermelon is much better.  Safe to swallow, which is good since she&#x27;s not ready to spit yet.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it&#x27;s natural and no fluoride. However, I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t make bubbles when brushing. I just don&#x27;t feel like teeth are clean without seeing the bubbles;) So that&#x27;s my own preference. My kids love the taste and can&#x27;t wait to use it. I find I use a LOT more of it then I did of the Toms Flouride free strawberry because of the fact you need a good amount to get bubbles. So I&#x27;ll be going through it faster and spending more money in the end. May have to go back to Toms....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a fan of the BabyGanics lines recently. I was little worried that my kids (1.5 years and 3 years) wouldn&#x27;t like the watermelon flavor, but they love it. I like that they sell this in 4 oz packages as so many of the fluoride free baby toothpastes seem to only come in 0.5 to 2 oz packages. We also like their sunscreen - great on my kids sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about this because of the couple of reviews stating that the baby didn&#x27;t like the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 1-year-old loves this.  And I tasted it ... it tastes like a very mild non-artificial watermelon.  Almost as if you were drinking watermelon juice out of the bowl of a fresh sliced watermelon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your baby likes watermelon, s/he&#x27;ll like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.  I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m teaching my daughter good habits and that she doesn&#x27;t fight me.  Even though she has only 3 teeth so far!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son had bad breath after 2 weeks of using this product  I switch back to regular toothpaste and Thank God it was gone!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste previously at local BRU and my kids liked it so I knew what I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a reaction to this toothpaste. It caused a temporary, almost burned-looking appearance where it touched her skin.</li>
            <li> My kids love this toothpaste.  It is a much larger bottle than the major brands and safer to use.</li>
            <li> She gets really red spots around her mouth...bummer, because it&#x27;s expensive and it&#x27;s non-returnable:-(  To be &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m skeptical because I really like their other products.</li>

            <li> My 2 year old loves this toothpaste. In fact, he is constantly asking for more when he brushes his teeth. It seems to do the job of a training toothpaste.</li>

            <li> I tried some other baby toothpaste that was strawberry banana and my son said...no no!  So we gave this a whirl and he loves it.</li>
