            <li>I love this soap - it is the best soap ever for getting rid of dry skin.  </li>
            <li>All the other aspects of the soap are great, doesn&#x27;t get too soft, perfect amount of scrubbiness, and made in the USA.</li>

            <li>I love the scents, They leave your skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and was surprised when my boyfriend asked me if I had more.</li>
            <li>, the scents were all-natural (I knew what to expect from a soap with all-natural ingredients: the homemade scent with a hint of the separate scents advertised.), and I feel CLEAN after using this soap.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and it has just the right amount of exfoliating scrub and lather.</li>
            <li>The price was great and beat out any other retailer..</li>
            <li>On buying this item I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li>I love my Loofa soap because it exfoliates so easily in the shower and of course it has a terrific  fragrance.</li>
            <li>These soaps are fragrant and quite effective, especially when used in conjunction with the exfoliating scrub gloves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the aloe &amp; kiwi one right now and don&#x27;t like the way it smells at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve , for a long time, liked to wash my face with soap, not use cleansing cream.  </li>
            <li>It does however smell nice and feels good while scrubbing, don&#x27;t think I will be trying it again for it was quite expensive for about 3 weeks of body wash.</li>
            <li>Shipment was very fast.</li>
            <li>Have only used the peach passion but absolutely love it.</li>

            <li>These bars smell pleasant and have just the right amount of loofah...not too harsh but vigorous enough to exfoliate and stimulate your skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so this has been a refreshing change to trim time spent on my morning routine.</li>
            <li>After using one bar of soap for not even a whole week it is almost depleted.</li>
            <li>It is better to travel with instead of a liquid cleanser due to this issue of carrying liquids with this soap</li>
            <li>The soap also is not harshly drying like other soaps; leaves skin clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Most of them are way too harsh the first couple times you use them.</li>
            <li>Ordered these soaps because I usually use a loofah sponge when bathing and thought this would be a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this brand for a number of years now, it is a mild product and green friendly as well..</li>
            <li>(Some clear bars turn to mush too fast - not these.)  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Loofah products since 2000 and have not felt comfortable using any other product to wash my face to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li>The soap is really quite soft and after use it seems to really fall apart the next time you get in for a wash.</li>
            <li>I took a quick sniff of the other 2 scents and don&#x27;t like the way they smell either.</li>
            <li>I have never used a loofah exfoliating soap and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>At the same time they are gentle enough to use on your face with a soft wash cloth.</li>
            <li>This soap is exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li>Although they are clear, they seem to dry well when stored properly.  </li>

It is better to travel with instead of a liquid cleanser due to this issue of carrying liquids with this soap you do not have to worry about all that hassle.[[ASIN:B0009ET74M Earth Therapeutics Loofah Exfoliating Soap Set 3ea]]</li>
            <li> These are wonderful soaps to use daily. The price was great and beat out any other retailer..I have been using this brand for a number of years now, it is a mild product and green friendly as well..</li>
            <li> Love this soap! I used to buy it at Kohl&#x27;s but they don&#x27;t carry it any more. Like having a loofah sponge in each bar!</li>
            <li> I love my Loofa soap because it exfoliates so easily in the shower and of course it has a terrific  fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and was surprised when my boyfriend asked me if I had more. The scent is light and it has just the right amount of exfoliating scrub and lather. Shipment was very fast.</li>
            <li> Very tiny specks of something in it, but not enough to exfoliate at all. Good smells tho. Found it cheaper at Ross.</li>
            <li> This loofah soap leaves your body so clean feeling.........highly recommend!!!  Only wish I could purchase it locally instead of online.</li>
            <li> I love this soap - it is the best soap ever for getting rid of dry skin.  I have been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Have only used the peach passion but absolutely love it. Has just enough exfoliating power to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I love the way it scratches my skin and American made is always great! I&#x27;m a guy who likes to exfoliate with some sort of scrubbing device.</li>
            <li> I picked this set of soap up at my local Ross for $5.99 + tax. It was such a good deal that I neglected to open the package to sniff the scents before I purchased it. I&#x27;m using the aloe &amp; kiwi one right now and don&#x27;t like the way it smells at all. I took a quick sniff of the other 2 scents and don&#x27;t like the way they smell either. They all smell very similar and nothing like advertised. All the other aspects of the soap are great, doesn&#x27;t get too soft, perfect amount of scrubbiness, and made in the USA. It&#x27;s really difficult to find exfoliating bar soap with the right amount of scrubbiness. Most of them are way too harsh the first couple times you use them. So I may repurchase this, but only if I find a great deal on it.</li>
            <li> All 3 of these soaps smell AMAZING! I have never used a loofah exfoliating soap and was pleasantly surprised.  It has done wonders for my skin and I am not all itchy as I have been after using my other brand of soap.</li>
            <li> great product, will order more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for sometime now. earlier always tried the green one. its not too harsh or drying and yet has these lil loofah bits that scrub against skin. this time I got all 3 colors and they have nice fragrances too. would recommend.</li>
            <li> These soaps are fragrant and quite effective, especially when used in conjunction with the exfoliating scrub gloves. At the same time they are gentle enough to use on your face with a soft wash cloth. I am enjoying using them.</li>
            <li> I love the scents, and there is just the right amount of exfoliant granules. I have tried others that are too harsh.  This is a great buy, and the bar seems to be lasting quite awhile.  Love them!</li>
            <li> Ordered based on reviews and LOVE the products!  Smells are great and the exfoliates are awesome!</li>
            <li> Love it good for skin.</li>
            <li> These bars smell pleasant and have just the right amount of loofah...not too harsh but vigorous enough to exfoliate and stimulate your skin.  Although they are clear, they seem to dry well when stored properly.  (Some clear bars turn to mush too fast - not these.)  I&#x27;ve used mine in the shower a few times a day over the past two weeks and they are wearing at the rate of &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; soap.  I was tired of keeping track of loofah and poof and body wash and and and and and...so this has been a refreshing change to trim time spent on my morning routine. They are a tad pricey but not when you consider that you can eliminate these extraneous purchases. The soap also is not harshly drying like other soaps; leaves skin clean and smooth.  I follow it with a smear of pure coconut oil as a moisturizer and voila - happy body!</li>
            <li> This soap is exactly what I expected!  The loofah was concentrated in the perfect amount of exfoliation (I could always go for more, though!), the scents were all-natural (I knew what to expect from a soap with all-natural ingredients: the homemade scent with a hint of the separate scents advertised.), and I feel CLEAN after using this soap.  Wonderful!  I will be buying this again when I get down to the last bar.</li>
            <li> it smells great and it leaves my skin smooth after a shower. and it comes is 3 different types.&lt;br /&gt;i like it. just keep in dry place it get all gooey if you leave in a wet area.</li>
            <li> I use this soap daily.  Love the texture !</li>
            <li> Everything a bar of soap should be</li>
            <li> On buying this item I was pretty excited. After using one bar of soap for not even a whole week it is almost depleted. The soap is really quite soft and after use it seems to really fall apart the next time you get in for a wash. It does however smell nice and feels good while scrubbing, don&#x27;t think I will be trying it again for it was quite expensive for about 3 weeks of body wash.</li>
