            <li>Good seller.  </li>
            <li>Best of the Best - 10pc limited edition mini lacquer collection]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Love OPI!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It makes the nail polish stay on my nails more than ever!</li>
            <li>this product is healthy for the nails.</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and creates a nice surface that preps the nails for whatever polish you&#x27;re applying.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>Love O.P.I basecoat.</li>
            <li>I love OPI.  </li>
            <li>I am really glad I got this color.  </li>
            <li>❤ ❤ Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love both polishes.</li>
            <li>I got it not even 4 days later, that was awesome!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously the OPI pro brush is awesome for most of us, but not so awesome for those of you who have smaller nails and problems with thick brushes.</li>
            <li>My nails become dyed easily.</li>
            <li>it also leaves the nails strong and shiny when used alone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick, but think it gives good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using this stuff my (normally fine) nails have begun to split and crack.  </li>
            <li>From no base coat to using this, I can add 5 days onto my manicure.  </li>
            <li>I used to get gel manicures but that UV light was killing my hands and also my budget.</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant decrease in the staining of my nails</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, dries quickly and is a great first step to use prior to applying polish.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of OPI products, and like to do my own manicure in-between professional manicures.</li>
            <li>It is a tried and true method.</li>
            <li>It makes the time it takes to paint my nails more worthwhile because I know it will last.</li>
            <li>Plus, it dries super quick</li>
            <li>It also got here quickly .</li>
            <li>This basecoat goes on easily and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more of this soon!</li>
            <li>and I feel its worth the money for OPI</li>
            <li>This gives me the most professional looking manicure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I am a professional nail artist and this one is so great item.keep last longer nail polish.</li>
            <li>I wish this was in a quick dry formula, but it&#x27;s amazing as is.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, dries will and provides an excellent base to whatever colored lacquers you choose to top it with.</li>
            <li>I love the OPI brand in general, would recommend.</li>
            <li>Opi polish already lasts long but this was just a nice added bonus.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping also!</li>
            <li>When the brush broke off in the bottle on first use they replaced it as soon as I emailed them a pic.  </li>
            <li>I am willing to believe that the is an aberration since no one else has reported this concern.</li>
            <li>B00421X1WM OPI Nail Lacquer, Italian Love Affair, 0.5-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>Makes my nail polish last a lot longer, nothing more to say about it</li>
            <li>but the actual bottle dries out easily.</li>
            <li>This has a very light pink tint and does not take away from the polish color at all.</li>
            <li>Cannot really use anymore.</li>
            <li>my polish (OPI) stays on much longer..</li>
            <li>It went on easily and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, coats well, dries quickly and is ready for the color coat within a very few minutes.</li>
            <li>Love love love opi&#x27;s base coat.</li>
            <li>and I paint my nails a lot in highly pigmented colors that stain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend OPI.</li>
            <li>As of right now, I only use OPI polishes.</li>
            <li>Quick dry and can protect my nail from those nail color.</li>
            <li>and i found this on here because i got into doing my nails alot more than usual</li>
            <li>not only grow faster but have become much stronger!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not fortunate enough to have strong, pretty nails.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural  base coat out there.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the time to apply and money spent.</li>
            <li>The OPI base cost could be the best there is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OPI has given us a base that is perfect.</li>
            <li>Why, then do I say, this &#x27;could&#x27; be the best base coat?  </li>
            <li>great thin layer of protection between your nails and the polish and doesn&#x27;t cake up underneath other layers.  </li>
            <li>By the time you finish your tenth nail, your firstnmail is already dry and ready to go.</li>
            <li>Have tried many nail products and this base coat protects my nails more than others.  </li>
            <li>So far it has protected my nails from getting yellow because of the nail polish.</li>
            <li>but I choose not to because by then I&#x27;m tired of the color. :)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a great base coat.</li>
            <li>Use base coat, polish, dry and base coat again, Worth the higher price to be confident my nails will stay looking good.</li>
            <li>I Love this base coat sets quick and works well this is why I gave it five stars.</li>
            <li>Then I tried this base coat, and the polish really does stay on better without chipping!</li>

            <li> This is the first base coat I have tried, I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for a long lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> 2-3 extra days from a Sally Hansen base coat, which I consider quite good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use one coat of base, two coats of the color polish, and then apply a fast dying top coat.</li>
            <li> Loved this as a base coat.  </li>
            <li> so i heard this was a good base coat</li>
            <li> This is a good base coat, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be blocking the color layer well from my nail.</li>
            <li> Other brands streak, peels off and do not last long on my nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased the OPI Treatment &amp; Finish Natural Nail Base Coat with the OPI top coat....</li>
            <li> A very good base coat, but it gets too thick about 2/3 of the way down into the bottle, &amp; I can&#x27;t use that last amount.</li>
            <li> Great base coat which has also helped my short, dull nails</li>
            <li> It will help minimize nail stains when you use deep dark colors.</li>
            <li> I tend to wear my manicures for about 4-5 days and during that period I have very limited chipping,</li>
            <li> This Base coat works well, But even when i use the top coat in the same brand, Still chips after a day or two..</li>
            <li> I generally get at least four days before I start to see some peeling at the tips</li>
            <li> When I am doing a light color manicure, I only use one coat of the base coat.</li>
            <li> An item hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have nails long enough to bother painting, but once in a while when I do, I want the polish to stay on for at least a day or two.....</li>
            <li> I love this base coat,</li>
            <li> I am giving the base coat one more chance.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat.  </li>
            <li> Maybe even less.</li>
            <li> so much for a base cost for natural nails.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat, it serves its purpose and my mani usually lasts around 4 days with no chips.</li>
            <li> This base coat makes the polish last so much longer!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this base cost.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat!</li>
            <li> I have found that its usually cheaper to buy OPI through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The OPI Natural Nail Base Coat helped to restore my nails and also helps regular nail polish last a lot longer than when I used Orly base coats.</li>
            <li> This base polish works very well with any polish.  </li>
            <li> They are either too watery or too thick or they don&#x27;t wear well, or they smudge while applying the color polsh.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m using a dark color, especially a red, I use two coats of the base coat to ensure no nails staining.</li>
            <li> The last base coat lasted all of three manicures.</li>
            <li> If you polish your nail often and use deep saturated colors you need to protect your nails with a base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably go back to the base.</li>
            <li> This base coat dries quickly, seems to keep the polish &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; on where it belongs, and doesn&#x27;t have a horrible odor like some do.</li>
            <li> tried this base coat for a few weeks and none of my nail polishes have chipped!</li>
            <li> and I realized it wasn&#x27;t the cold at all.  </li>
            <li> It s impossible to attach the brush to the applicator so that it will stay.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say</li>
            <li> and it makes my nails peel really bad :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I like the way this base goes on.  </li>
            <li> Using a layor is base coat helps a lot to protect your nail and the color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every base coat polish known to man.</li>
            <li> always recommend using a base coat.</li>
            <li> This base coat is just terrible for my nails.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Opi is a go to product. Always. Fast shipping also!</li>
            <li> I love this base coat, it serves its purpose and my mani usually lasts around 4 days with no chips.</li>
            <li> An item hard to find locally.  So happy have these to go with my OPI collection!</li>
            <li> this product is healthy for the nails. it protects them from the dyes in color nail polish. it also leaves the nails strong and shiny when used alone.</li>
            <li> great thin layer of protection between your nails and the polish and doesn&#x27;t cake up underneath other layers.  I have used this for years and one bottle lasts forever.  Great base coat.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat! I have seen a significant decrease in the staining of my nails and I paint my nails a lot in highly pigmented colors that stain. This goes on smoothly and creates a nice surface that preps the nails for whatever polish you&#x27;re applying. This also prolongs your manicure. I tend to wear my manicures for about 4-5 days and during that period I have very limited chipping, if any at all. I could wear my manicures for longer but I choose not to because by then I&#x27;m tired of the color. :)</li>
            <li> I wish this was in a quick dry formula, but it&#x27;s amazing as is.  From no base coat to using this, I can add 5 days onto my manicure.  2-3 extra days from a Sally Hansen base coat, which I consider quite good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the OPI pro brush is awesome for most of us, but not so awesome for those of you who have smaller nails and problems with thick brushes.</li>
            <li> Loved this as a base coat.  Definitely extended the length of time for the nail polish before it finally chipped! Will not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I always buy OPI. Other brands streak, peels off and do not last long on my nails. OPI does not do that. Use base coat, polish, dry and base coat again, Worth the higher price to be confident my nails will stay looking good.</li>
            <li> This base polish works very well with any polish.  It helps protect the nails and keeps the polish from chipping longer.  This has a very light pink tint and does not take away from the polish color at all.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have nails long enough to bother painting, but once in a while when I do, I want the polish to stay on for at least a day or two.....it  wouldn&#x27;t. Then I tried this base coat, and the polish really does stay on better without chipping! I generally get at least four days before I start to see some peeling at the tips and this is way longer than without it. It makes the time it takes to paint my nails more worthwhile because I know it will last.</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and did my nails. I didn&#x27;t time the drying but I do know that it was no longer than 1-3 minutes. Maybe even less. My nails look great with just this base coat on them. I am happy with my purchase and have always liked OPI nail polish. I&#x27;m not fortunate enough to have strong, pretty nails. But I do my best with what I have and I feel its worth the money for OPI because the cheaper polishes I have tried peel and chip either same day or within a couple days. I have found that its usually cheaper to buy OPI through Amazon. As of right now, I only use OPI polishes.</li>
            <li> Great Polish. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This Base coat works well, But even when i use the top coat in the same brand, Still chips after a day or two..</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love OPI!  This is a great Base Coat and it does the job well!  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like the way this base goes on.  It&#x27;s not thick, but think it gives good coverage.  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Got goopy within a couple of months. Cannot really use anymore. I even tried to put some nail polish remover in there to un-goop it, but to no avail. Beware!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for me. I paint my nails once or twice a week and I HAVE to use this. Plus, it dries super quick</li>
            <li> Good seller.  When the brush broke off in the bottle on first use they replaced it as soon as I emailed them a pic.  That said: wish I&#x27;d asked for a refund.  Since I started using this stuff my (normally fine) nails have begun to split and crack.  I thought is was because of the winter but then the weather changed and I realized it wasn&#x27;t the cold at all.  This base coat is just terrible for my nails.  I&#x27;m throwing it out.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for a long lasting manicure. When I am doing a light color manicure, I only use one coat of the base coat. If I&#x27;m using a dark color, especially a red, I use two coats of the base coat to ensure no nails staining. By the time you finish your tenth nail, your firstnmail is already dry and ready to go.</li>
            <li> This product definitely steps up your manny and pedi. Opi polish already lasts long but this was just a nice added bonus.</li>
            <li> Quick dry and can protect my nail from those nail color. I like it and will use it every time.</li>
            <li> You can track your package from the moment it&#x27;s shipped, i received mine in 3 days on standard shipping. Would buy again. Great service</li>
            <li> I love this base coat, my polish (OPI) stays on much longer.. Would never again put on polish without this product!</li>
            <li> Using a layor is base coat helps a lot to protect your nail and the color. This is the first base coat I have tried, I love it.</li>
            <li> I always order from hubbys account and i found this on here because i got into doing my nails alot more than usual so i heard this was a good base coat and it is recommend it to everyone. I use Sally Hansen Top coat best one i have found yet.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of OPI products, and like to do my own manicure in-between professional manicures. The OPI base cost could be the best there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every base coat polish known to man. They are either too watery or too thick or they don&#x27;t wear well, or they smudge while applying the color polsh. OPI has given us a base that is perfect. It is easy to apply, coats well, dries quickly and is ready for the color coat within a very few minutes. I use one coat of base, two coats of the color polish, and then apply a fast dying top coat. This gives me the most professional looking manicure. It is a tried and true method. Why, then do I say, this &#x27;could&#x27; be the best base coat?  The brush applicator has separated from the brush on two separate occasions. It s impossible to attach the brush to the applicator so that it will stay. I am giving the base coat one more chance. The last base coat lasted all of three manicures. I am willing to believe that the is an aberration since no one else has reported this concern. I will report back any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 08-22-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005SAAM2S OPI Best of the Best - 10pc limited edition mini lacquer collection]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00421X1WM OPI Nail Lacquer, Italian Love Affair, 0.5-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I will forever purchase my OPI nail polish online.  Great product, and you cannot beat the price!  This is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; place now!</li>
            <li> Great buy for nails. If you polish your nail often and use deep saturated colors you need to protect your nails with a base coat. It will help minimize nail stains when you use deep dark colors. Try it.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this and used it and I really love it.  My nails feel stronger, the coat (by itself even) hasn&#x27;t chipped off at all.  It went on easily and dried quickly.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great and works well but the actual bottle dries out easily.</li>
            <li> Great product by a wonderful brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago and it def has improved the strenth in my nails! They also dont get stained! Love it!</li>
            <li> Love O.P.I basecoat. So far it has protected my nails from getting yellow because of the nail polish. It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is a good base coat, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be blocking the color layer well from my nail. My nails become dyed easily. I&#x27;ll probably go back to the base.</li>
            <li> tried this base coat for a few weeks and none of my nail polishes have chipped! Definitely will buy more of this soon!</li>
            <li> I used to get gel manicures but that UV light was killing my hands and also my budget. The OPI Natural Nail Base Coat helped to restore my nails and also helps regular nail polish last a lot longer than when I used Orly base coats. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This base coat makes the polish last so much longer!  It is worth the time to apply and money spent.</li>
            <li> Love love love opi&#x27;s base coat. It makes the nail polish stay on my nails more than ever! Which is crucial...</li>
            <li> This base coat dries quickly, seems to keep the polish &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; on where it belongs, and doesn&#x27;t have a horrible odor like some do.</li>
            <li> A very good base coat, but it gets too thick about 2/3 of the way down into the bottle, &amp; I can&#x27;t use that last amount.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it!!  It is a great color.  I love OPI.  I am really glad I got this color.  I highly recommend OPI.</li>
            <li> This basecoat goes on easily and dries fast.  It protects my nails and keeps the Nails from drying out. Recommend .</li>
            <li> This is the best natural  base coat out there.  Wear alone or under your polish and it holds up for days.</li>
            <li> Have tried many nail products and this base coat protects my nails more than others.  It goes on smoothly, dries quickly and is a great first step to use prior to applying polish. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> ❤ ❤ Love this product. Great base coat which has also helped my short, dull nails not only grow faster but have become much stronger! I love the OPI brand in general, would recommend.</li>
            <li> always recommend using a base coat. this one is excellent, as are all OPI products in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever tried!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my nail polish last a lot longer, nothing more to say about it</li>
            <li> I purchased the OPI Treatment &amp; Finish Natural Nail Base Coat with the OPI top coat....I love both polishes. Each dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a professional nail artist and this one is so great item.keep last longer nail polish. best item to buy.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat.  It goes on easily, dries will and provides an excellent base to whatever colored lacquers you choose to top it with.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this base cost. I got it not even 4 days later, that was awesome! However, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and it makes my nails peel really bad :( so much for a base cost for natural nails. I&#x27;m so disappointed with it. I&#x27;ve never had this problem.</li>
            <li> I Love this base coat sets quick and works well this is why I gave it five stars. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a great base coat. It also got here quickly . I have nothing bad to say</li>
