            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>

            <li>Still use lip balm throughout day but even without my lips feel good.</li>
            <li>but it works, good product.</li>
            <li>I used Blistex Medicated during the day, but was looking for a good night treatment.  </li>

            <li>For now, i am delighted.</li>
            <li>I have to be good about remembering to apply it every 12 hours.</li>

            <li>This time I thought that I should invest in a product that many people have raved about and I am so happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>So many lip products that just do not work!</li>
            <li>I have already recommended and purchased it for many of my family members (even men)!</li>

            <li>you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>I heard many good things about this balm and had to try it.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect night time companion to my new day time habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more once this is gone for sure!</li>
            <li>Best for keeping lips soft</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this lip gloss!</li>
            <li>This is a nice lip balm, but after trying 100 different types of lip treatment, the very very best is Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>This product is very smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the best treatment for dry lips, I&#x27;ve yet to find anything better!</li>
            <li>I love this lip therapy.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I try to get more before I run out.  </li>
            <li>So, I am THRILLED that it is now available on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if the product is authentic.</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>I am a lip product junkie--I wanted to love the \\&quot;Kiss Me\\&quot; in a tube</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>This lip balm made my lips so smooth and made them stop peeling!</li>
            <li>glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>i love this.  </li>
            <li>and I love this one and will never be caught without it.</li>
            <li>I havent been able to find it in stores that sell philosophy.</li>
            <li>This is why I LOVE AMAZON -</li>
            <li>Tonight balm and after reading the reviews, decided to give it a try - and ladies, the verdict is that I LOVE IT!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels more like I&#x27;ve put a clay-type of product over them, even though the consistency and feel of it when you apply it is not at all like that.</li>
            <li>I am a chapstick junkie and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s pricey, but it smells and tastes great and is very emollient, lasts longer than most lip balms, and seems to plump up my lips.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>So much better than lip balm sticks.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this product as Purity products are my favorite...</li>
            <li>It also has an awesome scent--a soft sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li>It worked right from the start, I can&#x27;t go anywhere with out it!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, this lip gloss is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li>have used Burts Bees (original) which was my favorite.</li>
            <li>Sends the right message, is useful, and is a good quality product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>And guys, feel free to copy our idea on a girlfriend gift here.</li>
            <li>According to Leaping Bunny they are NOT a cruelty free company -- therefore they test products on animals.  </li>
            <li>It fixes the dry,cracked winter lips overnight and gives you a smooth rosy glow.</li>
            <li>I love philosophy, and they&#x27;re usually worth the $$$, but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li>I used to always get it from Nordstrom, and just found that it&#x27;s no longer available there.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my lips smooth</li>
            <li>Felt so good putting it on and was so pleased with how my lips felt the next morning.</li>
            <li>which I loved and my lips were soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be an overstatement to say that I have tried nearly every lip balm out there - and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite treatment right before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in 2 days (thanks to Prime)!!!</li>
            <li>this glossy gloss makes them even lip pious feels great smooth worth</li>
            <li>This is creamy and rich feeling on the lips</li>
            <li>What on Earth could be in their products that they need to test them first on an animal to see if they are safe for humans???????</li>
            <li>I use many Philosophy products and this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product</li>
            <li>Lip balm (Burts Bee&#x27;s original) was almost an obsession.</li>
            <li>I was excited to received this.</li>
            <li>I know the price is high, but this is the best product I have found for my severely dry lips!</li>
            <li>I have full  lips and</li>
            <li>This is just the right consistency: smooth, not waxy, and stays put.</li>
            <li>Guess I was lucky to get one when I did</li>
            <li>I have tried many things to relieve dry chapped lips and this is certainly not the best product I have tried yet</li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I first saw it and felt it, I thought I was going to have huge problems standing it, but</li>
            <li>A majority of balms are waxy and just sit on top of your lips without doing anything to help them (I would even think they might dry them out more).</li>
            <li>I apply it throughout the day and the difference it&#x27;s made has been nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>it really is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>In fact, I wake up to my lips remaining soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of product that you apply before  bed and is still on your lips the next morning.</li>
            <li>I am quite fussy about lip balm as I find so many of them are quite waxy and really don&#x27;t give me much relief at all, but this one is fantastic - keeps my lips soft and moisturised for ages.  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra buck :)</li>
            <li>I live in the desert Southwest, where is it very arid most of the year, and it&#x27;s always a challenge to keep lips from being dry, chapped, cracked, flaky, despite always using great moisturizing lipsticks and such.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t feel medicated, but it is very very soothing.</li>
            <li>and it gives my lips a nice hint of shiny pink.</li>
            <li>I tried so many over the counter lip balms such as chapstick, burts bees, vaseline, etc.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly if this will work for every lip type</li>
            <li>I love this product, which I used before and the last bottle is still not gone (bought in May) .  </li>
            <li>It does feel like it penetrates (better than just regular petroleum jelly), but doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.</li>
            <li>I had all but given up on finding something that made my lips feel better without having to constantly reapply.</li>
            <li>They are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the brand names, handmade ones from Etsy (with some good success, actually, so let me know if you want recs), and finally decided to search out an intense overnight mixture that was specifically formulated for my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; it&#x27;s still a good idea to get them something little just to show you care!).  </li>
            <li>I pretty much knew that I will need some sort of lip balm for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>super soft lips.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t dry out like most lip balms.</li>
            <li>But It is easy enough off of Amazon..</li>
            <li>I first started using this product after moving to the high desert.</li>
            <li>really makes a huge difference will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It lasts throught he whole night.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find that I need much.  </li>
            <li>(so I would be ready for pop-over visits).</li>
            <li>- really did not like that, and the neosporin lip ?</li>
            <li>I would think twice before spending so much on a lip therapy...</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>It is better than any other lip gloss I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I was so hesitant to buy this due to the price, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Seller was prompt item is great a little goes a long way I use a lip scrub at night</li>
            <li>I use it every night before going to bed, and in the morning my lips are soft and ready for lipstick ;)</li>
            <li>I cannot say that so much of this particular product.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used Carmex/ Chap Stick and the more you use it, the second it comes off, your lips feel terribly dry right away.</li>
            <li>and you will wake-up with new lips!</li>
            <li>I have used tons of products both high end and drug store brands.  </li>
            <li>I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips so soft so fast</li>
            <li>So far, I am very please with just applying during the day.  </li>
            <li>but if you have similar genes as me, it is worth the try.  </li>
            <li>I no longer check my pocket every few minutes to be sure my chap stick is there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leave my lips feeling soft the next morning and super hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night when my lips are most dry and irritated, especially after brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Philosophy lip therapy instantly smooths and calms my lips right away.  </li>
            <li>I have always had dry lips and applied balm daily which made little difference, but now, after using this product, my lips feel great.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different types of lip moisturizers, even body butter and body lotion, but my lips always peeled and bled and were rough.</li>
            <li>I did use it in winter several times a day at first then went to nightly</li>
            <li>Underneath that dry skin was some fresh, new soft skin.  </li>
            <li>So far this hasn&#x27;t proven any results.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to have the rosy lip glow the product described--nothing so far.</li>
            <li>By the next day my lips were so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li>I use this at bedtime each night, and it keeps my lips soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>I went and bought 10 different chapstick/lip balm/lip stuff at the drug store at one point and tried each for several days... only to end up throwing them all out and trying the vaseline/oil/regular moisturizer route (which went better, but didn&#x27;t totally work).</li>
            <li>and I would swear my lips look better than they have in years without having to be gooey, sticky, oily, or otherwise icky.</li>
            <li>This thing makes her lips so soft and tasty.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see her using a lot and her lips are really soft.</li>
            <li>This is a rather soft moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night and my lips stay soft all night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very rich, thick, emollient gel, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, or have any type of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I always have super dry peeling lips and am constantly on the lookout for something to help!  </li>
            <li>so I think it will last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Tried the little blue Blistex thing, at night, but mostly it was a topical analgesic not fixing/curing my chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>it is the VERY most expensive.</li>
            <li>Not only are they soft, they dont dry out as fast even when I am not wearing it!  </li>
            <li>I do really like this product, I have horribly dry lips all throughout the year.  </li>
            <li>I have a real problem with dry lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; for dry lips.</li>
            <li>no other lip treatment truly softened my lips like this does.</li>
            <li>The jar is small and the price seems kind of high for the amount you get, but since you hardly use any, it should last 4-5+ months.</li>
            <li>The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that I wish it was available to buy in stores instead of just online.</li>
            <li>After one use I noticed a major difference, and since purchasing this my lips have been soft and rarely dry.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing, not sticky or tacky, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This little jar really lasts!  </li>
            <li>I just barely dab my pinky finger in it and there is enough to do all of my lips, plus some extra.</li>
            <li>I thought this item was a little pricey, so I expected quick results.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I try to get more before I run out.  </li>
            <li> So, I am THRILLED that it is now available on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if the product is authentic.</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I am a lip product junkie--I wanted to love the \\&quot;Kiss Me\\&quot; in a tube</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> This lip balm made my lips so smooth and made them stop peeling!</li>
            <li> glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> i love this.  </li>
            <li> and I love this one and will never be caught without it.</li>
            <li> I havent been able to find it in stores that sell philosophy.</li>
            <li> This is why I LOVE AMAZON -</li>
            <li> Tonight balm and after reading the reviews, decided to give it a try - and ladies, the verdict is that I LOVE IT!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels more like I&#x27;ve put a clay-type of product over them, even though the consistency and feel of it when you apply it is not at all like that.</li>
            <li> I am a chapstick junkie and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s pricey, but it smells and tastes great and is very emollient, lasts longer than most lip balms, and seems to plump up my lips.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> So much better than lip balm sticks.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product as Purity products are my favorite...</li>
            <li> It also has an awesome scent--a soft sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li> It worked right from the start, I can&#x27;t go anywhere with out it!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, this lip gloss is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> have used Burts Bees (original) which was my favorite.</li>
            <li> Sends the right message, is useful, and is a good quality product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> And guys, feel free to copy our idea on a girlfriend gift here.</li>
            <li> According to Leaping Bunny they are NOT a cruelty free company -- therefore they test products on animals.  </li>
            <li> It fixes the dry,cracked winter lips overnight and gives you a smooth rosy glow.</li>
            <li> I love philosophy, and they&#x27;re usually worth the $$$, but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I used to always get it from Nordstrom, and just found that it&#x27;s no longer available there.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my lips smooth</li>
            <li> Felt so good putting it on and was so pleased with how my lips felt the next morning.</li>
            <li> which I loved and my lips were soft.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would be an overstatement to say that I have tried nearly every lip balm out there - and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite treatment right before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in 2 days (thanks to Prime)!!!</li>
            <li> this glossy gloss makes them even lip pious feels great smooth worth</li>
            <li> This is creamy and rich feeling on the lips</li>
            <li> What on Earth could be in their products that they need to test them first on an animal to see if they are safe for humans???????</li>
            <li> I use many Philosophy products and this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product</li>
            <li> Lip balm (Burts Bee&#x27;s original) was almost an obsession.</li>
            <li> I was excited to received this.</li>
            <li> I know the price is high, but this is the best product I have found for my severely dry lips!</li>
            <li> I have full  lips and</li>
            <li> This is just the right consistency: smooth, not waxy, and stays put.</li>
            <li> Guess I was lucky to get one when I did</li>
            <li> I have tried many things to relieve dry chapped lips and this is certainly not the best product I have tried yet</li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it and felt it, I thought I was going to have huge problems standing it, but</li>
            <li> A majority of balms are waxy and just sit on top of your lips without doing anything to help them (I would even think they might dry them out more).</li>
            <li> I apply it throughout the day and the difference it&#x27;s made has been nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> it really is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> In fact, I wake up to my lips remaining soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of product that you apply before  bed and is still on your lips the next morning.</li>
            <li> I am quite fussy about lip balm as I find so many of them are quite waxy and really don&#x27;t give me much relief at all, but this one is fantastic - keeps my lips soft and moisturised for ages.  </li>
            <li> Worth the extra buck :)</li>
            <li> I live in the desert Southwest, where is it very arid most of the year, and it&#x27;s always a challenge to keep lips from being dry, chapped, cracked, flaky, despite always using great moisturizing lipsticks and such.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel medicated, but it is very very soothing.</li>
            <li> and it gives my lips a nice hint of shiny pink.</li>
            <li> I tried so many over the counter lip balms such as chapstick, burts bees, vaseline, etc.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly if this will work for every lip type</li>
            <li> I love this product, which I used before and the last bottle is still not gone (bought in May) .  </li>
            <li> It does feel like it penetrates (better than just regular petroleum jelly), but doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.</li>
            <li> I had all but given up on finding something that made my lips feel better without having to constantly reapply.</li>
            <li> They are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the brand names, handmade ones from Etsy (with some good success, actually, so let me know if you want recs), and finally decided to search out an intense overnight mixture that was specifically formulated for my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; it&#x27;s still a good idea to get them something little just to show you care!).  </li>
            <li> I pretty much knew that I will need some sort of lip balm for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> super soft lips.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out like most lip balms.</li>
            <li> But It is easy enough off of Amazon..</li>
            <li> I first started using this product after moving to the high desert.</li>
            <li> really makes a huge difference will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It lasts throught he whole night.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find that I need much.  </li>
            <li> (so I would be ready for pop-over visits).</li>
            <li> - really did not like that, and the neosporin lip ?</li>
            <li> I would think twice before spending so much on a lip therapy...</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> It is better than any other lip gloss I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I was so hesitant to buy this due to the price, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Seller was prompt item is great a little goes a long way I use a lip scrub at night</li>
            <li> I use it every night before going to bed, and in the morning my lips are soft and ready for lipstick ;)</li>
            <li> I cannot say that so much of this particular product.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used Carmex/ Chap Stick and the more you use it, the second it comes off, your lips feel terribly dry right away.</li>
            <li> and you will wake-up with new lips!</li>
            <li> I have used tons of products both high end and drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips so soft so fast</li>
            <li> So far, I am very please with just applying during the day.  </li>
            <li> but if you have similar genes as me, it is worth the try.  </li>
            <li> I no longer check my pocket every few minutes to be sure my chap stick is there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Leave my lips feeling soft the next morning and super hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night when my lips are most dry and irritated, especially after brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Philosophy lip therapy instantly smooths and calms my lips right away.  </li>
            <li> I have always had dry lips and applied balm daily which made little difference, but now, after using this product, my lips feel great.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types of lip moisturizers, even body butter and body lotion, but my lips always peeled and bled and were rough.</li>
            <li> I did use it in winter several times a day at first then went to nightly</li>
            <li> Underneath that dry skin was some fresh, new soft skin.  </li>
            <li> So far this hasn&#x27;t proven any results.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to have the rosy lip glow the product described--nothing so far.</li>
            <li> By the next day my lips were so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li> I use this at bedtime each night, and it keeps my lips soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I went and bought 10 different chapstick/lip balm/lip stuff at the drug store at one point and tried each for several days... only to end up throwing them all out and trying the vaseline/oil/regular moisturizer route (which went better, but didn&#x27;t totally work).</li>
            <li> and I would swear my lips look better than they have in years without having to be gooey, sticky, oily, or otherwise icky.</li>
            <li> This thing makes her lips so soft and tasty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see her using a lot and her lips are really soft.</li>
            <li> This is a rather soft moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and my lips stay soft all night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very rich, thick, emollient gel, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, or have any type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I always have super dry peeling lips and am constantly on the lookout for something to help!  </li>
            <li> so I think it will last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Tried the little blue Blistex thing, at night, but mostly it was a topical analgesic not fixing/curing my chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> it is the VERY most expensive.</li>
            <li> Not only are they soft, they dont dry out as fast even when I am not wearing it!  </li>
            <li> I do really like this product, I have horribly dry lips all throughout the year.  </li>
            <li> I have a real problem with dry lips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; for dry lips.</li>
            <li> no other lip treatment truly softened my lips like this does.</li>
            <li> The jar is small and the price seems kind of high for the amount you get, but since you hardly use any, it should last 4-5+ months.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that I wish it was available to buy in stores instead of just online.</li>
            <li> After one use I noticed a major difference, and since purchasing this my lips have been soft and rarely dry.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing, not sticky or tacky, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This little jar really lasts!  </li>
            <li> I just barely dab my pinky finger in it and there is enough to do all of my lips, plus some extra.</li>
            <li> I thought this item was a little pricey, so I expected quick results.  </li>
            <li> And a huge bonus is that although it looks relatively small, a little goes a very long way, so it should last me quite awhile.</li>
            <li> long lasting model me</li>
            <li> this is something I put on at night, its pretty thick but in the morning</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a very long way...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry lips, and after moving to a drier climate my lips were constantly parched.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical when I got this, but with record lows for us for the last two weeks I have STILL been chap free for over a month now.  </li>
            <li> I had somewhat dry lips before that, but now I feel like they need constant attention.</li>
            <li> When your lips are extremely dry, especially in the winter...put some of this on before you go to bed</li>
            <li> Lastly, it&#x27;s a very small pot of product, but my first one lasted me almost a year.</li>
            <li> It stays on your lips a long time.  </li>
            <li> How long does it take to work?</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to stay on as long as I had hoped, so I tend to apply it before bed.</li>
            <li> I always have really dry lips--- and as much as I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> I had used a long lasting lipstick daily for a few months while visiting family</li>
            <li> i no longer feel like I need to constantly reapply like all the other balms etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re struggling with dry, cracked lips, this is your fix.</li>
            <li> I use it at night, when my lips tend to dry out.  </li>
            <li> My lips always seem to be a bit on the dry side and over the years I&#x27;ve tried almost every lip balm out there.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t suffer from &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; lips, they do stay dry all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put it on at night, working my way up in terms of how much I lather on (still have the aversion problem), but this product is completely tolerable and it hasn&#x27;t been difficult at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not the type of lip product that makes your lips feel dry when you are not wearing it either.</li>
            <li> It worked well for my chronic dry lips.</li>
            <li> It is small but I only need a small dab really...</li>
            <li> I have been troubled by dry chapped lips most of my life and this has been a little saviour!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny little jar, but it has lasted quite a long time.</li>
            <li> and like there is less product than there actually is, IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips</li>
            <li> On day -1, my lips were so chapped that the middle part of my bottom lip cracked while I was sleeping and bled a little-</li>
            <li> the price is jacked way up because there are so few left.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes all other lip products obsolete.</li>
            <li> Only concerned is I have not opened the jar yet (to preserve shelf life) and a small concern that it might be rancid (nothing to suggest this either.)</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers said it helped heal their cracked or chapped lips.</li>
            <li> may continue to watch for other therapies since this is a bit pricy and not as &amp;#34;convenient&amp;#34; as lets say, the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend since I was asked to buy some other Philosophy things.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a very long way - just a dab will do</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to find outside of a \\&quot;kit\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Not worth $20.</li>
            <li> I live in very dry Tucson AZ right now and have suffered from horribly chapped lips on and off since moving here.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and within days noticed I was using less lip balm.  </li>
            <li> my lips are a lot less chapped.</li>
            <li> It is kind of pricy, but I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a small little container, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , Neosporin lip therapy in the little tub</li>
            <li> A little bit does go along ways.</li>
            <li> I put it on a few night a week</li>
            <li> and I may not use it again for a few days/weeks.</li>
            <li> In recent years, I&#x27;d finally succumbed to trying different lip remedies, because I just hated how they looked and the never-ending cycle.</li>
            <li> the price comes in a small box</li>
            <li> your lips immediately feel smoother even after it wears away (which takes awhile because it&#x27;s really long lasting), and it doesn&#x27;t have a nasty taste or odor like some of the other treatments I have tried.</li>
            <li> Since recieving the product, I&#x27;ve used faithfully at least once a day.  </li>
            <li> It feels like thick Vaseline.</li>
            <li> But not strong enough to be annoying.</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no change until after about one week, which was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Just as I was feeling disappointed, the dry layer of skin started to slowly peel off of my lips.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes in the winter, lips crack and get dry and it is horribly painful.</li>
            <li> I have really noticed a difference in my horrible lips.  </li>
            <li> I have become addicted the the sensation of putting it on at night.  </li>
            <li> I may have a day where my lips feel terrible, I use it at bedtime, I wake up with new lips</li>
            <li> and while that is not incredibly dehydrating, my lips are drying.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> But, this product can be difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> but sadly it is almost gone!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed my lip peeling as badly since using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate when I run out</li>
            <li> This is a product I hate to be without.</li>
            <li> Get it you want go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> I use underneath my lip gloss as a base and voila!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this lip therapy. I use it under lip gloss. It stays on your lips a long time.  I hate when I run out</li>
            <li> I do really like this product, I have horribly dry lips all throughout the year.  I have used tons of products both high end and drug store brands.  This is creamy and rich feeling on the lips and I love the way it feels.  I have really noticed a difference in my horrible lips.  It is great for nighttime or day because it doesn&#x27;t travel all over my lips to end up all over my face.</li>
            <li> This product has been the answer to my prayers. I use it every night before going to bed, and in the morning my lips are soft and ready for lipstick ;)</li>
            <li> So far this hasn&#x27;t proven any results. It&#x27;s basically just a chapstick in a pot. I was hoping to have the rosy lip glow the product described--nothing so far. How long does it take to work?</li>
            <li> I bought this on behalf of my brother-in-law, who was looking for a good birthday gift for his girlfriend.  (Guys, when a girl says \\&quot;you don&#x27;t *have* to get me anything,\\&quot; it&#x27;s still a good idea to get them something little just to show you care!).  After searching online together, we decided on this.  Sends the right message, is useful, and is a good quality product.  We bought it along with the \\&quot;Falling in Love\\&quot; bath gel.  The girlfriend, I am told, loved it.  Score one for the sister-in-law!  :)  And guys, feel free to copy our idea on a girlfriend gift here.</li>
            <li> The product is OK, but sad I put any money into this companies pockets.  According to Leaping Bunny they are NOT a cruelty free company -- therefore they test products on animals.  What on Earth could be in their products that they need to test them first on an animal to see if they are safe for humans???????</li>
            <li> Best for keeping lips soft and I have tried them all.  Will continue to purchase this item in the future.</li>
            <li> So many lip products that just do not work! Felt so good putting it on and was so pleased with how my lips felt the next morning. Haven&#x27;t noticed my lip peeling as badly since using. Still use lip balm throughout day but even without my lips feel good. It was a sigh of relief because the cost/size was a concern. It is small but I only need a small dab really... so I think it will last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this lip gloss! It is better than any other lip gloss I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my lips so soft so fast and it gives my lips a nice hint of shiny pink. I&#x27;m always going to keep some on hand. The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that I wish it was available to buy in stores instead of just online. Other than that, this lip gloss is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> Just like the one from philosophy. Works great.</li>
            <li> love this smells great and works good I constantly use chapstick during day and this helps at night to condition lips</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it in the AM and in the PM.  By the next day my lips were so much softer and smoother.  Since recieving the product, I&#x27;ve used faithfully at least once a day.  The jar is small and the price seems kind of high for the amount you get, but since you hardly use any, it should last 4-5+ months.</li>
            <li> Well this is a find!  I have been troubled by dry chapped lips most of my life and this has been a little saviour!  I am quite fussy about lip balm as I find so many of them are quite waxy and really don&#x27;t give me much relief at all, but this one is fantastic - keeps my lips soft and moisturised for ages.  When  I put it on at night its still there in the morning. Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Expensive but it works, good product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about three months ago and this product is incredible!! Sometimes in the winter, lips crack and get dry and it is horribly painful. You feel self concious about how chapped they are and NO amount of chapstick fixes it. You try carmex and it just burns, but doesnt seem to fix it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Philosophy&#x27;s Kiss Me Tonight Lip Theraphy...&lt;br /&gt;It makes all other lip products obsolete. It fixes the dry,cracked winter lips overnight and gives you a smooth rosy glow. I use it throughout the day and night. A little goes a long way. It is kind of pricy, but I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed! If you think about the cost of trying all of the inexpensive lip products combined, it would probably be about the same cost. This stuff is miraculous!!! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have a real problem with dry lips.  For years I&#x27;ve needed to wear some sort of crapped lip balm all through out the day.  I received this as a gift and within days noticed I was using less lip balm.  After a while I didn&#x27;t need any during lip balm at all during the day.  However, once I run out of this product it is about a week before I start needing lip balm during the day again.  I try to get more before I run out.  But, this product can be difficult to find.  So, I am THRILLED that it is now available on amazon.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll never have to be without it again.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.  I grew up in the islands and moved to the US 15 years ago and ever since then, I have suffered chapped lips because of the lack of humidity.  I pretty much knew that I will need some sort of lip balm for the rest of my life.  I tried so many over the counter lip balms such as chapstick, burts bees, vaseline, etc.  This time I thought that I should invest in a product that many people have raved about and I am so happy with the results.  It has now been two weeks since I started using the product and my lips have dramatically improved.  On day -1, my lips were so chapped that the middle part of my bottom lip cracked while I was sleeping and bled a little- and this is when I used a lip balm 24/7.  Now, two weeks later, there has been no chapping and some of the tiny lines on my lips caused by the dryness are no longer that noticeable, especially when I wear lipstick!  I am so ecstatic and I hope that my lips keep improving.  I don&#x27;t know exactly if this will work for every lip type but if you have similar genes as me, it is worth the try.  I have already recommended and purchased it for many of my family members (even men)!</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t sealed. The balm is held in a cup inside the jar. That cup comes out of the jar-balm &amp; all. Makes me wonder if the product is authentic. I love Philosophy products. I haven&#x27;t found 1 I don&#x27;t like yet  but this balm doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve had this stuff over a month &amp; used it as directed. My lips haven&#x27;t improved a bit. It feels like thick Vaseline. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my second jar of this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing! I always have really dry lips--- and as much as I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. Kiss Me Tonight saved my lips this winter. I put it on before bed and voila! super soft lips. Bonus: it smells great.</li>
            <li> This product is a must-have!  I don&#x27;t just use it at night, as suggested.  I keep a container on my vanity, in my bag, and on my desk. I apply it throughout the day and the difference it&#x27;s made has been nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> Kind of sticky. Not worth $20. I love philosophy, and they&#x27;re usually worth the $$$, but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> This has done in 3 days what a combo of Aquaphor/Carmex/Vaseline couldn&#x27;t help...it really is worth every penny. If you&#x27;re struggling with dry, cracked lips, this is your fix.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews in the winter because of chapped lips. It works wonderfully and not just for winter. I did use it in winter several times a day at first then went to nightly really makes a huge difference will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This is the BEST night-time lip therapy EVER! I live in the desert Southwest, where is it very arid most of the year, and it&#x27;s always a challenge to keep lips from being dry, chapped, cracked, flaky, despite always using great moisturizing lipsticks and such. I use this at bedtime each night, and it keeps my lips soft and conditioned. I used to always get it from Nordstrom, and just found that it&#x27;s no longer available there. So pleased to find it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips and after I read the reviews decided to give it a try. This is my third jar of it. It worked right from the start, I can&#x27;t go anywhere with out it!!</li>
            <li> This is a product I hate to be without. I seldom need to use anything else during the day because this hydrates my lips so well at night.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This is the best lip therapy there is.  It keeps our lips moist.  I use it at night, when my lips tend to dry out.  It lasts throught he whole night.</li>
            <li> I have this on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; with it set to arrive every six months.  I do not run out before the next order arrives.  This little jar really lasts!  I only use it at night and I don&#x27;t find that I need much.  It leaves my lips hydrated and feeling great in the morning.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so hesitant to buy this due to the price, but I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve always had dry lips, and after moving to a drier climate my lips were constantly parched. After one use I noticed a major difference, and since purchasing this my lips have been soft and rarely dry. I use it nightly before bed.</li>
            <li> I love this product, which I used before and the last bottle is still not gone (bought in May) .  Only concerned is I have not opened the jar yet (to preserve shelf life) and a small concern that it might be rancid (nothing to suggest this either.)</li>
            <li> I live in very dry Tucson AZ right now and have suffered from horribly chapped lips on and off since moving here.  Nothing has worked.  NOTHING. I went and bought 10 different chapstick/lip balm/lip stuff at the drug store at one point and tried each for several days... only to end up throwing them all out and trying the vaseline/oil/regular moisturizer route (which went better, but didn&#x27;t totally work). I was extremely skeptical when I got this, but with record lows for us for the last two weeks I have STILL been chap free for over a month now.  This stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s my go to in the morning, when I get home from work, and before bed and I would swear my lips look better than they have in years without having to be gooey, sticky, oily, or otherwise icky.</li>
            <li> I am a lip product junkie--I wanted to love the \\&quot;Kiss Me\\&quot; in a tube but it was to emollient and slippery. This is just the right consistency: smooth, not waxy, and stays put. I use it all day. It also has an awesome scent--a soft sweet vanilla. But not strong enough to be annoying. LOVE THIS. Keep one at work, one by my bed, and one in my puse. Wish it came it a bigger size.</li>
            <li> This lip balm made my lips so smooth and made them stop peeling! I&#x27;m very happy about this purchase! I know the price is high, but this is the best product I have found for my severely dry lips!</li>
            <li> I first started using this product after moving to the high desert. A little goes a long way. I use underneath my lip gloss as a base and voila! long lasting model me</li>
            <li> this is something I put on at night, its pretty thick but in the morning my lips are a lot less chapped. I know use it a couple of times a week, glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I always have super dry peeling lips and am constantly on the lookout for something to help!  This product (though it didn&#x27;t cure it 100%) is one of the products I&#x27;ve found that helps a ton.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I used Blistex Medicated during the day, but was looking for a good night treatment.  Tried the little blue Blistex thing, at night, but mostly it was a topical analgesic not fixing/curing my chapped lips.  I love it.  When I am in front of the computer, not doing a lot of talking or drinking,  I put it on for a couple of hours, otherwise I put it on at night.  I recently started to wear Bobbi Brown Lip spf 12 and while that is not incredibly dehydrating, my lips are drying.  This is a perfect night time companion to my new day time habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 8/20/2013&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this three times consecutively.  It&#x27;s my favorite treatment right before I go to bed.  Leave my lips feeling soft the next morning and super hydrated.  I have become addicted the the sensation of putting it on at night.  I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is very good lip balm.  I gave it three stars because of the price.  I heard many good things about this balm and had to try it.  I do like it, but I will never pay that price for balm again.  Burt&#x27;s Bees and Carmex work just as well, but at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to last and protect my lips as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this lip product.  I use it at night when my lips are most dry and irritated, especially after brushing my teeth.  Philosophy lip therapy instantly smooths and calms my lips right away.  And it doesn&#x27;t dry out like most lip balms. In fact, I wake up to my lips remaining soft and smooth!  I hope Amazon keeps this on their website because it&#x27;s the best!  And I love the shipping! It arrived in 2 days (thanks to Prime)!!!</li>
            <li> i love this.  one use of this, kept my lips hydrated for hours.  a great product. im ordering again</li>
            <li> My lips always seem to be a bit on the dry side and over the years I&#x27;ve tried almost every lip balm out there. I use many Philosophy products and this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product and I love this one and will never be caught without it. Super moisturizing, not sticky or tacky, and a little goes a long way. Love it!</li>
            <li> I adore this stuff. I tried Burts Bees, Sally Hansen, no other lip treatment truly softened my lips like this does. I use it at night, during the day, whenever! Really, really good product...</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers said it helped heal their cracked or chapped lips. While I don&#x27;t suffer from &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; lips, they do stay dry all the time. I had used a long lasting lipstick daily for a few months while visiting family (so I would be ready for pop-over visits). I had somewhat dry lips before that, but now I feel like they need constant attention. Lip balm (Burts Bee&#x27;s original) was almost an obsession. I never ever left the house without it - not even to visit with the neighbors. This lip therapy..Kiss me Tonight.. has healed me of my obsession. I no longer check my pocket every few minutes to be sure my chap stick is there.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that this product is a miracle, but I think it comes close. I can definitely tell the difference in the way it feels compared to a chapstick like burts bees. It does feel like it penetrates (better than just regular petroleum jelly), but doesn&#x27;t sting or burn. it doesn&#x27;t feel medicated, but it is very very soothing. and a little goes a very long way - just a dab will do ya.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Burts Bees (original) which was my favorite. Burts bees replenishing pomegranite was not that great, Neosporin lip therapy in the little tub - really did not like that, and the neosporin lip ?therapy? in the white tube with spf, and didn&#x27;t care for that either. I had all but given up on finding something that made my lips feel better without having to constantly reapply. Kiss me tonight - makes me feel like it is healing my lips a bit..i no longer feel like I need to constantly reapply like all the other balms etc.&lt;br /&gt;I may continue to watch for other therapies since this is a bit pricy and not as &amp;#34;convenient&amp;#34; as lets say, the grocery store. But It is easy enough off of Amazon..I think it is going to last..and it is the best I have tried. For now, i am delighted.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I put it on a few night a week and it keeps my lips smooth and I don&#x27;t feel like I constantly need to be putting Chapstick on!</li>
            <li> I am one happy girl.  This stuff is hard to find outside of a \\&quot;kit\\&quot;.  I havent been able to find it in stores that sell philosophy. This is why I LOVE AMAZON - I get what I want, when I want it at a great price!  This lip stuff has got to be the best I have ever tried.  I used to wear vaseline on my lips at night....which I loved and my lips were soft.  But not like this.  Not only are they soft, they dont dry out as fast even when I am not wearing it!  Like all Philosophy products.  A tiny bit goes a very long way...you need the tinest dab for hours and hours of softness!!  I will purchase again....definately.</li>
            <li> I was excited to received this. I tend to get chapped lips alot. This product is very smooth. And it feel like velvet going on. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> [*NOTE* Price should be $17-20, NOT $86+!! Checkout the Philosophy website until this price goes back to normal]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had cracked and chapped lips, and it has been a chicken-and-egg type situation. I pick my lips ... which would make them chapped and cracked ... which would make me pick them ... and you get the picture - on and on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have also always had an aversion to anything greasy or oily, whether it be on my skin or my lips. In recent years, I&#x27;d finally succumbed to trying different lip remedies, because I just hated how they looked and the never-ending cycle. I&#x27;ve bought the brand names, handmade ones from Etsy (with some good success, actually, so let me know if you want recs), and finally decided to search out an intense overnight mixture that was specifically formulated for my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across the Kiss Me Tonight balm and after reading the reviews, decided to give it a try - and ladies, the verdict is that I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for THREE nights and already I can see and feel the difference. I&#x27;ve put it on at night, working my way up in terms of how much I lather on (still have the aversion problem), but this product is completely tolerable and it hasn&#x27;t been difficult at all. It feels more like I&#x27;ve put a clay-type of product over them, even though the consistency and feel of it when you apply it is not at all like that. When I first saw it and felt it, I thought I was going to have huge problems standing it, but not at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, definitely recommend it. And a huge bonus is that although it looks relatively small, a little goes a very long way, so it should last me quite awhile. (Also, the image pictured here actually makes it look smaller and like there is less product than there actually is, IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use this every night and recommend it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no change until after about one week, which was disappointing.  I thought this item was a little pricey, so I expected quick results.  Just as I was feeling disappointed, the dry layer of skin started to slowly peel off of my lips.  Gross, I know!  Underneath that dry skin was some fresh, new soft skin.  Hallelujah! I have always had dry lips and applied balm daily which made little difference, but now, after using this product, my lips feel great.  I carry this in my purse and apply maybe 5 or 6 times a week.  I&#x27;d apply it every day if I could actually remember.  I am thinking of buying another one and leaving it on my nightstand to apply before I go to bed because I can never remember to get it from my purse and apply at night.  So far, I am very please with just applying during the day.  It has worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend since I was asked to buy some other Philosophy things. This thing makes her lips so soft and tasty. It&#x27;s pretty amazing. It&#x27;s a tiny little jar, but it has lasted quite a long time. I don&#x27;t see her using a lot and her lips are really soft. I&#x27;ll buy more once this is gone for sure!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product as Purity products are my favorite...I cannot say that so much of this particular product. I have tried many things to relieve dry chapped lips and this is certainly not the best product I have tried yet it is the VERY most expensive. I would think twice before spending so much on a lip therapy...</li>
            <li> This is a rather soft moisturizer. A little bit does go along ways. It didn&#x27;t seem to stay on as long as I had hoped, so I tend to apply it before bed. I haven&#x27;t had chapped lips and can not comments on how well it does with soothing and/or repairing the lip tissue in that condition. I do like that this has no flavor as some lip alms do. It seem over priced for the amount of product that you actually receive.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lip balm, but after trying 100 different types of lip treatment, the very very best is Aquaphor. This is a good alternative though four your purse!</li>
            <li> I am a chapstick junkie and this is my favorite.  Yeah, it&#x27;s pricey, but it smells and tastes great and is very emollient, lasts longer than most lip balms, and seems to plump up my lips.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I put it on every night before I sleep.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ENTIRELY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOOK 2 NIGHTS FOR MY LIPS TO BECOME PERFECT FROM CHAPPED MESSES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY SUGGESTED PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I PUT IT ON BEFORE I GO TO BED EVERYNIGHT!! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment for dry lips, I&#x27;ve yet to find anything better! When your lips are extremely dry, especially in the winter...put some of this on before you go to bed and you will wake-up with new lips! It&#x27;s a very rich, thick, emollient gel, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, or have any type of fragrance. It&#x27;s also not the type of lip product that makes your lips feel dry when you are not wearing it either. I guess, I am trying to say, I&#x27;ve used Carmex/ Chap Stick and the more you use it, the second it comes off, your lips feel terribly dry right away. This product is not like that at all! I may have a day where my lips feel terrible, I use it at bedtime, I wake up with new lips and I may not use it again for a few days/weeks. It&#x27;s really a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; for dry lips. Lastly, it&#x27;s a very small pot of product, but my first one lasted me almost a year. Just try it...you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Seller was prompt item is great a little goes a long way I use a lip scrub at night then I put this product on my lips I have full  lips and this glossy gloss makes them even lip pious feels great smooth worth the price comes in a small box but it doesn&#x27;t take much and I also use it during the day!.. Get it you want go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would be an overstatement to say that I have tried nearly every lip balm out there - and this is by far the best. A majority of balms are waxy and just sit on top of your lips without doing anything to help them (I would even think they might dry them out more). You can tell this one is working immediately...your lips immediately feel smoother even after it wears away (which takes awhile because it&#x27;s really long lasting), and it doesn&#x27;t have a nasty taste or odor like some of the other treatments I have tried. I wish I could have one of these everywhere (office, car, bathroom, etc) but every time I try to order it, it seems to either be out of stock or the price is jacked way up because there are so few left. Guess I was lucky to get one when I did but sadly it is almost gone!</li>
            <li> It worked well for my chronic dry lips. I have to be good about remembering to apply it every 12 hours. I use it sparingly though because it is pricey.</li>
            <li> Has done wonders for my lips. I have tried so many different types of lip moisturizers, even body butter and body lotion, but my lips always peeled and bled and were rough. I have been using this product for about a week and my lips no longer peel. They are soft and smooth. Yes, it is a small little container, but a little goes a long way. I just barely dab my pinky finger in it and there is enough to do all of my lips, plus some extra. I feel like I have found a miracle product! Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is great. So much better than lip balm sticks. I put it on at night and my lips stay soft all night. You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of product that you apply before  bed and is still on your lips the next morning. Worth the extra buck :)</li>
