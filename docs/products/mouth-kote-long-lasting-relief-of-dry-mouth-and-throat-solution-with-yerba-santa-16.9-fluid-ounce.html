    <ol>
            <li>This is the best one I have found.  </li>
            <li>Recommended to me by my excellent dentist &amp;</li>
            <li>I mix it with Biotene for best results</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Plus, It has a pleasant lemon taste.</li>
            <li>It tastes good and feels good in my mouth.</li>
            <li>No nasty &amp;#34;Morning Breath&amp;#34; for me.  </li>
            <li>Mouth Kote  works better than anything that I tried.</li>
            <li>, I spray 7 times in my mouth &amp; gently swish the delicious Mouth Kote for 2-3 minutes then slowly swallow ( this is the way &#x27;I&#x27; do it, this works for &#x27;me&#x27;) &amp; wake up with a very good feeling &amp; Tasting mouth!  </li>
            <li>He said the taste of this is pleasant, but he might have to use it a bit more frequently than the Biotene, but it does do the job.</li>
            <li>I will enjoy what I have left, as it&#x27;s interesting and tastes good, and I&#x27;m still hoping it will moisten my mouth.</li>
            <li>The absolute best dry mouth treatment I have used.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for dry mouth caused by medications.</li>
            <li>I saw the larger bottle and thought that&#x27;s a good idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mouth Kote may be at present the best solution to dry mouth symptoms.  </li>
            <li>Most economical to buy if you use it regularly to ease the mouth dryness caused by oxygen use at night</li>
            <li>This is the first time it bought the large bottle.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how many stars it deserves because, while it tastes better than others, it really doesn&#x27;t live up to its promise of &amp;#34;long-lasting relief&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Biotene dry mouth spray makes me gag - I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Ordered the large refill bottle and it does not have any lemon-lime taste to it at all.</li>
            <li>it really is a quality if life factor.</li>
            <li>The mouth kore spray works really, really, well.</li>
            <li>I wish that it&#x27;s effects lasted longer, but it is a real relief, while it lasts.</li>
            <li>and I sip water very frequently.</li>
            <li>I will go back to ordering the large spray bottle instead.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about Yerba Santa, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be what I need, personally.</li>
            <li>have Mouth Kote next to me on my night stand and when I wake up during the night, I just spray it into my mouth, swish it around, swallow, and go right back to sleep.  </li>
            <li>My voice is back to normal.</li>

            <li> I was having voice troubles from dry mouth.....</li>
            <li> which causes very dry mouth</li>
            <li> Due to radiation I suffer from Dry Mouth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the effect does not last much longer than a sip of water.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry mouth because my salivary glands were killed by a radiation treatment I had to my neck for throat cancer.  </li>
            <li> We had been using Biotene previously, but it was recalled due to inaccurate content information.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

            <li> I have extremely dry mouth because my salivary glands were killed by a radiation treatment I had to my neck for throat cancer.  I it extremely dry and I sip water very frequently. I have tried several brands of liquids that are supposed to help this condition.  This is the best one I have found.  It tastes good and feels good in my mouth. Unfortunately the effect does not last much longer than a sip of water.  I am not sure how many stars it deserves because, while it tastes better than others, it really doesn&#x27;t live up to its promise of &amp;#34;long-lasting relief&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by my excellent dentist &amp; I&#x27;m grateful he did!  I&#x27;ve had to take numerous meds. which causes very dry mouth - I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; wake up on the morning with cheeks stuck to to your teeth!  That hasn&#x27;t happened when I Brush my teeth at night, I spray 7 times in my mouth &amp; gently swish the delicious Mouth Kote for 2-3 minutes then slowly swallow ( this is the way &#x27;I&#x27; do it, this works for &#x27;me&#x27;) &amp; wake up with a very good feeling &amp; Tasting mouth!  No nasty &amp;#34;Morning Breath&amp;#34; for me.  :â€¢)&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is my experience not a recomendation</li>
            <li> This was recommended by another COPD patient, my husband uses it daily and it reduces the dryness from oxygen therapy.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes bad and doesn&#x27;t work near as well as Oasis in keeping a mouth moist. I think they forgot to test it before putting it on the market.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry mouth caused by medications. Use it all the time.  I can heartily recommend this product for anyone!</li>
            <li> Most economical to buy if you use it regularly to ease the mouth dryness caused by oxygen use at night</li>
            <li> This is the first time it bought the large bottle. I have always bought the 8oz size. I saw the larger bottle and thought that&#x27;s a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying Mouth Kote for years and the taste has always been the same. This bottle the taste is way off and every time I use it, I think should I be still using it. Unfortunately at this time I can&#x27;t afford to replace it. I will only be buying the 8oz from now on.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my doctor. It works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> I take a medication that causes constant and severe dry mouth.  I have tried a number of products to help alleviate the problem:  Biotene mouth wash, Therabreath lozengers, Biotene gum...which do help, but are inconvenient to use during the night..I would have to get up and go to the bathroom to use the mouth wash, I&#x27;ve fallen asleep while using the lozenger and gum and wake up with it in my hair or on my pillow!!&lt;br /&gt;I have Mouth Kote next to me on my night stand and when I wake up during the night, I just spray it into my mouth, swish it around, swallow, and go right back to sleep.  Plus, It has a pleasant lemon taste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have such a  dry mouth it really is a quality if life factor. The mouth kore spray works really, really, well. I have tried everything they make. The Biotine products and more.i found out the products</li>
            <li> Biotene dry mouth spray makes me gag - I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Ordered the large refill bottle and it does not have any lemon-lime taste to it at all. I will go back to ordering the large spray bottle instead.</li>
            <li> The absolute best dry mouth treatment I have used. I threw away my biotene after using this a couple of nights. I like the semi lemon taste. Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive . Don&#x27;t waste your money on any of the others!</li>
            <li> My husband lost his salivary glands following the radiation for throat cancer.  He constantly has to spray his mouth for moisture and we tried this product.  We had been using Biotene previously, but it was recalled due to inaccurate content information.  He said the taste of this is pleasant, but he might have to use it a bit more frequently than the Biotene, but it does do the job.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy this again. I will enjoy what I have left, as it&#x27;s interesting and tastes good, and I&#x27;m still hoping it will moisten my mouth. It contains saccharin, the artificial sweetener that was found to be carcinogenic, so that&#x27;s a downside for me. You can swallow it, so it&#x27;s convenient to use when sink not available. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get cancer from one bottle. I can&#x27;t taste the horrible flavor of the saccharin, and I don&#x27;t even know why the company uses it in this product, as the Xylitol and Sorbitol in it sweeten it enough. I don&#x27;t know much about Yerba Santa, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be what I need, personally. It might work for someone else, though.</li>
            <li> I mix it with Biotene for best results</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t sweetened with an artificial sweetener. I was having voice troubles from dry mouth..... My voice is back to normal. The product works. Just spray a few times every couple hours. Works great!</li>
            <li> Mouth Kote may be at present the best solution to dry mouth symptoms.  I wish that it&#x27;s effects lasted longer, but it is a real relief, while it lasts.</li>
            <li> Due to radiation I suffer from Dry Mouth. Mouth Kote  works better than anything that I tried.</li>
