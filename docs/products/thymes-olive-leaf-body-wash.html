            <li> Love it!  Just wish we could buy it in the UK.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent. I received a sample when I ordered through Thymes, otherwise I probably would not have tried the body wash. I am not a fan of olives and could not imagine this would be a flattering scent. Boy was I wrong. Light fresh fragrance with a definite feminine appeal.&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shower gel, leaves your skin feeling soft with a hint of fragrance.  As others have stated the fragrance is perfect for women and men alike.  Will continue to use this product thank you for the helpful reviews.</li>
            <li> When I use this people actually comment and ask me what it is.&lt;br /&gt;It is a fairly strong smell, but I think it&#x27;s clean.  It&#x27;s not olive-y at all.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome without being overpowering. This is one of my favorite little shower luxuries!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and body wash. It smells so clean and refreshing! I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Nice scent and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin!</li>
            <li> Body wash smell different than the lotion. Smells more like something a man would wear. Love the lotion but may pass on teh wash next time.</li>
            <li> It does the job very well with a clean fragrance and a wonderful lather.  I have tried over the counter body washes and have been dissatisfied.  I am so glad I am able to purchase this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> but wish the fragrance was a bit longer lasting. Still a nice smelling body wash in my favorite fragrance. Perfect for daytime!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance helps eliminate the tips of fingers cracking</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a family member who requested the particular scent.  When I receive the packed, I was a little surprised to see that it wasn&#x27;t in a box, but only had plastic (like the kind around the top of medicine bottles) around the bottle. I put it in a box and wrapped it as normal, but thought is was off that it didn&#x27;t come in a box of its own.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  Wish it came in bigger bottles!</li>
            <li> I love the silkiness in the rich, creamy lather. Smells so fresh and clean too.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels moisturized and smooth, not dry and scaly. Great product. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> i adore olive leaf scent and thymes has some great fragrances THIS is my persaonl favorite. the body wash is very nice, not all lotiony like some ive used more like liquid soap that smells great and thats what i use it for. i have lotion for the silky part (after the shower!)</li>

            <li> I love Thymes products and particularly the Olive Leaf scents.  It is a nice clean smell that stays with you on your skin for a while!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing scent! Love it! I think I need to buy the body lotion to make the scent last longer. But I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have it my shower &amp; in my guest bathroom too.  The botanical scent is appropriate for both men &amp; women.  It has a long lasting, very pleasant scent.  I first started using it after finding it at a local, high end gift shop.  The price was so much better on Amazon.  You might also want to buy the body lotion in this scent!</li>
