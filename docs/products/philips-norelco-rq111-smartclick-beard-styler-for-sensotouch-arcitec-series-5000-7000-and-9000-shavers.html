            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Good addition to Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li>For the money it&#x27;s a good.</li>
            <li>Wish it were made of a more pliable form of plastic - great pick up regardless</li>
            <li>More than exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>nice addition to the razor,  got it for a good price, if it was any more, i would not have bought it.</li>
            <li>it get&#x27;s nice and close</li>
            <li>When I use it with the guard for trimming it gives me a nice even trim in way</li>
            <li>Nice addition to the shaver</li>
            <li>Nice attachment.</li>
            <li>This a nice compact way to carry a trimmer when traveling.  </li>
            <li>The Styler works great - keeps my mustache and goatee trimmed perfectly, and the thing is almost silent when you use it</li>
            <li>really nice attachment for the razor</li>
            <li>This click on styler is really easy to use and makes your mustache and beard even whiskers really good shape.</li>
            <li>works great for quick trims</li>
            <li>Item performs excellently and completely meets my all expectations.</li>
            <li>however if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair or just want to use if for upkeep its a good fit.</li>
            <li>By far one of the best purchases I have made in 2014!</li>
            <li>Worked great a first</li>
            <li>Great product, but be aware of the limitations.</li>
            <li>This clipper is well made and gives very accurate control of beard length.</li>
            <li>I quickly received my beard trimmer, and it met all expectations: ease of use, good quality, etc.</li>
            <li>Very good razor on a one day old growth..</li>
            <li>They should have made it better.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my very short beard.</li>
            <li>I can adjust the closeness for a better groom and not just a shave, and the blades are rounded now (instead of jagged edges)</li>
            <li>Much more ergonomic than the flip-out stylers.</li>
            <li>so it allows me to finish quicker and not have to worry about lining up as many strokes on my neck</li>
            <li>it replaced norelco maverick and works much better.</li>
            <li>So overall, great product, and for the quality, the price is fair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Click-on styler for my Norelco Sensotouch 3D for more than a month now.</li>
            <li>More than that, it came off the shavers body during the operation while motor was working.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>It has five adjustable settings that I think should satisfy most beard trimming needs.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I wish it was more than that.</li>
            <li>i cannot describe more cause it is him who is using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just gotta learn to aim that thing better.</li>
            <li>it was a nice hi quality replacement, for the cheap one that came with my razor originally.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps a separate guard would be better.</li>
            <li>I ordered this head because it looked more sturdy and nicer,and it is.</li>
            <li>Glad I decided to get this attachment.</li>
            <li>it was a really worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>Works better than the built in trimmer.</li>
            <li>(OK, it is the blade without a guard, but it sounds cooler to say secret).&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does a better job than a specialized shaver.</li>
            <li>awesome add-on component - my only concern after a month is that the plastic guard they provide is like to break, I am still using the cheaper edge tool because I am avoiding taking off and placing on that flimsy plastic depth guard.  </li>
            <li>love this attachment, eliminated the need for me to have another clipper, like the setting it has, can be used on many things.</li>
            <li>I have the 9700 series shaver and this works better than my Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It slides closer-further from the blades to adjust beard length and you have to slide it off for a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>great quality, working fine, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>cuts greats, love how it adjusts, and this one can easily be cleaned out, this also feels alot better quality than what came with the buzzer</li>
            <li>love the guard and easy use.  </li>
            <li>It attaches and detaches from the razor very easily and is easy to clean by running under the tap, as is the razor itself.</li>
            <li>I use it this morning to trim my beard, really cool gadget, easy to clean, doesnt make much noise which very good on those hangover days</li>
            <li>This works okay, just a bit &#x27;cheap&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Had a friend tell me yesterday that my goatee really looked good.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed by the built in trimmer in my Norelco 1255XTR Sensitivity 3D, but the Beard Styled takes it to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li>It attaches easily and cleanup is a breeze.</li>
            <li>Snaps on easily.</li>
            <li>The comb size is easily adjusted.</li>
            <li>but it is SO easy to use I don&#x27;t need to travel with my Wahl (and separate charger)</li>
            <li>a Norelco SensoTouch 3D. Installation is easy, Just pull the shaver from the SensoTouch and push in the beard styler until it clicks.</li>
            <li>Easy to attach to my razor and easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>Easy to switch in and out between the shaver and styler as well</li>
            <li>It packs easily, thus it is pefect for traveling</li>
            <li>Bought this to attach to the 2D works as said does a close shave and makes desired length easy to do</li>
            <li>but I super glued it and it has been working fine for a couple years!</li>
            <li>Also the different levels of trim is excellent - I can clean up my sideburns efficiently and quickly.</li>
            <li>On both occasions, after having Amazon ship a replacement it works fine.</li>
            <li>Better than what originally came with my razor (the original broke, so I ordered this one.)</li>
            <li>Works fine...</li>
            <li>I use it with no attachment for a quick trim and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>the shaver battery much more quickly than the three-headed shaver attachment.</li>
            <li>it is easy and convenient to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This little device is the perfect accessory for my Norelco razor.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to adjust and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my beard, but that&#x27;s because I keep it very short.</li>
            <li>This attachment does not feel that you can comfortably used on the face or else where.</li>
            <li>I had been using a cheap pen trimmer to keep the beard in check until I got</li>
            <li>Great product for traveling and only having to carry one device</li>
            <li>Super easy to change out the head.</li>
            <li>blade makes trimming a quick and easy task!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trims hair very well, and very easy to switch out for the shaver attachment.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a new head for my razor &amp; Amazon had the best deal.</li>
            <li>I lost the one my razor originally came with.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first, but as my skin adjusted and I got used to the razor, I love it..</li>
            <li>This is the unit that my razor should have had in the original box.</li>
            <li>Works great as long as I aim it well.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was what I wanted</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a pleasant surprise from Phillips, given it usually makes good stuff but rarely misses an opportunity to overcharge.</li>
            <li>Turns out, I was right!</li>
            <li>Works Great and as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Norelco products for several years now and find them to be good quality.</li>
            <li>This accessory is perfect, just saves you from having to buy many other products that serve the same purpose.</li>
            <li>This easily attached to the razor, and looks pretty.  </li>
            <li>Swapping heads is so quick and easy-less time than swapping power cords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they get it to you quick.</li>
            <li>This thing works so quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased and highly recommend this trimmer head to anyone with a compatible Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After perhaps 6 months of regular use, I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Just recently got this and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to add to a new razor I bought and it works better than a beard trimmer I have.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, cleans up fast.</li>
            <li>The attachment is easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li>exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>Bought this item for my new razor, I was surprised at how good it works.</li>
            <li>A great little accessory for the Norelco razor.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would replace my old trimmer...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to only have one unit on my counter now.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what made me fall in love with my old trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was worth a shot, and the thought of eliminating one widget and leveraging the shaver was appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good decision.</li>
            <li>the fact that it uses the shaver means it&#x27;s driven by a powerful battery that charges rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer, did away with a second device and charger.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.;</li>
            <li>Nice accessory to go with the Norelco Shaver he bought at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I found this at a fraction of the cost and well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Excellent for trimming everything nice and neatly to bad it wasn&#x27;t included when I first purchased my razor...</li>
            <li>The motor in it is much stronger than the original trimmer and its a lot quicker to cut off the hair.</li>
            <li>With the styler I can trim it to a fine stubble and then remove with the normal SensoTouch head.</li>
            <li>leaves more room on counter top and one less thing to charge.</li>
            <li>I have a large professional beard trimmer and this attachment does a better job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to take apart and put back together to clean.</li>
            <li>delivered to us very fast.</li>
            <li>This has a few benefits: Easy to clean, easy to attach, and don&#x27;t have to worry about bumping the adjustment when you put the guide on/off.</li>
            <li>I really like that it attaches to my new Norelco razor so easily.</li>
            <li>Really great thing, worth the ridiculous price.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re all pretty slim.</li>
            <li>At least it doesn&#x27;t seem like a great idea to put any wear and tear on the drive connection, even though it&#x27;s made to snap on and off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>but it trims my beard very well!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I do not have a ton of facial hair and mostly use this for upkeep and trimming around the neck line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will probably stay in my drawer and not be used again, sad since the razor itself is great!</li>
            <li>I love my Norelco razor, and now it works equally well as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>All it means is that it takes some time to get a consistent cut in place.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to find it on Amazon sold individually.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>, then think a bit shorter would be better; I go back over the beard.</li>
            <li>The quality of this attachment is very high, and snaps right on my Sensotouch.</li>
            <li>I got this to go along with my  new Philips Norelco shaver to help keep my facial hair nice and trimmed.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer for the Norelco Sensotouch is great, I can trim the hear in the back corner of my head to stop the chicken wing effect of the hear growing straight out, the variable depth is great for controlling the length of the hear.</li>
            <li>To boot, it functions better at trimming down edges than the trimmer that was originally provided with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just use scissors for that currently, and good news--with the wider blade than my last trimmer</li>
            <li>I can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The comb does a good job of pulling the whiskers up to the blades; I only have to go over the same place a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;Hey, its twenty bucks!&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The business end of the guide is pretty short, which allows for easily trimming the &#x27;stache/lower lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>It snaps on easily and takes the place of an extra stand alone trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Using the clippers bare, without the plastic guide, is far more efficient than the built-in trimmer on the SensoTouch models.</li>
            <li>The RQ111 feels solid and durable, and snaps on and off the shaver easily.</li>
            <li>OMG really?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>This does not work very well.</li>
            <li>but I am very impressed with its ease of adjustment and cutting power.</li>
            <li>Making it much easier for travel.</li>
            <li>this trimmer works very well .</li>
            <li>Love this as my hair styling needs at this stage of my life are quite minimal.  </li>
            <li>It works wonders for me and really shortens my time shaving.</li>
            <li>thanks Phillips for making this.</li>
            <li>Even the highest setting makes for a very closely-cropped beard.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I really recommend</li>
            <li>Really like this attachment</li>
            <li>Additionally, the &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; that come with it leave much to be desired.</li>
            <li>The reason to own this is so that you can pack just one tiny shaver bag (your regular shaver plus this replacement head for beard trimming) when you travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially helpful given the shrinking size of the pop-up trimmers in the newer 3-D shavers, but this trimmer is far better than any pop-up trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The accessory works better than expected!</li>
            <li>The styler is better than the other two I have owned and</li>
            <li>I can easily clean out the hair (how my last one broke)</li>
            <li>works like it says it does and came in new like it said and fast A.</li>
            <li>close and trims evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Great results in less time than options I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;SO much better than a flip-out</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, for less than the price of this add-on, you can get a stand alone trimmer that is far more comfortable to use and functional, such as the Phillips Norelco G370.</li>
            <li>guide settings (this is the main reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard about these through an insert in a set of the absurdly expensive Phillips replacement heads for my 3-D shaver, which incidentally is a wonderful shaver except for an entirely too-puny pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li>This particular product wasn&#x27;t what I hoped for but that was my incorrect expectation - trying to turn a shaver into a clipper.  </li>
            <li>I was interested to see if they have made it better than the small tooth one on the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i highly recomend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>There is that normal trimmer buzz but nothing obnoxious.  </li>
            <li>Worth it if you need to trim body and facial hair.</li>
            <li>Amazon reviews were largely positive, and the price was almost shockingly reasonable for Phillips, which seems bent on charging arms and legs for replacement blades and toothbrushes for its various hygienic contraptions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>be advised this is not some cheap clipper attachment - it is sharp and works as described.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded my razor to a new Norelco.</li>
            <li>The new one doesn&#x27;t have a cord... needs a dedicated charging dock.</li>
            <li>With the new razor I have to leave it plugged in which caused a fight for outlets, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Rather than spend 30 - 40 dollars on a new one, I thought I&#x27;d give the Norelco Click-On a try (it was on sale for $14</li>
            <li>By happy coincidence, Norelco sent me an offer for a RQ111 about the time I was getting annoyed with the state of the non-replaceable battery in my last beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I had been using the built in styler on my Norelco but this is a big step up and makes the whole process much easier.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special here, a beard trimmer that works as expected.  </li>
            <li>My facial hair is pretty square</li>
            <li>Truly professional cut!</li>
            <li>The clear plastic guard is just sharp enough to irritate my skin when I use it; I made sure to give it the recommended month for my skin to get used to it, to no avail.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ve just exercised poor judgment in the past, but this is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, and</li>
            <li>Could have given it a 4 because it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;quite&amp;#34; as good as a Wahl or other small trimmer -</li>
            <li>I hope my current shaver never breaks, but if it does, I&#x27;ll certainly look for another one that can use an attachment like this.</li>
            <li>old razor was corded and basically bullet proof.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm, secure, and their&#x27;s no razor head to obstruct your view.</li>
            <li>On my old trimmer I was a 3/5.</li>
            <li>my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Guide is extremely simple and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda loud</li>
            <li>I now have one device that does all and can retire my old beard trimmer which was also a Norelco.</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to chew through thick hair effectively.</li>
            <li>The only con I have with this styler is the adjustable comb tends to push my beard down more than actually comb through.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my razor about two years ago and have gotten several advertisements for this particular add-on and never decided to act upon it.</li>
            <li>after a little research I found this head not only fit it, but addressed all the issues I had with the old head.</li>
            <li>This makes it a little more difficult to trim and takes more time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d appreciate options for a size or two longer for when I just want to do a quick once-over to tame my beard down, but don&#x27;t have time for a full trim.</li>
            <li>However, and I understand this isn&#x27;t the intention of the product, but after taking this to my balls, and &amp;#34;hammer&amp;#34; it left me with a few razor burns, so I ask all buyers to be careful when doing this, because it will mess you up if you&#x27;re not careful, but on the plus side it did trim up really good down there. :)</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected</li>
            <li>Was working fine at the beginning, but it suddenly stopped working due to some hair stuck in there!!</li>
            <li>you do a detailed sculpted outline, the wide trimmer might be too wide.</li>
            <li>The styler&#x27;s should offer a choice of five length settings , but actually it just offers one length ，the length settings can not be setted</li>
            <li>It offers five (count em, FIVE) different height adjustments and a sixth, super-secret, no clip mode</li>
            <li>only thing you have to be careful about is that even though it has five settings for length, even the furthest setting is pretty close.  </li>
            <li>However, the adjustable guard is limited on the high end: needs another step or two so that you don&#x27;t trim too close.</li>
            <li>My facial hair grows fast, so letting it grow for a few days leaves a bit too much for the standard razor head to trim through.</li>
            <li>Seems like the blades do not trim the hair very well when using the guard, but other than that seems like a well designed device.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that I wanted something that could style my medium-length beard and the guard doesn&#x27;t come out far enough to do that.</li>
            <li>This unit is far less expensive than most stand alone trimmers and performs the same functions reasonably well.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this trimmer and the second time I&#x27;ve had to return for a replacement as the first one delivered &amp;#34;stalls&amp;#34; the shaver after running the trimmer for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>A little awkward at first but got used to the different holding position pretty quick.</li>

            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Good addition to Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li> For the money it&#x27;s a good.</li>
            <li> Wish it were made of a more pliable form of plastic - great pick up regardless</li>
            <li> More than exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> nice addition to the razor,  got it for a good price, if it was any more, i would not have bought it.</li>
            <li> it get&#x27;s nice and close</li>
            <li> When I use it with the guard for trimming it gives me a nice even trim in way</li>
            <li> Nice addition to the shaver</li>
            <li> Nice attachment.</li>
            <li> This a nice compact way to carry a trimmer when traveling.  </li>
            <li> The Styler works great - keeps my mustache and goatee trimmed perfectly, and the thing is almost silent when you use it</li>
            <li> really nice attachment for the razor</li>
            <li> This click on styler is really easy to use and makes your mustache and beard even whiskers really good shape.</li>
            <li> works great for quick trims</li>
            <li> Item performs excellently and completely meets my all expectations.</li>
            <li> however if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair or just want to use if for upkeep its a good fit.</li>
            <li> By far one of the best purchases I have made in 2014!</li>
            <li> Worked great a first</li>
            <li> Great product, but be aware of the limitations.</li>
            <li> This clipper is well made and gives very accurate control of beard length.</li>
            <li> I quickly received my beard trimmer, and it met all expectations: ease of use, good quality, etc.</li>
            <li> Very good razor on a one day old growth..</li>
            <li> They should have made it better.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my very short beard.</li>
            <li> I can adjust the closeness for a better groom and not just a shave, and the blades are rounded now (instead of jagged edges)</li>
            <li> Much more ergonomic than the flip-out stylers.</li>
            <li> so it allows me to finish quicker and not have to worry about lining up as many strokes on my neck</li>
            <li> it replaced norelco maverick and works much better.</li>
            <li> So overall, great product, and for the quality, the price is fair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Click-on styler for my Norelco Sensotouch 3D for more than a month now.</li>
            <li> More than that, it came off the shavers body during the operation while motor was working.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> It has five adjustable settings that I think should satisfy most beard trimming needs.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I wish it was more than that.</li>
            <li> i cannot describe more cause it is him who is using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just gotta learn to aim that thing better.</li>
            <li> it was a nice hi quality replacement, for the cheap one that came with my razor originally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps a separate guard would be better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this head because it looked more sturdy and nicer,and it is.</li>
            <li> Glad I decided to get this attachment.</li>
            <li> it was a really worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> Works better than the built in trimmer.</li>
            <li> (OK, it is the blade without a guard, but it sounds cooler to say secret).&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does a better job than a specialized shaver.</li>
            <li> awesome add-on component - my only concern after a month is that the plastic guard they provide is like to break, I am still using the cheaper edge tool because I am avoiding taking off and placing on that flimsy plastic depth guard.  </li>
            <li> love this attachment, eliminated the need for me to have another clipper, like the setting it has, can be used on many things.</li>
            <li> I have the 9700 series shaver and this works better than my Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li> It slides closer-further from the blades to adjust beard length and you have to slide it off for a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> great quality, working fine, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> cuts greats, love how it adjusts, and this one can easily be cleaned out, this also feels alot better quality than what came with the buzzer</li>
            <li> love the guard and easy use.  </li>
            <li> It attaches and detaches from the razor very easily and is easy to clean by running under the tap, as is the razor itself.</li>
            <li> I use it this morning to trim my beard, really cool gadget, easy to clean, doesnt make much noise which very good on those hangover days</li>
            <li> This works okay, just a bit &#x27;cheap&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Had a friend tell me yesterday that my goatee really looked good.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed by the built in trimmer in my Norelco 1255XTR Sensitivity 3D, but the Beard Styled takes it to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li> It attaches easily and cleanup is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Snaps on easily.</li>
            <li> The comb size is easily adjusted.</li>
            <li> but it is SO easy to use I don&#x27;t need to travel with my Wahl (and separate charger)</li>
            <li> a Norelco SensoTouch 3D. Installation is easy, Just pull the shaver from the SensoTouch and push in the beard styler until it clicks.</li>
            <li> Easy to attach to my razor and easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li> Easy to switch in and out between the shaver and styler as well</li>
            <li> It packs easily, thus it is pefect for traveling</li>
            <li> Bought this to attach to the 2D works as said does a close shave and makes desired length easy to do</li>
            <li> but I super glued it and it has been working fine for a couple years!</li>
            <li> Also the different levels of trim is excellent - I can clean up my sideburns efficiently and quickly.</li>
            <li> On both occasions, after having Amazon ship a replacement it works fine.</li>
            <li> Better than what originally came with my razor (the original broke, so I ordered this one.)</li>
            <li> Works fine...</li>
            <li> I use it with no attachment for a quick trim and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> the shaver battery much more quickly than the three-headed shaver attachment.</li>
            <li> it is easy and convenient to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This little device is the perfect accessory for my Norelco razor.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to adjust and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my beard, but that&#x27;s because I keep it very short.</li>
            <li> This attachment does not feel that you can comfortably used on the face or else where.</li>
            <li> I had been using a cheap pen trimmer to keep the beard in check until I got</li>
            <li> Great product for traveling and only having to carry one device</li>
            <li> Super easy to change out the head.</li>
            <li> blade makes trimming a quick and easy task!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trims hair very well, and very easy to switch out for the shaver attachment.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a new head for my razor &amp; Amazon had the best deal.</li>
            <li> I lost the one my razor originally came with.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first, but as my skin adjusted and I got used to the razor, I love it..</li>
            <li> This is the unit that my razor should have had in the original box.</li>
            <li> Works great as long as I aim it well.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was what I wanted</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a pleasant surprise from Phillips, given it usually makes good stuff but rarely misses an opportunity to overcharge.</li>
            <li> Turns out, I was right!</li>
            <li> Works Great and as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Norelco products for several years now and find them to be good quality.</li>
            <li> This accessory is perfect, just saves you from having to buy many other products that serve the same purpose.</li>
            <li> This easily attached to the razor, and looks pretty.  </li>
            <li> Swapping heads is so quick and easy-less time than swapping power cords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they get it to you quick.</li>
            <li> This thing works so quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased and highly recommend this trimmer head to anyone with a compatible Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After perhaps 6 months of regular use, I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Just recently got this and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to add to a new razor I bought and it works better than a beard trimmer I have.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, cleans up fast.</li>
            <li> The attachment is easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li> exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my new razor, I was surprised at how good it works.</li>
            <li> A great little accessory for the Norelco razor.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would replace my old trimmer...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to only have one unit on my counter now.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what made me fall in love with my old trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed like it was worth a shot, and the thought of eliminating one widget and leveraging the shaver was appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good decision.</li>
            <li> the fact that it uses the shaver means it&#x27;s driven by a powerful battery that charges rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, did away with a second device and charger.</li>
            <li> it is worth it.;</li>
            <li> Nice accessory to go with the Norelco Shaver he bought at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I found this at a fraction of the cost and well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent for trimming everything nice and neatly to bad it wasn&#x27;t included when I first purchased my razor...</li>
            <li> The motor in it is much stronger than the original trimmer and its a lot quicker to cut off the hair.</li>
            <li> With the styler I can trim it to a fine stubble and then remove with the normal SensoTouch head.</li>
            <li> leaves more room on counter top and one less thing to charge.</li>
            <li> I have a large professional beard trimmer and this attachment does a better job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to take apart and put back together to clean.</li>
            <li> delivered to us very fast.</li>
            <li> This has a few benefits: Easy to clean, easy to attach, and don&#x27;t have to worry about bumping the adjustment when you put the guide on/off.</li>
            <li> I really like that it attaches to my new Norelco razor so easily.</li>
            <li> Really great thing, worth the ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re all pretty slim.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t seem like a great idea to put any wear and tear on the drive connection, even though it&#x27;s made to snap on and off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> but it trims my beard very well!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I do not have a ton of facial hair and mostly use this for upkeep and trimming around the neck line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will probably stay in my drawer and not be used again, sad since the razor itself is great!</li>
            <li> I love my Norelco razor, and now it works equally well as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> All it means is that it takes some time to get a consistent cut in place.</li>
            <li> so I was glad to find it on Amazon sold individually.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> , then think a bit shorter would be better; I go back over the beard.</li>
            <li> The quality of this attachment is very high, and snaps right on my Sensotouch.</li>
            <li> I got this to go along with my  new Philips Norelco shaver to help keep my facial hair nice and trimmed.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer for the Norelco Sensotouch is great, I can trim the hear in the back corner of my head to stop the chicken wing effect of the hear growing straight out, the variable depth is great for controlling the length of the hear.</li>
            <li> To boot, it functions better at trimming down edges than the trimmer that was originally provided with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just use scissors for that currently, and good news--with the wider blade than my last trimmer</li>
            <li> I can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The comb does a good job of pulling the whiskers up to the blades; I only have to go over the same place a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;Hey, its twenty bucks!&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> The business end of the guide is pretty short, which allows for easily trimming the &#x27;stache/lower lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> It snaps on easily and takes the place of an extra stand alone trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Using the clippers bare, without the plastic guide, is far more efficient than the built-in trimmer on the SensoTouch models.</li>
            <li> The RQ111 feels solid and durable, and snaps on and off the shaver easily.</li>
            <li> OMG really?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This does not work very well.</li>
            <li> but I am very impressed with its ease of adjustment and cutting power.</li>
            <li> Making it much easier for travel.</li>
            <li> this trimmer works very well .</li>
            <li> Love this as my hair styling needs at this stage of my life are quite minimal.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders for me and really shortens my time shaving.</li>
            <li> thanks Phillips for making this.</li>
            <li> Even the highest setting makes for a very closely-cropped beard.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I really recommend</li>
            <li> Really like this attachment</li>
            <li> Additionally, the &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; that come with it leave much to be desired.</li>
            <li> The reason to own this is so that you can pack just one tiny shaver bag (your regular shaver plus this replacement head for beard trimming) when you travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially helpful given the shrinking size of the pop-up trimmers in the newer 3-D shavers, but this trimmer is far better than any pop-up trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The accessory works better than expected!</li>
            <li> The styler is better than the other two I have owned and</li>
            <li> I can easily clean out the hair (how my last one broke)</li>
            <li> works like it says it does and came in new like it said and fast A.</li>
            <li> close and trims evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Great results in less time than options I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;SO much better than a flip-out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, for less than the price of this add-on, you can get a stand alone trimmer that is far more comfortable to use and functional, such as the Phillips Norelco G370.</li>
            <li> guide settings (this is the main reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard about these through an insert in a set of the absurdly expensive Phillips replacement heads for my 3-D shaver, which incidentally is a wonderful shaver except for an entirely too-puny pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> This particular product wasn&#x27;t what I hoped for but that was my incorrect expectation - trying to turn a shaver into a clipper.  </li>
            <li> I was interested to see if they have made it better than the small tooth one on the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i highly recomend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> There is that normal trimmer buzz but nothing obnoxious.  </li>
            <li> Worth it if you need to trim body and facial hair.</li>
            <li> Amazon reviews were largely positive, and the price was almost shockingly reasonable for Phillips, which seems bent on charging arms and legs for replacement blades and toothbrushes for its various hygienic contraptions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> be advised this is not some cheap clipper attachment - it is sharp and works as described.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded my razor to a new Norelco.</li>
            <li> The new one doesn&#x27;t have a cord... needs a dedicated charging dock.</li>
            <li> With the new razor I have to leave it plugged in which caused a fight for outlets, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Rather than spend 30 - 40 dollars on a new one, I thought I&#x27;d give the Norelco Click-On a try (it was on sale for $14</li>
            <li> By happy coincidence, Norelco sent me an offer for a RQ111 about the time I was getting annoyed with the state of the non-replaceable battery in my last beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had been using the built in styler on my Norelco but this is a big step up and makes the whole process much easier.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special here, a beard trimmer that works as expected.  </li>
            <li> My facial hair is pretty square</li>
            <li> Truly professional cut!</li>
            <li> The clear plastic guard is just sharp enough to irritate my skin when I use it; I made sure to give it the recommended month for my skin to get used to it, to no avail.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve just exercised poor judgment in the past, but this is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, and</li>
            <li> Could have given it a 4 because it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;quite&amp;#34; as good as a Wahl or other small trimmer -</li>
            <li> I hope my current shaver never breaks, but if it does, I&#x27;ll certainly look for another one that can use an attachment like this.</li>
            <li> old razor was corded and basically bullet proof.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm, secure, and their&#x27;s no razor head to obstruct your view.</li>
            <li> On my old trimmer I was a 3/5.</li>
            <li> my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Guide is extremely simple and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda loud</li>
            <li> I now have one device that does all and can retire my old beard trimmer which was also a Norelco.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to chew through thick hair effectively.</li>
            <li> The only con I have with this styler is the adjustable comb tends to push my beard down more than actually comb through.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my razor about two years ago and have gotten several advertisements for this particular add-on and never decided to act upon it.</li>
            <li> after a little research I found this head not only fit it, but addressed all the issues I had with the old head.</li>
            <li> This makes it a little more difficult to trim and takes more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d appreciate options for a size or two longer for when I just want to do a quick once-over to tame my beard down, but don&#x27;t have time for a full trim.</li>
            <li> However, and I understand this isn&#x27;t the intention of the product, but after taking this to my balls, and &amp;#34;hammer&amp;#34; it left me with a few razor burns, so I ask all buyers to be careful when doing this, because it will mess you up if you&#x27;re not careful, but on the plus side it did trim up really good down there. :)</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> Was working fine at the beginning, but it suddenly stopped working due to some hair stuck in there!!</li>
            <li> you do a detailed sculpted outline, the wide trimmer might be too wide.</li>
            <li> The styler&#x27;s should offer a choice of five length settings , but actually it just offers one length ，the length settings can not be setted</li>
            <li> It offers five (count em, FIVE) different height adjustments and a sixth, super-secret, no clip mode</li>
            <li> only thing you have to be careful about is that even though it has five settings for length, even the furthest setting is pretty close.  </li>
            <li> However, the adjustable guard is limited on the high end: needs another step or two so that you don&#x27;t trim too close.</li>
            <li> My facial hair grows fast, so letting it grow for a few days leaves a bit too much for the standard razor head to trim through.</li>
            <li> Seems like the blades do not trim the hair very well when using the guard, but other than that seems like a well designed device.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that I wanted something that could style my medium-length beard and the guard doesn&#x27;t come out far enough to do that.</li>
            <li> This unit is far less expensive than most stand alone trimmers and performs the same functions reasonably well.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this trimmer and the second time I&#x27;ve had to return for a replacement as the first one delivered &amp;#34;stalls&amp;#34; the shaver after running the trimmer for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> A little awkward at first but got used to the different holding position pretty quick.</li>
            <li> The price was a little high, but for what it it does  </li>
            <li> the comb part does not look like it will last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s waterproof (my tests suggest it is, though I am not certain) or provide any guidance around cleaning or general usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a new, high-quality trimmer for just a few bucks</li>
            <li> better late then never though I guess !!!</li>
            <li> at home this add-on is not really something you want to pop on and off your regular 3D shaver.  </li>
            <li> Unless you are extra extra gentle in maneuvering it around your face, something in the guard will jam just a little, and it will keep cutting right</li>
            <li> the guide itself is just a single piece.</li>
            <li> Can also be used down low.</li>
            <li> only complaints are that the guard has a gap in it with sharp plastic on each edge and that there is no easy way to angle it to shave properly.</li>
            <li> Only complaint it that it occasionally gets noisy and can be difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was expensive for what it is, but after trying it a few times, I have to admit that it is very well built, and definitely NOT cheaply made.</li>
            <li> If you do anything sculpty it might be too wide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few years and will be switching back.</li>
            <li> So I just ordered it just to have it and not really use it unless I had to travel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight piece, but the blade itself is heavy and sharp, not unlike a commercial trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After other tries, this is the one!&lt;br /&gt;perfect</li>
            <li> Now this little attachment I get the same results with less weight.</li>
            <li> It seems to have been made for those who trim daily with hair that grows VERY little.</li>
            <li> I had bought those other $10 - $15 stand alone trimmers before.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s one other problem.  </li>
            <li> This head also work for other location as well</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Does what I expected!</li>
            <li> Allows me to trim my sideburnes, mustache and the small hairs on the back of my neck between haircuts.</li>
            <li> Not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> I had some other trimmers that did not adjust as well as these.</li>
            <li> I do not give it 5 stars, because I have not tried any other product.  </li>
            <li> The noise level is average.</li>
            <li> and it takes half the time of conventional shaving..</li>
            <li> My goatee is always looking sharp!</li>
            <li> Only a problem, it´s little slow to shave.</li>
            <li> but now i get half way through a shave and the blades stop moving</li>
            <li> I used to typically shave after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> it takes less time for a trim, so it&#x27;s easier to squeeze in nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trimming your beard is a breeze with this thing and Amazon gets it to you for less than what you would pay anywhere else</li>
            <li> The height of the guard is adjusted by a little black slider on the bottom.</li>
            <li> they come out an odd angle, sometimes fold away while you&#x27;re using them, and I&#x27;ve had them die a few times before the razor does.</li>
            <li> I do wish there was a setting for a little longer hair though.  </li>
            <li> The adjustments on this Norelco Styler lets met get a little closer for a neater look.</li>
            <li> Product worked for a little while then stopped all together</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could have come with a little protective</li>
            <li> (the narrow one could sometimes lead to a jagged line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> everyday use at home</li>
            <li> They work for a few weeks then break and won&#x27;t trim any hair.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment to the head is useless which does not lift the hair properly.</li>
            <li> It can in no way substitute a full-scale trimmer, and, is fully meaningless as such.</li>
            <li> #34;clean up&amp;#34; some over the ears I&#x27;ve ended up with some pretty nasty unwanted white walls a couple of times..  </li>
            <li> The teeth  on this are just too small.</li>
            <li> I usually use a No. 2 or 3 beard trimmer and this styler delivered.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like being halfway through your small beard (cutting off less than a 1/8 inch) when suddenly the clippers grab your hair and pull.  </li>
            <li> Slips into lower settings if you push too hard while shaving.</li>
            <li> really hard to use</li>
            <li> and I hardly used it.</li>
            <li> My complaint about the guide is it&#x27;s length settings...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well on thick hair.</li>
            <li> totaly recomended, but little expensive.</li>
            <li> Not to catastrophise here, but it looks a little vulnerable, both when in use and when traveling.</li>
            <li> probably is not fair to mention what has not happened, or may not happen, but</li>
            <li> but that sucker is packed away in a drawer now!</li>
            <li> It was so thin.</li>
            <li> You may need to adjust the cutting blade with a small alan wrench to achieve a closer trim.  </li>
            <li> Too difficult to snap in and take off the razor</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;dedicated&amp;#34; trimmer failed and was expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s moderately uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> gets petty close to the difficult right-under-your-nose area.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li> that didn&#x27;t bother me, I always hated the integrated ones on my past razors...</li>
            <li> I bought these and when I took them out of the box, the cutting (moving blade) is at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Jeff!</li>
            <li> Basically, skip this product, it will pull and annoy the crap out of you.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works Great and reduced clutter on my counter, eliminating one grooming tool. Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good beard trimmer!</li>
            <li> I am a licensed barber. I bought these and when I took them out of the box, the cutting (moving blade) is at the bottom. OMG really? This is the dumbest design every. When the moving blade is at the bottom, it will pull hairs which hurts. Basically, skip this product, it will pull and annoy the crap out of you. You will end up with shaving bumps.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Great value</li>
            <li> Bought this cause I lost the one my razor originally came with. Worked great a first but now i get half way through a shave and the blades stop moving and it just vibrates.</li>
            <li> This has been a great addition for me! Super easy to change out the head. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> The comb attachment to the head is useless which does not lift the hair properly. They should have made it better.</li>
            <li> nice addition to the razor,  got it for a good price, if it was any more, i would not have bought it.</li>
            <li> This accessory is perfect, just saves you from having to buy many other products that serve the same purpose. It is a must have.</li>
            <li> Slips into lower settings if you push too hard while shaving.</li>
            <li> A great little accessory for the Norelco razor.  It trims mustache and side burns to keep from looking saggy.  Easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li> Very good razor on a one day old growth.. I used to typically shave after a couple of days.  But if you shave daily with this razor, it will give you a close shave and it takes half the time of conventional shaving.. I was worried at first, but as my skin adjusted and I got used to the razor, I love it.. Be patient and learn how it works for you..</li>
            <li> This does not work very well. Bought a Wahl clipper set instead after this.</li>
            <li> Delivey was on time and have been very happy with purchase...exactly as advertised! Would recommend to anyone looking for same or similar item.</li>
            <li> I had bought those other $10 - $15 stand alone trimmers before.  But this works awesome with the Norelco chavers it fits.  Buy it for this prices..</li>
            <li> I use it this morning to trim my beard, really cool gadget, easy to clean, doesnt make much noise which very good on those hangover days</li>
            <li> Item performs excellently and completely meets my all expectations. I use it trim my hair since I have no beard</li>
            <li> Perfect for my very short beard.</li>
            <li> I went to get a replacement blade for my Nerelco 2D Razor only to find that head had been discontenued. after a little research I found this head not only fit it, but addressed all the issues I had with the old head. I can easily clean out the hair (how my last one broke) I can adjust the closeness for a better groom and not just a shave, and the blades are rounded now (instead of jagged edges) that would leave red lines on my neck.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my morello shaver to trim and it works great.</li>
            <li> Paired with: \\&quot;Philips Norelco 1150X SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Facial hair style: Dense beard cut to about 1/2\\&quot; length, trimmed square&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded my razor to a new Norelco. It didn&#x27;t have a styler on it-that didn&#x27;t bother me, I always hated the integrated ones on my past razors... they come out an odd angle, sometimes fold away while you&#x27;re using them, and I&#x27;ve had them die a few times before the razor does. When my last styler crapped out but the razor was still kicking I went out and bout a dedicated trimmer for my beard--Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old razor was corded and basically bullet proof. The new one doesn&#x27;t have a cord... needs a dedicated charging dock. I used to unplug my trimmer when I needed the razor. With the new razor I have to leave it plugged in which caused a fight for outlets, so I decided to give this a try. I wasn&#x27;t sure this would replace my old trimmer... but that sucker is packed away in a drawer now! It&#x27;s so nice to only have one unit on my counter now. Swapping heads is so quick and easy-less time than swapping power cords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the guard this gives you a great angle of approach for lining the edge of your beard. Much more ergonomic than the flip-out stylers. It&#x27;s firm, secure, and their&#x27;s no razor head to obstruct your view. That&#x27;s what made me fall in love with my old trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is wider than my old trimmer, almost twice as wide (about 1.5\\&quot;). If you do anything sculpty it might be too wide. My facial hair is pretty square so it allows me to finish quicker and not have to worry about lining up as many strokes on my neck (the narrow one could sometimes lead to a jagged line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide adjustment is set on the head of the unit.. the guide itself is just a single piece. This has a few benefits: Easy to clean, easy to attach, and don&#x27;t have to worry about bumping the adjustment when you put the guide on/off. My complaint about the guide is it&#x27;s length settings... they&#x27;re all pretty slim. On my old trimmer I was a 3/5. I tried 3/5 on this one off that bat--big mistake! It was so thin. I&#x27;ve gone up to 5/5 and it&#x27;s perfect for my beard. I&#x27;d appreciate options for a size or two longer for when I just want to do a quick once-over to tame my beard down, but don&#x27;t have time for a full trim. I just use scissors for that currently, and good news--with the wider blade than my last trimmer it takes less time for a trim, so it&#x27;s easier to squeeze in nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it for lining my beard it get&#x27;s nice and close-sometimes I don&#x27;t even bother to follow up with the razor on my cheeks/neck. When I use it with the guard for trimming it gives me a nice even trim in way fewer passes that my old trimmer. The business end of the guide is pretty short, which allows for easily trimming the &#x27;stache/lower lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Functionality of a dedicated trimmer without needing a second device.&lt;br /&gt;Wide blade makes trimming a quick and easy task!&lt;br /&gt;Guide is extremely simple and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts close and trims evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Great results in less time than options I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;SO much better than a flip-out styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Short guide settings (this is the main reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars)&lt;br /&gt;If you travel a lot I could see why you&#x27;d want the convenience of a flip-out&lt;br /&gt;If you do a detailed sculpted outline, the wide trimmer might be too wide.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sensotouch 3D. Only used it once but I am very impressed with its ease of adjustment and cutting power.</li>
            <li> The reason to own this is so that you can pack just one tiny shaver bag (your regular shaver plus this replacement head for beard trimming) when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at home this add-on is not really something you want to pop on and off your regular 3D shaver.  At least it doesn&#x27;t seem like a great idea to put any wear and tear on the drive connection, even though it&#x27;s made to snap on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s one other problem.  Unless you are extra extra gentle in maneuvering it around your face, something in the guard will jam just a little, and it will keep cutting right but the noise will increase greatly from a hum to a louder buzz, and that&#x27;s either annoying or worrisome like it might wear out faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyday use at home I recommend the Philips Norelco QT4014/42 trimmer which is working great for me -- [[ASIN:B00ARF44O6 B00ARF44O6]]</li>
            <li> This little device is the perfect accessory for my Norelco razor.  It snaps on easily and takes the place of an extra stand alone trimmer.  Making it much easier for travel.</li>
            <li> This head also work for other location as well ;) so the shaver can become mutli purpose</li>
            <li> I have a large professional beard trimmer and this attachment does a better job.  It is easy to adjust and clean.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my new razor, I was surprised at how good it works. I would recommend buying this item.</li>
            <li> this trimmer works very well . it replaced norelco maverick and works much better. leaves more room on counter top and one less thing to charge.</li>
            <li> I got the Sensotouch for birthday present, and saw this option.  Love this as my hair styling needs at this stage of my life are quite minimal.  It works great and saves me time and money at the barber.  Sorry, Jeff!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was expensive for what it is, but after trying it a few times, I have to admit that it is very well built, and definitely NOT cheaply made. So overall, great product, and for the quality, the price is fair.</li>
            <li> The accessory works better than expected! It attaches easily and cleanup is a breeze. It is a quality product. I would buy it again if needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a very attractive price.  I recently purchased a new head for my razor &amp; Amazon had the best deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda loud but it trims my beard very well! The plastic part snapped after a while but I super glued it and it has been working fine for a couple years! It&#x27;s pretty easy to take apart and put back together to clean. It also needs to be cleaned and lubed every now and then otherwise it won&#x27;t work unless you run it under some water.</li>
            <li> I quickly received my beard trimmer, and it met all expectations: ease of use, good quality, etc. However, and I understand this isn&#x27;t the intention of the product, but after taking this to my balls, and &amp;#34;hammer&amp;#34; it left me with a few razor burns, so I ask all buyers to be careful when doing this, because it will mess you up if you&#x27;re not careful, but on the plus side it did trim up really good down there. :)</li>
            <li> Great styler, works well for me.</li>
            <li> Snaps on easily. The comb size is easily adjusted. Could have given it a 4 because it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;quite&amp;#34; as good as a Wahl or other small trimmer - but it is SO easy to use I don&#x27;t need to travel with my Wahl (and separate charger) so I gave it a 5.</li>
            <li> I got this beard styler to use with a Norelco SensoTouch 3D. Installation is easy, Just pull the shaver from the SensoTouch and push in the beard styler until it clicks. The noise level is average. There is that normal trimmer buzz but nothing obnoxious.  The adjustable comb is great to get the perfect height I desire. The only con I have with this styler is the adjustable comb tends to push my beard down more than actually comb through.  This makes it a little more difficult to trim and takes more time. I believe if the comb was thinner this would make things easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Click-on styler for my Norelco Sensotouch 3D for more than a month now. It works wonders for me and really shortens my time shaving. Using the clippers bare, without the plastic guide, is far more efficient than the built-in trimmer on the SensoTouch models. My facial hair grows fast, so letting it grow for a few days leaves a bit too much for the standard razor head to trim through. With the styler I can trim it to a fine stubble and then remove with the normal SensoTouch head. No complaints as of yet, that&#x27;s why it gets all five stars in my book.</li>
            <li> Easy to attach to my razor and easy to adjust.  Works extremely well.  Only complaint it that it occasionally gets noisy and can be difficult to clean.  that being said, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This attachment does not do the job it&#x27;s intented to do. It does not trim the hair at all. More than that, it came off the shavers body during the operation while motor was working. It means that this thing is fully unreliable and does not fulfill its proposed function. I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll be using it any time again. It can in no way substitute a full-scale trimmer, and, is fully meaningless as such.</li>
            <li> great for trimming unwanted hair and cleaning up.  love the guard and easy use.  great price too.  thanks Phillips for making this.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the styler will only work for very short hair. It&#x27;s great for my beard, but that&#x27;s because I keep it very short. Even the highest setting makes for a very closely-cropped beard. Anyone who wears facial hair longer would need a separate trimmer and should not consider this product. It attaches and detaches from the razor very easily and is easy to clean by running under the tap, as is the razor itself. Great product, but be aware of the limitations.</li>
            <li> This unit is far less expensive than most stand alone trimmers and performs the same functions reasonably well. Glad I learned of it&#x27;s existence in the package that contained my replacement shaver head.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my razor..</li>
            <li> totaly recomended, but little expensive. Only a problem, it´s little slow to shave. need to do three or four passes</li>
            <li> Nice addition to the shaver</li>
            <li> Does what I expected!</li>
            <li> Works Great and as expected. It should be sold with your razor but I can see why Phillips didn&#x27;t. Because they want to make money. Worth it if you need to trim body and facial hair.</li>
            <li> a good one. exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> Nothing special here, a beard trimmer that works as expected.  I do wish there was a setting for a little longer hair though.  I really like that it attaches to my new Norelco razor so easily.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer for the Norelco Sensotouch is great, I can trim the hear in the back corner of my head to stop the chicken wing effect of the hear growing straight out, the variable depth is great for controlling the length of the hear.</li>
            <li> Good addition to the shaver, however depending on if you like the removable, snap on attachment.... A separate trimmer unit might be a smarter buy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase considering the quality and price, it simply cannot be beat. It has five adjustable settings that I think should satisfy most beard trimming needs. I wear my beard close and use the #2 setting which provides me with a neat uniform appearance. Trimming your beard is a breeze with this thing and Amazon gets it to you for less than what you would pay anywhere else and they get it to you quick. I like not having to have a separate shaver for shaving and trimming. Just detach the shaving head and put on the trimmer head for your Philips SensoTouch and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li> This attachment does not feel that you can comfortably used on the face or else where.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to snap in and take off the razor</li>
            <li> Nice attachment. Allows me to trim my sideburnes, mustache and the small hairs on the back of my neck between haircuts. Can also be used down low. Beware that it does not get skin close.</li>
            <li> I heard about these through an insert in a set of the absurdly expensive Phillips replacement heads for my 3-D shaver, which incidentally is a wonderful shaver except for an entirely too-puny pop-up trimmer. Amazon reviews were largely positive, and the price was almost shockingly reasonable for Phillips, which seems bent on charging arms and legs for replacement blades and toothbrushes for its various hygienic contraptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works great. You have to remove the entire shaver head, as you would to replace the blades on the newer models. The trimmer pops on, adjusts to your preferred length, and trims longer hairs beautifully, \\&quot;zip-zip-zip\\&quot; at the length you set. It&#x27;s a lightweight piece, but the blade itself is heavy and sharp, not unlike a commercial trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pleasant surprise from Phillips, given it usually makes good stuff but rarely misses an opportunity to overcharge. It&#x27;s especially helpful given the shrinking size of the pop-up trimmers in the newer 3-D shavers, but this trimmer is far better than any pop-up trimmer I have ever used. It&#x27;s like having a new, high-quality trimmer for just a few bucks more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased and highly recommend this trimmer head to anyone with a compatible Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> The styler did not  provide the end result I was looking for, I am disapointed with the workings of the styler.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations.  I use it with no attachment for a quick trim and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> After other tries, this is the one!&lt;br /&gt;perfect desing&lt;br /&gt;ease to clean&lt;br /&gt;I use it to keep my bald head!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go to the barbershop again!</li>
            <li> Works perfect!  love it</li>
            <li> This a nice compact way to carry a trimmer when traveling.  Works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I wear a goatee and had a trimmer I used to keep it neat - but the trimmer died recently.  Rather than spend 30 - 40 dollars on a new one, I thought I&#x27;d give the Norelco Click-On a try (it was on sale for $14 and I had $5 gift card).  The Styler works great - keeps my mustache and goatee trimmed perfectly, and the thing is almost silent when you use it (it&#x27;s quieter than the regular razor head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you have to be careful about is that even though it has five settings for length, even the furthest setting is pretty close.  It&#x27;s not a problem for me as I keep the goatee close anyway, but if you have a substantial beard or mustache, you might lose part of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these. They work for a few weeks then break and won&#x27;t trim any hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this trimmer and the second time I&#x27;ve had to return for a replacement as the first one delivered &amp;#34;stalls&amp;#34; the shaver after running the trimmer for a few seconds. Some sort of manufacturing defect? On both occasions, after having Amazon ship a replacement it works fine.</li>
            <li> A must for my mustache!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a series of dedicated beard trimmers over the years. By happy coincidence, Norelco sent me an offer for a RQ111 about the time I was getting annoyed with the state of the non-replaceable battery in my last beard trimmer. It seemed like it was worth a shot, and the thought of eliminating one widget and leveraging the shaver was appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good decision. ;-) The RQ111 feels solid and durable, and snaps on and off the shaver easily. Maybe I&#x27;ve just exercised poor judgment in the past, but this is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, and the fact that it uses the shaver means it&#x27;s driven by a powerful battery that charges rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After perhaps 6 months of regular use, I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product. I hope my current shaver never breaks, but if it does, I&#x27;ll certainly look for another one that can use an attachment like this. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This works okay, just a bit &#x27;cheap&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Great add-on for your Norelco razor. Does a good job of trimming.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I really recommend</li>
            <li> This is the perfect attachment for trimming. It has several adjustments for different lengths and the adjustment piece also is removable for a zero length shaver.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed by the built in trimmer in my Norelco 1255XTR Sensitivity 3D, but the Beard Styled takes it to a whole new level.  This Styler works great!  Almost as well as the Stand alone stylers</li>
            <li> not recommend to buy. waste of money. really hard to use</li>
            <li> This attachment works well with my rechargeable Norelco Razor. I do not have a ton of facial hair and mostly use this for upkeep and trimming around the neck line. This unit is Defiantly not a replacement for a dedicated trimmer especially on that is plugged into a wall it just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to chew through thick hair effectively. however if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair or just want to use if for upkeep its a good fit.</li>
            <li> Was working fine at the beginning, but it suddenly stopped working due to some hair stuck in there!!</li>
            <li> Just recently got this and have been very pleased with it.  I had been using the built in styler on my Norelco but this is a big step up and makes the whole process much easier.  Easy to switch in and out between the shaver and styler as well</li>
            <li> This is a great attachment for Philips Norelco 1290x Senso Touch 3d Electric Razor. Not too big or too small. Great price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This easily attached to the razor, and looks pretty.  I wish it was more than that. The trimmer does trim, but it keeps jamming.  It seems to have been made for those who trim daily with hair that grows VERY little. There is nothing like being halfway through your small beard (cutting off less than a 1/8 inch) when suddenly the clippers grab your hair and pull.  That is a bit of a shock until it happens for hte 8th time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will probably stay in my drawer and not be used again, sad since the razor itself is great!</li>
            <li> bought the shaver for my husband as a gift, and then we bought the styler to go with it. it is easy and convenient to use and easy to clean. he basically only put it under the running water after use. i cannot describe more cause it is him who is using it. he loves it. delivered to us very fast.</li>
            <li> Better than what originally came with my razor (the original broke, so I ordered this one.) This is the unit that my razor should have had in the original box.</li>
            <li> I love my Norelco razor, and now it works equally well as a beard trimmer. And this head is compact enough to travel with me.</li>
            <li> Neat accessory for my razor.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, did away with a second device and charger. Does a good &#x27;3 day&#x27; trim. A little awkward at first but got used to the different holding position pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Norelco products for several years now and find them to be good quality. This particular product wasn&#x27;t what I hoped for but that was my incorrect expectation - trying to turn a shaver into a clipper.  I just found it easier to use a separate clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and bought a Norelco clipper instead and that works well for me.  If you want to use your shaver as a clipper, this could work well for you.  The quality is good.</li>
            <li> This click on styler is really easy to use and makes your mustache and beard even whiskers really good shape.</li>
            <li> Works great as long as I aim it well.  Trying to &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; some over the ears I&#x27;ve ended up with some pretty nasty unwanted white walls a couple of times..  I&#x27;ve just gotta learn to aim that thing better.</li>
            <li> it was a nice hi quality replacement, for the cheap one that came with my razor originally.&lt;br /&gt;i highly recomend it</li>
            <li> This is the cat&#x27;s meow. It works as advertized. Highly recommend it. It packs easily, thus it is pefect for traveling</li>
            <li> A VERY GOOD ACCESSORY FOR THE SHAVER.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised!</li>
            <li> The click on module works well with the shaver. However, the adjustable guard is limited on the high end: needs another step or two so that you don&#x27;t trim too close. Perhaps a separate guard would be better.</li>
            <li> great quality, working fine, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> works great for quick trims</li>
            <li> Although I got this attachment on my Phillips Norellco I ordered this head because it looked more sturdy and nicer,and it is. The price was a little high, but for what it it does  it is worth it.;</li>
            <li> He loves it.  Amazed by the way it shaves so close without hurting at all.  Really great thing, worth the ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> Nice accessory to go with the Norelco Shaver he bought at the same time.  Would definitely recommend buying this as an add-on if you buy the Sensotouch razor</li>
            <li> I got this to go along with my  new Philips Norelco shaver to help keep my facial hair nice and trimmed. This thing works so quickly and evenly. My goatee is always looking sharp!</li>
            <li> The styler&#x27;s should offer a choice of five length settings , but actually it just offers one length ，the length settings can not be setted</li>
            <li> This is a great attachment for my Norelco.  Had a friend tell me yesterday that my goatee really looked good.  Glad I decided to get this attachment.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;dedicated&amp;#34; trimmer failed and was expensive to replace. I found this at a fraction of the cost and well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to a new razor I bought and it works better than a beard trimmer I have.</li>
            <li> I had some other trimmers that did not adjust as well as these. The adjustments on this Norelco Styler lets met get a little closer for a neater look. The styler is better than the other two I have owned and it was a really worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> Works better than the built in trimmer. Plus adjustable trim length.</li>
            <li> By far one of the best purchases I have made in 2014! About halfway through the year I decided to start growing a beard. I had been using a cheap pen trimmer to keep the beard in check until I got curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my razor about two years ago and have gotten several advertisements for this particular add-on and never decided to act upon it. With a beard, I thought it would be the perfect investment. Turns out, I was right! It offers five (count em, FIVE) different height adjustments and a sixth, super-secret, no clip mode (OK, it is the blade without a guard, but it sounds cooler to say secret).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trims hair very well, and very easy to switch out for the shaver attachment. To boot, it functions better at trimming down edges than the trimmer that was originally provided with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that the guard has a gap in it with sharp plastic on each edge and that there is no easy way to angle it to shave properly. If one angles the trimmer against the grain, a very short cut will result. With the grain, a longer cut results. All it means is that it takes some time to get a consistent cut in place.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, cleans up fast. it does a better job than a specialized shaver. I like using it weekly.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I do not give it 5 stars, because I have not tried any other product.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had a Norelco 2D SensoTouch for 2 years that the trimmer piece is separate from the shaver. The shaver is great, and I was very happy but my trimmer piece broke. I thought about just getting another shaver but ended up finding this click onstyler. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was what I wanted but it has exceeded my expectations. The motor in it is much stronger than the original trimmer and its a lot quicker to cut off the hair. Also the different levels of trim is excellent - I can clean up my sideburns efficiently and quickly. More than exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> My initial purchase did not come with this attachment so I was glad to find it on Amazon sold individually.  The attachment is easy to use and works very well.  I recommend this styler for anyone who has this Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> really nice attachment for the razor</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent for trimming everything nice and neatly to bad it wasn&#x27;t included when I first purchased my razor...better late then never though I guess !!!</li>
            <li> awesome add-on component - my only concern after a month is that the plastic guard they provide is like to break, I am still using the cheaper edge tool because I am avoiding taking off and placing on that flimsy plastic depth guard.  Wish it were made of a more pliable form of plastic - great pick up regardless</li>
            <li> I now have one device that does all and can retire my old beard trimmer which was also a Norelco.</li>
            <li> be advised this is not some cheap clipper attachment - it is sharp and works as described.  It will cut the hair you put in front of it - even if you make a mistake.  So take care and be fully awake when using it.</li>
            <li> Product worked for a little while then stopped all together and I hardly used it.</li>
            <li> This clipper is well made and gives very accurate control of beard length.</li>
            <li> Great product for traveling and only having to carry one device</li>
            <li> Really like this attachment</li>
            <li> Good addition to Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in order to simplify the number of shaving components I have. In that respect, it is successful. It also passes the functionality test; it does trim my beard. However, it&#x27;s moderately uncomfortable to use. The clear plastic guard is just sharp enough to irritate my skin when I use it; I made sure to give it the recommended month for my skin to get used to it, to no avail. Additionally, the &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; that come with it leave much to be desired. It doesn&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s waterproof (my tests suggest it is, though I am not certain) or provide any guidance around cleaning or general usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, for less than the price of this add-on, you can get a stand alone trimmer that is far more comfortable to use and functional, such as the Phillips Norelco G370. I&#x27;ve had it for a few years and will be switching back.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well on thick hair. It&#x27;s perfect for lighter jobs.</li>
            <li> love this attachment, eliminated the need for me to have another clipper, like the setting it has, can be used on many things.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about ordering this product since I already have plenty of trimming tools.  So I just ordered it just to have it and not really use it unless I had to travel.  I have the 9700 series shaver and this works better than my Wahl trimmer.  Not to mention my trimmer just broke so now I will be using this to edge up around the back of my neck.  I am glad that I made this purchase.  I am just waiting for Philips to release the face cleaner attachment.  According to the warrant department of Philip Norelco products one is already out for the market but is not compatible for U.S. products.</li>
            <li> cuts greats, love how it adjusts, and this one can easily be cleaned out, this also feels alot better quality than what came with the buzzer</li>
            <li> Not as decribed . It was only the attachment.</li>
            <li> I was interested to see if they have made it better than the small tooth one on the shaver.  No,  they did not! I will still be using my Oster clipper for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The teeth  on this are just too small.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Great addition to razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent for trimming your beard!  Truly professional cut!</li>
            <li> I used to carry a trimmer and a razor.  Now this little attachment I get the same results with less weight.</li>
            <li> works great and has lots of hair length settings for hear height. works like it says it does and came in new like it said and fast A.</li>
            <li> got very quickly in perfect shape...Works fine...</li>
            <li> You may need to adjust the cutting blade with a small alan wrench to achieve a closer trim.  For the money it&#x27;s a good.</li>
            <li> The quality of this attachment is very high, and snaps right on my Sensotouch. The height of the guard is adjusted by a little black slider on the bottom. My only gripe is that I wanted something that could style my medium-length beard and the guard doesn&#x27;t come out far enough to do that.</li>
            <li> Seems like the blades do not trim the hair very well when using the guard, but other than that seems like a well designed device.</li>
            <li> Bought this to attach to the 2D works as said does a close shave and makes desired length easy to do</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised. I usually use a No. 2 or 3 beard trimmer and this styler delivered.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Cuts the hair and does not pull the hair, so it is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;it gets petty close to the difficult right-under-your-nose area.&lt;br /&gt;Fits well with the shaver body.&lt;br /&gt;The 5 adjustments work well, sometimes I&#x27;ll &#x27;mow the grass’, then think a bit shorter would be better; I go back over the beard. I can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The comb does a good job of pulling the whiskers up to the blades; I only have to go over the same place a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;Hey, its twenty bucks!&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Drains the shaver battery much more quickly than the three-headed shaver attachment. Even so, I still get a million shaves out of one charge.&lt;br /&gt;It could have come with a little protective case.&lt;br /&gt;It probably is not fair to mention what has not happened, or may not happen, but the comb part does not look like it will last as long as I would like. It slides closer-further from the blades to adjust beard length and you have to slide it off for a more thorough cleaning. Not to catastrophise here, but it looks a little vulnerable, both when in use and when traveling.</li>
