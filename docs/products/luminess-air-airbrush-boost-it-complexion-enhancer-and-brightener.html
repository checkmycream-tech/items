            <li>Definitely not for mature skin.</li>
            <li>and I have a hard time understanding how this product would be useful for women with darker skin.  </li>

            <li> Packaging sucks for this make up!  I spent a lot of money on the make up only to find it does not travel well.  It bursts and emptys completely from its cheep plastic container when flying or just moving it around in my bag. The caps popped off easily and it drained completely empty, into and all over, the inside of my bag. I will keep the mechanical parts (compressor) but will look for a more durable packaged makeup.  Im very disappointed in the durability of the make up containers.</li>
            <li> Great product, light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Pretty color but the top/tip of bottle broke off into the cap, makes absolutely no sense....no way to repair it. Very poor design, has never happened with any of my other brands. I lost the entire bottle. I can&#x27;t in good judgment ever spend the money on another one.</li>
            <li> Received it quicker than expected. Was better than expected. I tried it the very first day I got it and I could tell the difference immediately. Great product worth every nickel,m</li>
            <li> I used this for a week before writing this,because i wanted a fair review but I must say I really can&#x27;t tell the difference with or without it for me I don&#x27;t think I would buy again but it&#x27;s for everyone to try for them self because everyone has a different opinion I hope this is helpful</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews were so good. Really I saw no difference in how my airbrush makeup looked on my face. Nothing. Now this is two products I have purchased from Luminess and I haven&#x27;t been happy with either of them.</li>
            <li> I use this before every application of Luminess makeup. It does help hide imperfections and gives a refreshing feeling to your skin. There&#x27;s no sticky residue but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t come out the stylus smooth like the makeup. The mist can spudded a little but it doesn&#x27;t show on the skin. I use Luminess products and I&#x27;m a huge fan of their products so far. Been using it for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Luminess Air will stick you with a monthly recurring charge (their monthly club membership) that is difficult to stop and impossible to reverse charges (even on credit cards). The notification that you have incurred this monthly fee is hidden and hard to spot in the order process. DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes your face feel good and you can use it just for a little glow.</li>
            <li> the product is thin and works great in my air brush machine. It seems to give a great base for my makeup</li>
            <li> I have learned to put it on first, then put on your eye make up as well as your blush, then add your glam air make up and it looks great.</li>
            <li> the product was received on time works great to get the skin feeling soft and silky. good product b/4 using the luminess liquid makeup</li>
            <li> I use this product with my airbrush machine after putting on sunscreen.  I usually water it down a bit.  It helps lessen the look of dark imperfections.  After it dries I use water-based airbrush foundations over it.  Sometimes I use a concealer before using the boost it.  I have olive skin and I have a hard time understanding how this product would be useful for women with darker skin.  It says on the bottle that it&#x27;s for all skin tones and hues, but I just don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible.  One reviewer said it made her pores and wrinkles look more pronounced.  I think this is true of most makeup.  The older we get the less we  should use, really.  But using water-based materials and adding water to them has helped me find a medium with airbrush.  I also think that if you&#x27;re caking the stuff on really thick this is inevitable.  As with any makeup, if your goal is to look perfect you should probably invest in a psychologist instead of in this product.  Good luck to you!</li>
            <li> OMG this is gross to use. Very sticky....it feels gross wearing it. It never tried and it highlighted any pores and every little peach fuzz, esp around you r eyebrow and sideburns areas. Being that it is so stick it was extremely hard to wash off. Sucks that I wasted my money on something I will never use again and the one time it had to be washed off...a few times.</li>
            <li> Great with my Luminess system.</li>
            <li> Nice base for all skin types</li>
            <li> Love this product so much, however, the bottle that the company uses for this product is not the best. This is the second one i have that the neck of the bottle cracked and it leaked all over. Thought it was just coincidence w first bottle, thays why i ordered this, but same thing happened and it leaked all over. It happened w their airbrush make up bottles too. Prob needs to be stored uoright only, which can be a pain to keep that way.</li>
            <li> Cannot tell anything when I apply 2 my face</li>
            <li> If I am in a hurry and need something within 2 days, I always buy on Amazon.  The lumpiness products are very good and I continue to buy over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some women do not give the airless sprayer enough time.  If you take your time, use the product and machine as shown and stated in the booklet, then your makeup will look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten many many comments in the past year about my makeup and my skin is beautiful.</li>
            <li> This Luminess Air Boost It Really DOES boost your face!  Makes it look brighter and younger (in my case.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Luminess and Amazon!</li>
            <li> This does nothing for me, I am really disappointed. I will not rebuy again.</li>
            <li> Like spraying glitter all over your face</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype. This product made my pores and aging skin look worse. Instead of obscuring lines and wrinkles, it highlighted them. It added a sheen that attracts the light to the very places you want to blur. Maybe if you are young and have perfect skin, this would be useful to give you a glow. Definitely not for mature skin.</li>
            <li> It gives a highlight to the skin and is best used along with moisturizer, it can be drying without. It keeps my shininess at bay all day long. Make sure to shake before using.</li>
