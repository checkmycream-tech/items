            <li> I have to say I am not exactly big on the smell.  It&#x27;s kind of strong and almost a floral smell.  I usually prefer a clean, fresh smell.  With that being said, my face feels very clean, and fresh.  It almost leaves your face tingling.  It&#x27;s not drying, but just clean. I will put the smell aside, and purchase again</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin people need to beware that Avani products are not for sensitive skin unless you like rashes and breakouts! Highly fragranced also, so not good for allergies.</li>
            <li> Love all the Avani products!</li>
            <li> The price is so much cheaper on Amazon than any spa or cosmetic store. Always check before purchasing elsewhere! The Avani products are unbelievable. You will see significant changes. I use to use Image C until I saw a significant change on my friends face. I&lt;br /&gt;switched immediately.</li>
            <li> I am older and use all Avani products. They make ones face appear youthful. This toner is a great cleanser!</li>
            <li> Great, would buy again. Love this product line.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner, it cleanses my skin but is so gentle, my skin does not feel tight or taut like it felt with other toners.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good line.  They do not test on animals for a start.  The products work.  I have used this and it is refreshing.  I use it in the morning instead of washing my face again.  That dries my skin too much.  It dries quickly and I reapply the serum and moisturizer and am ready to go.  My skin looks good.  People ask me where my wrinkles are - I am 68 and people are surprised.</li>
            <li> Great toner with vitamins and natural herbs</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few days,but have loved all the other products.I love the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> A very good product. It feels very refreshing when I clean my face and use it. I have noticed a little toning in my face but not alot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in Hawaii,  wonderful on the facial skin, leaves a refreshing smoothness, moisturized feel.  Soothed two facial breakouts.</li>
