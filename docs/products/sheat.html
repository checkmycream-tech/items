            <li>I&#x27;ve tried (and loved) argan and maracuja for my middle-aged skin (yikes!</li>
            <li>Feels good and nourishing when i apply it day and night!</li>
            <li>I prefer this oil for my face compared to others I&#x27;ve used -- jojoba is great for eye makeup removal and argan I prefer for my hair).  </li>
            <li>Even though i have an olive completion the oil itself is great ladies.</li>
            <li>Feels great, not greasy.</li>
            <li>This has anti-inflammatory capabilities which works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great price as well as I&#x27;ve seen marula oil sold for upwards of $40.</li>
            <li>A very nice multi-purpose oil for face, body and hair.</li>
            <li>Very good oil for your face keeps it nice and moisturized with out feeling greasy</li>
            <li>I had already tried their argan oil, which is also excellent, and this one may be even better at moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li>And nice fragrance too!</li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>this oil has the most delicious roasted coffee bean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Is this good for acne sufferers?</li>
            <li>wear a ton of makeup to look like you have good skin, just have good skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Everything else is good</li>
            <li>Just as good as the name brand marula oil that sells for $60.</li>
            <li>A good product, will keep using.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with how it makes my skin feel and look.  </li>
            <li>(Do your own research on that).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li>Really pleased!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am in love!</li>
            <li>The odor evaporates within a minute or two, so those with sensitivities don&#x27;t need to worry about the smell lingering, but it is lovely while it lasts!</li>
            <li>It is best to apply after first applying a toner, a cream, or any kind of a water-based product.  </li>
            <li>It works great reducing fine lines</li>
            <li>This oil has very strong toning properties, and it is now on the very top of my list of oils, and I have tried probably 90% of all the oils used in cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really amazing.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Great opportunity for trying something that isn&#x27;t available everywhere</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I can detect no fragrance, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Thanks to everyone who wrote great reviews and convinced me to try!</li>
            <li>For the price this is a nice oil.</li>
            <li>Nice oil but no impact</li>
            <li>The $78 Marula oil smelled nice and reminded me of a spa.</li>
            <li>I had received a sample of the Leaky Collection Marula oil and loved it but didn&#x27;t love the price.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and light oil clearned up my skin and</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, if not the best I&#x27;ve ever used for my severely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Its still a wonderful natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I own a lot of carrier oils, and I&#x27;m always looking for more to purchase and try.</li>
            <li>It soaks right into your skin and feels great.</li>
            <li>Best face moisturizer I&#x27;ve been able to find so far.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad oil, or a good one.</li>
            <li>seem to have is the scent, but it&#x27;s a very light, nutty smell that becomes unnoticeable after 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slap</li>
            <li>The oil is also very light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>What is good is that it acts quickly, and that is what made it on my top list.  </li>
            <li>glad i ran across this while just killing time on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>not one product has ever left my skin feeling and looking as wonderful as this product has!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like this better than argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I love using marula oil on my skin.</li>
            <li>it does much better than if I try to do it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this oil ..</li>
            <li>I recommend this oil for its many uses, but if you&#x27;re looking exclusively for your face, I would buy</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it better than argon or almond oil, so will not buy again.</li>
            <li>Using beauty oils makes my skin a better &amp;#34;blank</li>
            <li>in all I LOVE Shea Terra&#x27;s Marula Oil and will stick with it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this feels.</li>
            <li>Love the oil, use it all the time</li>
            <li>While it is more cost effective, it is not silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love love love it.</li>
            <li>but the price is SO much more extravagant than this one.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>, I saved the best for last...</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>and I also enjoyed the smell more.  </li>
            <li>but it feel better.</li>
            <li>My skin is so bright, smooth, fades scars well, highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, nice oil, absorbs quickly without greasy residue.</li>
            <li>one of the richest oils I have ever used, and unlike many oils, it actually absorbed quite nicely into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Great product.... lightweight and nearly odorless</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I repurchased .</li>
            <li>My conscience wants me to because it&#x27;s Fair Trade and sustainably harvested, but my wallet cries at the thought of spending $78 on body</li>
            <li>So, this one has to do for now until I get rich and famous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been applying it more recently to my neck with great results.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice light oil and is absorbed easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45, so this is to address fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It helps with the aging process to decrease the fine lines</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it doesn&#x27;t hang around for very long anyway, which is the case with most Shea Terra products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>The oil is light</li>
            <li>If I go out at night I wipe it off, but most of it seems to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>It is a great deal since other companies sell it for much more..</li>
            <li>on my second bottle, absolutely fantastic stuff!!!</li>
            <li>I find the Marula oil to be very light, absorbing easily.</li>
            <li>Since using the Marula oil, I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement.</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending your product in a timely manner,  I&#x27;m excited to use your product.</li>
            <li>I found the Shea Terra product on Amazon for a much more reasonable price-$17!</li>
            <li>This oil works great on dry flaky skin and is a cottage industry for women in Africa.</li>
            <li>Love it and it has been helpful in keeping the youthful skin for a sun worshiper older woman!</li>
            <li>So far I am loving this product.</li>
            <li>They are chock full of chemicals and silicone</li>
            <li>But you have to use it daily before bed to get good results.</li>
            <li>and while I read much about the wonderful properties of Marula Oil before I gave it a try, I could never find out how much Marula Oil was actually in the product</li>
            <li>Somehow, it really smooths the skin and makes it more resilient.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think it is a good product for the price</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin !!</li>
            <li>First of all, it is in no way, greasy, my skin absorbs it right away and feel more like it has been nourished and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>unlike the original MOs I tried which were golden in color).  </li>
            <li>and i find that it absorbs quickly and soothes, hydrates, and protects my skin...</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>problem I&#x27;ve found with maracuja oil (besides the pricetag) was that it went rancid quickly.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do much either; was rather happy since the price ($78/bottle) was not financially viable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and has no noticeable odor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a nutty scent but dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is good for dry spots on hands and feet but not anything really special.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenser is also nice, and I don&#x27;t really detect any particular odor.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a new product on one of my favorite websites, and just had to try it.</li>
            <li>This product is absorbed quickly into the skin and, after two weeks of using it, I have seen an improvement in my skin, specifically in texture.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s very light, almost clear ...</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ll say this product does not absorb as nicely as the more refined version that&#x27;s a higher price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always amazing when a product actually does what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out face oils and having some success with them.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not greasy or shiny once absorbed, I sometimes use it in the morning as a moisturizer under my sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any odor, and my skin just drinks it up and it leaves me looking fresh and dewy.  </li>
            <li>I felt like the Leaky oil absorbed faster</li>
            <li>It is so nice to finally have hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes might appear a bit more hydrated, but I am fortunate to have good skin to begin with so any changes would not be dramatic.  </li>
            <li>This product also is a a good price here, compared to other companies that sell it.</li>
            <li>Use it faithfully before bed and the product just absorbs right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use another moisturizer again.you can see rey right away.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and my skin loves it.  </li>
            <li>My skin soaks it right up.</li>
            <li>It is very nice, absorbs easily no smell; you can add to your moisturizer to use it.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin baby butt smooth, has helped clear up any minor breakouts I&#x27;ve had and most importantly, didn&#x27;t break me out or make me oily.</li>
            <li>I add a few drops to my moisturizer every night and it makes my skin feel sooo much more moisturized, smoother, and more supple.</li>
            <li>and on top of all that, Shea terra is very active in sustainable sourcing, fair trade, and providing a better life for the communities that help produce/grow/harvest the raw ingredients.</li>
            <li>originally used a much more expensive brand, but now that i have tried this, i will continue with it; very pleased</li>
            <li>skin is really wash and wear, and a little abused by most people&#x27;s standards I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>I only put it on at night as I wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply makeup over this.</li>
            <li>(yes, I know it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34;) but still.  </li>
            <li>My experience with beauty oils is pretty varied.  </li>
            <li>and I was definitely willing to try it, based on pricetag and organic, cold-pressed ingredient alone.  </li>
            <li>Along with so many others, I sampled the Marula oil from a different manufacturer who wanted to sell it at a much higher price, and then found this.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I believe my skin looks better especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The oil is light, and odorless, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything that shea butter, almond oil, avocado oil, and many other oils are capable of doing.</li>
            <li>The scent is so light it&#x27;s barely detectable and dissipates in about 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>i like how quickly the oil soaks into my face and how soft it leaves it; just wish that there was a nicer smell</li>
            <li>Many uses for your dry skin.</li>
            <li>product is just what it says, 100% pure marula oil.</li>
            <li>I too got this in lieu of the Leaky Collection&#x27;s Pure Marula Oil.</li>
            <li>and it is a fairly large bottle.</li>
            <li>I was told Marula oil is a wonder, but I did not see much of a difference in my hair than Argain oil.&lt;br /&gt;For the face and body is probably comparable to shea butter, but way refined.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t sink in my skin as much</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell too much difference with it.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this oil.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my hands during the winter months when my skin is at the absolute driest.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have any real scent to it.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and it took much longer to absorb than its competitor.</li>
            <li>I run and workout in the elements six days a week, and pretty much wear full makeup only when I need to.  </li>
            <li>; so that when I do wear my makeup, it looks that much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I heard that your neck tells your real age, so if you can erase time there...</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s all you really need.</li>
            <li>and this really helps keep my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lighter oil than argan, absorbs much quicker.</li>
            <li>Both oils have really helped me heal.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very moist.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit much for me under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to Marula Oil (another brand that is quite popular) a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>For my face, I use a few drops, warm it in my hands and press to the skin.</li>
            <li>but it feels good to use a natural product after submitting my skin to retinoids and bleaching creams (all prescription) everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I knew in advance through other reviews that this was oily.</li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed using this oil as a daily facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Made my face soft and supple plus softened my tiny fine lines</li>
            <li>First, understand that I am caucasian and although I am 54 years old my skin is in decent shape</li>
            <li>it worked instantly to smooth my dry skin, where this product has not done that yet.</li>
            <li>I use this oil mainly around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I said it...) and found that I prefer beauty oils to moisturizers and creams to keep my skin looking healthy and much younger than its chronological age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only gripe is that the sample I got from my Birchbox was by a different brand (The Leakey Collection Marula) and I think it smelled better than this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>AND I knew I was sensitive to many of the other oils in the blend.  </li>
            <li>I tried the version they sell at Sephora and thought I better find a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied all over dry patches as soon as this arrived - and immediately her skin became very itchy, red and broke out in hives all over.</li>
            <li>I imagine I will use it more all over when my skin gets a little drier.</li>
            <li>I just wish it were a little more refined.</li>
            <li>I love doing everything with fewer products and this little miracle helps me knock a ton off my list at once.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s suitable for daily use unless your skin is very dry, but using it once or twice a week is balancing my skin</li>
            <li>It stays in your skin, not on and really makes it soft.  </li>
            <li>Now the whole family uses it on our sensitive skin instead of lotion or moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried have been kind of thick.</li>
            <li>Compared to other expensive facial oils, this is a great deal, I love that it is 100% pure.</li>
            <li>For supple skin you only need a couple drops to spread around and it soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good moisturizer, but a little on the heavy side</li>
            <li>love the feel, the natural coffee scent and of course, the results!&lt;br /&gt;it contains no additives, as it&#x27;s far more expensive competitor does.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a little more natural with my routine.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of Marula oil from another company and I liked it a lot, however the price for a very small bottle was $78.</li>
            <li>One application at night and my skin is like new in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>this oil is very light, doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor like some other oils I&#x27;ve used (hemp seed oil works great but smells hideous) and in a pinch one pump will moisturize your hands like they have never been moisturized before.</li>
            <li>It has helped my dry skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>So I mean it&#x27;s not a BAD smell, per se, but not as nice as the other brand.</li>
            <li>Had originally run across a much more expensive brand and after reading up on the marula oil decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel really soft!  </li>
            <li>Seriously cannot say enough good things about this</li>
            <li>- Rose Hips Black Soap Deep Pore Facial Wash &amp; Mask.</li>
            <li>I also use their Rose Hips Black Soap Deep Pore Facial Wash &amp; Mask.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed and improvements in my skin after using the product for nearly a year.</li>
            <li>I noticed no irritation when using this product, but it irritates my sister&#x27;s skin, so it is trial and error as far as that goes.</li>
            <li>Organic, 100% natural, no fillers.</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>She said that Dr Oz recommended it as a natural antifungal.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>People have told me that they thought i was in my early 40S.  </li>
            <li>but it is all natural</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural marula oil.</li>
            <li>When I wake up, my face is still soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I ordered it directly from the Shea Terra Organics website.  </li>
            <li>, my mature skin drinks it up.</li>
            <li>Once the oil finally is absorbed your skin feels very soft, but if you have oily skin it will never get absorbed enough to not feel like an oil slick on your face.</li>
            <li>so I researched a little further and learned that the particular Marula Oil product was actually a blend of many oils, not just Marula Oil ...</li>
            <li>use this right after a shower, and often not just on my face but on any other areas that need help to retain moisture.</li>
            <li>I like this product so far, but I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 weeks, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it will be long term, thus only 4 stars for now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that it absorbs into your skin as quickly as the more expensive product although when i apply it at night by morning my skin is dry and non-oily.</li>
            <li>A friend ordered some for me after I suffered a bad burn on my fingertips, and it worked great to heal the skin and minimize scarring.</li>
            <li>Even just after one use, you can feel the difference, if you are sensitive enough to the changes in your skin.  </li>
            <li>No need to buy expensive oil from other companies, this stuff is pure Marula oil with no fillers and is amazing on your skin or hair.</li>
            <li>We live in a northern climate and it&#x27;s extremely dry in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and don&#x27;t want to get wrinkly early!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white, 36 and have normal to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes without being greasy, totally natural, affordable - one bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Feels good and nourishing when i apply it day and night!</li>
            <li> I prefer this oil for my face compared to others I&#x27;ve used -- jojoba is great for eye makeup removal and argan I prefer for my hair).  </li>
            <li> Even though i have an olive completion the oil itself is great ladies.</li>
            <li> Feels great, not greasy.</li>
            <li> This has anti-inflammatory capabilities which works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great price as well as I&#x27;ve seen marula oil sold for upwards of $40.</li>
            <li> A very nice multi-purpose oil for face, body and hair.</li>
            <li> Very good oil for your face keeps it nice and moisturized with out feeling greasy</li>
            <li> I had already tried their argan oil, which is also excellent, and this one may be even better at moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li> And nice fragrance too!</li>
            <li> Nice product!</li>
            <li> this oil has the most delicious roasted coffee bean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Is this good for acne sufferers?</li>
            <li> wear a ton of makeup to look like you have good skin, just have good skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Everything else is good</li>
            <li> Just as good as the name brand marula oil that sells for $60.</li>
            <li> A good product, will keep using.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with how it makes my skin feel and look.  </li>
            <li> (Do your own research on that).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li> Really pleased!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am in love!</li>
            <li> The odor evaporates within a minute or two, so those with sensitivities don&#x27;t need to worry about the smell lingering, but it is lovely while it lasts!</li>
            <li> It is best to apply after first applying a toner, a cream, or any kind of a water-based product.  </li>
            <li> It works great reducing fine lines</li>
            <li> This oil has very strong toning properties, and it is now on the very top of my list of oils, and I have tried probably 90% of all the oils used in cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really amazing.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Great opportunity for trying something that isn&#x27;t available everywhere</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I can detect no fragrance, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Thanks to everyone who wrote great reviews and convinced me to try!</li>
            <li> For the price this is a nice oil.</li>
            <li> Nice oil but no impact</li>
            <li> The $78 Marula oil smelled nice and reminded me of a spa.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of the Leaky Collection Marula oil and loved it but didn&#x27;t love the price.  </li>
            <li> Very nice and light oil clearned up my skin and</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, if not the best I&#x27;ve ever used for my severely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Its still a wonderful natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of carrier oils, and I&#x27;m always looking for more to purchase and try.</li>
            <li> It soaks right into your skin and feels great.</li>
            <li> Best face moisturizer I&#x27;ve been able to find so far.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad oil, or a good one.</li>
            <li> seem to have is the scent, but it&#x27;s a very light, nutty smell that becomes unnoticeable after 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slap</li>
            <li> The oil is also very light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> What is good is that it acts quickly, and that is what made it on my top list.  </li>
            <li> glad i ran across this while just killing time on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> not one product has ever left my skin feeling and looking as wonderful as this product has!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like this better than argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I love using marula oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> it does much better than if I try to do it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this oil ..</li>
            <li> I recommend this oil for its many uses, but if you&#x27;re looking exclusively for your face, I would buy</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it better than argon or almond oil, so will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Using beauty oils makes my skin a better &amp;#34;blank</li>
            <li> in all I LOVE Shea Terra&#x27;s Marula Oil and will stick with it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this feels.</li>
            <li> Love the oil, use it all the time</li>
            <li> While it is more cost effective, it is not silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love love love it.</li>
            <li> but the price is SO much more extravagant than this one.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> , I saved the best for last...</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> and I also enjoyed the smell more.  </li>
            <li> but it feel better.</li>
            <li> My skin is so bright, smooth, fades scars well, highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, nice oil, absorbs quickly without greasy residue.</li>
            <li> one of the richest oils I have ever used, and unlike many oils, it actually absorbed quite nicely into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Great product.... lightweight and nearly odorless</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I repurchased .</li>
            <li> My conscience wants me to because it&#x27;s Fair Trade and sustainably harvested, but my wallet cries at the thought of spending $78 on body</li>
            <li> So, this one has to do for now until I get rich and famous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been applying it more recently to my neck with great results.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice light oil and is absorbed easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45, so this is to address fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It helps with the aging process to decrease the fine lines</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it doesn&#x27;t hang around for very long anyway, which is the case with most Shea Terra products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> The oil is light</li>
            <li> If I go out at night I wipe it off, but most of it seems to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> It is a great deal since other companies sell it for much more..</li>
            <li> on my second bottle, absolutely fantastic stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I find the Marula oil to be very light, absorbing easily.</li>
            <li> Since using the Marula oil, I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending your product in a timely manner,  I&#x27;m excited to use your product.</li>
            <li> I found the Shea Terra product on Amazon for a much more reasonable price-$17!</li>
            <li> This oil works great on dry flaky skin and is a cottage industry for women in Africa.</li>
            <li> Love it and it has been helpful in keeping the youthful skin for a sun worshiper older woman!</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this product.</li>
            <li> They are chock full of chemicals and silicone</li>
            <li> But you have to use it daily before bed to get good results.</li>
            <li> and while I read much about the wonderful properties of Marula Oil before I gave it a try, I could never find out how much Marula Oil was actually in the product</li>
            <li> Somehow, it really smooths the skin and makes it more resilient.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think it is a good product for the price</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin !!</li>
            <li> First of all, it is in no way, greasy, my skin absorbs it right away and feel more like it has been nourished and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> unlike the original MOs I tried which were golden in color).  </li>
            <li> and i find that it absorbs quickly and soothes, hydrates, and protects my skin...</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> problem I&#x27;ve found with maracuja oil (besides the pricetag) was that it went rancid quickly.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do much either; was rather happy since the price ($78/bottle) was not financially viable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and has no noticeable odor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a nutty scent but dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is good for dry spots on hands and feet but not anything really special.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser is also nice, and I don&#x27;t really detect any particular odor.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a new product on one of my favorite websites, and just had to try it.</li>
            <li> This product is absorbed quickly into the skin and, after two weeks of using it, I have seen an improvement in my skin, specifically in texture.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s very light, almost clear ...</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ll say this product does not absorb as nicely as the more refined version that&#x27;s a higher price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always amazing when a product actually does what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out face oils and having some success with them.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not greasy or shiny once absorbed, I sometimes use it in the morning as a moisturizer under my sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any odor, and my skin just drinks it up and it leaves me looking fresh and dewy.  </li>
            <li> I felt like the Leaky oil absorbed faster</li>
            <li> It is so nice to finally have hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes might appear a bit more hydrated, but I am fortunate to have good skin to begin with so any changes would not be dramatic.  </li>
            <li> This product also is a a good price here, compared to other companies that sell it.</li>
            <li> Use it faithfully before bed and the product just absorbs right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use another moisturizer again.you can see rey right away.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in and my skin loves it.  </li>
            <li> My skin soaks it right up.</li>
            <li> It is very nice, absorbs easily no smell; you can add to your moisturizer to use it.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin baby butt smooth, has helped clear up any minor breakouts I&#x27;ve had and most importantly, didn&#x27;t break me out or make me oily.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my moisturizer every night and it makes my skin feel sooo much more moisturized, smoother, and more supple.</li>
            <li> and on top of all that, Shea terra is very active in sustainable sourcing, fair trade, and providing a better life for the communities that help produce/grow/harvest the raw ingredients.</li>
            <li> originally used a much more expensive brand, but now that i have tried this, i will continue with it; very pleased</li>
            <li> skin is really wash and wear, and a little abused by most people&#x27;s standards I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li> I only put it on at night as I wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply makeup over this.</li>
            <li> (yes, I know it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34;) but still.  </li>
            <li> My experience with beauty oils is pretty varied.  </li>
            <li> and I was definitely willing to try it, based on pricetag and organic, cold-pressed ingredient alone.  </li>
            <li> Along with so many others, I sampled the Marula oil from a different manufacturer who wanted to sell it at a much higher price, and then found this.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and fresh.</li>
            <li> and I believe my skin looks better especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The oil is light, and odorless, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything that shea butter, almond oil, avocado oil, and many other oils are capable of doing.</li>
            <li> The scent is so light it&#x27;s barely detectable and dissipates in about 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> i like how quickly the oil soaks into my face and how soft it leaves it; just wish that there was a nicer smell</li>
            <li> Many uses for your dry skin.</li>
            <li> product is just what it says, 100% pure marula oil.</li>
            <li> I too got this in lieu of the Leaky Collection&#x27;s Pure Marula Oil.</li>
            <li> and it is a fairly large bottle.</li>
            <li> I was told Marula oil is a wonder, but I did not see much of a difference in my hair than Argain oil.&lt;br /&gt;For the face and body is probably comparable to shea butter, but way refined.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sink in my skin as much</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell too much difference with it.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this oil.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my hands during the winter months when my skin is at the absolute driest.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have any real scent to it.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and it took much longer to absorb than its competitor.</li>
            <li> I run and workout in the elements six days a week, and pretty much wear full makeup only when I need to.  </li>
            <li> ; so that when I do wear my makeup, it looks that much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I heard that your neck tells your real age, so if you can erase time there...</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s all you really need.</li>
            <li> and this really helps keep my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lighter oil than argan, absorbs much quicker.</li>
            <li> Both oils have really helped me heal.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very moist.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit much for me under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to Marula Oil (another brand that is quite popular) a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> For my face, I use a few drops, warm it in my hands and press to the skin.</li>
            <li> but it feels good to use a natural product after submitting my skin to retinoids and bleaching creams (all prescription) everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I knew in advance through other reviews that this was oily.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed using this oil as a daily facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Made my face soft and supple plus softened my tiny fine lines</li>
            <li> First, understand that I am caucasian and although I am 54 years old my skin is in decent shape</li>
            <li> it worked instantly to smooth my dry skin, where this product has not done that yet.</li>
            <li> I use this oil mainly around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I said it...) and found that I prefer beauty oils to moisturizers and creams to keep my skin looking healthy and much younger than its chronological age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only gripe is that the sample I got from my Birchbox was by a different brand (The Leakey Collection Marula) and I think it smelled better than this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> AND I knew I was sensitive to many of the other oils in the blend.  </li>
            <li> I tried the version they sell at Sephora and thought I better find a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied all over dry patches as soon as this arrived - and immediately her skin became very itchy, red and broke out in hives all over.</li>
            <li> I imagine I will use it more all over when my skin gets a little drier.</li>
            <li> I just wish it were a little more refined.</li>
            <li> I love doing everything with fewer products and this little miracle helps me knock a ton off my list at once.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s suitable for daily use unless your skin is very dry, but using it once or twice a week is balancing my skin</li>
            <li> It stays in your skin, not on and really makes it soft.  </li>
            <li> Now the whole family uses it on our sensitive skin instead of lotion or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried have been kind of thick.</li>
            <li> Compared to other expensive facial oils, this is a great deal, I love that it is 100% pure.</li>
            <li> For supple skin you only need a couple drops to spread around and it soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good moisturizer, but a little on the heavy side</li>
            <li> love the feel, the natural coffee scent and of course, the results!&lt;br /&gt;it contains no additives, as it&#x27;s far more expensive competitor does.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little more natural with my routine.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of Marula oil from another company and I liked it a lot, however the price for a very small bottle was $78.</li>
            <li> One application at night and my skin is like new in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> this oil is very light, doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor like some other oils I&#x27;ve used (hemp seed oil works great but smells hideous) and in a pinch one pump will moisturize your hands like they have never been moisturized before.</li>
            <li> It has helped my dry skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> So I mean it&#x27;s not a BAD smell, per se, but not as nice as the other brand.</li>
            <li> Had originally run across a much more expensive brand and after reading up on the marula oil decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face feel really soft!  </li>
            <li> Seriously cannot say enough good things about this</li>
            <li> - Rose Hips Black Soap Deep Pore Facial Wash &amp; Mask.</li>
            <li> I also use their Rose Hips Black Soap Deep Pore Facial Wash &amp; Mask.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed and improvements in my skin after using the product for nearly a year.</li>
            <li> I noticed no irritation when using this product, but it irritates my sister&#x27;s skin, so it is trial and error as far as that goes.</li>
            <li> Organic, 100% natural, no fillers.</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> She said that Dr Oz recommended it as a natural antifungal.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> People have told me that they thought i was in my early 40S.  </li>
            <li> but it is all natural</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% natural marula oil.</li>
            <li> When I wake up, my face is still soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I ordered it directly from the Shea Terra Organics website.  </li>
            <li> , my mature skin drinks it up.</li>
            <li> Once the oil finally is absorbed your skin feels very soft, but if you have oily skin it will never get absorbed enough to not feel like an oil slick on your face.</li>
            <li> so I researched a little further and learned that the particular Marula Oil product was actually a blend of many oils, not just Marula Oil ...</li>
            <li> use this right after a shower, and often not just on my face but on any other areas that need help to retain moisture.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far, but I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 weeks, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it will be long term, thus only 4 stars for now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it absorbs into your skin as quickly as the more expensive product although when i apply it at night by morning my skin is dry and non-oily.</li>
            <li> A friend ordered some for me after I suffered a bad burn on my fingertips, and it worked great to heal the skin and minimize scarring.</li>
            <li> Even just after one use, you can feel the difference, if you are sensitive enough to the changes in your skin.  </li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive oil from other companies, this stuff is pure Marula oil with no fillers and is amazing on your skin or hair.</li>
            <li> We live in a northern climate and it&#x27;s extremely dry in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and don&#x27;t want to get wrinkly early!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white, 36 and have normal to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes without being greasy, totally natural, affordable - one bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I started using this around my eyes because I have a problem with sensitive skin around my eyes and have to be very careful.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty bad like other reviewers said, but I knew it would be since this is authentic oil with no additives.</li>
            <li> It last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Too old to care about looking half my age-</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely a much better value than some of the other expensive brands, which are not even 100% marula oil.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I use on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This has to be applied several minutes (up to a half hour) prior to applying anything else on your face.</li>
            <li> Recently bought a similar product half the size, twice the price.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts for a very long time, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> Worked well on dry elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li> If applied on dry skin, the benefits will be diminished.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my face and mix it with my body lotion for generally dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is typically dry.</li>
            <li> I have really, really dry dehydrated skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various facial oils for a few years (argan, jojoba), and I like this oil a lot.  </li>
            <li> Did possibly cause a few tiny blemishes a couple of times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately how different the color was from the Marula Oils I tried previously</li>
            <li> The product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that had overpowering scents.</li>
            <li> It does NOT smell- there&#x27;s the faintest aroma(similar to other unscented oils), but aside from that</li>
            <li> Alas, there&#x27;s Shea Terra Organics marula oil: it&#x27;s the same thing at the fraction of the price - only reservation customers</li>
            <li> Makeup certainly has its place, don&#x27;t get me wrong-</li>
            <li> The oil can be a little heavy, and take a long time for your akin to absorb.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Shea Terra &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like someone you meet on the street corner during a dark night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I use several medications which tend to dry my skin out -- which then makes my acne worse.</li>
            <li> I do know that my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to feel as dry as usual.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and it does have a slight nutty smell, which is not stinky.</li>
            <li> However, it was $78 for less than 2-oz.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a lot of waste down the drain.  </li>
            <li> It also works to tame flyaway hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It still handles all the little nicks I get on my hands and helps them heal scar</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s little to no scent.</li>
            <li> Have to use it a little longer to see the effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> They worked well, but a little on the heavy side, so unless it&#x27;s the dead of winter, they feel a little much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a few drops is all you will need each day.  </li>
            <li> ( this is what makes you&#x27;re skin feel smooth in those products, and also clogs the crap out of your pores)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now and have not seen any improvement whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply it at night and use a towel on my pillow or if I am home for a few hours, apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> I was advised to start using an essential oil under my spf and moisturizer because as I&#x27;ve aged the face cream and lotions don&#x27;t seem to be cutting it anymore.  </li>
            <li> It also takes a while to dry and effort to spread a thin layer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could be put off by it...</li>
            <li> so I usually use it at night.  </li>
            <li> I use it after a shower in the evening, when there is plenty of time for it to soak in, and usually run a swab of witch hazel over my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this, but after purchasing this expensive oil in such a small quantity, I regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is helping or not.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I can tell anything in how it looks as yet...</li>
            <li> &amp; I thought it might help soothe my face from the Arctic blasts &amp; sub-zero temps we&#x27;ve been experiencing lately.</li>
            <li> it was the shea terra tamanu oil to help repair my thin skin caused by harsh medicine.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this made me break out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This oil smells a little weird.</li>
            <li> This product has so far help me break that vicious cycle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting money on the expensive department store type marula oil.</li>
            <li> However, I feel like it isn&#x27;t as filtered as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because the leaky collection murula oil was a miracle on my skin, however, too expensive for my budget.</li>
            <li> Ladies..don&#x27;t be afraid of oils.  </li>
            <li> I read that this had a slightly bad smell.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This oil smells a little weird. I haven&#x27;t noticed and improvements in my skin after using the product for nearly a year. One bottle lasts for a very long time, so that is a plus. The oil can be a little heavy, and take a long time for your akin to absorb. I would recommend this product be applied before bedtime. If you have ouly or acbe prone skin I would only use it on your eyes. Once the oil finally is absorbed your skin feels very soft, but if you have oily skin it will never get absorbed enough to not feel like an oil slick on your face. I noticed no irritation when using this product, but it irritates my sister&#x27;s skin, so it is trial and error as far as that goes.</li>
            <li> glad i ran across this while just killing time on Amazon.com.  Had originally run across a much more expensive brand and after reading up on the marula oil decided to try it.  it has made such  a difference in my face and hands!  would definitely recommend.  a few drops is all you will need each day.  try it!</li>
            <li> I was told Marula oil is a wonder, but I did not see much of a difference in my hair than Argain oil.&lt;br /&gt;For the face and body is probably comparable to shea butter, but way refined.&lt;br /&gt;I will add a bit to my moisturizer for longer effect.</li>
            <li> I use this oil mainly around my eyes.  When the weather turns colder I imagine I will use it more all over when my skin gets a little drier. I&#x27;ve been using various facial oils for a few years (argan, jojoba), and I like this oil a lot.  It&#x27;s light and absorbs well.  Any remainder on my fingers after application I rub into my cuticles.  I prefer this oil for my face compared to others I&#x27;ve used -- jojoba is great for eye makeup removal and argan I prefer for my hair).  The pump dispenser is also nice, and I don&#x27;t really detect any particular odor.  I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars instead of 5 because it hasn&#x27;t made any noticeable difference in my skin.  The skin around my eyes might appear a bit more hydrated, but I am fortunate to have good skin to begin with so any changes would not be dramatic.  I&#x27;m 45, so this is to address fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is one of THE BEST oils I&#x27;ve used to improve elasticity and wrinkles on my face. It&#x27;s really amazing. Organic, 100% natural, no fillers. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Since I began using this oil last week, I&#x27;ve begun breaking out with pimples. The oil is light &amp; I thought it might help soothe my face from the Arctic blasts &amp; sub-zero temps we&#x27;ve been experiencing lately. I can detect no fragrance, which is nice. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it on my hands, instead. For folks with acne-prone skin, I&#x27;d consider buying a different facial oil, as this one seems to clog the pores.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I repurchased . This is the only thing I use on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> i use this as a body oil and i find that it absorbs quickly and soothes, hydrates, and protects my skin...originally used a much more expensive brand, but now that i have tried this, i will continue with it; very pleased</li>
            <li> Very nice and light oil clearned up my skin and my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Is this good for acne sufferers?</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this product. I&#x27;m glad I knew in advance through other reviews that this was oily. I only put it on at night as I wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply makeup over this.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because it&#x27;s cheaper than John Masters but I didn&#x27;t like it as much.  Feels greasier (yes, I know it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34;) but still.  It didn&#x27;t sink in my skin as much and I have to dab it off.  Did possibly cause a few tiny blemishes a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m white, 36 and have normal to dry skin.  I was advised to start using an essential oil under my spf and moisturizer because as I&#x27;ve aged the face cream and lotions don&#x27;t seem to be cutting it anymore.  (Do your own research on that).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li> I struggle with red blotchy skin. Since using the Marula oil, I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement. Really pleased! It&#x27;s now a part of my daily cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling sticky. Very moisturizing. I like it so far and it&#x27;s definitely a much better value than some of the other expensive brands, which are not even 100% marula oil. I&#x27;ve been trying out face oils and having some success with them. I have dry skin and don&#x27;t want to get wrinkly early!</li>
            <li> Great oil for the face! I had already tried their argan oil, which is also excellent, and this one may be even better at moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell too much difference with it.  I have not noticed any results.</li>
            <li> Best face moisturizer I&#x27;ve been able to find so far. Makes my skin baby butt smooth, has helped clear up any minor breakouts I&#x27;ve had and most importantly, didn&#x27;t break me out or make me oily. Don&#x27;t bother wasting money on the expensive department store type marula oil. They are chock full of chemicals and silicone( this is what makes you&#x27;re skin feel smooth in those products, and also clogs the crap out of your pores) this oil is very light, doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor like some other oils I&#x27;ve used (hemp seed oil works great but smells hideous) and in a pinch one pump will moisturize your hands like they have never been moisturized before. Seriously cannot say enough good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah and on top of all that, Shea terra is very active in sustainable sourcing, fair trade, and providing a better life for the communities that help produce/grow/harvest the raw ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this oil. The smell is pretty bad like other reviewers said, but I knew it would be since this is authentic oil with no additives. I have been using again oil for a while on my face with no issues but wanted to use the marula at night for deeper moisturization. Unfortunately this made me break out pretty bad. I kept with it for a while because I figured my skin just needed to adjust but I kept breaking out.</li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive oil from other companies, this stuff is pure Marula oil with no fillers and is amazing on your skin or hair.</li>
            <li> not one product has ever left my skin feeling and looking as wonderful as this product has!&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel, the natural coffee scent and of course, the results!&lt;br /&gt;it contains no additives, as it&#x27;s far more expensive competitor does.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m on my second bottle, absolutely fantastic stuff!!!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Shea Terra &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like someone you meet on the street corner during a dark night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product by the way</li>
            <li> I bought this because my sister recommended it for my seborrheic dermatitis around my mouth and nose. She said that Dr Oz recommended it as a natural antifungal. I tried it and it does have a slight nutty smell, which is not stinky. Unfortunately, it flared up my dermatitis rather than make it better. So I will probably end up putting this on my legs just to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I like this better than argan oil.  Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. Ladies..don&#x27;t be afraid of oils.  Your skin will soak it in.</li>
            <li> It is very nice, absorbs easily no smell; you can add to your moisturizer to use it.  It last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always amazing when a product actually does what it claims to do.  This is one such product!  Thanks to everyone who wrote great reviews and convinced me to try!</li>
            <li> I love using marula oil on my skin. I think it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. However, I was introduced to marula with African Botanics. At $80 per bottle though, I can&#x27;t afford to use it regularly. So, I decided to give the Shea Terra brand a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is just what it says, 100% pure marula oil. However, I feel like it isn&#x27;t as filtered as the expensive brands. It definitely feels a bit thicker and greasier on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this stuff still works like a charm. Just a tiny bit is all I need for my face and neck. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it doesn&#x27;t hang around for very long anyway, which is the case with most Shea Terra products. It still handles all the little nicks I get on my hands and helps them heal scar free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that if I let the oil soak into my skin for about 10-15 minutes before I put makeup on in the morning it does much better than if I try to do it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product. Its still a wonderful natural moisturizer. I just wish it were a little more refined.</li>
            <li> Love this oil ..Made my face soft and supple plus softened my tiny fine lines im 63 and if your consistant with the product you will see  a difference  Use it faithfully before bed and the product just absorbs right into my skin.  People have told me that they thought i was in my early 40S.  So take that compliment to the bank.Even though i have an olive completion the oil itself is great ladies.But you have to use it daily before bed to get good results.Give it about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I use this every night under my moisturizer. It has helped my dry skin tremendously. I also use it on my hands during the winter months when my skin is at the absolute driest. One application at night and my skin is like new in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have any real scent to it. I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could be put off by it...I&#x27;ve used other products that had overpowering scents. Compared to other expensive facial oils, this is a great deal, I love that it is 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because the leaky collection murula oil was a miracle on my skin, however, too expensive for my budget. For the price this is a nice oil. I used it on my face and it took much longer to absorb than its competitor. I added it to my moisturizer for my body and my skin is softer. Worked well on dry elbows and knees.  I do notice the scent that others have mentioned and it smells like shea butter, but its not offensive or lingering, to me. I recommend this oil for its many uses, but if you&#x27;re looking exclusively for your face, I would buy the leaky collection cause it worked instantly to smooth my dry skin, where this product has not done that yet.</li>
            <li> This oil is terrific! Moisturizes without being greasy, totally natural, affordable - one bottle lasts a really long time. I&#x27;m on my second order and I still love it.</li>
            <li> i like how quickly the oil soaks into my face and how soft it leaves it; just wish that there was a nicer smell but it is all natural so I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now and have not seen any improvement whatsoever.  Nice oil but no impact (perhaps I can use it for cooking instead?)</li>
            <li> This is not a bad oil, or a good one. I don&#x27;t like it better than argon or almond oil, so will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for several weeks now and don&#x27;t know that there is any difference in my skin appearance.  I do know that my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to feel as dry as usual.  We live in a northern climate and it&#x27;s extremely dry in the winter months. This has to be applied several minutes (up to a half hour) prior to applying anything else on your face. This allows time for it to soak in properly and not leave a greasy, tacky feeling on your facial skin.</li>
            <li> My experience with beauty oils is pretty varied.  I&#x27;ve tried (and loved) argan and maracuja for my middle-aged skin (yikes! I said it...) and found that I prefer beauty oils to moisturizers and creams to keep my skin looking healthy and much younger than its chronological age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is really wash and wear, and a little abused by most people&#x27;s standards I&#x27;m sure.  I don&#x27;t wear chemical sunscreens.  I run and workout in the elements six days a week, and pretty much wear full makeup only when I need to.  I go on the &amp;#34;why wear a ton of makeup to look like you have good skin, just have good skin&amp;#34; premise in life.  Makeup certainly has its place, don&#x27;t get me wrong-but I&#x27;m a little more natural with my routine.  Using beauty oils makes my skin a better &amp;#34;blank canvas&amp;#34; so that when I do wear my makeup, it looks that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I&#x27;ve found with maracuja oil (besides the pricetag) was that it went rancid quickly.  Halfway through a 4 oz bottle and no bueno.  That&#x27;s a lot of waste down the drain.  Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried have been kind of thick. They worked well, but a little on the heavy side, so unless it&#x27;s the dead of winter, they feel a little much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along came Shea Terra&#x27;s Marula oil and I was definitely willing to try it, based on pricetag and organic, cold-pressed ingredient alone.  I&#x27;m SO happy to report that this oil delivers it all!  For supple skin you only need a couple drops to spread around and it soaks right in.  No oiliness or heaviness.  No shine.  No scent I could detect.  I&#x27;ve also been applying it more recently to my neck with great results.  (I heard that your neck tells your real age, so if you can erase time there...LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I LOVE Shea Terra&#x27;s Marula Oil and will stick with it.  I love doing everything with fewer products and this little miracle helps me knock a ton off my list at once.  Winner-winner!</li>
            <li> Love it and it has been helpful in keeping the youthful skin for a sun worshiper older woman!</li>
            <li> a very good skin moisturizer</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels. It soaks right into your skin and feels great. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending your product in a timely manner,  I&#x27;m excited to use your product.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, if not the best I&#x27;ve ever used for my severely dry skin.  The scent is so light it&#x27;s barely detectable and dissipates in about 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed using this oil as a daily facial moisturizer. It is a nice light oil and is absorbed easily. I feel it has helped improve my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in combination with Baobab Oil and Shea Terra Organics - Rose Hips Black Soap Deep Pore Facial Wash &amp; Mask.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Feels great, not greasy. My skin soaks it up. And nice fragrance too! A great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Use it on my face every night - keeps skin from drying throughout the night.  Also use under makeup - skin looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a marula oil believer after trying Leakey Collection&#x27;s marula oil, which did wonders for my skin. Marula oil has smoothed out my complexion, made my skin softer, pores smaller, *and* actually helped with my acne. I&#x27;d have a lot of bumps + pimples on my forehead, but miraculously enough, it reduced those bumps and didn&#x27;t exacerbate the pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Leakey Collection&#x27;s marula oil is so friggin&#x27; overpriced, it&#x27;s inevitable customers like you and I needing to find a cheaper option. Alas, there&#x27;s Shea Terra Organics marula oil: it&#x27;s the same thing at the fraction of the price - only reservation customers seem to have is the scent, but it&#x27;s a very light, nutty smell that becomes unnoticeable after 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slap it on your face overnight, and that&#x27;s all you really need. It says you can add it to your lotions, face washes, and all of that, but applying it once a night seems to have worked for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty good moisturizer, but a little on the heavy side so I usually use it at night.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I started using this around my eyes because I have a problem with sensitive skin around my eyes and have to be very careful. This has anti-inflammatory capabilities which works great.</li>
            <li> Love the oil, use it all the time</li>
            <li> It was a speedy delivery. The product was not what I expected. The scent of the oil is off. Everything else is good</li>
            <li> It is good for dry spots on hands and feet but not anything really special. I do not plan to reorder.</li>
            <li> First, understand that I am caucasian and although I am 54 years old my skin is in decent shape and I use shower glove always on my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;This marula oil seems to do what I never would have thought an oil would do.  First of all, it is in no way, greasy, my skin absorbs it right away and feel more like it has been nourished and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I use this right after a shower, and often not just on my face but on any other areas that need help to retain moisture.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a 5-star product! Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Marula oil.  I use this on my face every morning and night.  I mix it with my sunscreen in the morning and moisturizer at night.  I don&#x27;t wear any type of foundation or powder on my skin so I don&#x27;t know how this would work if I did use those products.  It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  I tend to have drier skin and this really helps keep my skin moisturized.  I have gone through three bottles and I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I too got this in lieu of the Leaky Collection&#x27;s Pure Marula Oil. While it is more cost effective, it is not silky smooth. It also takes a while to dry and effort to spread a thin layer. Overall, hydrating but not luxurious like the Leaky Collection.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the name brand marula oil that sells for $60. I&#x27;d definitely repurchase this. It&#x27;s a lighter oil than argan, absorbs much quicker. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie. I noticed a new product on one of my favorite websites, and just had to try it. However, it was $78 for less than 2-oz. plus it contained a perfumed essence.  I decided to give this a try and am glad I did. It&#x27;s 100% natural marula oil. I use it on my face, hands and hair. It&#x27;s not too heavy, absorbs quickly. There&#x27;s no unpleasant odor. I apply it to my face at bedtime. When I wake up, my face is still soft and supple. Since it&#x27;s not greasy or shiny once absorbed, I sometimes use it in the morning as a moisturizer under my sunscreen. The order arrived in great shape within two days!</li>
            <li> Along with so many others, I sampled the Marula oil from a different manufacturer who wanted to sell it at a much higher price, and then found this. Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ll say this product does not absorb as nicely as the more refined version that&#x27;s a higher price. It does NOT smell- there&#x27;s the faintest aroma(similar to other unscented oils), but aside from that there&#x27;s little to no scent. I use it after a shower in the evening, when there is plenty of time for it to soak in, and usually run a swab of witch hazel over my face in the morning. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s suitable for daily use unless your skin is very dry, but using it once or twice a week is balancing my skin and it&#x27;s softer than ever.</li>
            <li> Very good oil for your face keeps it nice and moisturized with out feeling greasy</li>
            <li> Second time for purchasing marula oil. Yes it makes a difference!  Great opportunity for trying something that isn&#x27;t available everywhere</li>
            <li> I own a lot of carrier oils, and I&#x27;m always looking for more to purchase and try. I decided to try this, but after purchasing this expensive oil in such a small quantity, I regret the purchase. The oil is light, and odorless, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything that shea butter, almond oil, avocado oil, and many other oils are capable of doing.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!!! I won&#x27;t use another moisturizer again.you can see rey right away. My skin is so bright, smooth, fades scars well, highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Marula oil in my Birchbox subscription last month. I add a few drops to my moisturizer every night and it makes my skin feel sooo much more moisturized, smoother, and more supple. I&#x27;ve started using it after my showers as a body oil too and it makes my skin feel so velvety. I love love love it. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the sample I got from my Birchbox was by a different brand (The Leakey Collection Marula) and I think it smelled better than this one. This one smells a bit like toasted sesame. So I mean it&#x27;s not a BAD smell, per se, but not as nice as the other brand. That&#x27;s why I knocked off one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have bought the one from The Leakey Collection but the price is SO much more extravagant than this one. My conscience wants me to because it&#x27;s Fair Trade and sustainably harvested, but my wallet cries at the thought of spending $78 on body oi.. So, this one has to do for now until I get rich and famous.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and fresh. Using it on my winter-dry skin after bath, and can already tell a difference. Nice product!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Marula Oil (another brand that is quite popular) a few months ago.  It did nothing for me so I researched a little further and learned that the particular Marula Oil product was actually a blend of many oils, not just Marula Oil ... and while I read much about the wonderful properties of Marula Oil before I gave it a try, I could never find out how much Marula Oil was actually in the product AND I knew I was sensitive to many of the other oils in the blend.  No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then found another brand which was 100% Marula Oil but it didn&#x27;t do much either; was rather happy since the price ($78/bottle) was not financially viable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not give up, however, as my skin adores oils as a moisturizer; I use Rosehip Oil in the pm but still needed something for the am.  I gave the Shea Terra Organics Marula Oil a try and it is absolutely wonderful!  I ordered it directly from the Shea Terra Organics website.  It soaks right in and my skin loves it.  I noticed immediately how different the color was from the Marula Oils I tried previously (it&#x27;s very light, almost clear ... unlike the original MOs I tried which were golden in color).  I don&#x27;t notice any odor, and my skin just drinks it up and it leaves me looking fresh and dewy.  You can&#x27;t beat the price or its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Great product.... lightweight and nearly odorless, my mature skin drinks it up. Feels good and nourishing when i apply it day and night!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  It stays in your skin, not on and really makes it soft.  It is a great deal since other companies sell it for much more..</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is helping or not.  Have to use it a little longer to see the effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> This oil has very strong toning properties, and it is now on the very top of my list of oils, and I have tried probably 90% of all the oils used in cosmetics.  Somehow, it really smooths the skin and makes it more resilient.  What is good is that it acts quickly, and that is what made it on my top list.  Even just after one use, you can feel the difference, if you are sensitive enough to the changes in your skin.  It is best to apply after first applying a toner, a cream, or any kind of a water-based product.  If applied on dry skin, the benefits will be diminished.  This product also is a a good price here, compared to other companies that sell it.</li>
            <li> When applied,the oil absorbs into my skin somewhat so I don&#x27;t have a greasy look. I usually apply it at night and use a towel on my pillow or if I am home for a few hours, apply it to my face. If I go out at night I wipe it off, but most of it seems to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> Great Value and a great product!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s eczema upon recommendation by a Sephora clerk.  I tried the version they sell at Sephora and thought I better find a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied all over dry patches as soon as this arrived - and immediately her skin became very itchy, red and broke out in hives all over. My daughter is severely allergic to cashew and turns out marula nut is from the same cashew family. My husband as Ted to get rid of any marula at home asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why didn&#x27;t she get the same reaction from the Sephora brand?  It turns out not to be 100% marula oil but blended with essential oils.  I&#x27;m gong back to argan!</li>
            <li> The best. Many uses for your dry skin.</li>
            <li> A friend ordered some for me after I suffered a bad burn on my fingertips, and it worked great to heal the skin and minimize scarring. Now the whole family uses it on our sensitive skin instead of lotion or moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and has no noticeable odor. It also works to tame flyaway hair without weighing it down. We now order it regularly .</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin !!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, nice oil, absorbs quickly without greasy residue. Makes my face feel really soft!  A good product, will keep using.</li>
            <li> one of the richest oils I have ever used, and unlike many oils, it actually absorbed quite nicely into the skin.  I am in love!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. This is my second bottle. I mix it was the shea terra tamanu oil to help repair my thin skin caused by harsh medicine. Both oils have really helped me heal.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far, but I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 weeks, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it will be long term, thus only 4 stars for now.  However, I feel like it is hydrating and smoothing to my decolletage. I also use it on my face and mix it with my body lotion for generally dry skin. I find the Marula oil to be very light, absorbing easily. For my face, I use a few drops, warm it in my hands and press to the skin. I wait a minute and then apply my regular cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I saved the best for last...this oil has the most delicious roasted coffee bean fragrance.  Yum! The odor evaporates within a minute or two, so those with sensitivities don&#x27;t need to worry about the smell lingering, but it is lovely while it lasts!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Marula oil from another company and I liked it a lot, however the price for a very small bottle was $78. I found the Shea Terra product on Amazon for a much more reasonable price-$17! I think it works well and I believe my skin looks better especially around my eyes. I don&#x27;t think that it absorbs into your skin as quickly as the more expensive product although when i apply it at night by morning my skin is dry and non-oily. i dont use it during the day under makeup because of the absorption issue. But the biggest difference that caught my attention was the scent. The $78 Marula oil smelled nice and reminded me of a spa. The Shea Terra product smells like a toasted nut. Overall I think it is a good product for the price and it is a fairly large bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin is typically dry. This absorbs into my skin so well and moisturizes wonderfully. I use this as my face moisturizer. A little goes a long way. Two pumps is enough to cover my face and neck. The oil is also very light and not greasy. My skin soaks it right up. This is a great price as well as I&#x27;ve seen marula oil sold for upwards of $40.</li>
            <li> Recently bought a similar product half the size, twice the price. I&#x27;m not convinced that I see any changes, ie, reduction in facial lines, but I need only a couple of drops, my skin is definitely softer, and I like the way it feels.  Too old to care about looking half my age- nothing to prove!  I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love the product.  It makes my skin feel very moist.  It helps with the aging process to decrease the fine lines</li>
            <li> I use this oil at bedtime after cleansing my face.  It goes on feeling a bit oily, but soon the skin drinks it in.  I have been very satisfied with how it makes my skin feel and look.  I also use their Rose Hips Black Soap Deep Pore Facial Wash &amp; Mask.  Together, they make a wonderful combo to care for my skin.  I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> It works great reducing fine lines</li>
            <li> This oil works great on dry flaky skin and is a cottage industry for women in Africa.</li>
            <li> This feels lighter than argan oil but heavier than maracuja oil.  It&#x27;s has a nutty scent but dissipates quickly.  You have it be patient and let it sink into your skin. I know it will take a while to see the results but it feels good to use a natural product after submitting my skin to retinoids and bleaching creams (all prescription) everyday.</li>
            <li> A very nice multi-purpose oil for face, body and hair. Even though I have ance-prone face I had no problem using it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is absorbed quickly into the skin and, after two weeks of using it, I have seen an improvement in my skin, specifically in texture. I have acne prone skin and I use several medications which tend to dry my skin out -- which then makes my acne worse. This product has so far help me break that vicious cycle.</li>
            <li> I have really, really dry dehydrated skin.  I had received a sample of the Leaky Collection Marula oil and loved it but didn&#x27;t love the price.  I found this on Amazon and it works almost as well.  I felt like the Leaky oil absorbed faster and I also enjoyed the smell more.  The Shea Terra Marula oil has a somewhat nutty, burnt smell.  But for the price I will definitely be buying this again.  It is so nice to finally have hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> I read that this had a slightly bad smell.  Not at all.  I only use it at night.  It&#x27;s a bit much for me under my makeup.  I put it on after I wash my face in the evening or after my shower and leave it on all night.  I can tell a difference in how my skin feels.  Not sure if I can tell anything in how it looks as yet...but it feel better.</li>
