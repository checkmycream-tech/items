            <li> Very pretty although it&#x27;s more mauve.</li>

            <li> Nice color; one of my new favorites!</li>
            <li> Love this color. The picture does not give it justice. I have received so many compliments when I wore the OPI Java Mauve. I&#x27;m light skinned but it is a color that looks great on ANYONE! A must have in nail polish-robe.. Lol&lt;br /&gt;I liked that the seller wrapped the polish in paper in case the Polish had a mishap. Thank you</li>
            <li> Very nice nail polish that is a pretty color, but not at all as pretty as this photo would lead you to believe.&lt;br /&gt;More brown.</li>
            <li> Long standing fav of mine. Just works with my skin and colors of clothing. Like a shade I can wear all the time and this does it</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Love OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li> I choose this for the color.  Not a shade I find easily at my nail salon.  Normally OPI is my preference for polish but this seemed like it may have been a little old.  It was thicker and didn&#x27;t  glid on like OPI usually does.  I do like the prices on Amazon and would order more polish by this method.  It came in the time it said it would.  Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to really know how the color will work on your nails but it comes close enough to purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice color for all seasons.</li>
            <li> Just as described and shipped timely and packaged well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this color.  Always looking for neutral nail colors to match everything and this definitely fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The color was very dark, not at all close to the color pictured.</li>
            <li> long time lover of the product.</li>
            <li> Just as other reviews stated the shade is darker. Not at all pinkish! I still like polish Opi make a great product.</li>
            <li> Love OPI...... This color is awesome; goes with everything. OPI polish is the best.....Love the name</li>
            <li> I love this color nail polish and with the help of the other OPI nail products my self manicure looks great.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on OPI nail polish, and this shade is my favorite so far!</li>
