            <li>and I don&#x27;t see a remarkable difference over tanning with no lotion at all.  </li>
            <li>: One of the reasons I love CalTan products is for the delicious smells they have.</li>
            <li>, some reviews said it&#x27;s just wonderful, and they are so much more tan, etc.</li>
            <li>Best stuff I&#x27;ve found, even better than Designer Skin products,  </li>
            <li>She had a nice tan glow after just one use!</li>
            <li>The smell is ok but the texture is awesome.</li>
            <li>Good bronzing lotion with a great scent.</li>
            <li>Its a great lotion and smells good and works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the best one yet!</li>
            <li>Amazon sells all my favorite indoor tanning lotions at the best prices.</li>
            <li>this product smells like warm vanilla sugar!</li>
            <li>It had good reviews here on Amazon and it was a great price - but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li>Will for sure buy again :-D</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now looking a nice tan color!</li>
            <li>Great smell and good results</li>

            <li>Well I thought this product would be good, and it turned out not to be all that great.</li>
            <li>Could not tell a remarkable difference after 5 sessions.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST TANNING LOTION I HAVE EVER USED, AND EVEN BETTER</li>

            <li>and I have a nice tan!</li>
            <li>This is okay, but not the best!</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it isnt greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Non greasy and also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant.</li>

            <li>It is so easy to put on and is priced great on this site!</li>
            <li>and I think it is a great product, will buy more!</li>

            <li>I was told to try this by a friend and I found it at a good price so why not.</li>
            <li>Good tanning lotion, it is colored, so just a warning on getting it on your clothes.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re good too</li>
            <li>Based on the results it provided for my fair to medium skin tone, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again.  </li>

            <li>This product smells really good, but I noticed no acceleration in my bronzing.</li>
            <li>This product is good for tanning but would not pay $90 for product.</li>

            <li>This product is really good and does what it says.  </li>
            <li>Also smells good.</li>
            <li>I should be good to go from here on out.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a great value, if you&#x27;re looking for an effective indoor tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Designer Skin makes some good lotion, go with there&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Loved Paint</li>
            <li>It was a good buy.  </li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>The smell is good, but it just didn&#x27;t produce good results.  </li>
            <li>All my clients have loved this lotion.</li>
            <li>and its good for your skin</li>
            <li>It smells good and rubs in just like lotion.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t give me a good tan.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Has a good smell, not over powering.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li>recommend this for someone who is looking for a lotion that smells good, refreshes your skin and maintains your tan.</li>
            <li>But not so good if you are you tan and want to be darker.  </li>
            <li>It works good, i would recommend it to anyone, but you always need to switch lotions to get the darkness you desire.</li>
            <li>I have had friends ask if I lay out and that in itself is a good bonus.  </li>
            <li>however it was good while i used it.</li>
            <li>It smells so good though that I used it anyway until my daughter wanted it for use in a tanning booth.  </li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>This is a good lotion for tanning in a bed.</li>

            <li>It smells so good still</li>
            <li>Good product and good price</li>
            <li>The smell is good, this is used by both a man and a women</li>
            <li>Now, granted, it may be because I have been laying in a realllly good bed, but still the lotion has helped I think.</li>
            <li>All is good.</li>
            <li>Always count on Amazon for a good deal on what you need when you need it.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but I&#x27;d thought it would have a tingle</li>
            <li>All it did was make me smell good.</li>
            <li>well that I would get the good results I read about with this lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest this lotion to anyone looking for a good indoor tanning product.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on it and decided for the price it was a good gamble.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product on tuesday and got it friday, the packaging was good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to use.</li>
            <li>I got this to try because it got really good reviews</li>
            <li>Tanning wise, I did notice an accelerated tan within 3 sessions.</li>
            <li>I was given this lotion by a friend, and I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about it.</li>
            <li>It looks and sounds good..</li>
            <li>It smelt really good</li>
            <li>My boyfriend said I smelled good.</li>
            <li>It smells good though.  </li>
            <li>so when I seen this and all the good reviews I had to try it...</li>
            <li>this a tried because this works just a good as a 80 dollar bottle.  </li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>The price is good as well</li>
            <li>Oh, and no it doesnt smell good.</li>
            <li>and good moisture.</li>
            <li>I am naturally fair skinned with auburn hair.</li>
            <li>The lotion moisturizes well and smells good.</li>
            <li>It smells really good but does not work at all.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the smell isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>Price was good and it was delivered on time</li>
            <li>it smells good</li>
            <li>This product smells great, applies nicely, and has helped darken my tan.</li>
            <li>good moisture lotion for the tanning bed</li>
            <li>Good for price</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and do not tan well.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good.</li>
            <li>Then again Inhave fair skin.</li>
            <li>and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>As with all good tanning, you have to keep tanning.</li>
            <li>A rich vanilla scent is how I can best describe it.  </li>
            <li>Now anyways, I read through the ingredients, it has an awesome ingredient in here that people pay a ton of money for in true skin care products.  </li>
            <li>I work at a gym/tan salon and own my own bed, I wouldnt go anywhere but here!</li>
            <li>The difference in price and this company uses more than a very light bronzer, should make this the best lotion for the money anywhere.  </li>
            <li>For a lotion without tingle it works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>was super impressed with the colour as well</li>
            <li>Also, the delivery service was exceptional.</li>

            <li>I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Both are great by themselves, but I have found I have had better results using them together</li>

            <li>I did a lot of online research before I purchased this lotion, looking for THE BEST one out there as I am pretty fair-skinned, and this one was always in the top 5 or top 10 for best lotions, so I took a chance and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a great deal, you get a lot of product and you smell pretty good even after tanning!</li>
            <li>It went on very nicely and smelled ok during application</li>
            <li>I give this lotion 2 stars because it smells very nice, unlike many tanning products.</li>

            <li>but it works amazing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Turned me a nice brown not orange.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it,</li>
            <li>and this didn&#x27;t even help get the nice tan I got in Mexico this spring.</li>
            <li>Having been out of the tanning bed world for a while I just bought this to hold me over until I read some reviews and found a tingle lotion that I liked.</li>
            <li>It works fast and leaves an allover great looking tan!</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it as well.</li>
            <li>Women love &#x27;smell good&#x27; lotions and tanning lotions should have a &#x27;tanning&#x27; type smell.</li>
            <li>One review said this smells like warm vanilla</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for those with fair skin.</li>
            <li>product s a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion,</li>
            <li>The smell is nice I will give it that.</li>
            <li>, I thought I should experiment with my own.  </li>
            <li>But this lotion from the amazon seller (NOT green-whatever) passes my own frugal/skeptical legitimacy test.  </li>
            <li>It kind of smells like your run of the mill store bought tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I use it about twice a week, and I am developing a nice tan.</li>
            <li>Like I have my own superfly theme song.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is the absolute best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>
            <li>The smell was nice, but it took me two days to get the orange off my skin and to get my skin looking even again.  </li>
            <li>Most of the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>, I think it is kind of a unisex smell and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lotion for a while</li>
            <li>Okay I got this based on all the good reviews and now I feel some must be planted.</li>
            <li>Regardless, all three give me nice brown skin.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent</li>
            <li>and I have been really nice color since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Love it for getting a good summer tan</li>
            <li>It has a nice coconut smell to it and also good about keeping your skin moist and not oily like most tan lotions</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin, and this lotion works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lotion, but didn&#x27;t darken the skin to give you a tan.  </li>
            <li>but it smells nice</li>
            <li>I think it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>This works fairly well, but I think I had better results with the 100X.</li>
            <li>moisturizes and provides a nice bronze color.</li>
            <li>I was not too thrilled with this.</li>
            <li>it smells nice..</li>
            <li>the color is nice, does not look yellowish.</li>
            <li>Liked product a lot.</li>
            <li>This product works for me to get a nice color.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice lotion.  </li>
            <li>I received my order before estimated arrival date, I am more than happy with my experience :)</li>
            <li>Nice even tan.</li>
            <li>I love the product, the price is so good for that quality.</li>
            <li>Smells nice though.</li>
            <li>Kind of makes me orange too.</li>
            <li>I bought this on amazon because it seemed popular.</li>
            <li>Recommend if your looking for a nice glow tan.</li>
            <li>This time i stopped using the lotion and switched to another kind</li>
            <li>I have a nice, even color</li>
            <li>From the tingle ones that hurt, to the ones that do nothing but make you smell nice.</li>
            <li>I havent been in a tanning bed all summer, and grew a nice farmer tan.</li>
            <li>Switching the two up gives me a really nice color.</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like skittles..</li>
            <li>and I really liked it</li>
            <li>really liked it.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>Nice bronze color, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>Nice deal otherwise.</li>
            <li>I just wish I would&#x27;ve gotten the darker kind.</li>
            <li>So before I go somewhere warm</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells like the warm brown sugar scents from Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice.</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>It has the perfect amount of bronzers &amp; acts as a moistuirzer - leaving my skin golden &amp; silky smooth!</li>
            <li>It also gave me a nice even brown color, no orange tint.</li>
            <li>Yes this lotion smells nice</li>
            <li>The lotion smells really good and noticeably has a lot of silicone in it, which I love.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to beginners or anyone wanting a nice tan.</li>
            <li>It was a really nice smell and its smoothing on skin .</li>
            <li>I dont think it necessairly has tanned me better than others I have used, but it has given me a very nice even brown tone that I love.</li>
            <li>For the price, the lotion is definitely a great buy and soo worth it!</li>
            <li>WORTH THE $$$!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married this summer and wanted to make sure I could perfect my color before time</li>
            <li>I have def used better and more effective ones!  </li>
            <li>If you need a good tanning lotion to give you nice natural color you should try this product, great price, good smell</li>
            <li>after reading all the wonderful reviews and searching for a product with a high bronzing factor,i ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>Worked great and darkened me up really quickly and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>It smells good at first but after tanning the smell isn&#x27;t very nice.</li>
            <li>Great full bottle.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and blends right in, the smell is excellent and the tanning is unreal.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and will most certainly purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>This product is nice because its cheap and smells good.  </li>

            <li>I was really hoping this lotion would meet my expectations because the price is great and lots of people seem to be having good results.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and smells good to :))</li>
            <li>It has such a good smell, gets you tanner faster, and my skin feels great afterwards!</li>
            <li>I strongly favor lotions that have good bronzers in them.</li>
            <li>make sure you wash your hands really good after you apply it on you  :)</li>
            <li>Has no fragrance which is really good, really nice silicone smooth.  </li>
            <li>I burn very easily without tanning lotion, but when I use this lotion, I don&#x27;t burn at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m olive skinned and tan very easily.</li>
            <li>and I tan very easily.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - I LOVE the SMELL TOO!</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li>there are better products out there! :)</li>
            <li>Pretty good like it !</li>
            <li>Bombshell is the best tanning bed lotion on the market as far as I am concerned!</li>
            <li>Works great, smells awesome, and does a great job of darkening my fair skin and for a redhead that is quite difficult.  </li>
            <li>I loved the smell and it seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m biracial, but I&#x27;m very fair, so I can tan really well,</li>
            <li>It absorbed very easily into my skin, felt great and did not have an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>Of all the bronzing tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used this one is by far the best!!!</li>
            <li>It is smooth and smells good when you put it on..</li>
            <li>I purchased this product the first time in 2010 based on all the great reviews and amazing price.</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice bronze tan faster than most lotion.</li>
            <li>The silicones in the bottle are one of the best on the market thus far.  </li>
            <li>but I think I have used others I liked better.  </li>
            <li>Smell is good and lotion makes your skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would reccommend trying this out before you buy it if you have fair or light skin.</li>
            <li>I have been tanning for years and have used ALOT of lotions, but I have to say  this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>all i had available was to wipe them off as good as i could on the wash cloth.</li>
            <li>So far so great!</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and leaves skin really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like vanilla which I like much better</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have any kind of reaction as I did with the one I bought from the tanning salon for much more money.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this is the color is a natural bronze.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a cheap lotion.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s always nice:)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion works well with my fair skin tone and has a light after scent.</li>
            <li>Love it, not greasy and smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>So far the best products I&#x27;ve found that keep my legs as tan as</li>
            <li>This lotion glides on so smoothly because it has a good amount of silcone in it.</li>
            <li>So far, this lotion has been working great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; color tanning lotion, it gives a natural looking tan that is awesome!</li>
            <li>Had no idea it would smell so good and be so smooth.  </li>
            <li>It smells delightful and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Love the nice tan color it leave.</li>
            <li>But is does smell pretty good, just dont count on it for a good tan.</li>
            <li>Smells good, and bronzers were pretty good for the price I&#x27;d use again.</li>
            <li>It doesnt make you supper tan real quick but still works great quick</li>
            <li>This lotion is great, it has an awesome tint/smell to it and does not turn your skin orange like many other bronzing tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>It looks great right after I get out of the bed...</li>
            <li>It is very light, and went on very easily.</li>
            <li>love love love!</li>
            <li>and it doesnt smell good and certainly doesnt smell good after you tan.  </li>
            <li>I have loved this brand for years and am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got this lotion after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good price!</li>

            <li>I love to tan and this is BY FAR, thee best lotion that I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many tanning lotions, and this one gives you a great tan, but fades quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent though not my favorite but not terrible either.  </li>
            <li>Works very good, wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but now I&#x27;m looking more colored than before :)</li>
            <li>I actually am pretty happy with it and have recommended it to my friends.  </li>
            <li>It really creates an even, beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look like Snooki, so I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what a great bronzer does.</li>
            <li>All in all a pretty great product.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works really well!</li>
            <li>I have just used this product for the first time, and I have to say I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin (burn rather easy) but also tan rather easily.  </li>
            <li>, lotion went on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and silky to the touch after tanning.</li>
            <li>It is a very lightly scented lotion.</li>
            <li>It was very smooth to put on</li>
            <li>The lotion itself goes on very smooth</li>
            <li>It smells great and has a light sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It does not have a good \\&quot;after tan\\&quot; smell, and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and quick color.</li>
            <li>good price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This lotion gets 5 stars from me because it is super inexpensive ($18.95) and it gives good results.   </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good for a quick tan.</li>
            <li>at first after a month of using that, i thought i liked it, the smell was Good.</li>
            <li>The smell with this lotion is great too, with a very fresh, clean smell. :)</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on super smooth and leaves my skin feeling great afterwards.</li>
            <li>Smells fine, but it seems to be kind of watery.</li>
            <li>If anyone else whom purchased this lotion and recieved great results can you send me a video of its consistency because Im almost certain</li>
            <li>On a positive, yes, it does smell very nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge deal!</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>so i will switch to one that has more bronzer.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work appropriately on my body.</li>
            <li>Im 100% satisfied, all pros, no cons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>That being said, it is just an OK lotion and nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li>you get comes more from the color of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because you Dont have to lay in the bed as much when you use this product.</li>
            <li>For one, I do not find the smell appealing.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I was expecting better from the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>And having only paid $15 for this lotion it is awesome!</li>
            <li>Overall no complaints and the ordering process was excellent.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is ok</li>
            <li>Thats all. :)</li>
            <li>I was expecting way better results from this lotion since it has so many bronzers</li>
            <li>This stuff does not work, I have used it for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it didn&#x27;t give me the \\&quot;50X\\&quot; tan that I thought I would get.</li>
            <li>Got me darker better than Freedom.</li>
            <li>Okay smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the Beach Bum Rum step 2....</li>
            <li>The smell says cotton blossom, but I would say it smells more like vanilla.</li>
            <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t leave skin an orange color like many lotions with bronzers do.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>I researched and read reviews of all the top tanning lotions and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with this tanning lotion but not amazed as some of you are.</li>
            <li>Smoke has got to be the BEST bronzer Ive used, personally.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to tell after using it more than 1 time.  </li>
            <li>that those blessed with better pigment than I have had.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m placing another order for 3 more bottles for my friends and family.  </li>
            <li>she admitted it was authentic, but couldn&#x27;t place the smell.</li>
            <li>and I continued to get more color every time I used it.</li>
            <li>Its ok.  </li>
            <li>shoulda known better to buy into the hype.</li>
            <li>but i love the results.</li>
            <li>Love how it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and</li>
            <li>I worked in a Tanning Salon and have used many many lotions.</li>
            <li>But when you take that shower that night, you won&#x27;t be any better off then</li>
            <li>I bought two :)</li>
            <li>Both smell amazing and leave your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Being someone who&#x27;s worked at a tanning salon before and have had tried many different lotions I would say this lotion isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not allergic to many things, but it seems I broke out in hives when I used this product.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want in a tanning lotion?</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and have ordered it twice now.  </li>
            <li>Okay folks, here&#x27;s how this bottle of lotion works.  </li>
            <li>This lotion was okay.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m hooked  my favorite ever.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many lotions.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best bronzers out there!  </li>
            <li>It is a fresh scent that smells good even after you tan.  </li>
            <li>They hydrate your skin so that it is more receptiive to the UV rays that tan them.</li>
            <li>Works great, especially if you&#x27;re fairly hairy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with the Designer Skin brand and will be returning to those products now.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>It has a coconut fragrance, which I love as well.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>IT WOULD COST ME 10X MORE AT THE TANNING SALON</li>
            <li>I WILL BE BUYING MORE FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this lotion.</li>
            <li>:) I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li>LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine any lotion working any better.</li>
            <li>So pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I would love it 100% if had pump on it..</li>
            <li>so maybe if you use more often you would have better results.  </li>
            <li>:) I will buy this product again and again</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for something that I love.  </li>
            <li>Is this better then using nothing a all?</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research for the best lotion (probably more than necessary :  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I go to because most of the employees that work there use it.</li>
            <li>I always used mostly Designer Skin products until I bought this Millennium product.</li>
            <li>From extending to color to nourishment to scent, I have used better lotions than this one.</li>
            <li>Its not terrible..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li>i have tried MANY different products, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love my Tanning lotion</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) buy it</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but after that it left me feeling tan and wonderful</li>
            <li>i have to say i love the millenium tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>the 100x bronzer is my favorite &amp; i always have a bottle to use.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, because it&#x27;s not as pi√±a coladish as the most of the tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>For $25, it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m definitely glad I didn&#x27;t pay more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she prefers that people buy this stuff for fifty bucks from her . . .</li>
            <li>It makes me want to type of more and more and more</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I imagine guys would also enjoy using this lotion!  </li>
            <li>better order both used both I just got darker when I used BS</li>
            <li>really like this product, smells great too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already wanting more and I still have sum in my bottle.</li>
            <li>Anyway I love the product it gives me more color on top of my ran already</li>
            <li>When I would buy a packet of tanning lotion by another company at the salon, I would get WAY more color than with this.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion seems like nothing more than lotion.</li>
            <li>i rather spend more money and save my time.</li>
            <li>The bronzer gave okay color.  </li>
            <li>and its got a good clean scent for those of you who dont like a strong smell</li>
            <li>I love the sugary, vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>This line is so much better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I really love Millenium Tanning products through Amazon, but if you are going to get Paint it</li>
            <li>I am getting more color when I was at a plateau.</li>
            <li>but I have used better for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>It had scotch tape on the top of the lid to hold it on.  </li>
            <li>perfect for outside tanning in the sun too.</li>
            <li>I have used Wal-Mart lotions with better results.</li>
            <li>More fruit smoothie than coconut and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>i still don&#x27;t see any better tan than before when i wasn&#x27;t using it</li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle a month ago and have just ordered two more</li>
            <li>I have been tanning for 6 plus years and tryed many.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big time tanner, but this seams to be one of the best lotions I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting any more tan than I would have been without the lotion.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t okay.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>From the many many reviews Ive read Paint</li>
            <li>My bottle was neatly and safely packaged in a bag within a box.</li>
            <li>Its not to sticky, its prob more sticky on me</li>
            <li>then most of the stuff iv tried there.</li>
            <li>Smells okay.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off spending more money on a better lotion.</li>
            <li>The #1 reason I love this tanning lotion is because even though it has bronzers it does not stain your skin at all.</li>
            <li>Lovely tan.</li>
            <li>Way more lotion and bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>Order was on time and I am supremely ecstatically pleased.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and leaves me with an even tan every time :) will be purchasing again when it runs out.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion</li>
            <li>boy was I glad I did.</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li>i deff saw results waaaaaaay better than without it.</li>
            <li>deff buy again :)</li>
            <li>Ive used numerous tanning lotions, i found that snooki&#x27;s line works best for me.</li>
            <li>so just checked my bottle soon as it came in to make sure it was legit and it was.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more of this.</li>
            <li>My skin is allergic to many lotions - not this one.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion also gives me more moisturization then a bottle of hempz..</li>
            <li>If it were $100 I would give it 3.5-4 stars because there are better lotions you can get for the price.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is much better and the results are phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it, and would recommend this product to everybody. :)</li>
            <li>so with that said for best results you would have to go SPF-free using this product outside...</li>
            <li>I got better results also by leaving the product on for 3-4 hours AFTER tanning without washing it off.  </li>
            <li>so you make sure the bronzer can still absorb</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more.</li>
            <li>Gives a great real tan after tanning.</li>
            <li>It has such a good smell, gets you tanned faster, and my skin feels great after I apply it.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t compare to the lotions at the salons for sure.  </li>
            <li>the bottle is moderate at best.  </li>
            <li>Better off spending $10 more dollars and get a better lotion like Conceited or Luminary.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who enjoys getting the perfect brown tan.</li>
            <li>I totally love this product.</li>
            <li>I would purchase this immediately again. :)</li>
            <li>Love the lotion</li>
            <li>But that being said it works very well and am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Love this product for couple years.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>The lotion is OK.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I know there&#x27;s gotta better out there.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, and the silky feeling after I&#x27;ve tanned.</li>
            <li>love the bronzing effect</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel after each use</li>
            <li>love the way it smells and makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Most importantly the color I achieved was a bit of brown and NOT orange!</li>
            <li>love it  </li>
            <li>No nasty streaks!!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to tan.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS LOTION.</li>
            <li>I wish I had a better review because I was looking forward to using this product.</li>
            <li>and like that one better because I feel like the bronzer is better .</li>
            <li>I do switch between the two and am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Gotta love amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast, smells great (no stinky bronzer smell) and you can go about your day without feeling like you have grime on your skin.</li>
            <li>most bricks are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that you aren&#x27;t supposed to shower until many hours after tanning, but the smell leaves me no choice.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it works just as well as the stuff they charged me twice to three times what this cost to get through Amazon...amazing amazon.</li>
            <li>gotta love em.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion and have used for years.  </li>
            <li>Top rated tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>the smell is ok.</li>
            <li>I felt better about myself.</li>
            <li>I have heard that the darker the lotion color the better results you will get.</li>
            <li>I am darker than most of my friends and they look up to me and are always asking to borrow it.</li>
            <li>I love it, if you wanna get sexified try this out.</li>
            <li>It works in both areas. :)</li>
            <li>Its okay, dont think i would buy it again though.</li>
            <li>My husband even used it on his white legs and was really happy with the results!</li>
            <li>I found most of them on here from the $15.00 - $30.00 range (again, a bit upset with myself for falling for the salon girls).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Would recommend for a cheap and effective tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li>No nasty after smell either!</li>
            <li>that is) and have never been so satisfied with a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many tanning lotions at all still.</li>
            <li>I have been able to maintain my color by going to the salon two or three times a week.</li>
            <li>It works well, has a nice scent and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>and I feel it Swanky Girl worked slightly better.</li>
            <li>Although the ingredients show it contains DHA (Dihydroxyacetone), I have used cheap DHA products from Walgren and Walmart that were much more effective.  </li>
            <li>love this product and you can&#x27;t beat the price...</li>
            <li>I am going to try the x100 by millenium and see if its better but who knows.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product...</li>
            <li>Love this item.  </li>
            <li>Works for darkening, so it is functional; I just love the tingle factor.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion</li>
            <li>able to lay in the pool on Sundays.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I do indeed love the texture and consistency of the Paint</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a tingle person, but I thought I would give this a try since everyone and their dog seems to love it.  </li>
            <li>Okay so the lotion i love</li>
            <li>I have used tons of tanning lotions and this one is seriously my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>It really helps with the tanning and it leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to have more effect faster</li>
            <li>but I am pleased with the results I got.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;tingler&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This lotion is ok.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, the moisture it provides, but this product does break out my skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to buys this one based off the amazon reviews and it was such a great decision!!!</li>
            <li>so i thought i better start getting my tan on</li>
            <li>A Must Try!!:)</li>
            <li>It seems to help somewhat but it&#x27;s  not my favorite</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Really love.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than at the tanning salon and works great.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I agave</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>BUT ITS OK , THE SHIN FIMING IN THIS</li>
            <li>Overall happy with product!</li>
            <li>I went for a motorcycle ride and wore a tube top and put it on my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting more bronzing effect from this lotion.</li>
            <li>When I leave the tanner I don&#x27;t seem to have that tanner smell that so many lotions leave in their wake.</li>
            <li>Was really impressed by the quality and also, the fact that you can use this both indoors and when tanning outside.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love the product.</li>
            <li>the areas it works best on are the arms stomach chest and back the legs</li>
            <li>Not that appealing of a scent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, feels, and the GRADUAL bronzing effect it delivers.</li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering; and not tropical like most lotions.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanning lotion of all time.</li>
            <li>like im better of just using baby oil.</li>
            <li>I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>Hopefully you have better luck if you purchase this.</li>
            <li>just not so sure if I would buy it again.</li>

            <li>It leaves your skin really smooth and the smell is nice</li>
            <li>I do not burn with this lotion at the tanning bed times that are appropriate for my skin tone, but I also dont purposely burn myself.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells good kind of like brown sugar, and it smelled okay after tanning, but I don&#x27;t really think it helped me tan.</li>
            <li>I order this lotion and was very pleased with how quickly I got it.</li>
            <li>When you first get out of the bed you look great, but it fades so quickly!</li>
            <li>Thanks Again!!!!</li>
            <li>I just want to say I am not payed to write this I am a real person!!!!</li>

            <li>Bronzes you up beautifully, and leaves your skin silky soft all summer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really bad, but could be better!</li>

            <li>I have tried other lotions this is very nice and smells great</li>
            <li>:) I swear, this helped me get an amazing tan really quickly.</li>
            <li>I give Paint it Black 4 stars because it does its job nicely for a great price!</li>

            <li>I couldnt believe how good this worked compared to everything else I have tried and its SUPER cheap</li>
            <li>I liked the smell and it went on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Tanning lotion is good smelling and super smooth feeling when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty fair skinned</li>
            <li>It smells so good and after the first couple times of tanning i noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled good when I first opened the bottle, but while I was applying it to my skin</li>
            <li>I saw no difference after a month, and I am pretty fair skinned.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice in the bottle, would agree it smells sweet like sugar/vanilla.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned</li>
            <li>This has lasted a long time and smells great!</li>
            <li>The designer skin line seems to be pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>Lotion worked pretty good to get my tan going.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that many have used it and are just fine.</li>
            <li>Excited to get my tan on!</li>
            <li>and I will def say NOT DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t turn into that \\&quot;tanning bed smell\\&quot; and works well!!</li>
            <li>finally have nice tan!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, yes; but more importantly, it gives me a nice rich bronzed hue (not orange).</li>
            <li>Smell was pleasant but did not Bronze as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Excellent tan &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry skin.  </li>
            <li>works as promised, and i am loving the quick tan.  </li>
            <li>The smell was OK not to strong</li>
            <li>Works quickly, and gives you a nice tan glow.</li>
            <li>It glides on easily and is absorbed quickly and because of the silicone emulsion, my skin feels great for hours and never feels sticky or greasy when I use this.</li>
            <li>, is super hydrating AND turns you a nice brown.  </li>
            <li>Definatly recommended for anyone who wants fast results and beautiful tanned skin!</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of tanning lotion from this seller, and I&#x27;m *sold*!  Fantastic service, awesome pricing, and...</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>There are many tan accelerants/moisturizers that have a cheap perfume scent to them that might smell good upon first use, but after a while they tend to have this waning fragrance that you can&#x27;t wait to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for very long to see how fast it tans, but it goes on good and smells great!</li>
            <li>I love the way it spells and works just fine  , I have been buying tanning lotions from places I use to go to Tanning</li>
            <li>im sure it will be fine</li>
            <li>Love it and got here quick!</li>
            <li>The after tan smell is definitely the best part (which is rare!).</li>
            <li>It worked pretty good but due to price and results it wasnt the greatest.</li>
            <li>They had lots of different products to choose from and at very good prices.</li>
            <li>I have used several high dollar lotions over the years and this by far, is the best quality , not to mention the best PRICE!</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>huge bottle was five bucks more, and it came in TWO days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was worried about becoming orange, but had no problems in that area.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, and feels great, but as far as darkness of color, it hasn&#x27;t done much for me.  </li>
            <li>I took the plunge, and so far I am happy.</li>
            <li>I liked this lotion, the smell was better than average, although the reviews of a great smell, etc....seemed a bit over the top to me.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well from the color I&#x27;ve developed but not the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I also received it quicker then what I had expected which was awesome!  </li>
            <li>Its a nice, light sweet scent without smelling like youre giving the coconuts a run for their money or like an over fried churro when your 15 min are up.</li>
            <li>Got better results with a cheap beauty supply store product.  </li>
            <li>if I sat in a bathtub filled with coffee grindes I&#x27;d get a better tan than I&#x27;ve gotten from using this.</li>
            <li>So far it has been great.</li>
            <li>It gives a great natural tan color too.</li>
            <li>Product arrived with a cheap piece of scotch tape over the top.</li>
            <li>also incapable of becoming tan without help</li>
            <li>This lotion works great and it giving me a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I got this product and WOW its great.</li>
            <li>I was very white and now have a beautiful tan I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments:)  </li>
            <li>far as the tanning qualities, it works great.</li>
            <li>I give it just an OK rating it was cheap</li>
            <li>Give it a couple tries, its wonderful!  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and it keeps us nice and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Smells really good &amp; is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a nice golden bronze.</li>
            <li>the smell is ok, ive smelled better but its not bad.</li>
            <li>Its a good tanning lotion and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It smells good and absorbs into the skin fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really give me a good tan.</li>
            <li>This is better then the 100x, the 100x makes you orange due to the bronzing in it, this one just gives nice tan and a great scent.</li>
            <li>i bought and tried this, once i went in water, my skin was all gooey and slippery and i looked like a shedding lizard, guessing this product is mostly for tanning bed, if your in the sun and laying on raft in pool, i would highly recommend Austalian Gold bronzing dry oil spray intensifier with color boost maximizer, for a great great tan,</li>
            <li>those who tan every day to every other day this is the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li>It looks really cool if someone&#x27;s playing some bass-type music, cuz I can strut like a pimp to it!</li>
            <li>Great scent, but not dark at all.</li>
            <li>after tanning only twice and using the lotion i have a good tan!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is now her \\&quot;go to\\&quot; lotion!</li>
            <li>so you could see where you apply and the spots you missed but other than that works excellent--</li>
            <li>Good lotion with dark bronzed just make sure you wipe your hands good then wash them when your done or your fingers will be orange</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price!</li>
            <li>Liked how light the lotion is and doesn&#x27;t have the normal tanning lotion smell but expected way more for a product that was selected as #2 of Top 10 Best tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel nice and silky post tan because it has silicone in it, but as soon as you get out of the shower you better have after tan lotion ready because you will get the \\&quot;tan</li>
            <li>Works great, smells good, no worries about leaving lines or uneven spots.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a caramel color and is easy to apply before your tanning session.</li>
            <li>Yes it spreads easily.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 3 stars because I think it would work better for someone that doesn&#x27;t have fair or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I get a nice even tan and the bronzer helps my stretch marks not stand out so much :)</li>
            <li>My skin tans relatively easily already though, and</li>
            <li>My skin does not tan easily</li>
            <li>A product like the purchased in a salon would  easily cost $30</li>
            <li>I tan fairly easily</li>
            <li>I tan easy</li>
            <li>&amp; you will be summer fun ready &amp; smell great.</li>
            <li>a great amazon price means I&#x27;ll definitely order again! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the texture, thanks to the silicone, and my skin still feels soft after my tanning session.</li>
            <li>really helps my skin turn nice pecan brown:)</li>
            <li>Smells like vanilla and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>therefore you know I do not tan easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and will not leave marks.</li>
            <li>and I would burn easily.</li>
            <li>which i tan really easy anyway</li>
            <li>My friend who tans easily used it also, but without result.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick though...</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get orange hands, and it smells really clean and cottony, which helps prevent a more burnt skin smell you get when using fruit scented lotions.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan easily</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a strong lotion with a lot of bronzing power,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had lotions before that all I wanted to do was gobhome and wash it off because it smelled so strong.</li>
            <li>It doesnt have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Initially before sun expose it smelled kind of good but not afterwards.</li>
            <li>I mainly got this lotion because it got generally good reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong either</li>
            <li>I thought with 50x that I&#x27;d be getting the darkest bronzing ever however I only got a nice textured good smelling lotion with what appears to be no bronzer.</li>
            <li>Extreme Silicone Auto Darkening Tanning Lotion 13.5 oz   is a great product you see results after your first tanning sesion and is also a great after tanning mositerizer.</li>
            <li>for the money, this lotion works better than most out there, and the price is right on.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and, while using this product I was able to achieve darker results faster than other lotions.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like Beauty in a bottle, you get a natural bronze tan with an awesome after tan smell and absolutely  devine, smooth and silky skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for about 2mths, already have a pretty nice tan.</li>
            <li>The best thing I can say about it is it smells good with almost no detectable scent afterwards and doesn&#x27;t make my Irish skin burn after 20 minutes in a regular bed.</li>
            <li>Today makes a week tanning agin, not on a every day basis and the beds here are not even as good as my normal tanning salon</li>
            <li>Excellent product but no sun screen got really dark</li>
            <li>It works pretty nice.</li>
            <li>After first use I got a nice color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice on very hot days, the stuff looks like a creamy brown coming out of the tube, it goes on and is nice and cool like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li>now almost a month later iv got a beautiful tan going on</li>
            <li>Just ok, Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>There was only a piece of scotch tape over the top of the bottle without any kind of seal around the top or between the bottle and the top.    </li>
            <li>It Black will help me reach my best color yet!</li>
            <li>but I thought it was fine.</li>
            <li>Paint it black tanning lotion is great!</li>
            <li>After using Paint It Black, I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>Paint it Black works great!</li>
            <li>Paint it Black is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I work outside a lot on a hot days with a lot of sun,this stuff works great!</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and easily</li>
            <li>Black works best as a tanning enhancer, in the tanning bed or the sun.</li>
            <li>the lotion for tanning bed paint it black is wonderful</li>
            <li>I dont see a expiration date on bottle but its working fine.</li>
            <li>So the first day I tried it I was very happy, so then the next day I put the paint</li>
            <li>so I assume it worked fine</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>and I actually have a pretty great tan!</li>
            <li>But im still using it because the odd smell doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it is an awesome tanning lotion with quick results!</li>
            <li>I do actually fine at 15 mins now)</li>
            <li>so i guess for some it works fine but not for me.</li>
            <li>I think this lotion has probably done a fine job of accelerating the tan.</li>
            <li>Applies easily and makes your skin feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last week and it worked great!</li>
            <li>It works fine as a moisturizing tanning lotion but thats about it.</li>
            <li>and I am fine.</li>
            <li>Black is that it smells great!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend uses it more than me and she loves it because she gets tan quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick results!</li>
            <li>outside(I don&#x27;t use tanning beds) smells good, and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel very soft, and I thought it smelled really good.</li>
            <li>Smells fine, goes on good, and leaves skin feeling AMAZINGLY soft!</li>
            <li>I see so many great reviews for this lotion, but it actually SHIELDED the bulbs from giving me my full tan.</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes your skin silky soft!</li>
            <li>I have loved using this lotion so far!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions, this by far has to be my favorite!</li>
            <li>It gives me such a nice tan while leaving my skin feeling super soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li>Not greasy and no unpleasant after tanning smell!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely urge anyone to get this that wants a great tan quick!</li>
            <li>This is a very popular auto tanning lotion, which gives a deep, dark, rich tan and the scent is great!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything about the claim that it is &#x27;firming&#x27;...who knows if those claims about anything really is accurate.</li>
            <li>, I had plateaued some, but I just used this on my legs and seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but I can alreay tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I know that this should be taken with a huge grain of salt but the lady that owns the tanning salon</li>
            <li>It felt great one and left my skin smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I also havent ever noticed any staining on myself or my clothes after using it which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>For the price you pay on Amazon this is a huge steal.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent of the lotion and its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>For what the product is worth, it was okay.</li>
            <li>Great smell and definitely increases your tan.</li>
            <li>I got 2 bottles for $27 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>and leaves your skin feeling smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>That was confirmed...</li>
            <li>Grab this up when it is this cheap, even working in a salon and getting a discount from reg prices</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, it applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion, even if your just starting or maybe trying to even out your tan.</li>
            <li>I  am happy to say I am back!</li>
            <li>The smell is so light and not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a great price obviously, but it&#x27;s just something to think about...</li>
            <li>Works very well and smells amazing</li>
            <li>So if you have light skin then this should work for you.</li>
            <li>Get this lotion if you can find it at a cheap price.</li>
            <li>We both have light skin</li>
            <li>I think it smells fabulous before and after tanning.</li>
            <li>I absolutly love this lotion and would recommend it to everyone wanting a golden brown tan from the tanning salon with no streaking marks.</li>
            <li>I have used many tanning lotions and can tell you first hand that this product is average at best.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>This tanning lotion gave me a great overall coloring.  </li>
            <li>It was silky and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feel awesomely smooth.</li>
            <li>I have fairly light skin, but I can tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>This product has a ncool bottle, and for so cheap</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t feel comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and helps keep you moisturized while tanning.</li>
            <li>It has a great instant tan with bronzers that don&#x27;t turn you orange!</li>
            <li>I was using a cheap Walmart lotion before I got this</li>
            <li>so happy not to be stuck wearing blue jeans</li>
            <li>I think  it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>When you tan it absorbs into your skin so when you leave the bed/hex the silicone leaves your skin silky smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>This lotion really gives you nice color when used in indoor tanning salons.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make you darker, turns u into a light orange shade.</li>
            <li>Anyways, not only does it smell great</li>
            <li>but it also goes on extremely smooth because its silicone</li>
            <li>but after I was done it reminded me of a combo of burnt skin and cheap body wash.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing this product and it has always worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy at all, but can have a smell after a while if you do not shower all day.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>how do they sell it so cheap?</li>
            <li>try it great price buy only from the Milleium site ......</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>and this has such great conditioners in it.  </li>
            <li>They wanted $68.00 for this lotion at my salon, I got it for $14.95 with free Prime shipping on here.  </li>
            <li>They wanted $68.00 for this lotion at my salon, I got it for $14.95 with free Prime shipping on here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked the results SO much, though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this years ago and it was great, but I recently purchased this again</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>Everyone always ask why is was so cheap compared to the tanning salon prices of 50-60 bucks.</li>
            <li>but I like the cheap price</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>After just one use, I can say it is a great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>overall its a great product</li>
            <li>It has a light floral smell.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this lotion.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth like body lotion and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>Thank you Millennium for such a great invention.</li>
            <li>I used it a few times at the beach because it says it works great outdoors, but I got no color at all!</li>
            <li>, it smells of light perfume.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been softer and the color is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Yes this lotion is silicone based and goes on smoothly, evenly, and does not require a &amp;#34;ton&amp;#34; of lotion to cover your body.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall great lotion.</li>
            <li>This probably is cheap but gives you an orange tint.</li>
            <li>this made me more golden that the Luminosity.</li>
            <li>I put a light sunscreen, and then this.  </li>
            <li>Price is fantastic compared to salons.</li>
            <li>I have used many different lotions and this one by far is the best, texture, smell!</li>
            <li>Smells good, works well, like the bronzers in it, gives u a natural looking tan</li>
            <li>I take a shower immediately after tanning and my skin was still soft after my shower so the moisturizers are of good quality and don&#x27;t wash off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice soft smell, not overpowering like many tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Good for someone who goes tanning frequently.</li>
            <li>I have used it 3 times so far and all has been good.  </li>
            <li>A good lotion if you go tanning several times a week, not so good for someone who doesn&#x27;t go tanning very often.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for outside use as well as tanning bed use although I saw better results with a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>II have fair skin and only go to the tanning bed three months out of the year, I have tried many lotions, and after reading the reviews I decided to try this lotion.</li>
            <li>skin feels really soft after tanning, it smells good also,</li>
            <li>I have fair soft skin</li>
            <li>You can really achieve a deep color and the smell is great!</li>
            <li>It smells good, and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job with enhancing my tan since most people can notice I&#x27;ve tanned after only a couple tanning visits.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>Make sure you drink enough water, lather with a good lotion after every shower, and this should be an ace in the hole for you.</li>
            <li>The initial vanilla scent is wonderful and it works very well without streaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product, I am fair and I have a very natural, deep tan that I am very happy with.</li>
            <li>Just a gorgeous, natural tan ... FAST!!!  </li>
            <li>It really works!!!  </li>
            <li>Company ships FAST!!!  </li>
            <li>Tans your skin really fast!!!  </li>
            <li>Saw results the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li>Gets you tanned soooooo much faster than with no lotion at all!!!  </li>
            <li>I really like this tanning lotion all together!!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make me orange at all, in fact it brought out a very golden brown that I couldn&#x27;t have achieved otherwise.</li>
            <li>I did try it a few times anyway, but it did not make me more tan at all!!!</li>
            <li>It comes out too light a color than the original.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, it goes on very smoothly &amp; absorbs very well!  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t generally allergic to lotions I&#x27;d tell you that this product is perfect, however, if your skin is sensitive I&#x27;d recommend staying away from this product.</li>
            <li>The first thing I want to say after using this lotion for about a week is that the product description word for word couldn&#x27;t be more accurate.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I expected at a great price!  </li>
            <li>Decent lotion, smells nice and isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li>I am a pretty advanced tanner, and I have been tanning for many years</li>
            <li>pretty much all the good lotions work</li>
            <li>Try this for sure, cheap and does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to for sure!</li>
            <li>I would very much recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>it works very quick and last a good while</li>
            <li>I have been using paint it black for about a month now and it works great, also my tan lasts more than a week.</li>
            <li>If you have a trip planned and need a quick tan this is great, but only if you are already a tanner.</li>
            <li>but I was glad to find this one just like the one I purchased for a much higher price at the tanning salon</li>
            <li>After one tanning session I noticed a significant boost in my color.</li>
            <li>I USED IT ONE TIME IN THE TANNING BED AND RECIEVED A SIGNIFICANT TAN..</li>
            <li>Probably would have worked even better in a higher level bed.  </li>
            <li>were i can purchase a sample first instead of getting stuck with a $20.00 bottle of junk,even if i have to pay more</li>
            <li>For the inexpensive price, this lotion is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t until I used this lotion that I could notice a significant darkening in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It also did not come in its original packaging, presumably to save on shipping.</li>
            <li>this item is well worth it for the price!</li>
            <li>For one, when you first put on the lotion it smells... okay.</li>
            <li>and...well, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>, it has a suttle fresh scent to it!</li>
            <li>What do you expect for it to smell like fresh linens!??</li>
            <li>I am an avid tanner and have worked at a tanning salon for many years.</li>
            <li>this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve not been satisfied with.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion lasted me over 6 months which is a really long time and also a great value.</li>
            <li>I have to say the first time I used this I fell in love.</li>
            <li>After reading, this one seemed to be one of the higher rated, and most bought.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this product after reading reviews.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I am not that familiar with the lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li>I like this lotion because it has a unique fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the fast results!</li>
            <li>rich color lasts longer than I thought it Would</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and was so excited to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>For me this lotions is just not cutting it!</li>
            <li>This product, on the other hand, has people around me exclaiming, \\&quot;Something smells good!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been getting significantly tanner ever since i started using this product.</li>
            <li>The smell was nice but the tan was normal .</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this lotion</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this lotion because of the PRICE...</li>
            <li>8 hours later, and it still has a nice smell!</li>
            <li>Maybe it got to hot and broke down the bronzers or something while shipping, smelled good, felt good but didnt do a thing for my tan.</li>
            <li>This lotion smelled great and made my skin super soft and silky and gave me a very nice dark color, i saw the results after just one use of this lotion...</li>
            <li>Also, the tanning lotion goes on smooth, actually smells good and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li>so i would get free super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells great and the silicone really makes your skin so so soft.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, smells amazing and definitely works for tanning.</li>
            <li>I have gotten such amazing color from this lotion, my skin is so smooth too!</li>
            <li>goes on clean and doesnt leave me greasy afterwords.</li>
            <li>I cant say enough how much i love this product its Amazing</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pleasant enough to tan before work and work all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned naturally and this gave me a nice dark color.</li>
            <li>Was very good lotion and gets you dark quick without the tingle.</li>
            <li>I am getting this old favorite!</li>
            <li>I figure if that works then its a special bonus</li>
            <li>You may not know what I&#x27;m talking about because most tanning salons use the large company brands</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>It smells like tanning lotion, nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this product.  </li>
            <li>I stopped at a gas station right after tanning, and the guy working asked what perfume I was wearing!</li>
            <li>THEY ARE RIGHT!</li>
            <li>i made sure i rubbed it in really good until dry but didnt have a chance to wash my hands!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly &amp; smells good but other than that, it was a waist of my 13 dollars!</li>
            <li>It was hard for me to find a product that did not smell like a girl -- this works great!  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the light refreshing smell and that it is not a very thick lotion.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent (nothing like Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27; \\&quot;Warm Vanilla Sugar\\&quot; like another reviewer stated, thank goodness) and has little to no after-tan odor.</li>
            <li>it definitely works better than not using it..and its a very good price (considering what you get is actually real).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great accelerator for tanning; not much smell, but</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty fair naturally, so I have to work to maintain color.  </li>
            <li>I love how this lotion smells and feels on my skin, but I don&#x27;t really think it has the amount of bronzer it advertises.  </li>
            <li>It was equally as good as several that I had paid $60/bottle for at the salon!  </li>
            <li>so glad i did not pay that much 4 it</li>
            <li>but true)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning over a week using this lotion &amp; have gotten a nice tan so far</li>
            <li>I simply wanted a good tanning lotion that would help men tan betten in my indoor tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews on here before buying and everything they say is true</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and light and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>At this point I had already worked my way up to the full 10 minutes and was getting no where.</li>
            <li>it smells good, feels good, and the only problem i had was that i burn, but that&#x27;s just my skin type, so of course it could be different for someone else.</li>
            <li>It makes cool on the downlow or whatever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the people people that have used this lotion have noticed real antiaging effects.   </li>
            <li>My 3x bronzer (Hempology) works better and was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>i also love the color it works very well</li>
            <li>I bought this from a different seller a couple years ago and LOVED it....</li>
            <li>it works as a tanning lotion, very moisturizing, but i have used spellbound by designer skin with quadruple bronzer, and the immediate results are a lot better, i will probably buy that to use instead.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>Overall, it smells good</li>
            <li>Save your money and stick with the tried and true drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product, but</li>
            <li>It has an extremely wonderful, silky smooth feel - but it actually broke me out on my chest and around the back of my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>because I use alot most of the time when I go, you do not need to use much at all</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin soft and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li>I would NOT however purchase this lotion at full retail.</li>
            <li>(but I&#x27;m sure they would work better or at least as good).  </li>
            <li>Sort of sweet and summery.</li>
            <li>Has a nice soft feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have much scent, but I&#x27;m okay with that as I don&#x27;t like for others to smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tanning beds for quite a while, and this is the most unusual lotion I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even go the full time.</li>
            <li>Not enough bronzing in product and im fair skin</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a basic, good tanning lotion-</li>
            <li>Good touch up lotion if your someone who doesn&#x27;t go regularly.</li>
            <li>but this is a true brown color.</li>
            <li>I used this product last year and loved it.</li>
            <li>The lotion is perfect consistency, it&#x27;s not runny or so thick.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells like sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li>but thats not a bad smell...</li>
            <li>I read all sorts of good reviews on this product, how dark even the whitest person was able to get....  </li>
            <li>The smell not bad if you stay away from everybody.</li>
            <li>No, but its not a bad price.</li>
            <li>Smells like a tanning lotion, its not bad</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance is not bad though.</li>
            <li>I bought it because the price is not bad compared to some others</li>
            <li>Definitely not a bad choice</li>
            <li>Works really good and does not leave the after smell that most other tanning lotions leave on your skin!</li>
            <li>it smelled amazing and my skin was super soft for that day.  </li>
            <li>This one is my top choice,works very well taking your tan darker quickly.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that this product allows me to hit a tanning bed less often with good color.</li>
            <li>After reading so many good reviews,I just had to try Paint it Black.  </li>
            <li>Went on smooth, absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Fast and very friendly customer service.</li>
            <li>I tan pretty easily</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent, love the way my skin feels after using it, love how fast I got my tan back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing it soon to see how it compares, but honestly I&#x27;m kinda new to the whole tanning thing, and I have yet to try the entire Designer Skin line to compare these to, and they seem to be the most popular.  </li>
            <li>Each time I use it I get an amazing tan afterwards and certainly look much darker than if I tan with just oil or no lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t give you that burnt flesh smell like other lotions.</li>
            <li>Its ridiculously moisturizing and wonderful feeling for like hours after tanning.    </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Its also smooth and velvety when you apply it, it adds instant glow to your body and works amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different products and this one is better then most.  </li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly and on time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super picky.  </li>
            <li>quick turn around, a pleasure to do business with.</li>
            <li>I thought DS lotions were overpriced and made my skin super greasy.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I ordered and it was here the next day, Amazing service!</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice enough and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>but it reaches a point where you don&#x27;t get any darker and it does fade fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this to get a quick tan and that I did....</li>
            <li>Deliver time is super quick 3 day max.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It gives you a quick tan look.</li>
            <li>My friend told me about this tanning lotion because I was already using back in blaque (which is also awesome) and she said it will give my tan an instant boost.</li>
            <li>The lotion is light an not heavy, with no horrible smell to it.</li>
            <li>The thing I like the most about this particular lotion is the scent and the feel of it.</li>
            <li>so it dries quick and isn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li>Quick noticeable results.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.  </li>
            <li>For someone who doesn&#x27;t normally get dark, I am very impressed already.</li>
            <li>I bought this after deciding that I needed a quick tan before a weekend getaway.</li>
            <li>I am almost out of it and most definitely will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li>My skin seemed to absorb it quickly.</li>
            <li>but I felt like I ran out really quick.</li>
            <li>It arrived in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li>Worth the money if you want a beautiful dark tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this lotion if you&#x27;re looking to get color quickly, but not so dramatically that it&#x27;ll look like you spray tanned over night.</li>
            <li>but I will most likely be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind because I did get color results quickly</li>
            <li>This DOES NOT MAKE YOU SUPER TAN WITH ONE USE.</li>
            <li>love love love the paint it black</li>
            <li>Ok I wanted to purchase an inexpensive yet closest to high end quality tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>This is a really good tanning lotion, I noticed a good deal of a difference after the first, the second, &amp; now the third use.</li>
            <li>If you want to have a great dark color quick this is for you.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice smell unlike other tanning lotions that can be overpowering.</li>
            <li>I am an avid tanner -- very light natural skin tone but tans easily.</li>
            <li>I seen huge results just from the first tan.</li>
            <li>, it definitely gets you a nice golden brown tan!</li>
            <li>This is a great for people who cannot use tingle factor and want to get dark faster</li>
            <li>Helps to get a great, even, dark tan.</li>
            <li>This stuff gives you a nice deep rich brown bronze color.</li>
            <li>Great for the tanning bed and that dark look</li>
            <li>Very much recommended!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I have only used it once, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Great product for a really dark tan.</li>
            <li>Gives you a great dark tone, no orange look at all.</li>
            <li>great wife looks tan and dark</li>
            <li>Great lotion, for a decent price.. You actually get a lot of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>It seems to last pretty good too and not fade away so quick.</li>
            <li>I am trying a new product and hoping for better results.</li>
            <li>I love trying out new tanning lotions, it is an obsession of mine.  </li>
            <li>but I live marshmallows. :)</li>
            <li>It makes yuor skin feel great, less smell, you seem to tan quicker, and your tan lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>Paint it Black 50X indoor tanning lotion is a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>The price is wonderful, but as far as quality, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li>The paint it black works great.</li>
            <li>It Black, partly because of the great reviews and also because of the price.</li>
            <li>Paint it black tanning lotion works great</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn my fair skin a weird color, and it smells nice!</li>
            <li>I wanted this product to get a pretty good jump on the tanning season..and living in Southern California in April</li>
            <li>I use a variety of tanning products (some better than others) but this is the first one that I purchased that does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell even after tanning and the smoothness of this lotion allows it to go on easy.  </li>
            <li>The bronzers in it are strong, but not so much that it leaves steaks.</li>
            <li>Love this, will continue to buy it as long as its available!</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty fair right now, but I am Italian and tan very easily, so I can&#x27;t speak for those with naturally fair/pale skin.</li>
            <li>made my very fair skin pretty dark but wore off at first.</li>
            <li>The extreme silicone made my skin so soft and smooth, really helped my skin look great!!</li>
            <li>Fast service !!</li>
            <li>Our daughter is in love with it so far!</li>
            <li>I love this product so far!</li>
            <li>My wife and I were impressed with the product on our first order compared to much more expensive tanning lotions</li>
            <li>i got compliments the first day i was using it!</li>
            <li>This lotion does exactly what the company says it will!</li>
            <li>I really like this tanning lotion!!  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted !</li>
            <li>I have tried several tanning lotions but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty amazed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only gone tanning using this lotion a couple of times,and I love the color that I am getting!  </li>
            <li>this is absolutely real!!</li>
            <li>Same as the one I paid a lot more for!</li>
            <li>I could tell after my first use!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are the prices salon owners are paying in the first place before they up the price!  </li>
            <li>Then I went to Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and got a low end lotion there that worked better than this one!</li>
            <li>I have tried probably hundreds of lotions, but paint it black is by far the best..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- it does smell nice during the application, and the after smell certainly was more pleasant.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion because it had so many positive reviews and reasonably  priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine cream I suppose, but if you&#x27;re looking to darken your complexion then it doesn&#x27;t offer much.</li>
            <li>A good smell to the lotion and the color was dark &amp; rich .</li>
            <li>Seems to be a decent tanning lotion, specially for the cheap price...   </li>
            <li>I have tried many tanning lotions, and being an impatient person I LOVE strong bronzing tanning lotions, and I am not afraid to try them even though my skin is light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great, like a vanilla with a little hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>Even though my skin feels great right after putting it on, about 12 hours later my skin is dry and much more flaky than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really think I got very good color from it after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin feels good when I get out instead of dry like other products I have used and gives you a good color.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this lotion after reading all the positive reviews....</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and smooth going on.</li>
            <li>, it took me about a week of going everyday to get a great tan started.</li>
            <li>Definitely didn&#x27;t give me any amazing results.</li>
            <li>It is very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>although I did finish the bottle it kind of left a residue on my skin that would peel off sometimes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i recommend it 100% worth the money in gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Than I didn&#x27;t see if it was useful.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the smell too much, and I have used tanning lotions a lot better than this.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion shortly after buying my own tanning bed.</li>
            <li>so I think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only a nice moisturizer but gives no color at all if you are a non-tanning bed user.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel hydrated after tanning, and it makes my \\&quot;fair\\&quot; colored skin turn a nice brown color instead of red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times now and it doesn&#x27;t do anything more for me than the cheap stuff I buy at the store.  </li>
            <li>It gives my skin a golden tan.</li>
            <li>It gave me a great base tan, smells delicious, moisturize  really well as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice pump bottle of lotion, but cannot find any that&#x27;s on the same price range as the Millenium Brand.</li>
            <li>Absolutely No orange hue to my tan at All, good even coverage, and</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is really thick and goes on so smooth, your skin feels great before and after tanning.</li>
            <li>my legs are finally golden tan...NOT orange,</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the smell of the lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still doing my own investigation to see if the product is same lotion you would purchase from a tanning salon....</li>
            <li>This product was worth the money.</li>
            <li>I got a nice tan in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>Definetly worth the money</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest and it smells even worse after I tan.</li>
            <li>However, the smell after on my skin after I finished tanning was kind of gross.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite</li>
            <li>Worth every penny . . .</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>** was worth $99.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft as smooth and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Also, the effects were worth the price o</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly to get me a good base tan for the summer.</li>
            <li>My package arrived on time, but the lotion was not as good as i expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>I got a nice tan from using it overall</li>
            <li>My skin type is fair, but able to get tan by going slow in the beds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice enough when applied, but the smell of cooked sugar stays on my skin for hours and hours after tanning.</li>
            <li>The product is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Even with my extremely fair complexion, I have already seen my skin getting darker in just a week than I did in a whole month using an Australian Gold product.</li>
            <li>I was using Supre Sweet and Sexy bronzer and barely got a tan after a couple uses</li>
            <li>well worth it 100%</li>
            <li>i have fair skin with pink undertone.</li>
            <li>As far as it&#x27;s effect, I could have shown a bit more color</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>and I prefer more of a masculine scent</li>
            <li>Not bad when you first apply, but after tanning...</li>
            <li>However, this is good for people who are pale so they can build up a light tan and for paler people on a budget.</li>
            <li>You get nice color, however you will notice that it fades pretty quickly the next day..</li>
            <li>Its OK not what I expected when I read all the other reviews it sounded good , but it could have been better.</li>
            <li>It gets you dark really quick and that to me is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, especially for the price, I&#x27;ve used many different lotions and this one is definitely with the best ones.</li>
            <li>Unlike some lotions, you can continue to run errands after tanning and feel confident knowing that people are staring at you for other reasons aside from your \\&quot;just tanned\\&quot; odor :)  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get me too hot in the bed, the results came quick, and the price on Amazon compared to salon&#x27;s prices can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>It does a good job at giving me more color than i was getting, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The color with this bronzer is good, but it leaves my skin dryer than other bronzers.</li>
            <li>I thought i would give this a try because it was a pretty good price for tanning lotion and had good reviews, but i was wrong about it.</li>
            <li>Other than that you&#x27;re going to have to spend about 20 to 25 bucks for the good stuff on amazon.</li>
            <li>if you are a beginner tanner i highly reccommend that you do not use this product until you are fairly tan without bronzers because this is a dha rich concoction which will look orangy on you if you are not already fairly dark (think full time in a medium bed no burning tan)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many tanning lotions over the years and paint it black is the best one i&#x27;ve used so far, I definitely will not being switching anytime soon.</li>
            <li>You see the results right away.</li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>I returned it right when I realized and am still waiting for my refund.</li>
            <li>I put it on right before</li>
            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t expecting any color right away</li>
            <li>It will take you color and boost it right up.</li>
            <li>priced just right 2.</li>
            <li>by the second time it was a beautiful color and the third i was at the color</li>
            <li>the 50x is pretty good, but there&#x27;s not much difference in price, so go ahead &amp; get the 100x.</li>
            <li>The product works decent at first, but the color fades very quickly, even for a bronzer.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for that dark deep tan</li>
            <li>I had hoped for exceptional results, and didn&#x27;t even get minimal results.</li>
            <li>If it were anymore than 12 bucks I would have to take a star off, but if you want to be a cheap skate and still have a decent tan, get this.</li>
            <li>I am Irish and burn very easily (1 hr in sun</li>
            <li>okay, I switched to the 60x bronzer recently through the same manufacturer, smells better w/better results!</li>
            <li>I ordered this lotion primarily because of the large number of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>so I have tried them all, cheap runny ones, tingling ones to the ultra high priced ones.</li>
            <li>Dont let the cheap proce fool you, it is high quality.</li>
            <li>I work in a tanning salon and have used many products with alot less amount of bronzers and have recieved much better color.</li>
            <li>The best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve tried is Black Diamond, but I think that only because it reminds me of the Perfume</li>
            <li>Most lotions leave your skin dry after tanning , but this lotion keeped my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>So since I lost most of my tan, I was looking for something to get it back and quick.</li>
            <li>This lotion was pretty cheap, and it worked ok, but it wasn&#x27;t anything wondrous - I tanned with it, but it didn&#x27;t make me super super dark like it says it would.</li>
            <li>it will make you super dark, the lotion itsself is like a light pinkish brown tone very light color</li>
            <li>I have tried several different lotions, and this is definitely, by far, the very best.</li>
            <li>Def worth 13 dollars ;)</li>
            <li>so my tan is pretty brown golden.</li>
            <li>And of course, you have to keep it up by applying and tanning some more, but I go pretty sparingly, perhaps three times a month and still am a nice tan instead of my usual paleness.  </li>
            <li>I like the lotion because one it smells good and two it gets you really dark</li>
            <li>It has a good smell (not like some of the other lotions that smell like &amp;#34;tanning bed&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>Wanna get a good dark tan?</li>
            <li>It smells yum, good price, gets you dark after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really good, dark tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I certainly doesn&#x27;t make you darker quickly.  </li>
            <li>then your going to spend a little more but get lots more in return.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the price of this lotion, esp since so many dark tanners are around $50 at the salon!</li>
            <li>and if it was priced about 40% lower I would say that its a good deal but keep in mind that this is just average bronzer not any different than the free or cheap samples that they offer you at the tanning shops.</li>
            <li>It does give you a nice golden (not orange) tan but will fade fast if if you don&#x27;t go tanning on a regular consistent basis.  </li>
            <li>After going about 3x a week and not seeing much result as quickly as I wanted to (I&#x27;m getting married next summer/have engagement pics coming up soon and don&#x27;t want to look like Casper), I decided to look for a lotion that would make me darker more quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I was new to tanning, it was cheap, and it had about 175 raving reviews.</li>
            <li>I will certainly recommend you to my Friends!  </li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I have used where I have noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and was excited to use this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using currently isn&#x27;t as good as the one I previously used.  </li>
            <li>Applies easy and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Got this product and it&#x27;s good for the use and gives me a slight tan</li>
            <li>This is the first time my fair skin has ever been this dark.</li>
            <li>Iy absorbs quickly and has really accelerated my tanning process.</li>
            <li>, I love it\\&quot;, and we all know 16 year olds rarely notice anything except their next text</li>
            <li>I have always loved these products but after using Black and Tan this seemed to not give me any color.</li>
            <li>My big concern is that the bottle had no seal on it, so how do I know that it wasn&#x27;t filled with just a cheap lotion that has no tanning effects at all?  </li>
            <li>While the lotion is moisurizing and does leave your skin smelling good - not like your typical tanning chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy when I found tanning lotions on amazon for such LOW PRICES!</li>
            <li>I would say for my intentions of going from ghostly white to nice bronze were accomplished.</li>
            <li>Next i used hempz 25x bronzer in a blue bottle and that stuff was great.  </li>
            <li>The bronzers work great and don&#x27;t cause an orange tint and last about 3 days for me (with daily showers).</li>
            <li>then the super sweet fruity smells that most other tanning lotions smell like.</li>
            <li>Also, feels great on my skin for the first few hours, very moisturized and silky.</li>
            <li>As a fair skinned person, I want something with as much bronzer as possible, without turning orange, so that I don&#x27;t have to fry myself looking a normal shade of tan.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread very well, it just absorbed right in.  </li>
            <li>This is the first lotion that I have used where I really saw results quickly</li>
            <li>Item was shipped super fast and was exactly what I wanted..</li>
            <li>particular lotion is a bronzer, so it does not have the tingle factor (not a fan of tingle factors!!).</li>
            <li>the l0ti0n came very fast and was just what was advertised.</li>
            <li>I am using this and another spray bronzing spray that has an spf 15 since skin cancer is a very real thing.</li>
            <li>and I went through this bottle very fast.</li>
            <li>Got here very fast.</li>
            <li>and it was shipped to me very fast.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a great smelling lotion that will get you a very nice base tan and doesn&#x27;t have any tingle, this is for you.</li>
            <li>i very very upset when it did not work</li>
            <li>It smells good and goes on just like any other moisturizer and the results are fast.</li>
            <li>it is ok isnt working like i thought it would, but has given me fast color, just not dark color</li>
            <li>Its almost like if you miss a day of tanning or don&#x27;t use the lotion one day you are significantly lighter so that was an upset considering that I don&#x27;t want to have to live in a tanning bed to keep my color.</li>
            <li>Maybe it only works for people who tan super easily.</li>
            <li>Smells good very light colored and very watery and thin</li>
            <li>ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to get a nice deep color I highly recommend looking into some Ed hardy products.</li>
            <li>you can see the difference after one use and the smell is soft and floral unlike many others with bronzers that high.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for the past couple of weeks and the results are just amazing!  </li>
            <li>But ok overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it may work well for others, but seems to not like my skin and doesn&#x27;t want to last.</li>
            <li>It gives you a longer lasting and better looking tan.  </li>
            <li>Product gives you color with first application, but does not turn you orange.</li>
            <li>Would not be my first scent choice, but it DOES NOT stink.</li>
            <li>I just used this lotion today for the first time</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t tan for more then 10 min each time &amp; after looking at product only putting it on my legs.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is only okay.  </li>
            <li>Color was okay but washed away in shower (several hours after tanning).</li>
            <li>This lotion left my skin a lovely goldon brown</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product; instead I would suggest spending some extra money on a better quality lotion.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because it seemed that every review said it smelled like something different.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect too much because it was around 13 dollars, but that&#x27;s what I get for thinking!</li>
            <li>It was my first indoor tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product before and it was normally sealed and full.  </li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li>But - it really does!</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I went in one time with no lotion at all, and got pretty red/tan...</li>
            <li>I first used it before taking a Caribbean cruise.</li>
            <li>The lotion which I just received in the mail smells and feels EXACTLY how the lotion which I just ran out of feels</li>
            <li>I even bought another bottle when after I used up the first one.</li>
            <li>so using the tanning booth is pretty convenient.  </li>
            <li>I used this lotion for the first time ever yesterday</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I have used that wasn&#x27;t Designer Skin brand.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d definitely buy it again :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I could ever tan this fast!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and light.</li>
            <li>Tans legs very well!</li>
            <li>I just wanted a cheap lotion to tan and was pleasantly surprised.   </li>
            <li>Sometimes I layer this with a better bronzer just for the extra skin goodies.</li>
            <li>I can tan 3 days in a row in a higher level bed and stay tanned for over two weeks before I start to fade.  </li>
            <li>so it really works for me!</li>
            <li>I did burn the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>

            <li>Very inexpensive tanning lotions!</li>
            <li>First off, when I recieved this lotion mine smelled like bath &amp; body works coconut lime verbena &amp; when I&#x60;m finished tanning</li>
            <li>I decided to try a different lotion that had more bronzers in it.</li>
            <li>The smell (when you first put it on) reminds me of vanilla and spice.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my tan after the first use.</li>
            <li>A great price and brought me at least 4 - 5 tones darker in 2 weeks with 3 days a week use.</li>
            <li>I switched to denim and diamonds by swedish beauty, I personally like it a lot more.</li>
            <li>i just started tanning again indoors for the  first time in years.  </li>
            <li>one one arm first and test out the results.</li>
            <li>That being said, I will most definitely be buying Paint</li>
            <li>but the results are maximized when I use it on the higher level beds.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon vs purchasing at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how watery this product was and how light the color of the lotion seemed.</li>
            <li>It literally made me so tan the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Not the real thing!</li>
            <li>The price of 5 bottles here is the same as 1 bottle at my tanning place and this works better</li>
            <li>I noticed color after the first time using it.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and it was here the next day!</li>
            <li>I first came across this lotion from a client in the tanning salon</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>first off..</li>
            <li>First off...</li>
            <li>after I&#x27;m done tanning it smells exactly like when I put it on..</li>
            <li>This product works BETTER outside without sunscreen</li>
            <li>After use this product smells exactly like it does when</li>
            <li>than that, it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;Enhances tan even after first use.</li>
            <li>never did it give me streaks or smell funny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving 4 stars bc when I first received my package</li>
            <li>Best tanning lotion out there expensive if you buy in salon 50$ when i saw it for 10.00 per bottle</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>get me wrong, it&#x27;s still a very good tanning product!</li>
            <li>Big bottle however just wished it worked better.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have bought this lotion, and I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thank you i really appreciate!</li>
            <li>and this is one of the first ever tanning lotions that I started using when I would tan</li>
            <li>It worked for me in just the first week.</li>
            <li>For my first tanning lotion, I could say it does the job.</li>
            <li>and when I used it for the first timeI saw definate results..</li>
            <li>This is the first bronzer that I used and it worked first time I used it..</li>
            <li>This is not a fake post</li>
            <li>I used this product since the first of March.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t satisfying enough.</li>
            <li>I recommend this lotion to anyone that wants a darker tan!</li>
            <li>After the first use I&#x27;m darker then all my friends that use spray tans and tanning beds.  </li>
            <li>Last summer I got so  many compliments on my tan</li>
            <li>The ones for $100.00 at the salon actually did not have stunning reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is probably my second favorite lotion I have tried, my first being made by matahari.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty much no complaints!  </li>
            <li>The bottle says \\&quot;auto-darkening tan technology\\&quot;, but unless you have a tanning bed available to you, I did not see any natural bronzing or darkening going on after a diligent use of this product for two weeks.    </li>
            <li>Im pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than the salons prices, same lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be back again and again!  </li>
            <li>Pretty Barbie</li>
            <li>and i got hooked and used that first, so</li>
            <li>But maybe for someone else it will have better results, everyone is different.</li>
            <li>it really is!</li>
            <li>I want to first speak of some of the reviews</li>
            <li>It smells okay, but my tan actually faded using this product.</li>
            <li>I suggest using a smaller pouch of this product before purchasing the bottle to make sure you wont break out from it.</li>
            <li>Im getting married in 2 months</li>
            <li>I use with a tingle lotion by the same company and they magic together.</li>
            <li>Much better than paying $100 for paying for same thing at tanning salon.</li>
            <li>This is my first tanning bed tanner and it works well.  </li>
            <li>The stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li>The first two to three weeks using tinglers</li>
            <li>I will also add that if you&#x27;re looking for a bronzer with more instant effects, this is not the lotion for you.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty fare skinned.</li>
            <li>Compared to how much the salons charge for lotions, this is a steal!</li>
            <li>Reviews really do help me when ordering a product!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I am an avid outdoor tanner.</li>
            <li>I am going back to my favorite Hawaiian tanning oil.</li>
            <li>(I go 15 minutes in the Hot bed, or 10 in the stand up)</li>
            <li>I was at a stand still in my tanning and within the first use of Paint</li>
            <li>First time I used it I seen a difference</li>
            <li>The exact sale lotion as the tanning bed places sail for 1/3 the price I say</li>
            <li>The smell is great, it&#x27;s not overpowering whatsoever and there is no after tanning &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; at least not that I have or</li>
            <li>Spens $8 more and get something that will actually work.</li>
            <li>Arrived much quicker than I was expecting!</li>
            <li>i would definitely repurchase. :)</li>
            <li>so much cheaper than any tanning salon!</li>
            <li>I tan within a week if I use it consistently along with sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>It may not glide on like Bronze bunny, but pretty close.</li>
            <li>The bronzers hold its color pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the product but this is the second time I have ordered this product and it claims to have been delivered but wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Well, first of all, this shipment took 9 days to reach me.</li>
            <li>This is my first tanning bed lotion</li>
            <li>This stuff works and if your fair skinned like I am go to the tanning bed for a few weeks</li>
            <li>The clean, vanilla-y scent of this lotion makes it seem like you&#x27;re applying a fragrant body lotion, unlike many other tanning lotions on the market.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for women who are pale or haven&#x27;t tanned in a long time.</li>
            <li>Better smelling by far from the old bronzers!</li>
            <li>It rubs in like a true lotion, which so many other tanning lotions lack.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased some online in the past and they say the smell is pleasant</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty positive my tan place was getting $50 for it.     </li>
            <li>the smell was great and my skin felt amazingly soft afterwards, but i didn&#x27;t see a difference at all with a deeper tan after more than 6 uses (and I&#x27;m pasty pale white).</li>
            <li>It has Derma Dark bronzers in it, plus 20 vitamins and minerals to keep your face glowing and healthy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice bronzer but have used other lotions with stronger bronzer.</li>
            <li>good lotion, lasted a long time, not extremely smelly and no glitter (always a plus).</li>
            <li>Thanx, you have got yourself a new loyal customer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it goes on really nicely.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is really good for such a low price...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because I have a lot of better lotions and this one was only $15</li>
            <li>has a great smell, good for after you have a base tan.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the investment, especially for us light skinned folks.</li>
            <li>I had good results but decided to try more expensive Designer Skin lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly fair, I have some Irish back there somewhere in my family, but this stuff makes me look like Al Jolsen.</li>
            <li>Deep dark and beautiful</li>
            <li>Since the lotion is relatively cheap through Amazon it maybe ok to use with a stronger bronzer but using it solo is almost a waste.  </li>
            <li>It worked out really great and would reco this to anyone trying to get a good base</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel like it is as good as the \\&quot;Back in Blaque\\&quot; which is only 20X instead of 50X.</li>
            <li>The package arrived the next day thanks to my Prime (love Prime) and I opened one bottle to check out how the lotion smells.</li>
            <li>I am fair skin, freckled with blonde hair and blue eyes.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent Lotion for the price!</li>
            <li>but I definitely would put more effort into making sure its even and smooth than I would with basic tanning oil just to be sure... and use common sense</li>
            <li>I work at a tanning salon and we only carry certain lotions i went outside the salon looking for a good bronzer</li>
            <li>I am super dark and there is no nasty after smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I loved my old lotion, so it had a tough go at winning my heart.</li>
            <li>i used to take frequently to get a dark color tan, but now i tan less frequently becuase thi slotion give me awesome long lasting color  and great smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t all that great but no different than any other cheaper tanning lotion, consistency is alright, just did not work for me.</li>
            <li>got the lotions pretty fast in the mail though.</li>
            <li>I pretty much wanna eat my arm when I get home from tanning now.</li>
            <li>She has been an avid tanner for quite some time and really enjoys this lotion.  </li>
            <li>This was my first lotion that I purchased here and the name really sold me.</li>
            <li>fast shipping too thanks guys!</li>
            <li>This is my first real tanning lotion</li>
            <li>seems to be the real deal salons charge way too much for tanning products definatly recomend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that this product does not work very well if you put tanning oil on first...</li>
            <li>It worked fast and got me really tan!  </li>
            <li>a few hours later you will see the bronzing effect not to mention the silicone in this lotion leaves your skin soooo soft and it amells great!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m sold and sticking with the brand unless I stumble upon something better.</li>
            <li>It also has a strange smell that wasn&#x27;t appealing to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells great, like regular body lotion not fruity like other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>this product works very well for a first time tanner and a pro tanner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great lotion maybe for beginners getting their base tan, but not for someone who is more advanced.</li>
            <li>Allot cheaper then everyone else, and works just as good... if not better.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, and after 4 - 5 tanning bed sessions, I was as tan as I usually am in mid-summer.</li>
            <li>all in all, I reccommend this for tanners with a good base tan and a love for lotions :)  </li>
            <li>but it made my skin nice and dark</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice dark color though this does work.</li>
            <li>Within a week I had a nice dark tan.</li>
            <li>I was anxious to try it, and with good reason.</li>
            <li>It also gives you a nice color not orange or too dark.</li>
            <li>but would definitely never pay full price for this product!</li>
            <li>which I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for very long (maybe 30 mins on each side at most).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this in conjuction with the Black Storm and have had amazing results.</li>
            <li>that it feels soooo amazing because of the silcones in it, when i got out of the tanning bed, i seen a slight difference.</li>
            <li>I was recommended to buy &#x27;Paint it Black&#x27; by the women who own the tanning salon</li>
            <li>Just make sure it is dry before you put on your clothes because it will stain them.</li>
            <li>I like it done what it said but I liked black storm</li>
            <li>it leaves your skin super duper soft.</li>
            <li>I recieved my order VERY quickly and I would definitely buy from this user again.</li>
            <li>I heard that this is suitable for the natural sun as well; I have decided to test drive it and report back in the fall.  </li>
            <li>so I burn and get red easy.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great for anyone who loves a deep, dark tan.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to over apply, last long &amp; smells good.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a good even tan without making you look like you were left in an oven for to long.</li>
            <li>But...for me, I&#x27;m already pretty dark as it is, and I honestly can&#x27;t tell a diffrence in color when I get out of a 15 minute high pressure bed.</li>
            <li>It certainly does NOT smell like cotton blossoms or vanilla sugar.</li>
            <li>Not saying this product will work for everyone, but it certainly did for me.</li>
            <li>I chose this lotion because of the positive reviews and the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It remained dark in between tanning sessions and left a nice smooth texture to my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff slips right on, and it doesn&#x27;t take a long time for it to smooth out and soak in.  </li>
            <li>I bought this lotion primarily because I wanted something that smells different than the typical, weird-scented tanning lotion; I honestly didn&#x27;t think that it would work as well as it does.</li>
            <li>black sun tan lotion is the best value for the money , my wife used it and she never tans and with this sun tan lotion she did ,looks like she just came back from the beach , I used it all so and it made me look like I just came back from the tropics , I will buy it again</li>
            <li>Was affordable and was a pretty decent lotion.</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li>It certainly gets you bronze, and I am already very tan.</li>
            <li>the price is very good also you cant go wrong......</li>
            <li>The smell is kinda hard to explain, but its good</li>
            <li>I love the bronzer, it really gives you a little golden look as soon as you step out of the bed.</li>
            <li>but it it a HUGE change from my last lotion.</li>
            <li>I read that this stuff was amazing, and I like it, but I still feel like I was darker last summer using a different lotion.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a huge difference in skin tones between a fair-skinned Mediterranean and a fair-skinned Irish person.</li>
            <li>Seen great results in only a few days.</li>
            <li>also shipping was fast and product came intact.</li>
            <li>I guess I shouldn&#x27;t expect much for $14.00.</li>
            <li>It is not the best smelling stuff to start with, but after you tan it just stinks</li>
            <li>it did not make me bronze or increase my color at all really.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>AND THE SMELL IS VERY PLEASENT</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t noticed too much of a differnce and wouldn&#x27;t buy this lotion again.</li>
            <li>and i just started tanning about a month ago getting ready for summer.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to darken as much as White2Black does.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a month and have yet to really see whether it is accelerating my tan.</li>
            <li>it just adds a real boost to your indoor tanning.</li>
            <li>I think I will continue to buy this product because of its reasonable price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v heard of salons selling it for as much as 95.00,</li>
            <li>cuz u never know what your really getting from these internet sites(sad</li>
            <li>The transaction went very well-</li>
            <li>It really is.</li>
            <li>An employee at the tanning salon gave me lots of flack about buying lotion online and how it&#x27;s probably not even real lotion, etc.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be a return customer.</li>
            <li>did n0t give me as much c0l0r while tanning.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>For the amount of bronzers it says it doesn&#x27;t seem to help that much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like it really made me any tanner</li>
            <li>- it really helps you to get a darker tan</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this stuff people!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tingle and works fast</li>
            <li>For the price, I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a week and haven&#x27;t notice much difference..</li>
            <li>I want an accelerator not a bronser so much.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The lotion is very liquidy, almost like water.</li>
            <li>Shipping was SO fast.</li>
            <li>Fast ship time.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this lotion.  </li>
            <li>But I tried this stuff, and after just a couple uses, I&#x27;m ready to throw the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greasy and sticky, and never feels like it really absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>Spent a lil more on austrailian gold vintage gold</li>
            <li>but I tend to lose my tan extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>So if you want fast results without frying yourself this lotion is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>haha..</li>
            <li>I have tried it and is shows not as much \\&quot;darkening\\&quot; and I was expecting...</li>
            <li>Made tanning in the sun so much easier.</li>
            <li>i thought that the 50x bronzer would be too intense for me</li>
            <li>my tan is now much lighter...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re really tan</li>
            <li>you look really tan</li>
            <li>and this really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my color.</li>
            <li>and I tan really well,</li>
            <li>And the price difference from these as opposed to Designer Skin lotions is just too much for me to ignore, so I stick with Millenium Tanning.  </li>
            <li>The results were fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t enhance tan much.  </li>
            <li>Have been passing it around at the family pool because everyone is very envious of my tan this year.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and it really did help darken me fast.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it that much</li>
            <li>really like it</li>
            <li>much thanks</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t not stink and rubs in very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy that does tans very often.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have not burned at all, even after I started off at 11 minutes, and my skin is moisturized very well after I lay in the tanning</li>
            <li>But i think you just test it out before you get the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well for me</li>
            <li>Again, the problem could have been that I didn&#x27;t get the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>Expected better results.</li>
            <li>I did intend on getting so much darker than I am</li>
            <li>it get you really dark,within 2 session</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t done much for me when it comes to bronzing.</li>
            <li>Such a smooth formula.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Tanned with it 4 times and was very tan.</li>
            <li>then it probably isn&#x27;t real..  </li>
            <li>This product smells like Vanilla Ice Cream, or something very sugary vanilla that ants would like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really did not work...</li>
            <li>As another review said, I think it actually didn&#x27;t let the booth tan me, like it blocked the light.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>We might not be getting the real thing - or maybe it&#x27;s expired.</li>
            <li>The bronzers work really well in this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive and works really well.</li>
            <li>I have been using since I purchased it and have not noticed much.</li>
            <li>so much cheaper than if you buy it at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It did work very well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product because of the price.</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>so I was starting off from scratch, no base tan or anything.</li>
            <li>My theroy of tanning beds are; the employees try to push tanning lotion on people, and I really don&#x27;t think that tanning lotion works.</li>
            <li>BUT MILLENNIUM REALLY OUGHT TO WORK ON THAT SCENT.</li>
            <li>This product does help with the color, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t have much of a smell when I applied it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned, blue eyed blond hair</li>
            <li>I really feel darker than I have ever been.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t spend much money on this</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not going to complain to much.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews and assumed because I tan fast</li>
            <li>However when using it I did not notice any real difference in my tan, not even immediately after tanning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a session, the silicone leaves  your skin very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they worked very well together.  </li>
            <li>Also I find putting it on a day before tanning and the day after really helps with results.</li>
            <li>I got the lotion fast.</li>
            <li>but my last purchase made me splotchy, and as you know those lotions aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned and tan</li>
            <li>the darkening factor I don&#x27;t notice much.</li>
            <li>I like this product although I don&#x27;t have much experience with tanning.  </li>
            <li>My husband has olive skin and it didn&#x27;t really help him tanning, but I like it.</li>
            <li>and I get fast results.</li>
            <li>And it does it fast too</li>
            <li>I can no longer afford to blow that much money on one bottle of lotion</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a fantastic tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>and I became very tan.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of difference in my tan.  </li>
            <li>There were two nights that I absolutely could not sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves the smell.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing to help tan my legs/arms</li>
            <li>I was really REALLY wanting it to work</li>
            <li>and I really tried to like it</li>
            <li>Who wants to spend&lt;br /&gt;$100 when you can spend $15?</li>
            <li>Just be careful, make sure to test it on yourself as recommended.</li>
            <li>My bottle was absolutely the real deal.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave any bronzer residue on clothes or hands but really works.</li>
            <li>No tingle, not tooo much bronzer,</li>
            <li>This lotion is very comparable to a $8 lotion at Walmart.</li>
            <li>however, the one thing that i absolutely cannot stand about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li>i absolutely cannot stand how i smell.</li>
            <li>is when I really started to appreciate the color it gave me.</li>
            <li>and it really help you to get color faster.</li>
            <li>this tanning lotion works very well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but this stuff worked really well</li>
            <li>I could really tell it helped me tan quicker.</li>
            <li>This lotion does work really well</li>
            <li>I will say that my skin takes very well to tanning...</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t put a whole bottle on yourself, it won&#x27;t be greasy.</li>
            <li>and it really work like a</li>
            <li>The only lotion that has given me faster results are lotions with tingle which I can&#x27;t use anymore because my skin has become more sensitive.</li>
            <li>This lotion should be used only after a nice base tan is gained if you want the best results.</li>
            <li>Male tanners (my gf borrowed it and liked it too, so female tanners too)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting on my 2nd bottle to arrive, I&#x27;ve gone to the tanning bed every spring to prepare for summer and this has been my favorite lotion by far and the cheapest.</li>
            <li>I will attempt to use the rest of this bottle to not waste, but I will for sure be going back to California Tan products!!!!!</li>
            <li>use a more natural face bronzer or just let it be slightly different colors and let it be..</li>
            <li>I have noticed a nice color after a few uses.</li>
            <li>This product smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that icky tanning bed smell.</li>
            <li>It keeps skin soft and right after you look very tan with a glow and the tan does stay.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try paint it black and even after the first couple times I tanned, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I instantly noticed that my skin was darker after tanning, but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li>I keep wanting to try new ones and this is always better (including Solid Black, which is supposed to be a better version of this).</li>
            <li>and wow they were right.</li>
            <li>so ridiculously soft right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this stuff works for other people, but try to get a sample packet before you buy a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>It gives me a good color &amp; I don&#x27;t get red, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make me stink after tanning like some other lotions do.</li>
            <li>My main problem with it is that the smell is very strong and is less than desirable and it seeps into everything (e.g. clothes).</li>
            <li>Love this stuff because EVERY OTHER tanning lotion on the market (and I&#x27;ve tried about a hundred) make me smell HORRID when I get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>From other users reviews of this product I thought it would have smelled better.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes like most other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a while and just used it again today, and it reminded me of why I like other lotions better.</li>
            <li>Better results with this lotion than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t till the last week that I started using it and this Is Not the original Paint</li>
            <li>Most other lotions leave me itchy for days even after I shower</li>
            <li>For $15.00 I couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal and at first I was a little unsure about it, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t noticed that it works any better than any other lotion.</li>
            <li>Better stick to other well known brands.</li>
            <li>this product works pretty well, as far as i know!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t burned using it, unlike many other tanning lotions...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I would buy this product again because there is so many other products out there that I would like to try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still to my other one, it gives me more color.</li>
            <li>I have compared it to other lotions, and this seems to work just as well or better.</li>
            <li>it goes on easily and smells good before tanning, but for some reason after the tanning bed I just smell AWFUL (reminiscent of cooked skin), but because of the great price I can bypass that factor.</li>
            <li>but you smell clean and presentable enough for work buddies to not notice.  </li>
            <li>Works decently think I&#x27;m ready for something stronger though</li>
            <li>This lotion gives a nice and quick base color as well as a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and live where its difficult to get any sun.  </li>
            <li>My only down point is the scent is not as good as others.</li>
            <li>I guess I will know for sure if it happens to be bad after a few more sessions, but I can already tell that it is great.  </li>
            <li>I guess I will know for sure if it happens to be bad after a few more sessions, but I can already tell that it is great.  </li>
            <li>Ive actually had this for quite a while but just recently started using it, I&#x27;m really light skinned and its made a huge difference for me as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I normally use Bombshell by Designer Skin, but was willing to try some new things.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Australian Gold fan, but decided to give something new a try.</li>
            <li>and I waited six hours on the first time I used it to shower and eight hours the second time I used it to shower the color washes right off.</li>
            <li>Does what you need it to do, considerably cheaper here on Amazon then at your local tanning salon where it is 70.00 + easy...</li>
            <li>I ended up paying a whole lot more for Aphrodisiac at the salon because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of Paint it Black.</li>
            <li>it Black goes, I read the numerous positive reviews and decided to try it - and very glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I am still very new to tanning</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells &amp; how dark it makes me.</li>
            <li>Also, I haven&#x27;t really noticed my tan getting any darker than it normally would.  </li>
            <li>So far its one of my favorites and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I am pretty busy</li>
            <li>As far as color I believe that it helped me tan and not a fake color.</li>
            <li>I have recently begun tanning indoors and this lotions is the key to my beautiful dark tan.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on my tan, and I&#x27;ve never been that dark in my life.  </li>
            <li>Also the consistancy is more of a tan color and its the consistancy of an average lotion...</li>
            <li>I would say you may can get 15-20 full body uses out of one bottle, but don&#x27;t expect it to last all su mmer.  </li>
            <li>I tan pretty well, and most lotions usually help excelerate the process with me, but this one, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product 110% to anyone who is interested in getting a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Obviously for the price, this lotion is not as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>For me I get the same results or better, with non greasy skin for cheap with Paint it Black!</li>
            <li>I like the smell of it and it seems good, just enough bronzer to make a little difference.</li>
            <li>This might just be my new go to lotion!</li>
            <li>I literally don&#x27;t think I could live without it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to try a whole new routine where I&#x27;ll be using Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell 100x one day,</li>
            <li>I really try to get something new every time I need lotion.</li>
            <li>I was curious about this product and hoped for amazing results, but the lotion fell short of all expections.</li>
            <li>On Black 50X works well in the way of moisterizing and helping give a better tan.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to notice a difference after tanning with paint it black compared to others I have used</li>
            <li>Paint it Black is my FAVORITE lotion EVER.</li>
            <li>I feel that Paint it Black gives me somewhat of color and extends my tan somewhat, but I have used tanning lotions that give me a lot better results in all aspects.</li>
            <li>So the black bottle looks more for men.</li>
            <li>Black is my favorite bronzer without a doubt.</li>
            <li>it Black is up there in my top 5!!!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love Paint in Black.</li>
            <li>I will use it until it is gone, but will more than likely try something else next time.</li>
            <li>It has a decent bronzing quality to it as well.</li>
            <li>Decent product for the money.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion because 1-there were decent reviews, and 2-I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>As far as moisturizing, I don&#x27;t really know too much about that</li>
            <li>I actually bought this on eBay for about the same price, because I wasn&#x27;t able to use PayPal through Amazon for some reason.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to everyone that wants to get a golden tan.</li>
            <li>but I have never tanned this quick in only 4 sessions in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth and does not make you smell weird after.</li>
            <li>I got some good color after only using a few times</li>
            <li>I am not at all pleased with this &amp; would like to send it back &amp; get my money back!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super white and this makes me look as if I&#x27;ve been to the beach.</li>
            <li>The product works decently well..</li>
            <li>Smells decent.</li>
            <li>but I felt like I got decent color from it.  </li>
            <li>There are two options from the same company that made this  &#x27;above&#x27; this lotion (there may be more now)</li>
            <li>It really makes you darker &amp; leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>the results are amazing as well, i noticed a big difference after just the first few times using it.</li>
            <li>but at least it&#x27;s safe!</li>
            <li>It gives you a very natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li>I have been using indoor tanning bronzer for a few years &amp; tried many different products with various results &amp; I do not believe that the product I received is anything more then a scented lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend washing your hands after application or you will get orange streaks in between your fingers.</li>
            <li>im 21 and have been tanning since i was in high school.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly and will probably re-up when I run out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any price-savvy tanner.</li>
            <li>Their tanning beds don&#x27;t have high power and adjustable levels</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I tan in a high pressure bed two times a week</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this is so highly rated.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, last a long time, and really gets my skin dark.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion, not only am I of Irish descent and is very faired skin but my skin is ver sensitive to products.</li>
            <li>I am interested in trying out the other products similar to this one!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scent is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Honestly it was not what I initially thought it was due to the name it gave.</li>
            <li>I have used other products from Millenium and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to purchase it because I&#x27;m pretty pale and don&#x27;t tan really easily.</li>
            <li>first time I saw major results.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping for a little bit more boost with the \\&quot;50x\\&quot; bronzer.  </li>
            <li>spend a little more than this a look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Cost a little more but quess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Wish I could darken a little more with this product as I have with others.</li>
            <li>It has given me a little color, but I tan better without lotion.</li>
            <li>Smell was OK and was a little greasy.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell, but is definately decent enough to handle!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly &amp; the bronzer doesn&#x27;t leave a orange coloring behind highly recommended &amp; came very fast &amp; sealed</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other lotions and is easy to evenly apply</li>
            <li>yet so I have not very many things to stack it up again besides the Swanky Girl Temptress Cafe that I&#x27;d used for years, but I paid 3x more for it</li>
            <li>I was excited when I read the positive reviews about how dark this lotion has made others...</li>
            <li>It is clear to me that the whole time it was this lotion, and I stopped using it immediately.</li>
            <li>Maybe this lotion works well but just make sure you buy it from a reputable dealer as I clearly got a fake product.</li>
            <li>Gives a great fake tan after you put it on.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading all the reviews and everyone saying how great it was, but I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li>I was shocked and very happy that I bought from AMAZON</li>
            <li>so much I think I&#x27;m going back first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I normally use Worship me by Designer Skin but I after reading the reviews on Paint</li>
            <li>I tried this on a lark since I had just run out of White2Black (my normal lotion).</li>
            <li>The tanning lotion I bought is normally 100 dollars in retail sale, but I got it for 13.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, and I have tanned in the past where I was going everyday almost and had tried many different lotions.</li>
            <li>Normally at the salon its about 50 per bottle</li>
            <li>&quot; Those are a few of my favorite.</li>
            <li>I will be buying a few more bottles soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some people may like the smell or don&#x27;t mind that heavy texture of the lotion.</li>
            <li>I am definitely a lot more tanned and didnt take long to gain color.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price here on Amazon verses the price in the actual tanning salons.</li>
            <li>When I received this I was so excited to try it because it seemed like it would work really well based on the claims and other reviews I read.</li>
            <li>Its only  worth about $5.</li>
            <li>After the third session of tanning, my skin came out golden brown.</li>
            <li>When I received the product it had some of the lotion (which is a tan color) dried around the top of the bottle opening.</li>
            <li>Definitely can&#x27;t beat it for the price, and totally worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I have seen trial sized lotions at my tanning place go for $7.99 and why would anyone buy that when you can spend just a few more bucks and get this?</li>
            <li>with this Lotion it makes the most of my few moments&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Overall, worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>the rest of me are ProTan Dangerously Sexy and Australian Gold Funky Monkey.</li>
            <li>had to wash my hands a few more times for it to disappear.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have used several different tanning lotions and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s given me a great color which is hard for me to get, because I have fair-ish skin that prefers to burn &amp; takes a long time to build a tan!</li>
            <li>I am new to indoor tanning and wanted a lotion that had high remarks...</li>
            <li>Now, if it was sold as a long lasting moisturizer with a slight bronze glow that washes off at the end of the day, it&#x27;s a great 5 star</li>
            <li>I have used this product twice so far and while I didn&#x27;t notice any results after the end of the first day, after the second day of using this product, I am definitely and significantly darker than I was when I woke up this morning.</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion because compared to other lotions i have tried it smells really good even after you have tanned wearing it, you don&#x27;t get that burnt fake tan smell.</li>
            <li>This product really helps getting a dark tan, and the smell is pleasant and not strong at all.</li>
            <li>(atleast in my experiences, if you put sunscreen on I&#x27;d give it a full hour to dry</li>
            <li>This is the second time I bought this particular lotion from amazon, as I am a seasoned tanner and lotion junkie.    </li>
            <li>Decent product - I have paid a lot more for products in the past.</li>
            <li>initially smelling the lotion, it smells very fragrant and sweet - similar to vanilla.</li>
            <li>But I still went to a locally owned little tanning salon, and with this lotion I&#x27;m Loving the results.</li>
            <li>I actually think it smells a little like warm vanilla sugar from bath &amp; body works.  </li>
            <li>and then right before i got in the bed i put on the back in blaque and WOW talk about being tan!</li>
            <li>I am looking for a new lotion.</li>
            <li>(I was on a try new things kick) and they all just paled in comparason to this stuff.</li>
            <li>The salon owner suggested another product and within days of using the new product and was darker.  </li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>I live in Indiana, and I try to hit the tanning bed every day.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00147FGJ8 Millenium Tanning New Paint</li>
            <li>I needed some new lotion this year and picked this one based on reviews and of course price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived on time and in new condition.</li>
            <li>Opened it and it looked brand new.</li>
            <li>Think I will just order a new bottle of Hempology.</li>
            <li>NEW 2008 Paint</li>
            <li>so I knew it was new.</li>
            <li>So i will finsh the bottle try something new.</li>
            <li>I am a new tanner.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness Amazon makes trying new lotions so affordable.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it only if someone asked directly about &#x27;Paint it Black&#x27; or something super cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d spent a bit more money &amp; get a different product.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice scent and provides even subtle color.</li>
            <li>, just doesn&#x27;t go on as well or get me dark as quickly as this does, and this is way cheaper!</li>
            <li>Gets ya dark quick!</li>
            <li>My tan is a gorgeous dark brown, my husband calls me his dark brown</li>
            <li>My hunch is this stuff might be a little older than what you&#x27;d get in the salon, which is fine.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft not oily.</li>
            <li>The color is very natural and I didn&#x27;t have any streaking.</li>
            <li>have VERY sensitive skin also, and have had no reaction to this lotion</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling very soft, even when you shower you can feel it coming off.</li>
            <li>Now this does not mean I was black or even bronze, but I was light tan which is still WAY darker than I had ever been before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its super soft, leaves your skin silky all day long.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re naturally medium or dark toned, this will probably work great for you as long as you&#x27;re not sensitive skinned!</li>
            <li>I on the other hand, do have sensitive fair skin (but I can tan without issue typically--</li>
            <li>dont shy away , it is an amazing tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>Tonight I went and used this product, wow!</li>
            <li>Gotta be the coolest looking lotion to pull out of your bag by far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy another bottle when I&#x27;m finished with my first bottle</li>
            <li>you can get the same exact product for A LOT cheaper on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I boughtt this lotion a week ago and used it for the first time last night in a level 2 bed for 9minites</li>
            <li>I was ecstatic the first time I used it and have continued to darken even further.  </li>
            <li>and i thought wow!</li>
            <li>After she used it the first time she wasnt red at all!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and it makes me so dark.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, not sure if we didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;real\\&quot; thing, but the bronzers did nothing.  </li>
            <li>The affects of the lotion will last for around 2 days; so it is safe to tan every other day.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty white now.</li>
            <li>I used this lotion and only went on the first level bed.</li>
            <li>The first lotion that  has actually been getting me tan!</li>
            <li>I use Johnson&#x27;s Baby sleeping lotion that gives me tan from the first day and costs 2$ at my local store.</li>
            <li>With the shirt off, im pretty white.</li>
            <li>Gives you an instant boost of color after your first tan.</li>
            <li>It made me tan in barely a few sessions! :)</li>
            <li>I noticed results after the first use with a ten minute session.</li>
            <li>I had similar results with other products that I was able to purchase at the Grocery Store.</li>
            <li>Overall I will go back to supre smoke even though its smaller its definetely my favorite.</li>
            <li>I first tried this a while back</li>
            <li>have purchased many tanning products in the past and this one&lt;</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t be dismayed if at first it seems to wash off the next day in the shower</li>
            <li>your skin is not slick or greasy.</li>
            <li>Using this lotion in combination of a tanning bed I have got a good tan glow going on that I had trouble getting using other lotions.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much, I sit out in the sun for 15 minutes (i usually wait or workout after sitting in the sun, you don&#x27;t notice immediately a change in skin color but trust me you will begin to notice your skin turn from a pale to a nice golden COMPLETELY natural skin color.</li>
            <li>i am light skinned and usually have a hard time tanning, but i dont have any problems with tanning any more!</li>
            <li>Another nice thing about this is a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>i was dark after the first 3 uses!!</li>
            <li>It was clearly brand new like it was stated because the packaging was unopened.</li>
            <li>And the products are always new and packaging is always professional.</li>
            <li>I have not really seen the dark and amazing results others have spoken of.</li>
            <li>I can use less of this product because it goes on so smoothly too.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is silky smooth and keeps me moisturized long after I&#x27;ve left the salon!</li>
            <li>It Black&#x27;s fantastic price and availability</li>
            <li>I tan fairly easily but had not been indoor tanning in a few years.</li>
            <li>I usually stay tanned but haven&#x27;t been able to go to the tanning bed because of my classes and busy schedule (college kid).</li>
            <li>Experience stunning dark tan color and ultra moisturization that last all day..</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different tanning lotions, and this hands down is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It really gets you hard VERY quickly</li>
            <li>Smells good, MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE than anything you can buy from a tanning salon, and my tan always looks natural and stays strong.  </li>
            <li>super dark, soft skin, unbeatable price!!</li>
            <li>Maybe it works well after you have reached your full tan effect, but it did nothing other than act as sun screen for me.</li>
            <li>Bella Black from this same company works great for me) and I broke out into hives and it leaves me a little orange tinted when I use it.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it because I&#x27;d rather go to the tanning bed less times (not a big fan</li>
            <li>but I prefer the Australian Gold Black better.</li>
            <li>Ive used Luminary, Bombshell, Phoenician, Obsidian, Black Noir, Rue La La and most recently Splurge.</li>
            <li>Well they both work the same, except the Black storm smells better</li>
            <li>will spend the extra $15 on Black20x which I have had better results with on previous occasions.</li>
            <li>She started tanning about two weeks prior to the wedding with not much result, as she doesn&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t burn easily, but I do turn red and pink after sun exposure instead of tan.</li>
            <li>(I already had a very nice tan that I have been working on in the beds for the past few months).  </li>
            <li>Paint it Black is a great all around lotion for a nice base tan..</li>
            <li>Non-tingle people may love it, but I&#x27;m used to being lobster red when I leave the salon, stinging for hours aferward, and having to blot myself dry after I finally shower it off</li>
            <li>My skin is so light I could glow in the dark, but this lotion has gotten me dark so quick, and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Love this tanning lotion, I have never gotten this dark before!!!</li>
            <li>Got a great deal on this lotion, but didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of color....and was a little thin.</li>
            <li>really recomend it if you want a dark tan fast!</li>
            <li>I thought this was supposed to be great tanning lotion, but have been pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I could clearly see a difference.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the color I got with this product.  </li>
            <li>When I called the number on the back for Milennium, they said it most likely is not real</li>
            <li>Also the lotion leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>If it is actually \\&quot;auto-tanning\\&quot; don&#x27;t see much in results.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and it helps me maintain my tan.</li>
            <li>As far as the product goes, however, I did not like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Also, you will have soft, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>The only downside i see is that there doesnt seem to be any real bronzing or color adding agent.  </li>
            <li>And it completely neutralizes that after-tan smell.</li>
            <li>I bought a whole bottle because it was priced well and would be cheaper than buying individual packets of lotion at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>As far as Millenium Paint</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting ready to buy another from this same company.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>this product helped give me the natural tan without turning orange or feeling like my skin is about to burn off my body.</li>
            <li>and I am going to purchase my second bottle very soon.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li>i just got really busy with college and didn&#x27;t have the time.</li>
            <li>and wow I wish I could post a picture of the heart shape.</li>
            <li>all of a sudden it goes away within 2 days... very stange...</li>
            <li>it is digusting... smells like an old people home...  </li>
            <li>I picked my 16 year old  daughter up from school, and  she  said,</li>
            <li>Well come to find out the person I bought it from sent me a old one.  </li>
            <li>they sent a really old bottle.  </li>
            <li>So far, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Now I make a point of buying directly from Amazon</li>
            <li>The bronzer really does its job and the silicon additives are just an extra bonus!!!  </li>
            <li>After just 3 tans I noticed a considerable difference in my skin color.</li>
            <li>I went one time so far this year, used this lotion and just after one time, 10 minutes in a stand up, I have a tan.</li>
            <li>Helps give a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>My only dislike is which so much bronzer it</li>
            <li>This product worked fast and left me with a &amp;#34;deep tan&amp;#34</li>
            <li>(wow)   </li>
            <li>I read that someone used this outside and decided to try it because I don&#x27;t really care for tanning beds.</li>
            <li>I will also state that I do not use tanning beds, only the real sun..</li>
            <li>atleast if you&#x27;re using it outside, can&#x27;t really state results of tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and silky, not sticky like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and they fixed the problem promptly</li>
            <li>Very Well so that&#x27;s definitely not the problem.</li>
            <li>Also, the tan that I have gotten from it is natural looking.</li>
            <li>The silicone leaves my skin feeling soft all day.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Felts as though it was advertised as SUNLESS tanning lotion, but really it&#x27;s Tanning bed or outside</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My tanning salon offers this lotion for $50.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be surprised if people start singing the Commodores&#x27; old song &amp;#34;Brick House&amp;#34; when you walk by them...</li>
            <li>give it four stars because it also leaves my skin extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It went on smoother than any of the others I have used and leaves me so soft.</li>
            <li>I have to say it meet my expectations and went far beyond.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is just a really old bottle, or someone had tampered with it or used it?</li>
            <li>much cheaper than buying it at the local store and</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the lotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great color results, Natural looking tan, not oompa-loompa.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow I ran out of a 45 dollar bottle I dont have on hand that I got from my Tanning spot.</li>
            <li>After initial burn, tan develops very well indeed.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>feels soft on my skin</li>
            <li>Works very well for an inexpensive lotion, only downside it</li>
            <li>but so far I like this stuff</li>
            <li>Does not do well as far as a bronzer go.</li>
            <li>It has gotten me considerably darker since I started using it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s making me darken up - and the tan looks natural</li>
            <li>The combo works wonders for those with sensitive skin, as you&#x27;re not &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to use body tanners on your face.</li>
            <li>I got this tanning lotion for my mother and so far it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;Ide</li>
            <li>This product causes my naturally tan skin to shimmer</li>
            <li>I used this lotion twice so far</li>
            <li>While I was tanning, I noticed that my skin was extremely soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using bronzers off and on for years now, and once my tan is built up, it&#x27;s a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>We both had been tanning for a few days before we received it and after the first time we used it we were soo much darker!  </li>
            <li>I have used this for about 3 times and I, the woman whose legs have always been see thru white are finally looking a golden tan color.</li>
            <li>Received my shipment two days after I ordered from Amazon (Not Green Web, I saw many negative reviews).</li>
            <li>This product does what it says and the color you receive is a good tan color, not orangey or fake looking.</li>
            <li>After two 8 minute sessions in a level 2 bed, I have an awesome tan, not just a base either.</li>
            <li>Auto-Darkening Dark Tanning Lotion - 13.5oz]]This product is not bad</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think they were working as expected and felt kind of pale</li>
            <li>Fortunately the bottle is black and has a skull on it, so I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed carrying it around either!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten much better results from other lotions, looks like I&#x27;ll be switching back to my old Australian Gold XOXO Kisses.</li>
            <li>It has a good smell but not sure if it makes me as black as it says it should.....</li>
            <li>The tan is also even and smooth, not blotchy, and the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave behind an orange tint like so many other tanning products.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, so I&#x27;m not really the right person to be giving this review.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m fairly light skinned, but this lotion didn&#x27;t do much extra compared to other lotions I have used.  </li>
            <li>I was scared it was gonna make me orange or super dark.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the tanning salons tell you that lotions sold online are fake, they are just trying to protect their main source of profit - if you buy from a reputable online store then you will get the real deal</li>
            <li>If you need to get dark quick, this is for you.</li>
            <li>With this, I am SUPER dark.</li>
            <li>I have not ever got this dark so quickly before.</li>
            <li>I tanned for almost a month with a different tanning lotion &amp; it seemed like I could not get any further on my tan (which I hadn&#x27;t got far on in the first place)</li>
            <li>so I am by far not dark</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this product, I was skeptical because some reviews indicated that it left an orange tint to skin, and that it wasn&#x27;t effective in accelerating darkening in a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend if you want a natural, deep tan without a lot of work!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and is very subtle.</li>
            <li>I will most likely get the black bottle of hempz tanning lotion next.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this from Amazon consistently for probably the last 3 years because it is SO inexpensive and it is in a big bottle for indoor tan lotion.</li>
            <li>smells decent too, not gross tanning aftersmell like others.</li>
            <li>And the tan is fantastic natural and the price is unbelievable inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different tanning lotions in the past and this one has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when the lotion arrived two days earlier than I had expected!</li>
            <li>I am of asian decent</li>
            <li>Im pretty sure this is a fake.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something much stronger in the Millenium Tanning line, then you can check out Pure Black.  </li>
            <li>I was very pale when I first used the lotion &amp; have gotten MUCH darker than I would&#x27;ve normally with another lotion.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly and I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you need basic lotion for the tanning bed!</li>
            <li>so I decided to give it a shot, because of the low price and high reviews.</li>
            <li>Major plus for me!</li>
            <li>Spent awhile researching different lotions looking for one that would give quick results but that did not have any tingle.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if it is a genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its so cheap and works just as well, if not better, then the stuff they sell in the salons.</li>
            <li>I felt like I barely got any darker, except for the natural tanning process.  </li>
            <li>I tried this out in a sample at a local tanning salon because I forgot my normal lotion.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website</li>
            <li>I will never go back to normal tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>i would get more dark and did&#x27;nt from some other lotions</li>
            <li>By far my favorite lotion, only down fall is the Orange stain that gets left in between your fingers, if you get the chance before you tan definitely wash your hands....</li>
            <li>I should have spent a little more and got a lotion that I knew would work.</li>
            <li>Just expected a little more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>and I recently started trying new ones.</li>
            <li>I live in Michigan and only tan for 1 month between April and May.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy new lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to tanning, only having been about five times before this summer.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this late morning Tuesday (2/5/13) - and received it very quickly (today, Friday 2/8/13, in the morning).  </li>
            <li>The origainal price of $95 is miss leading, there is no way this product would be worth half of that.  </li>
            <li>This one makes my skin soft, not dry.</li>
            <li>It definitely has made me much darker in just a short time using it.</li>
            <li>so my arms and legs tan at the same rate as the rest of my body, otherwise my torso becomes much darker than the rest of me (my legs, especially!).</li>
            <li>the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it really doesn&#x27;t have the instant self tanners like it says.</li>
            <li>It took a few times to see any mild change.</li>
            <li>but it goes quick for heavy tanners.</li>
            <li>Nice product actual value approximately $20.</li>
            <li>Tried this after reading all the great reviews and after about six tanning sessions I have to say that it does not in any way enhance my tan (over and above normal outcome of a session without any lotion), it smells bad</li>
            <li>never turning back to my old one!</li>
            <li>But, the first time I used it, I had to use about twice as much as other lotions.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say I love this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>Enjoy product, I don&#x27;t get as dark as I thought I would but love the tone that it provides, does not look fake or make you look orange as some do.</li>
            <li>Left my skin remarkably soft!</li>
            <li>I have used this for a month now and haven&#x27;t seen major results yet.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was using Black Diamond which is ok, tried the Bombshell and was fairly dark after just one use, but I&#x27;m just not seeing the hyped up results with the Paint</li>
            <li>I generally go to the tanning bed all year round and had stopped using any tan lotions at all because I found that I get just as dark without them, and it looks much more natural.</li>
            <li>There is a slight bronzing effect but it rubbed off somewhat during the day/when I went to bed and of course it all washes right off the moment you take a shower.</li>
            <li>As long as your body is cool (not hot, sweaty, etc)</li>
            <li>It was cheap enough so can&#x27;t complain about that, but for giving a deep tan that&#x27;s not true</li>
            <li>While I have gotten a little darker, The reviews I read implied that I would be a golden goddess in no time.  </li>
            <li>The paint it black 50x has more of a manly scent, the Black Storm 60X&lt;</li>
            <li>Ok, seriously, &#x27;it doesn&#x27;t last&#x27; because its a bronzer!!</li>
            <li>I used this for a few weeks, and what I noticed was that when I first left the salon I would have a really dark and rich color,</li>
            <li>I have a hard time getting tan since I have light skin but by the end</li>
            <li>and I have to shower right after whereas other lotions I&#x27;ve tried it smells the same as when it went on</li>
            <li>Very blendable and goes a long way while moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li>(they apparently didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin color until I started using this product.)I</li>
            <li>As far as the lotion I have only used it once</li>
            <li>This gave me the natural deep tan</li>
            <li>but I apparently misunderstood its function.</li>
            <li>Apparently you must be a tanning bed user to benefit from it in terms of color.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>and thought I was pretty dark.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the lotion would occasionally give me hives.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and not dryed out.</li>
            <li>Its a deep natural bronze.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t believe people when they say that there was absolutely no post-tanning bed scent thanks to the lotion.</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s value far exceeds its price, I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>It does help get me dark pretty quickly,even in level 1 and level 2 beds.</li>
            <li>Just what I expected and received it fast.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does make your skin soft.</li>
            <li>Your skin will definitely look darker, but the color doesn&#x27;t look natural on me.</li>
            <li>it made me sooo dark on my first tanning bed visit you wouldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>And as far as the smell, I know everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but all I smell is Vanilla after tanning.  </li>
            <li>I have used nearly 100 different lotions in my time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a glutton for punishment, apparently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tanned with this lotion once so far</li>
            <li>I have never gotten this dark this fast!</li>
            <li>This was my first tanning lotion, so maybe I wasn&#x27;t putting enough on or I wasn&#x27;t staying in the tanning booth long enough.</li>
            <li>I went tanning for three months with this crud and barely noticed a thing.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far in an indoor stand-up tanning bed (for just 10 minutes)</li>
            <li>The consistency is thick but smooths over your skin VERY well and really leaves your skin feeling sooo soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy into heavy music, so the packaging naturally attracted me at first.</li>
            <li>tanning\\&quot; smell, but it has its own weird musty smell.  </li>
            <li>I had to use it a few times to get the results I wanted, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>It has a worse after scent, but not horrible.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tan as nicely as the expensive lotions.</li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell its not a bad product.</li>
            <li>This was the first lotion I used when I started tanning (partly to help with skin issues, the other part vanity!).</li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for a new indoor tanning lotion, so I tend to buy several different brands per year.</li>
            <li>Then, for the next two days, I really had a problem with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I complained to the salon consultant about their beds not being strong enough, and requested to try another bed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, any color you THINK you got washes right down the drain with the BRINZER, which is only body makeup.</li>
            <li>Left me very soft all over even my legs which were kinda scaley and gross.</li>
            <li>I personally use Crystal Faces by Australian Gold and my face is a bit lighter but its very natural in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not smell like \\&quot;clean cotton blossom\\&quot;  more like a vanilla fig or something like that which isn&#x27;t bad putting on, but I do smell like that gross sweaty burnt smell when I&#x27;m done tanning.</li>
            <li>I tan almost every spring and summer, and this is my first time using Paint it Black.  </li>
            <li>I noticed I looked darker the first session I used Paint it Black.</li>
            <li>The reason i say kept is because i started out tanning with the JWOWW Black Bronzer lotion for about 2 months(it didn&#x27;t get me darker or lighter...stayed consistent).</li>
            <li>Black, you can get their Black Storm for the same price through Amazon, and that is supposed to have slightly more bronzers.  </li>
            <li>first then move up to the 60x Black storm bronzer.</li>
            <li>It Black for the first time tonight</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty typical of a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>At first smell, the lotion smelled like a typical tanning salon smell.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me which is more than I can say about the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I pay $27 for 30 days of tanning, so I mainly use that and these lotions, and I recently had to go to the doctor&#x27;s for something, and the nurse actually asked me if I&#x27;m mixed</li>
            <li>the only con really is if you use too much you can definitely tell; the lotion gives your skin a heavy, greasy feeling</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this yet, but I have heard that it works very well (from other reviews).</li>
            <li>Other reviews claim to have not received the real deal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d imagine this would really work extremely well for</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, everyone is shocked at how quickly I&#x27;m tanning, countless people said that if I didn&#x27;t go to a name brand tanning salon (Sun Tan City)</li>
            <li>The outside of the bottle was masculine enough for me as well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not dry and itchy after tanning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read through the poor reviews and it seems most people only know about dha.   </li>
            <li>Skin does not dry out.</li>
            <li>Only reason for 4 stars is I am not extremely fond of the smell.  </li>
            <li>and it helps you get pretty dark as well!</li>
            <li>In only 2 tanning sessions, I see a MAJOR improvement in darkness of color and condition of skin.</li>
            <li>I am pretty white normally, tanning usually takes me several sessions to work my way up</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion as a replacement to my Black Orchid by Supre when I was first starting to tan.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel much softer or smoother, and my skin was definetly not that dark.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but it didn&#x27;t really make me that dark.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t spend too much on this, not worth it.</li>
            <li>Gets you dark fast...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried this will make you too dark too fast, don&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li>Make you dark very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used other lotions before that seem to really give you that extra level of darkness this does not seem to do that.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that actually left burn scars on any part of my body that directly touched the tanning bed (heels of my feet especially).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m at least a full shade darker.  </li>
            <li>but although i&#x27;m already pretty tanned, i still burned and after few times.</li>
            <li>The lotion isn&#x27;t heavy; but it is a tad greasy when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>I have been using tanning products for a few years now and always bought at the salon, this was the first time I&#x27;d bought one off the internet</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first few weeks after receiving.</li>
            <li>its not bad just not really amazing like all the hipe</li>
            <li>The price is $27.99 atm, but Pure Black is supposed to be 100x as opposed to 50x or 60x bronzers.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d say these lotions really make the difference when it comes down to it.  </li>
            <li>My one complaint is the smell, it&#x27;s not a typical tanning lotion smell (coconuty) bit has more of a heavy, chocolate scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty pale for a while.</li>
            <li>Most of these reviews are fake, like every other review on amazon /: But this stuff is just like every other tanning lotion that comes in a cool hip bottle.</li>
            <li>The Auto-Darkening Tan Technology delivers extreme dark bronze tanning results through it&#x27;s super luxurious silicone emulsion blend.</li>
            <li>I usually tan right thru sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert, but i have used other lotions that don&#x27;t smell bad or smell good!  </li>
            <li>not super intense, nor is it fruity or florally.</li>
            <li>I have used paint it black for 2 days now, and already i am much darker than i was (without using a lotion).</li>
            <li>Got me a dark tan much quicker than using regular lotion alone.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is defective, not the real item or maybe just old</li>
            <li>It worked very well to achieve a deep dark tan</li>
            <li>The stuff is working only for a few first sessions.</li>
            <li>Only use this when you have a really good base tan because it does have a high power bronzer.</li>
            <li>If you are having a hard time achieving a tan, or would like to tan quickly for a low price...</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, didn&#x27;t get real dark, although I never do.</li>
            <li>but the tan is not long lasting.</li>
            <li>This product is low quality to say the least, it doesn&#x27;t absorb in your skin quickly and leaves you sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li>After five sessions in a tanning booth using this product with little to no results, I decided to only put the lotion on certain parts of my body and the rest of my body was lotionless.  </li>
            <li>I am someone with an olive skin tone that tans easily, I also have tried many tanning lotions and this one by far has been the worst.</li>
            <li>I was really skeptical when I bought it,the tanning bed girl said everyone complained about its smell after you lay in the bed,but I found no offensive smell in fact it was extremely pleasant my skin was silky soft...</li>
            <li>50X bronzers seems a little much to believe, there is no self tint added to your skin.</li>
            <li>I put it on before I mow the lawn and after the hard work I get to see a freshly mowed lawn and a tan.</li>
            <li>I saw very little results after first use and my sisters tan who has almost finished</li>
            <li>Other than that, the lotion leaves my skin very soft and after I shower.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell bad goes on good</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money you can buy fake tan for cheaper and it look a whole lot better.</li>

            <li> : One of the reasons I love CalTan products is for the delicious smells they have.</li>
            <li> , some reviews said it&#x27;s just wonderful, and they are so much more tan, etc.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve found, even better than Designer Skin products,  </li>

            <li> this product smells like warm vanilla sugar!</li>
            <li> It had good reviews here on Amazon and it was a great price - but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>

            <li> It smells good and rubs in just like lotion.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t give me a good tan.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Has a good smell, not over powering.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> recommend this for someone who is looking for a lotion that smells good, refreshes your skin and maintains your tan.</li>
            <li> But not so good if you are you tan and want to be darker.  </li>
            <li> It works good, i would recommend it to anyone, but you always need to switch lotions to get the darkness you desire.</li>
            <li> I have had friends ask if I lay out and that in itself is a good bonus.  </li>
            <li> however it was good while i used it.</li>
            <li> It smells so good though that I used it anyway until my daughter wanted it for use in a tanning booth.  </li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> It smells good</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion for tanning in a bed.</li>
            <li> Loved this product.  </li>
            <li> Its good.</li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells so good still</li>
            <li> Good product and good price</li>
            <li> The smell is good, this is used by both a man and a women</li>
            <li> Now, granted, it may be because I have been laying in a realllly good bed, but still the lotion has helped I think.</li>
            <li> All is good.</li>
            <li> Always count on Amazon for a good deal on what you need when you need it.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but I&#x27;d thought it would have a tingle</li>
            <li> All it did was make me smell good.</li>
            <li> well that I would get the good results I read about with this lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest this lotion to anyone looking for a good indoor tanning product.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on it and decided for the price it was a good gamble.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on tuesday and got it friday, the packaging was good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to use.</li>
            <li> I got this to try because it got really good reviews</li>
            <li> Tanning wise, I did notice an accelerated tan within 3 sessions.</li>
            <li> I was given this lotion by a friend, and I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about it.</li>
            <li> It looks and sounds good..</li>
            <li> It smelt really good</li>
            <li> My boyfriend said I smelled good.</li>
            <li> It smells good though.  </li>
            <li> so when I seen this and all the good reviews I had to try it...</li>
            <li> this a tried because this works just a good as a 80 dollar bottle.  </li>
            <li> good product</li>
            <li> The price is good as well</li>
            <li> Oh, and no it doesnt smell good.</li>
            <li> and good moisture.</li>
            <li> I am naturally fair skinned with auburn hair.</li>
            <li> The lotion moisturizes well and smells good.</li>
            <li> It smells really good but does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the smell isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> Price was good and it was delivered on time</li>
            <li> it smells good</li>
            <li> This product smells great, applies nicely, and has helped darken my tan.</li>
            <li> good moisture lotion for the tanning bed</li>
            <li> Good for price</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and do not tan well.  </li>
            <li> The smell is good.</li>
            <li> Then again Inhave fair skin.</li>
            <li> and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> As with all good tanning, you have to keep tanning.</li>
            <li> A rich vanilla scent is how I can best describe it.  </li>
            <li> Now anyways, I read through the ingredients, it has an awesome ingredient in here that people pay a ton of money for in true skin care products.  </li>
            <li> I work at a gym/tan salon and own my own bed, I wouldnt go anywhere but here!</li>
            <li> The difference in price and this company uses more than a very light bronzer, should make this the best lotion for the money anywhere.  </li>
            <li> For a lotion without tingle it works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> was super impressed with the colour as well</li>
            <li> Also, the delivery service was exceptional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, at an even better price!</li>
            <li> Has a GREAT smell, very light and tropical.</li>

            <li> so I was very pleased with its speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Both are great by themselves, but I have found I have had better results using them together</li>

            <li> I was very pleased with the consistancy and smell of the product.</li>

            <li> It smells good, is a nice size bottle, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of online research before I purchased this lotion, looking for THE BEST one out there as I am pretty fair-skinned, and this one was always in the top 5 or top 10 for best lotions, so I took a chance and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great deal, you get a lot of product and you smell pretty good even after tanning!</li>
            <li> It went on very nicely and smelled ok during application</li>
            <li> I give this lotion 2 stars because it smells very nice, unlike many tanning products.</li>

            <li> The odor is very sweet smelling and smells very nice and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an experienced tanner, I haven&#x27;t used very many lotions and don&#x27;t know quality from cheap tanning lotions, but I like the way this smells (for a tanning lotion)</li>
            <li> It smells great and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> easy to apply and great tanning coverage.</li>
            <li> Believe ALL of the good  reviews, cause they&#x27;re 100% true LOL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to me that a tanning lotion smells good and this one does.</li>

            <li> The scent is fine, got it at a great price here</li>
            <li> Great price and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and very clean and it does not give you that &amp;#34;tanning bed skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Also the seller was amazing...</li>
            <li> and I must say it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing.</li>

            <li> It smells great and goes on so smoothly too.</li>
            <li> I saw amazing results.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin silky smooth and smelling great.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing too.</li>

            <li> my results were amazing after 2 days of use, no streaking.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> It honeestly smells amazing</li>
            <li> Truly amazing product for the price.</li>

            <li> the 50X bronzers are amazing</li>
            <li> this is an amazing tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and works great.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells really great, spreads on evenly (no streaks) and leaves your skin feeling sooo smooth.</li>
            <li> This lotion sells for well over $50 in my tanning salon for $14 on here was an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> but it works amazing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Turned me a nice brown not orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it,</li>
            <li> and this didn&#x27;t even help get the nice tan I got in Mexico this spring.</li>
            <li> Having been out of the tanning bed world for a while I just bought this to hold me over until I read some reviews and found a tingle lotion that I liked.</li>
            <li> It works fast and leaves an allover great looking tan!</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it as well.</li>
            <li> Women love &#x27;smell good&#x27; lotions and tanning lotions should have a &#x27;tanning&#x27; type smell.</li>
            <li> One review said this smells like warm vanilla</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for those with fair skin.</li>
            <li> product s a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion,</li>
            <li> The smell is nice I will give it that.</li>
            <li> , I thought I should experiment with my own.  </li>
            <li> But this lotion from the amazon seller (NOT green-whatever) passes my own frugal/skeptical legitimacy test.  </li>
            <li> It kind of smells like your run of the mill store bought tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I use it about twice a week, and I am developing a nice tan.</li>
            <li> Like I have my own superfly theme song.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This is the absolute best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice smell</li>
            <li> The smell was nice, but it took me two days to get the orange off my skin and to get my skin looking even again.  </li>
            <li> Most of the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> , I think it is kind of a unisex smell and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion for a while</li>
            <li> Okay I got this based on all the good reviews and now I feel some must be planted.</li>
            <li> Regardless, all three give me nice brown skin.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent</li>
            <li> and I have been really nice color since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Love it for getting a good summer tan</li>
            <li> It has a nice coconut smell to it and also good about keeping your skin moist and not oily like most tan lotions</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin, and this lotion works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion, but didn&#x27;t darken the skin to give you a tan.  </li>
            <li> but it smells nice</li>
            <li> I think it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> This works fairly well, but I think I had better results with the 100X.</li>
            <li> moisturizes and provides a nice bronze color.</li>
            <li> I was not too thrilled with this.</li>
            <li> it smells nice..</li>
            <li> the color is nice, does not look yellowish.</li>
            <li> Liked product a lot.</li>
            <li> This product works for me to get a nice color.  </li>
            <li> This is really nice lotion.  </li>
            <li> I received my order before estimated arrival date, I am more than happy with my experience :)</li>
            <li> Nice even tan.</li>
            <li> I love the product, the price is so good for that quality.</li>
            <li> Smells nice though.</li>
            <li> Kind of makes me orange too.</li>
            <li> I bought this on amazon because it seemed popular.</li>
            <li> Recommend if your looking for a nice glow tan.</li>
            <li> This time i stopped using the lotion and switched to another kind</li>
            <li> I have a nice, even color</li>
            <li> From the tingle ones that hurt, to the ones that do nothing but make you smell nice.</li>
            <li> I havent been in a tanning bed all summer, and grew a nice farmer tan.</li>
            <li> Switching the two up gives me a really nice color.</li>
            <li> It kind of smells like skittles..</li>
            <li> and I really liked it</li>
            <li> really liked it.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> Nice bronze color, not orange at all.</li>
            <li> Nice deal otherwise.</li>
            <li> I just wish I would&#x27;ve gotten the darker kind.</li>
            <li> So before I go somewhere warm</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like the warm brown sugar scents from Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> It has the perfect amount of bronzers &amp; acts as a moistuirzer - leaving my skin golden &amp; silky smooth!</li>
            <li> It also gave me a nice even brown color, no orange tint.</li>
            <li> Yes this lotion smells nice</li>
            <li> The lotion smells really good and noticeably has a lot of silicone in it, which I love.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to beginners or anyone wanting a nice tan.</li>
            <li> It was a really nice smell and its smoothing on skin .</li>
            <li> I dont think it necessairly has tanned me better than others I have used, but it has given me a very nice even brown tone that I love.</li>
            <li> For the price, the lotion is definitely a great buy and soo worth it!</li>
            <li> WORTH THE $$$!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married this summer and wanted to make sure I could perfect my color before time</li>
            <li> I have def used better and more effective ones!  </li>
            <li> If you need a good tanning lotion to give you nice natural color you should try this product, great price, good smell</li>
            <li> after reading all the wonderful reviews and searching for a product with a high bronzing factor,i ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> Worked great and darkened me up really quickly and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> It smells good at first but after tanning the smell isn&#x27;t very nice.</li>
            <li> Great full bottle.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy and blends right in, the smell is excellent and the tanning is unreal.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and will most certainly purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is nice because its cheap and smells good.  </li>
            <li> This product helped me get a great tan and quick.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not that strong tanning lotion smell.</li>
            <li> I really liked this tanning lotion, it gave me that nice glowed tan that I love.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this lotion would meet my expectations because the price is great and lots of people seem to be having good results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and smells good to :))</li>
            <li> It has such a good smell, gets you tanner faster, and my skin feels great afterwards!</li>
            <li> I strongly favor lotions that have good bronzers in them.</li>
            <li> make sure you wash your hands really good after you apply it on you  :)</li>
            <li> Has no fragrance which is really good, really nice silicone smooth.  </li>
            <li> I burn very easily without tanning lotion, but when I use this lotion, I don&#x27;t burn at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m olive skinned and tan very easily.</li>
            <li> and I tan very easily.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - I LOVE the SMELL TOO!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li> there are better products out there! :)</li>
            <li> Pretty good like it !</li>
            <li> Bombshell is the best tanning bed lotion on the market as far as I am concerned!</li>
            <li> Works great, smells awesome, and does a great job of darkening my fair skin and for a redhead that is quite difficult.  </li>
            <li> I loved the smell and it seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biracial, but I&#x27;m very fair, so I can tan really well,</li>
            <li> It absorbed very easily into my skin, felt great and did not have an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> and this is by far the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> Of all the bronzing tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used this one is by far the best!!!</li>
            <li> It is smooth and smells good when you put it on..</li>
            <li> I purchased this product the first time in 2010 based on all the great reviews and amazing price.</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice bronze tan faster than most lotion.</li>
            <li> The silicones in the bottle are one of the best on the market thus far.  </li>
            <li> but I think I have used others I liked better.  </li>
            <li> Smell is good and lotion makes your skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would reccommend trying this out before you buy it if you have fair or light skin.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years and have used ALOT of lotions, but I have to say  this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> all i had available was to wipe them off as good as i could on the wash cloth.</li>
            <li> So far so great!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and leaves skin really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> It smells kind of like vanilla which I like much better</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any kind of reaction as I did with the one I bought from the tanning salon for much more money.  </li>
            <li> The best thing about this is the color is a natural bronze.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a cheap lotion.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s always nice:)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion works well with my fair skin tone and has a light after scent.</li>
            <li> Love it, not greasy and smells really nice.  </li>
            <li> So far the best products I&#x27;ve found that keep my legs as tan as</li>
            <li> This lotion glides on so smoothly because it has a good amount of silcone in it.</li>
            <li> So far, this lotion has been working great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; color tanning lotion, it gives a natural looking tan that is awesome!</li>
            <li> Had no idea it would smell so good and be so smooth.  </li>
            <li> It smells delightful and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Love the nice tan color it leave.</li>
            <li> But is does smell pretty good, just dont count on it for a good tan.</li>
            <li> Smells good, and bronzers were pretty good for the price I&#x27;d use again.</li>
            <li> It doesnt make you supper tan real quick but still works great quick</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, it has an awesome tint/smell to it and does not turn your skin orange like many other bronzing tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> It looks great right after I get out of the bed...</li>
            <li> It is very light, and went on very easily.</li>
            <li> love love love!</li>
            <li> and it doesnt smell good and certainly doesnt smell good after you tan.  </li>
            <li> I have loved this brand for years and am never disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got this lotion after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff, worth it!</li>
            <li> I love to tan and this is BY FAR, thee best lotion that I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many many tanning lotions, and this one gives you a great tan, but fades quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent though not my favorite but not terrible either.  </li>
            <li> Works very good, wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but now I&#x27;m looking more colored than before :)</li>
            <li> I actually am pretty happy with it and have recommended it to my friends.  </li>
            <li> It really creates an even, beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look like Snooki, so I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what a great bronzer does.</li>
            <li> All in all a pretty great product.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well!</li>
            <li> I have just used this product for the first time, and I have to say I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin (burn rather easy) but also tan rather easily.  </li>
            <li> , lotion went on very smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and silky to the touch after tanning.</li>
            <li> It is a very lightly scented lotion.</li>
            <li> It was very smooth to put on</li>
            <li> The lotion itself goes on very smooth</li>
            <li> It smells great and has a light sweet smell.</li>
            <li> It does not have a good \\&quot;after tan\\&quot; smell, and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and quick color.</li>
            <li> good price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This lotion gets 5 stars from me because it is super inexpensive ($18.95) and it gives good results.   </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good for a quick tan.</li>
            <li> at first after a month of using that, i thought i liked it, the smell was Good.</li>
            <li> The smell with this lotion is great too, with a very fresh, clean smell. :)</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on super smooth and leaves my skin feeling great afterwards.</li>
            <li> Smells fine, but it seems to be kind of watery.</li>
            <li> If anyone else whom purchased this lotion and recieved great results can you send me a video of its consistency because Im almost certain</li>
            <li> On a positive, yes, it does smell very nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge deal!</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> so i will switch to one that has more bronzer.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work appropriately on my body.</li>
            <li> Im 100% satisfied, all pros, no cons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is just an OK lotion and nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> you get comes more from the color of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because you Dont have to lay in the bed as much when you use this product.</li>
            <li> For one, I do not find the smell appealing.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I was expecting better from the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> And having only paid $15 for this lotion it is awesome!</li>
            <li> Overall no complaints and the ordering process was excellent.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is ok</li>
            <li> Thats all. :)</li>
            <li> I was expecting way better results from this lotion since it has so many bronzers</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work, I have used it for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it didn&#x27;t give me the \\&quot;50X\\&quot; tan that I thought I would get.</li>
            <li> Got me darker better than Freedom.</li>
            <li> Okay smell.  </li>
            <li> I love the Beach Bum Rum step 2....</li>
            <li> The smell says cotton blossom, but I would say it smells more like vanilla.</li>
            <li> The lotion doesn&#x27;t leave skin an orange color like many lotions with bronzers do.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> I researched and read reviews of all the top tanning lotions and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with this tanning lotion but not amazed as some of you are.</li>
            <li> Smoke has got to be the BEST bronzer Ive used, personally.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to tell after using it more than 1 time.  </li>
            <li> that those blessed with better pigment than I have had.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m placing another order for 3 more bottles for my friends and family.  </li>
            <li> she admitted it was authentic, but couldn&#x27;t place the smell.</li>
            <li> and I continued to get more color every time I used it.</li>
            <li> Its ok.  </li>
            <li> shoulda known better to buy into the hype.</li>
            <li> but i love the results.</li>
            <li> Love how it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and</li>
            <li> I worked in a Tanning Salon and have used many many lotions.</li>
            <li> But when you take that shower that night, you won&#x27;t be any better off then</li>
            <li> I bought two :)</li>
            <li> Both smell amazing and leave your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Being someone who&#x27;s worked at a tanning salon before and have had tried many different lotions I would say this lotion isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not allergic to many things, but it seems I broke out in hives when I used this product.  </li>
            <li> What more could you want in a tanning lotion?</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and have ordered it twice now.  </li>
            <li> Okay folks, here&#x27;s how this bottle of lotion works.  </li>
            <li> This lotion was okay.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m hooked  my favorite ever.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many lotions.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best bronzers out there!  </li>
            <li> It is a fresh scent that smells good even after you tan.  </li>
            <li> They hydrate your skin so that it is more receptiive to the UV rays that tan them.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially if you&#x27;re fairly hairy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with the Designer Skin brand and will be returning to those products now.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It has a coconut fragrance, which I love as well.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> IT WOULD COST ME 10X MORE AT THE TANNING SALON</li>
            <li> I WILL BE BUYING MORE FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion.</li>
            <li> :) I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine any lotion working any better.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I would love it 100% if had pump on it..</li>
            <li> so maybe if you use more often you would have better results.  </li>
            <li> :) I will buy this product again and again</li>
            <li> I will keep looking for something that I love.  </li>
            <li> Is this better then using nothing a all?</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research for the best lotion (probably more than necessary :  </li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I go to because most of the employees that work there use it.</li>
            <li> I always used mostly Designer Skin products until I bought this Millennium product.</li>
            <li> From extending to color to nourishment to scent, I have used better lotions than this one.</li>
            <li> Its not terrible..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> i have tried MANY different products, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love my Tanning lotion</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) buy it</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but after that it left me feeling tan and wonderful</li>
            <li> i have to say i love the millenium tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> the 100x bronzer is my favorite &amp; i always have a bottle to use.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, because it&#x27;s not as pi√±a coladish as the most of the tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> For $25, it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m definitely glad I didn&#x27;t pay more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she prefers that people buy this stuff for fifty bucks from her . . .</li>
            <li> It makes me want to type of more and more and more</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I imagine guys would also enjoy using this lotion!  </li>
            <li> better order both used both I just got darker when I used BS</li>
            <li> really like this product, smells great too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already wanting more and I still have sum in my bottle.</li>
            <li> Anyway I love the product it gives me more color on top of my ran already</li>
            <li> When I would buy a packet of tanning lotion by another company at the salon, I would get WAY more color than with this.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion seems like nothing more than lotion.</li>
            <li> i rather spend more money and save my time.</li>
            <li> The bronzer gave okay color.  </li>
            <li> and its got a good clean scent for those of you who dont like a strong smell</li>
            <li> I love the sugary, vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> This line is so much better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I really love Millenium Tanning products through Amazon, but if you are going to get Paint it</li>
            <li> I am getting more color when I was at a plateau.</li>
            <li> but I have used better for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> It had scotch tape on the top of the lid to hold it on.  </li>
            <li> perfect for outside tanning in the sun too.</li>
            <li> I have used Wal-Mart lotions with better results.</li>
            <li> More fruit smoothie than coconut and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> i still don&#x27;t see any better tan than before when i wasn&#x27;t using it</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle a month ago and have just ordered two more</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for 6 plus years and tryed many.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big time tanner, but this seams to be one of the best lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting any more tan than I would have been without the lotion.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t okay.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> From the many many reviews Ive read Paint</li>
            <li> My bottle was neatly and safely packaged in a bag within a box.</li>
            <li> Its not to sticky, its prob more sticky on me</li>
            <li> then most of the stuff iv tried there.</li>
            <li> Smells okay.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off spending more money on a better lotion.</li>
            <li> The #1 reason I love this tanning lotion is because even though it has bronzers it does not stain your skin at all.</li>
            <li> Lovely tan.</li>
            <li> Way more lotion and bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Order was on time and I am supremely ecstatically pleased.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and leaves me with an even tan every time :) will be purchasing again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion</li>
            <li> boy was I glad I did.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li> i deff saw results waaaaaaay better than without it.</li>
            <li> deff buy again :)</li>
            <li> Ive used numerous tanning lotions, i found that snooki&#x27;s line works best for me.</li>
            <li> so just checked my bottle soon as it came in to make sure it was legit and it was.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more of this.</li>
            <li> My skin is allergic to many lotions - not this one.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion also gives me more moisturization then a bottle of hempz..</li>
            <li> If it were $100 I would give it 3.5-4 stars because there are better lotions you can get for the price.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is much better and the results are phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it, and would recommend this product to everybody. :)</li>
            <li> so with that said for best results you would have to go SPF-free using this product outside...</li>
            <li> I got better results also by leaving the product on for 3-4 hours AFTER tanning without washing it off.  </li>
            <li> so you make sure the bronzer can still absorb</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I just ordered more.</li>
            <li> Gives a great real tan after tanning.</li>
            <li> It has such a good smell, gets you tanned faster, and my skin feels great after I apply it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t compare to the lotions at the salons for sure.  </li>
            <li> the bottle is moderate at best.  </li>
            <li> Better off spending $10 more dollars and get a better lotion like Conceited or Luminary.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who enjoys getting the perfect brown tan.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product.</li>
            <li> I would purchase this immediately again. :)</li>
            <li> Love the lotion</li>
            <li> But that being said it works very well and am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Love this product for couple years.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> The lotion is OK.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I know there&#x27;s gotta better out there.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, and the silky feeling after I&#x27;ve tanned.</li>
            <li> love the bronzing effect</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel after each use</li>
            <li> love the way it smells and makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Most importantly the color I achieved was a bit of brown and NOT orange!</li>
            <li> love it  </li>
            <li> No nasty streaks!!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to tan.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS LOTION.</li>
            <li> I wish I had a better review because I was looking forward to using this product.</li>
            <li> and like that one better because I feel like the bronzer is better .</li>
            <li> I do switch between the two and am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Gotta love amazon.com.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast, smells great (no stinky bronzer smell) and you can go about your day without feeling like you have grime on your skin.</li>
            <li> most bricks are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that you aren&#x27;t supposed to shower until many hours after tanning, but the smell leaves me no choice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it works just as well as the stuff they charged me twice to three times what this cost to get through Amazon...amazing amazon.</li>
            <li> gotta love em.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion and have used for years.  </li>
            <li> Top rated tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> the smell is ok.</li>
            <li> I felt better about myself.</li>
            <li> I have heard that the darker the lotion color the better results you will get.</li>
            <li> I am darker than most of my friends and they look up to me and are always asking to borrow it.</li>
            <li> I love it, if you wanna get sexified try this out.</li>
            <li> It works in both areas. :)</li>
            <li> Its okay, dont think i would buy it again though.</li>
            <li> My husband even used it on his white legs and was really happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I found most of them on here from the $15.00 - $30.00 range (again, a bit upset with myself for falling for the salon girls).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Would recommend for a cheap and effective tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> No nasty after smell either!</li>
            <li> that is) and have never been so satisfied with a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many tanning lotions at all still.</li>
            <li> I have been able to maintain my color by going to the salon two or three times a week.</li>
            <li> It works well, has a nice scent and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> and I feel it Swanky Girl worked slightly better.</li>
            <li> Although the ingredients show it contains DHA (Dihydroxyacetone), I have used cheap DHA products from Walgren and Walmart that were much more effective.  </li>
            <li> love this product and you can&#x27;t beat the price...</li>
            <li> I am going to try the x100 by millenium and see if its better but who knows.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product...</li>
            <li> Love this item.  </li>
            <li> Works for darkening, so it is functional; I just love the tingle factor.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion</li>
            <li> able to lay in the pool on Sundays.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I do indeed love the texture and consistency of the Paint</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tingle person, but I thought I would give this a try since everyone and their dog seems to love it.  </li>
            <li> Okay so the lotion i love</li>
            <li> I have used tons of tanning lotions and this one is seriously my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> It really helps with the tanning and it leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to have more effect faster</li>
            <li> but I am pleased with the results I got.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;tingler&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This lotion is ok.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, the moisture it provides, but this product does break out my skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to buys this one based off the amazon reviews and it was such a great decision!!!</li>
            <li> so i thought i better start getting my tan on</li>
            <li> A Must Try!!:)</li>
            <li> It seems to help somewhat but it&#x27;s  not my favorite</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Really love.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than at the tanning salon and works great.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I agave</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> BUT ITS OK , THE SHIN FIMING IN THIS</li>
            <li> Overall happy with product!</li>
            <li> I went for a motorcycle ride and wore a tube top and put it on my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting more bronzing effect from this lotion.</li>
            <li> When I leave the tanner I don&#x27;t seem to have that tanner smell that so many lotions leave in their wake.</li>
            <li> Was really impressed by the quality and also, the fact that you can use this both indoors and when tanning outside.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love the product.</li>
            <li> the areas it works best on are the arms stomach chest and back the legs</li>
            <li> Not that appealing of a scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, feels, and the GRADUAL bronzing effect it delivers.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering; and not tropical like most lotions.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion of all time.</li>
            <li> like im better of just using baby oil.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> Hopefully you have better luck if you purchase this.</li>
            <li> just not so sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was better off using store brand</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s favorite</li>

            <li> therefore i have purchased many lotions and accelerators.</li>
            <li> but I have used much better bronzers than this.</li>
            <li> I did use it and it worked ok.</li>
            <li> ok I guess.</li>
            <li> Wish it had more of a bronzer in it</li>
            <li> I truly love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Great price for product fast shipping by seller</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> and i love the results.</li>
            <li> Love the results and for the price</li>
            <li> The number one thing I love about this lotion is that it doesn&#x27;t give you the oily feeling a lot of lotions tend to do.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell but after putting it on it felt sticky afterward</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is the very very best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really pleased with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I am more tan than when I started, the smell is Meh, the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I really enjoy this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> Enjoyable scent</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin really smooth and the smell is nice</li>
            <li> I do not burn with this lotion at the tanning bed times that are appropriate for my skin tone, but I also dont purposely burn myself.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells good kind of like brown sugar, and it smelled okay after tanning, but I don&#x27;t really think it helped me tan.</li>
            <li> I order this lotion and was very pleased with how quickly I got it.</li>
            <li> When you first get out of the bed you look great, but it fades so quickly!</li>
            <li> Thanks Again!!!!</li>
            <li> I just want to say I am not payed to write this I am a real person!!!!</li>
            <li> you are looking for and this stuff works fast!!!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was very excited to get this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Also the name is very fun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very excited to use this product just haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li> if you are familiar with bath and body works it smells like warm vanilla sugar lotion.</li>
            <li> Bronzes you up beautifully, and leaves your skin silky soft all summer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really bad, but could be better!</li>
            <li> All in all, a great lotion that I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried other lotions this is very nice and smells great</li>
            <li> :) I swear, this helped me get an amazing tan really quickly.</li>
            <li> I give Paint it Black 4 stars because it does its job nicely for a great price!</li>
            <li> Would defiantly recommend to anyone, beginner or advanced tanner and its a super good price.</li>
            <li> I couldnt believe how good this worked compared to everything else I have tried and its SUPER cheap</li>
            <li> I liked the smell and it went on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Tanning lotion is good smelling and super smooth feeling when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty fair skinned</li>
            <li> It smells so good and after the first couple times of tanning i noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled good when I first opened the bottle, but while I was applying it to my skin</li>
            <li> I saw no difference after a month, and I am pretty fair skinned.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice in the bottle, would agree it smells sweet like sugar/vanilla.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned</li>
            <li> This has lasted a long time and smells great!</li>
            <li> The designer skin line seems to be pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> Lotion worked pretty good to get my tan going.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that many have used it and are just fine.</li>
            <li> Excited to get my tan on!</li>
            <li> and I will def say NOT DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> It has a fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t turn into that \\&quot;tanning bed smell\\&quot; and works well!!</li>
            <li> finally have nice tan!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, yes; but more importantly, it gives me a nice rich bronzed hue (not orange).</li>
            <li> Smell was pleasant but did not Bronze as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Excellent tan &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry skin.  </li>
            <li> works as promised, and i am loving the quick tan.  </li>
            <li> The smell was OK not to strong</li>
            <li> Works quickly, and gives you a nice tan glow.</li>
            <li> It glides on easily and is absorbed quickly and because of the silicone emulsion, my skin feels great for hours and never feels sticky or greasy when I use this.</li>
            <li> , is super hydrating AND turns you a nice brown.  </li>
            <li> Definatly recommended for anyone who wants fast results and beautiful tanned skin!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of tanning lotion from this seller, and I&#x27;m *sold*!  Fantastic service, awesome pricing, and...</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> There are many tan accelerants/moisturizers that have a cheap perfume scent to them that might smell good upon first use, but after a while they tend to have this waning fragrance that you can&#x27;t wait to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for very long to see how fast it tans, but it goes on good and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love the way it spells and works just fine  , I have been buying tanning lotions from places I use to go to Tanning</li>
            <li> im sure it will be fine</li>
            <li> Love it and got here quick!</li>
            <li> The after tan smell is definitely the best part (which is rare!).</li>
            <li> It worked pretty good but due to price and results it wasnt the greatest.</li>
            <li> They had lots of different products to choose from and at very good prices.</li>
            <li> I have used several high dollar lotions over the years and this by far, is the best quality , not to mention the best PRICE!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> huge bottle was five bucks more, and it came in TWO days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was worried about becoming orange, but had no problems in that area.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, and feels great, but as far as darkness of color, it hasn&#x27;t done much for me.  </li>
            <li> I took the plunge, and so far I am happy.</li>
            <li> I liked this lotion, the smell was better than average, although the reviews of a great smell, etc....seemed a bit over the top to me.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well from the color I&#x27;ve developed but not the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I also received it quicker then what I had expected which was awesome!  </li>
            <li> Its a nice, light sweet scent without smelling like youre giving the coconuts a run for their money or like an over fried churro when your 15 min are up.</li>
            <li> Got better results with a cheap beauty supply store product.  </li>
            <li> if I sat in a bathtub filled with coffee grindes I&#x27;d get a better tan than I&#x27;ve gotten from using this.</li>
            <li> So far it has been great.</li>
            <li> It gives a great natural tan color too.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with a cheap piece of scotch tape over the top.</li>
            <li> also incapable of becoming tan without help</li>
            <li> This lotion works great and it giving me a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I got this product and WOW its great.</li>
            <li> I was very white and now have a beautiful tan I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments:)  </li>
            <li> far as the tanning qualities, it works great.</li>
            <li> I give it just an OK rating it was cheap</li>
            <li> Give it a couple tries, its wonderful!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and it keeps us nice and golden brown.</li>
            <li> Smells really good &amp; is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a nice golden bronze.</li>
            <li> the smell is ok, ive smelled better but its not bad.</li>
            <li> Its a good tanning lotion and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It smells good and absorbs into the skin fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really give me a good tan.</li>
            <li> This is better then the 100x, the 100x makes you orange due to the bronzing in it, this one just gives nice tan and a great scent.</li>
            <li> i bought and tried this, once i went in water, my skin was all gooey and slippery and i looked like a shedding lizard, guessing this product is mostly for tanning bed, if your in the sun and laying on raft in pool, i would highly recommend Austalian Gold bronzing dry oil spray intensifier with color boost maximizer, for a great great tan,</li>
            <li> those who tan every day to every other day this is the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li> It looks really cool if someone&#x27;s playing some bass-type music, cuz I can strut like a pimp to it!</li>
            <li> Great scent, but not dark at all.</li>
            <li> after tanning only twice and using the lotion i have a good tan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is now her \\&quot;go to\\&quot; lotion!</li>
            <li> so you could see where you apply and the spots you missed but other than that works excellent--</li>
            <li> Good lotion with dark bronzed just make sure you wipe your hands good then wash them when your done or your fingers will be orange</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price!</li>
            <li> Liked how light the lotion is and doesn&#x27;t have the normal tanning lotion smell but expected way more for a product that was selected as #2 of Top 10 Best tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel nice and silky post tan because it has silicone in it, but as soon as you get out of the shower you better have after tan lotion ready because you will get the \\&quot;tan</li>
            <li> Works great, smells good, no worries about leaving lines or uneven spots.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a caramel color and is easy to apply before your tanning session.</li>
            <li> Yes it spreads easily.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because I think it would work better for someone that doesn&#x27;t have fair or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I get a nice even tan and the bronzer helps my stretch marks not stand out so much :)</li>
            <li> My skin tans relatively easily already though, and</li>
            <li> My skin does not tan easily</li>
            <li> A product like the purchased in a salon would  easily cost $30</li>
            <li> I tan fairly easily</li>
            <li> I tan easy</li>
            <li> &amp; you will be summer fun ready &amp; smell great.</li>
            <li> a great amazon price means I&#x27;ll definitely order again! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the texture, thanks to the silicone, and my skin still feels soft after my tanning session.</li>
            <li> really helps my skin turn nice pecan brown:)</li>
            <li> Smells like vanilla and goes on easy.</li>
            <li> therefore you know I do not tan easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and will not leave marks.</li>
            <li> and I would burn easily.</li>
            <li> which i tan really easy anyway</li>
            <li> My friend who tans easily used it also, but without result.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick though...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get orange hands, and it smells really clean and cottony, which helps prevent a more burnt skin smell you get when using fruit scented lotions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan easily</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a strong lotion with a lot of bronzing power,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lotions before that all I wanted to do was gobhome and wash it off because it smelled so strong.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Initially before sun expose it smelled kind of good but not afterwards.</li>
            <li> I mainly got this lotion because it got generally good reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong either</li>
            <li> I thought with 50x that I&#x27;d be getting the darkest bronzing ever however I only got a nice textured good smelling lotion with what appears to be no bronzer.</li>
            <li> Extreme Silicone Auto Darkening Tanning Lotion 13.5 oz   is a great product you see results after your first tanning sesion and is also a great after tanning mositerizer.</li>
            <li> for the money, this lotion works better than most out there, and the price is right on.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and, while using this product I was able to achieve darker results faster than other lotions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like Beauty in a bottle, you get a natural bronze tan with an awesome after tan smell and absolutely  devine, smooth and silky skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for about 2mths, already have a pretty nice tan.</li>
            <li> The best thing I can say about it is it smells good with almost no detectable scent afterwards and doesn&#x27;t make my Irish skin burn after 20 minutes in a regular bed.</li>
            <li> Today makes a week tanning agin, not on a every day basis and the beds here are not even as good as my normal tanning salon</li>
            <li> Excellent product but no sun screen got really dark</li>
            <li> It works pretty nice.</li>
            <li> After first use I got a nice color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice on very hot days, the stuff looks like a creamy brown coming out of the tube, it goes on and is nice and cool like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li> now almost a month later iv got a beautiful tan going on</li>
            <li> Just ok, Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> There was only a piece of scotch tape over the top of the bottle without any kind of seal around the top or between the bottle and the top.    </li>
            <li> It Black will help me reach my best color yet!</li>
            <li> but I thought it was fine.</li>
            <li> Paint it black tanning lotion is great!</li>
            <li> After using Paint It Black, I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Paint it Black works great!</li>
            <li> Paint it Black is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I work outside a lot on a hot days with a lot of sun,this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and easily</li>
            <li> Black works best as a tanning enhancer, in the tanning bed or the sun.</li>
            <li> the lotion for tanning bed paint it black is wonderful</li>
            <li> I dont see a expiration date on bottle but its working fine.</li>
            <li> So the first day I tried it I was very happy, so then the next day I put the paint</li>
            <li> so I assume it worked fine</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> and I actually have a pretty great tan!</li>
            <li> But im still using it because the odd smell doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it is an awesome tanning lotion with quick results!</li>
            <li> I do actually fine at 15 mins now)</li>
            <li> so i guess for some it works fine but not for me.</li>
            <li> I think this lotion has probably done a fine job of accelerating the tan.</li>
            <li> Applies easily and makes your skin feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last week and it worked great!</li>
            <li> It works fine as a moisturizing tanning lotion but thats about it.</li>
            <li> and I am fine.</li>
            <li> Black is that it smells great!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses it more than me and she loves it because she gets tan quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick results!</li>
            <li> outside(I don&#x27;t use tanning beds) smells good, and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel very soft, and I thought it smelled really good.</li>
            <li> Smells fine, goes on good, and leaves skin feeling AMAZINGLY soft!</li>
            <li> I see so many great reviews for this lotion, but it actually SHIELDED the bulbs from giving me my full tan.</li>
            <li> It smells good and makes your skin silky soft!</li>
            <li> I have loved using this lotion so far!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions, this by far has to be my favorite!</li>
            <li> It gives me such a nice tan while leaving my skin feeling super soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li> Not greasy and no unpleasant after tanning smell!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely urge anyone to get this that wants a great tan quick!</li>
            <li> This is a very popular auto tanning lotion, which gives a deep, dark, rich tan and the scent is great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about the claim that it is &#x27;firming&#x27;...who knows if those claims about anything really is accurate.</li>
            <li> , I had plateaued some, but I just used this on my legs and seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but I can alreay tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I know that this should be taken with a huge grain of salt but the lady that owns the tanning salon</li>
            <li> It felt great one and left my skin smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I also havent ever noticed any staining on myself or my clothes after using it which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay on Amazon this is a huge steal.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent of the lotion and its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> For what the product is worth, it was okay.</li>
            <li> Great smell and definitely increases your tan.</li>
            <li> I got 2 bottles for $27 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> and leaves your skin feeling smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> That was confirmed...</li>
            <li> Grab this up when it is this cheap, even working in a salon and getting a discount from reg prices</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, it applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion, even if your just starting or maybe trying to even out your tan.</li>
            <li> I  am happy to say I am back!</li>
            <li> The smell is so light and not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a great price obviously, but it&#x27;s just something to think about...</li>
            <li> Works very well and smells amazing</li>
            <li> So if you have light skin then this should work for you.</li>
            <li> Get this lotion if you can find it at a cheap price.</li>
            <li> We both have light skin</li>
            <li> I think it smells fabulous before and after tanning.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this lotion and would recommend it to everyone wanting a golden brown tan from the tanning salon with no streaking marks.</li>
            <li> I have used many tanning lotions and can tell you first hand that this product is average at best.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li> This tanning lotion gave me a great overall coloring.  </li>
            <li> It was silky and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feel awesomely smooth.</li>
            <li> I have fairly light skin, but I can tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> This product has a ncool bottle, and for so cheap</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t feel comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and helps keep you moisturized while tanning.</li>
            <li> It has a great instant tan with bronzers that don&#x27;t turn you orange!</li>
            <li> I was using a cheap Walmart lotion before I got this</li>
            <li> so happy not to be stuck wearing blue jeans</li>
            <li> I think  it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> When you tan it absorbs into your skin so when you leave the bed/hex the silicone leaves your skin silky smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion really gives you nice color when used in indoor tanning salons.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you darker, turns u into a light orange shade.</li>
            <li> Anyways, not only does it smell great</li>
            <li> but it also goes on extremely smooth because its silicone</li>
            <li> but after I was done it reminded me of a combo of burnt skin and cheap body wash.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product and it has always worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy at all, but can have a smell after a while if you do not shower all day.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> how do they sell it so cheap?</li>
            <li> try it great price buy only from the Milleium site ......</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> and this has such great conditioners in it.  </li>
            <li> They wanted $68.00 for this lotion at my salon, I got it for $14.95 with free Prime shipping on here.  </li>
            <li> They wanted $68.00 for this lotion at my salon, I got it for $14.95 with free Prime shipping on here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked the results SO much, though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this years ago and it was great, but I recently purchased this again</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Everyone always ask why is was so cheap compared to the tanning salon prices of 50-60 bucks.</li>
            <li> but I like the cheap price</li>
            <li> and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> After just one use, I can say it is a great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> overall its a great product</li>
            <li> It has a light floral smell.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth like body lotion and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Thank you Millennium for such a great invention.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times at the beach because it says it works great outdoors, but I got no color at all!</li>
            <li> , it smells of light perfume.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been softer and the color is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Yes this lotion is silicone based and goes on smoothly, evenly, and does not require a &amp;#34;ton&amp;#34; of lotion to cover your body.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall great lotion.</li>
            <li> This probably is cheap but gives you an orange tint.</li>
            <li> this made me more golden that the Luminosity.</li>
            <li> I put a light sunscreen, and then this.  </li>
            <li> Price is fantastic compared to salons.</li>
            <li> I have used many different lotions and this one by far is the best, texture, smell!</li>
            <li> Smells good, works well, like the bronzers in it, gives u a natural looking tan</li>
            <li> I take a shower immediately after tanning and my skin was still soft after my shower so the moisturizers are of good quality and don&#x27;t wash off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice soft smell, not overpowering like many tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> Good for someone who goes tanning frequently.</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times so far and all has been good.  </li>
            <li> A good lotion if you go tanning several times a week, not so good for someone who doesn&#x27;t go tanning very often.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good for outside use as well as tanning bed use although I saw better results with a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> II have fair skin and only go to the tanning bed three months out of the year, I have tried many lotions, and after reading the reviews I decided to try this lotion.</li>
            <li> skin feels really soft after tanning, it smells good also,</li>
            <li> I have fair soft skin</li>
            <li> You can really achieve a deep color and the smell is great!</li>
            <li> It smells good, and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I think it does a good job with enhancing my tan since most people can notice I&#x27;ve tanned after only a couple tanning visits.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> Make sure you drink enough water, lather with a good lotion after every shower, and this should be an ace in the hole for you.</li>
            <li> The initial vanilla scent is wonderful and it works very well without streaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product, I am fair and I have a very natural, deep tan that I am very happy with.</li>
            <li> Just a gorgeous, natural tan ... FAST!!!  </li>
            <li> It really works!!!  </li>
            <li> Company ships FAST!!!  </li>
            <li> Tans your skin really fast!!!  </li>
            <li> Saw results the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li> Gets you tanned soooooo much faster than with no lotion at all!!!  </li>
            <li> I really like this tanning lotion all together!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me orange at all, in fact it brought out a very golden brown that I couldn&#x27;t have achieved otherwise.</li>
            <li> I did try it a few times anyway, but it did not make me more tan at all!!!</li>
            <li> It comes out too light a color than the original.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, it goes on very smoothly &amp; absorbs very well!  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t generally allergic to lotions I&#x27;d tell you that this product is perfect, however, if your skin is sensitive I&#x27;d recommend staying away from this product.</li>
            <li> The first thing I want to say after using this lotion for about a week is that the product description word for word couldn&#x27;t be more accurate.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I expected at a great price!  </li>
            <li> Decent lotion, smells nice and isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty advanced tanner, and I have been tanning for many years</li>
            <li> pretty much all the good lotions work</li>
            <li> Try this for sure, cheap and does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to for sure!</li>
            <li> I would very much recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> it works very quick and last a good while</li>
            <li> I have been using paint it black for about a month now and it works great, also my tan lasts more than a week.</li>
            <li> If you have a trip planned and need a quick tan this is great, but only if you are already a tanner.</li>
            <li> but I was glad to find this one just like the one I purchased for a much higher price at the tanning salon</li>
            <li> After one tanning session I noticed a significant boost in my color.</li>
            <li> I USED IT ONE TIME IN THE TANNING BED AND RECIEVED A SIGNIFICANT TAN..</li>
            <li> Probably would have worked even better in a higher level bed.  </li>
            <li> were i can purchase a sample first instead of getting stuck with a $20.00 bottle of junk,even if i have to pay more</li>
            <li> For the inexpensive price, this lotion is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t until I used this lotion that I could notice a significant darkening in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It also did not come in its original packaging, presumably to save on shipping.</li>
            <li> this item is well worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> For one, when you first put on the lotion it smells... okay.</li>
            <li> and...well, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> , it has a suttle fresh scent to it!</li>
            <li> What do you expect for it to smell like fresh linens!??</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner and have worked at a tanning salon for many years.</li>
            <li> this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve not been satisfied with.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion lasted me over 6 months which is a really long time and also a great value.</li>
            <li> I have to say the first time I used this I fell in love.</li>
            <li> After reading, this one seemed to be one of the higher rated, and most bought.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product after reading reviews.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I am not that familiar with the lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it has a unique fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the fast results!</li>
            <li> rich color lasts longer than I thought it Would</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was so excited to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> For me this lotions is just not cutting it!</li>
            <li> This product, on the other hand, has people around me exclaiming, \\&quot;Something smells good!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been getting significantly tanner ever since i started using this product.</li>
            <li> The smell was nice but the tan was normal .</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this lotion</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this lotion because of the PRICE...</li>
            <li> 8 hours later, and it still has a nice smell!</li>
            <li> Maybe it got to hot and broke down the bronzers or something while shipping, smelled good, felt good but didnt do a thing for my tan.</li>
            <li> This lotion smelled great and made my skin super soft and silky and gave me a very nice dark color, i saw the results after just one use of this lotion...</li>
            <li> Also, the tanning lotion goes on smooth, actually smells good and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li> so i would get free super saver shipping.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great and the silicone really makes your skin so so soft.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, smells amazing and definitely works for tanning.</li>
            <li> I have gotten such amazing color from this lotion, my skin is so smooth too!</li>
            <li> goes on clean and doesnt leave me greasy afterwords.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough how much i love this product its Amazing</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pleasant enough to tan before work and work all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned naturally and this gave me a nice dark color.</li>
            <li> Was very good lotion and gets you dark quick without the tingle.</li>
            <li> I am getting this old favorite!</li>
            <li> I figure if that works then its a special bonus</li>
            <li> You may not know what I&#x27;m talking about because most tanning salons use the large company brands</li>
            <li> nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> It smells like tanning lotion, nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this product.  </li>
            <li> I stopped at a gas station right after tanning, and the guy working asked what perfume I was wearing!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE RIGHT!</li>
            <li> i made sure i rubbed it in really good until dry but didnt have a chance to wash my hands!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly &amp; smells good but other than that, it was a waist of my 13 dollars!</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to find a product that did not smell like a girl -- this works great!  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the light refreshing smell and that it is not a very thick lotion.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent (nothing like Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27; \\&quot;Warm Vanilla Sugar\\&quot; like another reviewer stated, thank goodness) and has little to no after-tan odor.</li>
            <li> it definitely works better than not using it..and its a very good price (considering what you get is actually real).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great accelerator for tanning; not much smell, but</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty fair naturally, so I have to work to maintain color.  </li>
            <li> I love how this lotion smells and feels on my skin, but I don&#x27;t really think it has the amount of bronzer it advertises.  </li>
            <li> It was equally as good as several that I had paid $60/bottle for at the salon!  </li>
            <li> so glad i did not pay that much 4 it</li>
            <li> but true)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning over a week using this lotion &amp; have gotten a nice tan so far</li>
            <li> I simply wanted a good tanning lotion that would help men tan betten in my indoor tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on here before buying and everything they say is true</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and light and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li> At this point I had already worked my way up to the full 10 minutes and was getting no where.</li>
            <li> it smells good, feels good, and the only problem i had was that i burn, but that&#x27;s just my skin type, so of course it could be different for someone else.</li>
            <li> It makes cool on the downlow or whatever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the people people that have used this lotion have noticed real antiaging effects.   </li>
            <li> My 3x bronzer (Hempology) works better and was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> i also love the color it works very well</li>
            <li> I bought this from a different seller a couple years ago and LOVED it....</li>
            <li> it works as a tanning lotion, very moisturizing, but i have used spellbound by designer skin with quadruple bronzer, and the immediate results are a lot better, i will probably buy that to use instead.</li>
            <li> Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> Overall, it smells good</li>
            <li> Save your money and stick with the tried and true drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product, but</li>
            <li> It has an extremely wonderful, silky smooth feel - but it actually broke me out on my chest and around the back of my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> because I use alot most of the time when I go, you do not need to use much at all</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin soft and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> I would NOT however purchase this lotion at full retail.</li>
            <li> (but I&#x27;m sure they would work better or at least as good).  </li>
            <li> Sort of sweet and summery.</li>
            <li> Has a nice soft feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have much scent, but I&#x27;m okay with that as I don&#x27;t like for others to smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tanning beds for quite a while, and this is the most unusual lotion I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even go the full time.</li>
            <li> Not enough bronzing in product and im fair skin</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a basic, good tanning lotion-</li>
            <li> Good touch up lotion if your someone who doesn&#x27;t go regularly.</li>
            <li> but this is a true brown color.</li>
            <li> I used this product last year and loved it.</li>
            <li> The lotion is perfect consistency, it&#x27;s not runny or so thick.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells like sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li> but thats not a bad smell...</li>
            <li> I read all sorts of good reviews on this product, how dark even the whitest person was able to get....  </li>
            <li> The smell not bad if you stay away from everybody.</li>
            <li> No, but its not a bad price.</li>
            <li> Smells like a tanning lotion, its not bad</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance is not bad though.</li>
            <li> I bought it because the price is not bad compared to some others</li>
            <li> Definitely not a bad choice</li>
            <li> Works really good and does not leave the after smell that most other tanning lotions leave on your skin!</li>
            <li> it smelled amazing and my skin was super soft for that day.  </li>
            <li> This one is my top choice,works very well taking your tan darker quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this product allows me to hit a tanning bed less often with good color.</li>
            <li> After reading so many good reviews,I just had to try Paint it Black.  </li>
            <li> Went on smooth, absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Fast and very friendly customer service.</li>
            <li> I tan pretty easily</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty easy to do.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent, love the way my skin feels after using it, love how fast I got my tan back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing it soon to see how it compares, but honestly I&#x27;m kinda new to the whole tanning thing, and I have yet to try the entire Designer Skin line to compare these to, and they seem to be the most popular.  </li>
            <li> Each time I use it I get an amazing tan afterwards and certainly look much darker than if I tan with just oil or no lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t give you that burnt flesh smell like other lotions.</li>
            <li> Its ridiculously moisturizing and wonderful feeling for like hours after tanning.    </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Its also smooth and velvety when you apply it, it adds instant glow to your body and works amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different products and this one is better then most.  </li>
            <li> It also arrived quickly and on time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super picky.  </li>
            <li> quick turn around, a pleasure to do business with.</li>
            <li> I thought DS lotions were overpriced and made my skin super greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I ordered and it was here the next day, Amazing service!</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice enough and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> but it reaches a point where you don&#x27;t get any darker and it does fade fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get a quick tan and that I did....</li>
            <li> Deliver time is super quick 3 day max.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It gives you a quick tan look.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this tanning lotion because I was already using back in blaque (which is also awesome) and she said it will give my tan an instant boost.</li>
            <li> The lotion is light an not heavy, with no horrible smell to it.</li>
            <li> The thing I like the most about this particular lotion is the scent and the feel of it.</li>
            <li> so it dries quick and isn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li> Quick noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.  </li>
            <li> For someone who doesn&#x27;t normally get dark, I am very impressed already.</li>
            <li> I bought this after deciding that I needed a quick tan before a weekend getaway.</li>
            <li> I am almost out of it and most definitely will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li> My skin seemed to absorb it quickly.</li>
            <li> but I felt like I ran out really quick.</li>
            <li> It arrived in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li> Worth the money if you want a beautiful dark tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this lotion if you&#x27;re looking to get color quickly, but not so dramatically that it&#x27;ll look like you spray tanned over night.</li>
            <li> but I will most likely be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind because I did get color results quickly</li>
            <li> This DOES NOT MAKE YOU SUPER TAN WITH ONE USE.</li>
            <li> love love love the paint it black</li>
            <li> Ok I wanted to purchase an inexpensive yet closest to high end quality tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a really good tanning lotion, I noticed a good deal of a difference after the first, the second, &amp; now the third use.</li>
            <li> If you want to have a great dark color quick this is for you.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice smell unlike other tanning lotions that can be overpowering.</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner -- very light natural skin tone but tans easily.</li>
            <li> I seen huge results just from the first tan.</li>
            <li> , it definitely gets you a nice golden brown tan!</li>
            <li> This is a great for people who cannot use tingle factor and want to get dark faster</li>
            <li> Helps to get a great, even, dark tan.</li>
            <li> This stuff gives you a nice deep rich brown bronze color.</li>
            <li> Great for the tanning bed and that dark look</li>
            <li> Very much recommended!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Great product for a really dark tan.</li>
            <li> Gives you a great dark tone, no orange look at all.</li>
            <li> great wife looks tan and dark</li>
            <li> Great lotion, for a decent price.. You actually get a lot of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> It seems to last pretty good too and not fade away so quick.</li>
            <li> I am trying a new product and hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> I love trying out new tanning lotions, it is an obsession of mine.  </li>
            <li> but I live marshmallows. :)</li>
            <li> It makes yuor skin feel great, less smell, you seem to tan quicker, and your tan lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> Paint it Black 50X indoor tanning lotion is a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> The price is wonderful, but as far as quality, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> The paint it black works great.</li>
            <li> It Black, partly because of the great reviews and also because of the price.</li>
            <li> Paint it black tanning lotion works great</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn my fair skin a weird color, and it smells nice!</li>
            <li> I wanted this product to get a pretty good jump on the tanning season..and living in Southern California in April</li>
            <li> I use a variety of tanning products (some better than others) but this is the first one that I purchased that does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell even after tanning and the smoothness of this lotion allows it to go on easy.  </li>
            <li> The bronzers in it are strong, but not so much that it leaves steaks.</li>
            <li> Love this, will continue to buy it as long as its available!</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty fair right now, but I am Italian and tan very easily, so I can&#x27;t speak for those with naturally fair/pale skin.</li>
            <li> made my very fair skin pretty dark but wore off at first.</li>
            <li> The extreme silicone made my skin so soft and smooth, really helped my skin look great!!</li>
            <li> Fast service !!</li>
            <li> Our daughter is in love with it so far!</li>
            <li> I love this product so far!</li>
            <li> My wife and I were impressed with the product on our first order compared to much more expensive tanning lotions</li>
            <li> i got compliments the first day i was using it!</li>
            <li> This lotion does exactly what the company says it will!</li>
            <li> I really like this tanning lotion!!  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted !</li>
            <li> I have tried several tanning lotions but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty amazed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only gone tanning using this lotion a couple of times,and I love the color that I am getting!  </li>
            <li> this is absolutely real!!</li>
            <li> Same as the one I paid a lot more for!</li>
            <li> I could tell after my first use!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the prices salon owners are paying in the first place before they up the price!  </li>
            <li> Then I went to Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and got a low end lotion there that worked better than this one!</li>
            <li> I have tried probably hundreds of lotions, but paint it black is by far the best..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- it does smell nice during the application, and the after smell certainly was more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because it had so many positive reviews and reasonably  priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine cream I suppose, but if you&#x27;re looking to darken your complexion then it doesn&#x27;t offer much.</li>
            <li> A good smell to the lotion and the color was dark &amp; rich .</li>
            <li> Seems to be a decent tanning lotion, specially for the cheap price...   </li>
            <li> I have tried many tanning lotions, and being an impatient person I LOVE strong bronzing tanning lotions, and I am not afraid to try them even though my skin is light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great, like a vanilla with a little hint of citrus.</li>
            <li> Even though my skin feels great right after putting it on, about 12 hours later my skin is dry and much more flaky than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really think I got very good color from it after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin feels good when I get out instead of dry like other products I have used and gives you a good color.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this lotion after reading all the positive reviews....</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and smooth going on.</li>
            <li> , it took me about a week of going everyday to get a great tan started.</li>
            <li> Definitely didn&#x27;t give me any amazing results.</li>
            <li> It is very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> although I did finish the bottle it kind of left a residue on my skin that would peel off sometimes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i recommend it 100% worth the money in gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Than I didn&#x27;t see if it was useful.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the smell too much, and I have used tanning lotions a lot better than this.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion shortly after buying my own tanning bed.</li>
            <li> so I think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a nice moisturizer but gives no color at all if you are a non-tanning bed user.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel hydrated after tanning, and it makes my \\&quot;fair\\&quot; colored skin turn a nice brown color instead of red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times now and it doesn&#x27;t do anything more for me than the cheap stuff I buy at the store.  </li>
            <li> It gives my skin a golden tan.</li>
            <li> It gave me a great base tan, smells delicious, moisturize  really well as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice pump bottle of lotion, but cannot find any that&#x27;s on the same price range as the Millenium Brand.</li>
            <li> Absolutely No orange hue to my tan at All, good even coverage, and</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is really thick and goes on so smooth, your skin feels great before and after tanning.</li>
            <li> my legs are finally golden tan...NOT orange,</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the smell of the lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still doing my own investigation to see if the product is same lotion you would purchase from a tanning salon....</li>
            <li> This product was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got a nice tan in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Definetly worth the money</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest and it smells even worse after I tan.</li>
            <li> However, the smell after on my skin after I finished tanning was kind of gross.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite</li>
            <li> Worth every penny . . .</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> ** was worth $99.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft as smooth and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Also, the effects were worth the price o</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly to get me a good base tan for the summer.</li>
            <li> My package arrived on time, but the lotion was not as good as i expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> I got a nice tan from using it overall</li>
            <li> My skin type is fair, but able to get tan by going slow in the beds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice enough when applied, but the smell of cooked sugar stays on my skin for hours and hours after tanning.</li>
            <li> The product is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Even with my extremely fair complexion, I have already seen my skin getting darker in just a week than I did in a whole month using an Australian Gold product.</li>
            <li> I was using Supre Sweet and Sexy bronzer and barely got a tan after a couple uses</li>
            <li> well worth it 100%</li>
            <li> i have fair skin with pink undertone.</li>
            <li> As far as it&#x27;s effect, I could have shown a bit more color</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> and I prefer more of a masculine scent</li>
            <li> Not bad when you first apply, but after tanning...</li>
            <li> However, this is good for people who are pale so they can build up a light tan and for paler people on a budget.</li>
            <li> You get nice color, however you will notice that it fades pretty quickly the next day..</li>
            <li> Its OK not what I expected when I read all the other reviews it sounded good , but it could have been better.</li>
            <li> It gets you dark really quick and that to me is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, especially for the price, I&#x27;ve used many different lotions and this one is definitely with the best ones.</li>
            <li> Unlike some lotions, you can continue to run errands after tanning and feel confident knowing that people are staring at you for other reasons aside from your \\&quot;just tanned\\&quot; odor :)  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get me too hot in the bed, the results came quick, and the price on Amazon compared to salon&#x27;s prices can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> It does a good job at giving me more color than i was getting, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The color with this bronzer is good, but it leaves my skin dryer than other bronzers.</li>
            <li> I thought i would give this a try because it was a pretty good price for tanning lotion and had good reviews, but i was wrong about it.</li>
            <li> Other than that you&#x27;re going to have to spend about 20 to 25 bucks for the good stuff on amazon.</li>
            <li> if you are a beginner tanner i highly reccommend that you do not use this product until you are fairly tan without bronzers because this is a dha rich concoction which will look orangy on you if you are not already fairly dark (think full time in a medium bed no burning tan)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many tanning lotions over the years and paint it black is the best one i&#x27;ve used so far, I definitely will not being switching anytime soon.</li>
            <li> You see the results right away.</li>
            <li> I was right.</li>
            <li> I returned it right when I realized and am still waiting for my refund.</li>
            <li> I put it on right before</li>
            <li> But I wasn&#x27;t expecting any color right away</li>
            <li> It will take you color and boost it right up.</li>
            <li> priced just right 2.</li>
            <li> by the second time it was a beautiful color and the third i was at the color</li>
            <li> the 50x is pretty good, but there&#x27;s not much difference in price, so go ahead &amp; get the 100x.</li>
            <li> The product works decent at first, but the color fades very quickly, even for a bronzer.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for that dark deep tan</li>
            <li> I had hoped for exceptional results, and didn&#x27;t even get minimal results.</li>
            <li> If it were anymore than 12 bucks I would have to take a star off, but if you want to be a cheap skate and still have a decent tan, get this.</li>
            <li> I am Irish and burn very easily (1 hr in sun</li>
            <li> okay, I switched to the 60x bronzer recently through the same manufacturer, smells better w/better results!</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion primarily because of the large number of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> so I have tried them all, cheap runny ones, tingling ones to the ultra high priced ones.</li>
            <li> Dont let the cheap proce fool you, it is high quality.</li>
            <li> I work in a tanning salon and have used many products with alot less amount of bronzers and have recieved much better color.</li>
            <li> The best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve tried is Black Diamond, but I think that only because it reminds me of the Perfume</li>
            <li> Most lotions leave your skin dry after tanning , but this lotion keeped my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> So since I lost most of my tan, I was looking for something to get it back and quick.</li>
            <li> This lotion was pretty cheap, and it worked ok, but it wasn&#x27;t anything wondrous - I tanned with it, but it didn&#x27;t make me super super dark like it says it would.</li>
            <li> it will make you super dark, the lotion itsself is like a light pinkish brown tone very light color</li>
            <li> I have tried several different lotions, and this is definitely, by far, the very best.</li>
            <li> Def worth 13 dollars ;)</li>
            <li> so my tan is pretty brown golden.</li>
            <li> And of course, you have to keep it up by applying and tanning some more, but I go pretty sparingly, perhaps three times a month and still am a nice tan instead of my usual paleness.  </li>
            <li> I like the lotion because one it smells good and two it gets you really dark</li>
            <li> It has a good smell (not like some of the other lotions that smell like &amp;#34;tanning bed&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Wanna get a good dark tan?</li>
            <li> It smells yum, good price, gets you dark after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really good, dark tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I certainly doesn&#x27;t make you darker quickly.  </li>
            <li> then your going to spend a little more but get lots more in return.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the price of this lotion, esp since so many dark tanners are around $50 at the salon!</li>
            <li> and if it was priced about 40% lower I would say that its a good deal but keep in mind that this is just average bronzer not any different than the free or cheap samples that they offer you at the tanning shops.</li>
            <li> It does give you a nice golden (not orange) tan but will fade fast if if you don&#x27;t go tanning on a regular consistent basis.  </li>
            <li> After going about 3x a week and not seeing much result as quickly as I wanted to (I&#x27;m getting married next summer/have engagement pics coming up soon and don&#x27;t want to look like Casper), I decided to look for a lotion that would make me darker more quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was new to tanning, it was cheap, and it had about 175 raving reviews.</li>
            <li> I will certainly recommend you to my Friends!  </li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have used where I have noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and was excited to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using currently isn&#x27;t as good as the one I previously used.  </li>
            <li> Applies easy and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Got this product and it&#x27;s good for the use and gives me a slight tan</li>
            <li> This is the first time my fair skin has ever been this dark.</li>
            <li> Iy absorbs quickly and has really accelerated my tanning process.</li>
            <li> , I love it\\&quot;, and we all know 16 year olds rarely notice anything except their next text</li>
            <li> I have always loved these products but after using Black and Tan this seemed to not give me any color.</li>
            <li> My big concern is that the bottle had no seal on it, so how do I know that it wasn&#x27;t filled with just a cheap lotion that has no tanning effects at all?  </li>
            <li> While the lotion is moisurizing and does leave your skin smelling good - not like your typical tanning chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found tanning lotions on amazon for such LOW PRICES!</li>
            <li> I would say for my intentions of going from ghostly white to nice bronze were accomplished.</li>
            <li> Next i used hempz 25x bronzer in a blue bottle and that stuff was great.  </li>
            <li> The bronzers work great and don&#x27;t cause an orange tint and last about 3 days for me (with daily showers).</li>
            <li> then the super sweet fruity smells that most other tanning lotions smell like.</li>
            <li> Also, feels great on my skin for the first few hours, very moisturized and silky.</li>
            <li> As a fair skinned person, I want something with as much bronzer as possible, without turning orange, so that I don&#x27;t have to fry myself looking a normal shade of tan.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spread very well, it just absorbed right in.  </li>
            <li> This is the first lotion that I have used where I really saw results quickly</li>
            <li> Item was shipped super fast and was exactly what I wanted..</li>
            <li> particular lotion is a bronzer, so it does not have the tingle factor (not a fan of tingle factors!!).</li>
            <li> the l0ti0n came very fast and was just what was advertised.</li>
            <li> I am using this and another spray bronzing spray that has an spf 15 since skin cancer is a very real thing.</li>
            <li> and I went through this bottle very fast.</li>
            <li> Got here very fast.</li>
            <li> and it was shipped to me very fast.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a great smelling lotion that will get you a very nice base tan and doesn&#x27;t have any tingle, this is for you.</li>
            <li> i very very upset when it did not work</li>
            <li> It smells good and goes on just like any other moisturizer and the results are fast.</li>
            <li> it is ok isnt working like i thought it would, but has given me fast color, just not dark color</li>
            <li> Its almost like if you miss a day of tanning or don&#x27;t use the lotion one day you are significantly lighter so that was an upset considering that I don&#x27;t want to have to live in a tanning bed to keep my color.</li>
            <li> Maybe it only works for people who tan super easily.</li>
            <li> Smells good very light colored and very watery and thin</li>
            <li> ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get a nice deep color I highly recommend looking into some Ed hardy products.</li>
            <li> you can see the difference after one use and the smell is soft and floral unlike many others with bronzers that high.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past couple of weeks and the results are just amazing!  </li>
            <li> But ok overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it may work well for others, but seems to not like my skin and doesn&#x27;t want to last.</li>
            <li> It gives you a longer lasting and better looking tan.  </li>
            <li> Product gives you color with first application, but does not turn you orange.</li>
            <li> Would not be my first scent choice, but it DOES NOT stink.</li>
            <li> I just used this lotion today for the first time</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t tan for more then 10 min each time &amp; after looking at product only putting it on my legs.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is only okay.  </li>
            <li> Color was okay but washed away in shower (several hours after tanning).</li>
            <li> This lotion left my skin a lovely goldon brown</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product; instead I would suggest spending some extra money on a better quality lotion.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because it seemed that every review said it smelled like something different.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much because it was around 13 dollars, but that&#x27;s what I get for thinking!</li>
            <li> It was my first indoor tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before and it was normally sealed and full.  </li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li> But - it really does!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I went in one time with no lotion at all, and got pretty red/tan...</li>
            <li> I first used it before taking a Caribbean cruise.</li>
            <li> The lotion which I just received in the mail smells and feels EXACTLY how the lotion which I just ran out of feels</li>
            <li> I even bought another bottle when after I used up the first one.</li>
            <li> so using the tanning booth is pretty convenient.  </li>
            <li> I used this lotion for the first time ever yesterday</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have used that wasn&#x27;t Designer Skin brand.  </li>
            <li> I will most likely be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d definitely buy it again :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could ever tan this fast!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and light.</li>
            <li> Tans legs very well!</li>
            <li> I just wanted a cheap lotion to tan and was pleasantly surprised.   </li>
            <li> Sometimes I layer this with a better bronzer just for the extra skin goodies.</li>
            <li> I can tan 3 days in a row in a higher level bed and stay tanned for over two weeks before I start to fade.  </li>
            <li> so it really works for me!</li>
            <li> I did burn the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive tanning lotions!</li>
            <li> First off, when I recieved this lotion mine smelled like bath &amp; body works coconut lime verbena &amp; when I&#x60;m finished tanning</li>
            <li> I decided to try a different lotion that had more bronzers in it.</li>
            <li> The smell (when you first put it on) reminds me of vanilla and spice.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my tan after the first use.</li>
            <li> A great price and brought me at least 4 - 5 tones darker in 2 weeks with 3 days a week use.</li>
            <li> I switched to denim and diamonds by swedish beauty, I personally like it a lot more.</li>
            <li> i just started tanning again indoors for the  first time in years.  </li>
            <li> one one arm first and test out the results.</li>
            <li> That being said, I will most definitely be buying Paint</li>
            <li> but the results are maximized when I use it on the higher level beds.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon vs purchasing at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how watery this product was and how light the color of the lotion seemed.</li>
            <li> It literally made me so tan the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing!</li>
            <li> The price of 5 bottles here is the same as 1 bottle at my tanning place and this works better</li>
            <li> I noticed color after the first time using it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it was here the next day!</li>
            <li> I first came across this lotion from a client in the tanning salon</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> first off..</li>
            <li> First off...</li>
            <li> after I&#x27;m done tanning it smells exactly like when I put it on..</li>
            <li> This product works BETTER outside without sunscreen</li>
            <li> After use this product smells exactly like it does when</li>
            <li> than that, it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;Enhances tan even after first use.</li>
            <li> never did it give me streaks or smell funny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars bc when I first received my package</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion out there expensive if you buy in salon 50$ when i saw it for 10.00 per bottle</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> get me wrong, it&#x27;s still a very good tanning product!</li>
            <li> Big bottle however just wished it worked better.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this lotion, and I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thank you i really appreciate!</li>
            <li> and this is one of the first ever tanning lotions that I started using when I would tan</li>
            <li> It worked for me in just the first week.</li>
            <li> For my first tanning lotion, I could say it does the job.</li>
            <li> and when I used it for the first timeI saw definate results..</li>
            <li> This is the first bronzer that I used and it worked first time I used it..</li>
            <li> This is not a fake post</li>
            <li> I used this product since the first of March.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t satisfying enough.</li>
            <li> I recommend this lotion to anyone that wants a darker tan!</li>
            <li> After the first use I&#x27;m darker then all my friends that use spray tans and tanning beds.  </li>
            <li> Last summer I got so  many compliments on my tan</li>
            <li> The ones for $100.00 at the salon actually did not have stunning reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is probably my second favorite lotion I have tried, my first being made by matahari.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty much no complaints!  </li>
            <li> The bottle says \\&quot;auto-darkening tan technology\\&quot;, but unless you have a tanning bed available to you, I did not see any natural bronzing or darkening going on after a diligent use of this product for two weeks.    </li>
            <li> Im pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than the salons prices, same lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be back again and again!  </li>
            <li> Pretty Barbie</li>
            <li> and i got hooked and used that first, so</li>
            <li> But maybe for someone else it will have better results, everyone is different.</li>
            <li> it really is!</li>
            <li> I want to first speak of some of the reviews</li>
            <li> It smells okay, but my tan actually faded using this product.</li>
            <li> I suggest using a smaller pouch of this product before purchasing the bottle to make sure you wont break out from it.</li>
            <li> Im getting married in 2 months</li>
            <li> I use with a tingle lotion by the same company and they magic together.</li>
            <li> Much better than paying $100 for paying for same thing at tanning salon.</li>
            <li> This is my first tanning bed tanner and it works well.  </li>
            <li> The stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> The first two to three weeks using tinglers</li>
            <li> I will also add that if you&#x27;re looking for a bronzer with more instant effects, this is not the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> and I am pretty fare skinned.</li>
            <li> Compared to how much the salons charge for lotions, this is a steal!</li>
            <li> Reviews really do help me when ordering a product!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am an avid outdoor tanner.</li>
            <li> I am going back to my favorite Hawaiian tanning oil.</li>
            <li> (I go 15 minutes in the Hot bed, or 10 in the stand up)</li>
            <li> I was at a stand still in my tanning and within the first use of Paint</li>
            <li> First time I used it I seen a difference</li>
            <li> The exact sale lotion as the tanning bed places sail for 1/3 the price I say</li>
            <li> The smell is great, it&#x27;s not overpowering whatsoever and there is no after tanning &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; at least not that I have or</li>
            <li> Spens $8 more and get something that will actually work.</li>
            <li> Arrived much quicker than I was expecting!</li>
            <li> i would definitely repurchase. :)</li>
            <li> so much cheaper than any tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I tan within a week if I use it consistently along with sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> It may not glide on like Bronze bunny, but pretty close.</li>
            <li> The bronzers hold its color pretty well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the product but this is the second time I have ordered this product and it claims to have been delivered but wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Well, first of all, this shipment took 9 days to reach me.</li>
            <li> This is my first tanning bed lotion</li>
            <li> This stuff works and if your fair skinned like I am go to the tanning bed for a few weeks</li>
            <li> The clean, vanilla-y scent of this lotion makes it seem like you&#x27;re applying a fragrant body lotion, unlike many other tanning lotions on the market.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for women who are pale or haven&#x27;t tanned in a long time.</li>
            <li> Better smelling by far from the old bronzers!</li>
            <li> It rubs in like a true lotion, which so many other tanning lotions lack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased some online in the past and they say the smell is pleasant</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty positive my tan place was getting $50 for it.     </li>
            <li> the smell was great and my skin felt amazingly soft afterwards, but i didn&#x27;t see a difference at all with a deeper tan after more than 6 uses (and I&#x27;m pasty pale white).</li>
            <li> It has Derma Dark bronzers in it, plus 20 vitamins and minerals to keep your face glowing and healthy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice bronzer but have used other lotions with stronger bronzer.</li>
            <li> good lotion, lasted a long time, not extremely smelly and no glitter (always a plus).</li>
            <li> Thanx, you have got yourself a new loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it goes on really nicely.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is really good for such a low price...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because I have a lot of better lotions and this one was only $15</li>
            <li> has a great smell, good for after you have a base tan.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the investment, especially for us light skinned folks.</li>
            <li> I had good results but decided to try more expensive Designer Skin lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly fair, I have some Irish back there somewhere in my family, but this stuff makes me look like Al Jolsen.</li>
            <li> Deep dark and beautiful</li>
            <li> Since the lotion is relatively cheap through Amazon it maybe ok to use with a stronger bronzer but using it solo is almost a waste.  </li>
            <li> It worked out really great and would reco this to anyone trying to get a good base</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel like it is as good as the \\&quot;Back in Blaque\\&quot; which is only 20X instead of 50X.</li>
            <li> The package arrived the next day thanks to my Prime (love Prime) and I opened one bottle to check out how the lotion smells.</li>
            <li> I am fair skin, freckled with blonde hair and blue eyes.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent Lotion for the price!</li>
            <li> but I definitely would put more effort into making sure its even and smooth than I would with basic tanning oil just to be sure... and use common sense</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and we only carry certain lotions i went outside the salon looking for a good bronzer</li>
            <li> I am super dark and there is no nasty after smell to it.  </li>
            <li> I loved my old lotion, so it had a tough go at winning my heart.</li>
            <li> i used to take frequently to get a dark color tan, but now i tan less frequently becuase thi slotion give me awesome long lasting color  and great smooth skin.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t all that great but no different than any other cheaper tanning lotion, consistency is alright, just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> got the lotions pretty fast in the mail though.</li>
            <li> I pretty much wanna eat my arm when I get home from tanning now.</li>
            <li> She has been an avid tanner for quite some time and really enjoys this lotion.  </li>
            <li> This was my first lotion that I purchased here and the name really sold me.</li>
            <li> fast shipping too thanks guys!</li>
            <li> This is my first real tanning lotion</li>
            <li> seems to be the real deal salons charge way too much for tanning products definatly recomend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that this product does not work very well if you put tanning oil on first...</li>
            <li> It worked fast and got me really tan!  </li>
            <li> a few hours later you will see the bronzing effect not to mention the silicone in this lotion leaves your skin soooo soft and it amells great!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m sold and sticking with the brand unless I stumble upon something better.</li>
            <li> It also has a strange smell that wasn&#x27;t appealing to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells great, like regular body lotion not fruity like other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> this product works very well for a first time tanner and a pro tanner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great lotion maybe for beginners getting their base tan, but not for someone who is more advanced.</li>
            <li> Allot cheaper then everyone else, and works just as good... if not better.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, and after 4 - 5 tanning bed sessions, I was as tan as I usually am in mid-summer.</li>
            <li> all in all, I reccommend this for tanners with a good base tan and a love for lotions :)  </li>
            <li> but it made my skin nice and dark</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice dark color though this does work.</li>
            <li> Within a week I had a nice dark tan.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try it, and with good reason.</li>
            <li> It also gives you a nice color not orange or too dark.</li>
            <li> but would definitely never pay full price for this product!</li>
            <li> which I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for very long (maybe 30 mins on each side at most).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in conjuction with the Black Storm and have had amazing results.</li>
            <li> that it feels soooo amazing because of the silcones in it, when i got out of the tanning bed, i seen a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to buy &#x27;Paint it Black&#x27; by the women who own the tanning salon</li>
            <li> Just make sure it is dry before you put on your clothes because it will stain them.</li>
            <li> I like it done what it said but I liked black storm</li>
            <li> it leaves your skin super duper soft.</li>
            <li> I recieved my order VERY quickly and I would definitely buy from this user again.</li>
            <li> I heard that this is suitable for the natural sun as well; I have decided to test drive it and report back in the fall.  </li>
            <li> so I burn and get red easy.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great for anyone who loves a deep, dark tan.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to over apply, last long &amp; smells good.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a good even tan without making you look like you were left in an oven for to long.</li>
            <li> But...for me, I&#x27;m already pretty dark as it is, and I honestly can&#x27;t tell a diffrence in color when I get out of a 15 minute high pressure bed.</li>
            <li> It certainly does NOT smell like cotton blossoms or vanilla sugar.</li>
            <li> Not saying this product will work for everyone, but it certainly did for me.</li>
            <li> I chose this lotion because of the positive reviews and the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It remained dark in between tanning sessions and left a nice smooth texture to my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff slips right on, and it doesn&#x27;t take a long time for it to smooth out and soak in.  </li>
            <li> I bought this lotion primarily because I wanted something that smells different than the typical, weird-scented tanning lotion; I honestly didn&#x27;t think that it would work as well as it does.</li>
            <li> black sun tan lotion is the best value for the money , my wife used it and she never tans and with this sun tan lotion she did ,looks like she just came back from the beach , I used it all so and it made me look like I just came back from the tropics , I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Was affordable and was a pretty decent lotion.</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li> It certainly gets you bronze, and I am already very tan.</li>
            <li> the price is very good also you cant go wrong......</li>
            <li> The smell is kinda hard to explain, but its good</li>
            <li> I love the bronzer, it really gives you a little golden look as soon as you step out of the bed.</li>
            <li> but it it a HUGE change from my last lotion.</li>
            <li> I read that this stuff was amazing, and I like it, but I still feel like I was darker last summer using a different lotion.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a huge difference in skin tones between a fair-skinned Mediterranean and a fair-skinned Irish person.</li>
            <li> Seen great results in only a few days.</li>
            <li> also shipping was fast and product came intact.</li>
            <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t expect much for $14.00.</li>
            <li> It is not the best smelling stuff to start with, but after you tan it just stinks</li>
            <li> it did not make me bronze or increase my color at all really.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> AND THE SMELL IS VERY PLEASENT</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t noticed too much of a differnce and wouldn&#x27;t buy this lotion again.</li>
            <li> and i just started tanning about a month ago getting ready for summer.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to darken as much as White2Black does.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month and have yet to really see whether it is accelerating my tan.</li>
            <li> it just adds a real boost to your indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> I think I will continue to buy this product because of its reasonable price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v heard of salons selling it for as much as 95.00,</li>
            <li> cuz u never know what your really getting from these internet sites(sad</li>
            <li> The transaction went very well-</li>
            <li> It really is.</li>
            <li> An employee at the tanning salon gave me lots of flack about buying lotion online and how it&#x27;s probably not even real lotion, etc.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be a return customer.</li>
            <li> did n0t give me as much c0l0r while tanning.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> For the amount of bronzers it says it doesn&#x27;t seem to help that much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like it really made me any tanner</li>
            <li> - it really helps you to get a darker tan</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this stuff people!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tingle and works fast</li>
            <li> For the price, I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week and haven&#x27;t notice much difference..</li>
            <li> I want an accelerator not a bronser so much.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The lotion is very liquidy, almost like water.</li>
            <li> Shipping was SO fast.</li>
            <li> Fast ship time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this lotion.  </li>
            <li> But I tried this stuff, and after just a couple uses, I&#x27;m ready to throw the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy and sticky, and never feels like it really absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> Spent a lil more on austrailian gold vintage gold</li>
            <li> but I tend to lose my tan extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> So if you want fast results without frying yourself this lotion is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> haha..</li>
            <li> I have tried it and is shows not as much \\&quot;darkening\\&quot; and I was expecting...</li>
            <li> Made tanning in the sun so much easier.</li>
            <li> i thought that the 50x bronzer would be too intense for me</li>
            <li> my tan is now much lighter...</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re really tan</li>
            <li> you look really tan</li>
            <li> and this really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my color.</li>
            <li> and I tan really well,</li>
            <li> And the price difference from these as opposed to Designer Skin lotions is just too much for me to ignore, so I stick with Millenium Tanning.  </li>
            <li> The results were fast.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t enhance tan much.  </li>
            <li> Have been passing it around at the family pool because everyone is very envious of my tan this year.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and it really did help darken me fast.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that much</li>
            <li> really like it</li>
            <li> much thanks</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t not stink and rubs in very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that does tans very often.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have not burned at all, even after I started off at 11 minutes, and my skin is moisturized very well after I lay in the tanning</li>
            <li> But i think you just test it out before you get the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well for me</li>
            <li> Again, the problem could have been that I didn&#x27;t get the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> Expected better results.</li>
            <li> I did intend on getting so much darker than I am</li>
            <li> it get you really dark,within 2 session</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done much for me when it comes to bronzing.</li>
            <li> Such a smooth formula.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Tanned with it 4 times and was very tan.</li>
            <li> then it probably isn&#x27;t real..  </li>
            <li> This product smells like Vanilla Ice Cream, or something very sugary vanilla that ants would like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really did not work...</li>
            <li> As another review said, I think it actually didn&#x27;t let the booth tan me, like it blocked the light.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> We might not be getting the real thing - or maybe it&#x27;s expired.</li>
            <li> The bronzers work really well in this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and works really well.</li>
            <li> I have been using since I purchased it and have not noticed much.</li>
            <li> so much cheaper than if you buy it at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It did work very well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because of the price.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> so I was starting off from scratch, no base tan or anything.</li>
            <li> My theroy of tanning beds are; the employees try to push tanning lotion on people, and I really don&#x27;t think that tanning lotion works.</li>
            <li> BUT MILLENNIUM REALLY OUGHT TO WORK ON THAT SCENT.</li>
            <li> This product does help with the color, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t have much of a smell when I applied it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light skinned, blue eyed blond hair</li>
            <li> I really feel darker than I have ever been.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t spend much money on this</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not going to complain to much.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and assumed because I tan fast</li>
            <li> However when using it I did not notice any real difference in my tan, not even immediately after tanning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a session, the silicone leaves  your skin very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they worked very well together.  </li>
            <li> Also I find putting it on a day before tanning and the day after really helps with results.</li>
            <li> I got the lotion fast.</li>
            <li> but my last purchase made me splotchy, and as you know those lotions aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned and tan</li>
            <li> the darkening factor I don&#x27;t notice much.</li>
            <li> I like this product although I don&#x27;t have much experience with tanning.  </li>
            <li> My husband has olive skin and it didn&#x27;t really help him tanning, but I like it.</li>
            <li> and I get fast results.</li>
            <li> And it does it fast too</li>
            <li> I can no longer afford to blow that much money on one bottle of lotion</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a fantastic tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> and I became very tan.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of difference in my tan.  </li>
            <li> There were two nights that I absolutely could not sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves the smell.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing to help tan my legs/arms</li>
            <li> I was really REALLY wanting it to work</li>
            <li> and I really tried to like it</li>
            <li> Who wants to spend&lt;br /&gt;$100 when you can spend $15?</li>
            <li> Just be careful, make sure to test it on yourself as recommended.</li>
            <li> My bottle was absolutely the real deal.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any bronzer residue on clothes or hands but really works.</li>
            <li> No tingle, not tooo much bronzer,</li>
            <li> This lotion is very comparable to a $8 lotion at Walmart.</li>
            <li> however, the one thing that i absolutely cannot stand about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> i absolutely cannot stand how i smell.</li>
            <li> is when I really started to appreciate the color it gave me.</li>
            <li> and it really help you to get color faster.</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> but this stuff worked really well</li>
            <li> I could really tell it helped me tan quicker.</li>
            <li> This lotion does work really well</li>
            <li> I will say that my skin takes very well to tanning...</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t put a whole bottle on yourself, it won&#x27;t be greasy.</li>
            <li> and it really work like a</li>
            <li> The only lotion that has given me faster results are lotions with tingle which I can&#x27;t use anymore because my skin has become more sensitive.</li>
            <li> This lotion should be used only after a nice base tan is gained if you want the best results.</li>
            <li> Male tanners (my gf borrowed it and liked it too, so female tanners too)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting on my 2nd bottle to arrive, I&#x27;ve gone to the tanning bed every spring to prepare for summer and this has been my favorite lotion by far and the cheapest.</li>
            <li> I will attempt to use the rest of this bottle to not waste, but I will for sure be going back to California Tan products!!!!!</li>
            <li> use a more natural face bronzer or just let it be slightly different colors and let it be..</li>
            <li> I have noticed a nice color after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that icky tanning bed smell.</li>
            <li> It keeps skin soft and right after you look very tan with a glow and the tan does stay.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try paint it black and even after the first couple times I tanned, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I instantly noticed that my skin was darker after tanning, but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li> I keep wanting to try new ones and this is always better (including Solid Black, which is supposed to be a better version of this).</li>
            <li> and wow they were right.</li>
            <li> so ridiculously soft right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this stuff works for other people, but try to get a sample packet before you buy a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> It gives me a good color &amp; I don&#x27;t get red, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make me stink after tanning like some other lotions do.</li>
            <li> My main problem with it is that the smell is very strong and is less than desirable and it seeps into everything (e.g. clothes).</li>
            <li> Love this stuff because EVERY OTHER tanning lotion on the market (and I&#x27;ve tried about a hundred) make me smell HORRID when I get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> From other users reviews of this product I thought it would have smelled better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes like most other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a while and just used it again today, and it reminded me of why I like other lotions better.</li>
            <li> Better results with this lotion than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t till the last week that I started using it and this Is Not the original Paint</li>
            <li> Most other lotions leave me itchy for days even after I shower</li>
            <li> For $15.00 I couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal and at first I was a little unsure about it, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t noticed that it works any better than any other lotion.</li>
            <li> Better stick to other well known brands.</li>
            <li> this product works pretty well, as far as i know!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t burned using it, unlike many other tanning lotions...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I would buy this product again because there is so many other products out there that I would like to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still to my other one, it gives me more color.</li>
            <li> I have compared it to other lotions, and this seems to work just as well or better.</li>
            <li> it goes on easily and smells good before tanning, but for some reason after the tanning bed I just smell AWFUL (reminiscent of cooked skin), but because of the great price I can bypass that factor.</li>
            <li> but you smell clean and presentable enough for work buddies to not notice.  </li>
            <li> Works decently think I&#x27;m ready for something stronger though</li>
            <li> This lotion gives a nice and quick base color as well as a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and live where its difficult to get any sun.  </li>
            <li> My only down point is the scent is not as good as others.</li>
            <li> I guess I will know for sure if it happens to be bad after a few more sessions, but I can already tell that it is great.  </li>
            <li> I guess I will know for sure if it happens to be bad after a few more sessions, but I can already tell that it is great.  </li>
            <li> Ive actually had this for quite a while but just recently started using it, I&#x27;m really light skinned and its made a huge difference for me as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I normally use Bombshell by Designer Skin, but was willing to try some new things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Australian Gold fan, but decided to give something new a try.</li>
            <li> and I waited six hours on the first time I used it to shower and eight hours the second time I used it to shower the color washes right off.</li>
            <li> Does what you need it to do, considerably cheaper here on Amazon then at your local tanning salon where it is 70.00 + easy...</li>
            <li> I ended up paying a whole lot more for Aphrodisiac at the salon because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of Paint it Black.</li>
            <li> it Black goes, I read the numerous positive reviews and decided to try it - and very glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I am still very new to tanning</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells &amp; how dark it makes me.</li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t really noticed my tan getting any darker than it normally would.  </li>
            <li> So far its one of my favorites and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I am pretty busy</li>
            <li> As far as color I believe that it helped me tan and not a fake color.</li>
            <li> I have recently begun tanning indoors and this lotions is the key to my beautiful dark tan.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on my tan, and I&#x27;ve never been that dark in my life.  </li>
            <li> Also the consistancy is more of a tan color and its the consistancy of an average lotion...</li>
            <li> I would say you may can get 15-20 full body uses out of one bottle, but don&#x27;t expect it to last all su mmer.  </li>
            <li> I tan pretty well, and most lotions usually help excelerate the process with me, but this one, not so much.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product 110% to anyone who is interested in getting a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Obviously for the price, this lotion is not as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> For me I get the same results or better, with non greasy skin for cheap with Paint it Black!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it and it seems good, just enough bronzer to make a little difference.</li>
            <li> This might just be my new go to lotion!</li>
            <li> I literally don&#x27;t think I could live without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to try a whole new routine where I&#x27;ll be using Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell 100x one day,</li>
            <li> I really try to get something new every time I need lotion.</li>
            <li> I was curious about this product and hoped for amazing results, but the lotion fell short of all expections.</li>
            <li> On Black 50X works well in the way of moisterizing and helping give a better tan.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to notice a difference after tanning with paint it black compared to others I have used</li>
            <li> Paint it Black is my FAVORITE lotion EVER.</li>
            <li> I feel that Paint it Black gives me somewhat of color and extends my tan somewhat, but I have used tanning lotions that give me a lot better results in all aspects.</li>
            <li> So the black bottle looks more for men.</li>
            <li> Black is my favorite bronzer without a doubt.</li>
            <li> it Black is up there in my top 5!!!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love Paint in Black.</li>
            <li> I will use it until it is gone, but will more than likely try something else next time.</li>
            <li> It has a decent bronzing quality to it as well.</li>
            <li> Decent product for the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion because 1-there were decent reviews, and 2-I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> As far as moisturizing, I don&#x27;t really know too much about that</li>
            <li> I actually bought this on eBay for about the same price, because I wasn&#x27;t able to use PayPal through Amazon for some reason.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to everyone that wants to get a golden tan.</li>
            <li> but I have never tanned this quick in only 4 sessions in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth and does not make you smell weird after.</li>
            <li> I got some good color after only using a few times</li>
            <li> I am not at all pleased with this &amp; would like to send it back &amp; get my money back!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super white and this makes me look as if I&#x27;ve been to the beach.</li>
            <li> The product works decently well..</li>
            <li> Smells decent.</li>
            <li> but I felt like I got decent color from it.  </li>
            <li> There are two options from the same company that made this  &#x27;above&#x27; this lotion (there may be more now)</li>
            <li> It really makes you darker &amp; leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> the results are amazing as well, i noticed a big difference after just the first few times using it.</li>
            <li> but at least it&#x27;s safe!</li>
            <li> It gives you a very natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using indoor tanning bronzer for a few years &amp; tried many different products with various results &amp; I do not believe that the product I received is anything more then a scented lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend washing your hands after application or you will get orange streaks in between your fingers.</li>
            <li> im 21 and have been tanning since i was in high school.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly and will probably re-up when I run out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any price-savvy tanner.</li>
            <li> Their tanning beds don&#x27;t have high power and adjustable levels</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I tan in a high pressure bed two times a week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is so highly rated.  </li>
            <li> Great smell, last a long time, and really gets my skin dark.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion, not only am I of Irish descent and is very faired skin but my skin is ver sensitive to products.</li>
            <li> I am interested in trying out the other products similar to this one!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scent is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Honestly it was not what I initially thought it was due to the name it gave.</li>
            <li> I have used other products from Millenium and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to purchase it because I&#x27;m pretty pale and don&#x27;t tan really easily.</li>
            <li> first time I saw major results.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for a little bit more boost with the \\&quot;50x\\&quot; bronzer.  </li>
            <li> spend a little more than this a look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Cost a little more but quess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Wish I could darken a little more with this product as I have with others.</li>
            <li> It has given me a little color, but I tan better without lotion.</li>
            <li> Smell was OK and was a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell, but is definately decent enough to handle!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly &amp; the bronzer doesn&#x27;t leave a orange coloring behind highly recommended &amp; came very fast &amp; sealed</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other lotions and is easy to evenly apply</li>
            <li> yet so I have not very many things to stack it up again besides the Swanky Girl Temptress Cafe that I&#x27;d used for years, but I paid 3x more for it</li>
            <li> I was excited when I read the positive reviews about how dark this lotion has made others...</li>
            <li> It is clear to me that the whole time it was this lotion, and I stopped using it immediately.</li>
            <li> Maybe this lotion works well but just make sure you buy it from a reputable dealer as I clearly got a fake product.</li>
            <li> Gives a great fake tan after you put it on.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the reviews and everyone saying how great it was, but I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked and very happy that I bought from AMAZON</li>
            <li> so much I think I&#x27;m going back first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I normally use Worship me by Designer Skin but I after reading the reviews on Paint</li>
            <li> I tried this on a lark since I had just run out of White2Black (my normal lotion).</li>
            <li> The tanning lotion I bought is normally 100 dollars in retail sale, but I got it for 13.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, and I have tanned in the past where I was going everyday almost and had tried many different lotions.</li>
            <li> Normally at the salon its about 50 per bottle</li>
            <li> &quot; Those are a few of my favorite.</li>
            <li> I will be buying a few more bottles soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure some people may like the smell or don&#x27;t mind that heavy texture of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I am definitely a lot more tanned and didnt take long to gain color.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price here on Amazon verses the price in the actual tanning salons.</li>
            <li> When I received this I was so excited to try it because it seemed like it would work really well based on the claims and other reviews I read.</li>
            <li> Its only  worth about $5.</li>
            <li> After the third session of tanning, my skin came out golden brown.</li>
            <li> When I received the product it had some of the lotion (which is a tan color) dried around the top of the bottle opening.</li>
            <li> Definitely can&#x27;t beat it for the price, and totally worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I have seen trial sized lotions at my tanning place go for $7.99 and why would anyone buy that when you can spend just a few more bucks and get this?</li>
            <li> with this Lotion it makes the most of my few moments&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Overall, worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> the rest of me are ProTan Dangerously Sexy and Australian Gold Funky Monkey.</li>
            <li> had to wash my hands a few more times for it to disappear.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have used several different tanning lotions and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s given me a great color which is hard for me to get, because I have fair-ish skin that prefers to burn &amp; takes a long time to build a tan!</li>
            <li> I am new to indoor tanning and wanted a lotion that had high remarks...</li>
            <li> Now, if it was sold as a long lasting moisturizer with a slight bronze glow that washes off at the end of the day, it&#x27;s a great 5 star</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice so far and while I didn&#x27;t notice any results after the end of the first day, after the second day of using this product, I am definitely and significantly darker than I was when I woke up this morning.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion because compared to other lotions i have tried it smells really good even after you have tanned wearing it, you don&#x27;t get that burnt fake tan smell.</li>
            <li> This product really helps getting a dark tan, and the smell is pleasant and not strong at all.</li>
            <li> (atleast in my experiences, if you put sunscreen on I&#x27;d give it a full hour to dry</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought this particular lotion from amazon, as I am a seasoned tanner and lotion junkie.    </li>
            <li> Decent product - I have paid a lot more for products in the past.</li>
            <li> initially smelling the lotion, it smells very fragrant and sweet - similar to vanilla.</li>
            <li> But I still went to a locally owned little tanning salon, and with this lotion I&#x27;m Loving the results.</li>
            <li> I actually think it smells a little like warm vanilla sugar from bath &amp; body works.  </li>
            <li> and then right before i got in the bed i put on the back in blaque and WOW talk about being tan!</li>
            <li> I am looking for a new lotion.</li>
            <li> (I was on a try new things kick) and they all just paled in comparason to this stuff.</li>
            <li> The salon owner suggested another product and within days of using the new product and was darker.  </li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> I live in Indiana, and I try to hit the tanning bed every day.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00147FGJ8 Millenium Tanning New Paint</li>
            <li> I needed some new lotion this year and picked this one based on reviews and of course price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived on time and in new condition.</li>
            <li> Opened it and it looked brand new.</li>
            <li> Think I will just order a new bottle of Hempology.</li>
            <li> NEW 2008 Paint</li>
            <li> so I knew it was new.</li>
            <li> So i will finsh the bottle try something new.</li>
            <li> I am a new tanner.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness Amazon makes trying new lotions so affordable.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it only if someone asked directly about &#x27;Paint it Black&#x27; or something super cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d spent a bit more money &amp; get a different product.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice scent and provides even subtle color.</li>
            <li> , just doesn&#x27;t go on as well or get me dark as quickly as this does, and this is way cheaper!</li>
            <li> Gets ya dark quick!</li>
            <li> My tan is a gorgeous dark brown, my husband calls me his dark brown</li>
            <li> My hunch is this stuff might be a little older than what you&#x27;d get in the salon, which is fine.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft not oily.</li>
            <li> The color is very natural and I didn&#x27;t have any streaking.</li>
            <li> have VERY sensitive skin also, and have had no reaction to this lotion</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very soft, even when you shower you can feel it coming off.</li>
            <li> Now this does not mean I was black or even bronze, but I was light tan which is still WAY darker than I had ever been before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its super soft, leaves your skin silky all day long.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re naturally medium or dark toned, this will probably work great for you as long as you&#x27;re not sensitive skinned!</li>
            <li> I on the other hand, do have sensitive fair skin (but I can tan without issue typically--</li>
            <li> dont shy away , it is an amazing tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> Tonight I went and used this product, wow!</li>
            <li> Gotta be the coolest looking lotion to pull out of your bag by far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy another bottle when I&#x27;m finished with my first bottle</li>
            <li> you can get the same exact product for A LOT cheaper on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I boughtt this lotion a week ago and used it for the first time last night in a level 2 bed for 9minites</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic the first time I used it and have continued to darken even further.  </li>
            <li> and i thought wow!</li>
            <li> After she used it the first time she wasnt red at all!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it makes me so dark.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not sure if we didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;real\\&quot; thing, but the bronzers did nothing.  </li>
            <li> The affects of the lotion will last for around 2 days; so it is safe to tan every other day.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty white now.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion and only went on the first level bed.</li>
            <li> The first lotion that  has actually been getting me tan!</li>
            <li> I use Johnson&#x27;s Baby sleeping lotion that gives me tan from the first day and costs 2$ at my local store.</li>
            <li> With the shirt off, im pretty white.</li>
            <li> Gives you an instant boost of color after your first tan.</li>
            <li> It made me tan in barely a few sessions! :)</li>
            <li> I noticed results after the first use with a ten minute session.</li>
            <li> I had similar results with other products that I was able to purchase at the Grocery Store.</li>
            <li> Overall I will go back to supre smoke even though its smaller its definetely my favorite.</li>
            <li> I first tried this a while back</li>
            <li> have purchased many tanning products in the past and this one&lt;</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be dismayed if at first it seems to wash off the next day in the shower</li>
            <li> your skin is not slick or greasy.</li>
            <li> Using this lotion in combination of a tanning bed I have got a good tan glow going on that I had trouble getting using other lotions.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much, I sit out in the sun for 15 minutes (i usually wait or workout after sitting in the sun, you don&#x27;t notice immediately a change in skin color but trust me you will begin to notice your skin turn from a pale to a nice golden COMPLETELY natural skin color.</li>
            <li> i am light skinned and usually have a hard time tanning, but i dont have any problems with tanning any more!</li>
            <li> Another nice thing about this is a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i was dark after the first 3 uses!!</li>
            <li> It was clearly brand new like it was stated because the packaging was unopened.</li>
            <li> And the products are always new and packaging is always professional.</li>
            <li> I have not really seen the dark and amazing results others have spoken of.</li>
            <li> I can use less of this product because it goes on so smoothly too.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is silky smooth and keeps me moisturized long after I&#x27;ve left the salon!</li>
            <li> It Black&#x27;s fantastic price and availability</li>
            <li> I tan fairly easily but had not been indoor tanning in a few years.</li>
            <li> I usually stay tanned but haven&#x27;t been able to go to the tanning bed because of my classes and busy schedule (college kid).</li>
            <li> Experience stunning dark tan color and ultra moisturization that last all day..</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different tanning lotions, and this hands down is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It really gets you hard VERY quickly</li>
            <li> Smells good, MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE than anything you can buy from a tanning salon, and my tan always looks natural and stays strong.  </li>
            <li> super dark, soft skin, unbeatable price!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it works well after you have reached your full tan effect, but it did nothing other than act as sun screen for me.</li>
            <li> Bella Black from this same company works great for me) and I broke out into hives and it leaves me a little orange tinted when I use it.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it because I&#x27;d rather go to the tanning bed less times (not a big fan</li>
            <li> but I prefer the Australian Gold Black better.</li>
            <li> Ive used Luminary, Bombshell, Phoenician, Obsidian, Black Noir, Rue La La and most recently Splurge.</li>
            <li> Well they both work the same, except the Black storm smells better</li>
            <li> will spend the extra $15 on Black20x which I have had better results with on previous occasions.</li>
            <li> She started tanning about two weeks prior to the wedding with not much result, as she doesn&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn easily, but I do turn red and pink after sun exposure instead of tan.</li>
            <li> (I already had a very nice tan that I have been working on in the beds for the past few months).  </li>
            <li> Paint it Black is a great all around lotion for a nice base tan..</li>
            <li> Non-tingle people may love it, but I&#x27;m used to being lobster red when I leave the salon, stinging for hours aferward, and having to blot myself dry after I finally shower it off</li>
            <li> My skin is so light I could glow in the dark, but this lotion has gotten me dark so quick, and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion, I have never gotten this dark before!!!</li>
            <li> Got a great deal on this lotion, but didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of color....and was a little thin.</li>
            <li> really recomend it if you want a dark tan fast!</li>
            <li> I thought this was supposed to be great tanning lotion, but have been pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I could clearly see a difference.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the color I got with this product.  </li>
            <li> When I called the number on the back for Milennium, they said it most likely is not real</li>
            <li> Also the lotion leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> If it is actually \\&quot;auto-tanning\\&quot; don&#x27;t see much in results.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and it helps me maintain my tan.</li>
            <li> As far as the product goes, however, I did not like this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Also, you will have soft, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> The only downside i see is that there doesnt seem to be any real bronzing or color adding agent.  </li>
            <li> And it completely neutralizes that after-tan smell.</li>
            <li> I bought a whole bottle because it was priced well and would be cheaper than buying individual packets of lotion at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> As far as Millenium Paint</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting ready to buy another from this same company.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> this product helped give me the natural tan without turning orange or feeling like my skin is about to burn off my body.</li>
            <li> and I am going to purchase my second bottle very soon.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li> i just got really busy with college and didn&#x27;t have the time.</li>
            <li> and wow I wish I could post a picture of the heart shape.</li>
            <li> all of a sudden it goes away within 2 days... very stange...</li>
            <li> it is digusting... smells like an old people home...  </li>
            <li> I picked my 16 year old  daughter up from school, and  she  said,</li>
            <li> Well come to find out the person I bought it from sent me a old one.  </li>
            <li> they sent a really old bottle.  </li>
            <li> So far, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Now I make a point of buying directly from Amazon</li>
            <li> The bronzer really does its job and the silicon additives are just an extra bonus!!!  </li>
            <li> After just 3 tans I noticed a considerable difference in my skin color.</li>
            <li> I went one time so far this year, used this lotion and just after one time, 10 minutes in a stand up, I have a tan.</li>
            <li> Helps give a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> My only dislike is which so much bronzer it</li>
            <li> This product worked fast and left me with a &amp;#34;deep tan&amp;#34</li>
            <li> (wow)   </li>
            <li> I read that someone used this outside and decided to try it because I don&#x27;t really care for tanning beds.</li>
            <li> I will also state that I do not use tanning beds, only the real sun..</li>
            <li> atleast if you&#x27;re using it outside, can&#x27;t really state results of tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and silky, not sticky like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and they fixed the problem promptly</li>
            <li> Very Well so that&#x27;s definitely not the problem.</li>
            <li> Also, the tan that I have gotten from it is natural looking.</li>
            <li> The silicone leaves my skin feeling soft all day.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Felts as though it was advertised as SUNLESS tanning lotion, but really it&#x27;s Tanning bed or outside</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My tanning salon offers this lotion for $50.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be surprised if people start singing the Commodores&#x27; old song &amp;#34;Brick House&amp;#34; when you walk by them...</li>
            <li> give it four stars because it also leaves my skin extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It went on smoother than any of the others I have used and leaves me so soft.</li>
            <li> I have to say it meet my expectations and went far beyond.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is just a really old bottle, or someone had tampered with it or used it?</li>
            <li> much cheaper than buying it at the local store and</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the lotion</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great color results, Natural looking tan, not oompa-loompa.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow I ran out of a 45 dollar bottle I dont have on hand that I got from my Tanning spot.</li>
            <li> After initial burn, tan develops very well indeed.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> feels soft on my skin</li>
            <li> Works very well for an inexpensive lotion, only downside it</li>
            <li> but so far I like this stuff</li>
            <li> Does not do well as far as a bronzer go.</li>
            <li> It has gotten me considerably darker since I started using it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s making me darken up - and the tan looks natural</li>
            <li> The combo works wonders for those with sensitive skin, as you&#x27;re not &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to use body tanners on your face.</li>
            <li> I got this tanning lotion for my mother and so far it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;Ide</li>
            <li> This product causes my naturally tan skin to shimmer</li>
            <li> I used this lotion twice so far</li>
            <li> While I was tanning, I noticed that my skin was extremely soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bronzers off and on for years now, and once my tan is built up, it&#x27;s a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> We both had been tanning for a few days before we received it and after the first time we used it we were soo much darker!  </li>
            <li> I have used this for about 3 times and I, the woman whose legs have always been see thru white are finally looking a golden tan color.</li>
            <li> Received my shipment two days after I ordered from Amazon (Not Green Web, I saw many negative reviews).</li>
            <li> This product does what it says and the color you receive is a good tan color, not orangey or fake looking.</li>
            <li> After two 8 minute sessions in a level 2 bed, I have an awesome tan, not just a base either.</li>
            <li> Auto-Darkening Dark Tanning Lotion - 13.5oz]]This product is not bad</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they were working as expected and felt kind of pale</li>
            <li> Fortunately the bottle is black and has a skull on it, so I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed carrying it around either!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten much better results from other lotions, looks like I&#x27;ll be switching back to my old Australian Gold XOXO Kisses.</li>
            <li> It has a good smell but not sure if it makes me as black as it says it should.....</li>
            <li> The tan is also even and smooth, not blotchy, and the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave behind an orange tint like so many other tanning products.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, so I&#x27;m not really the right person to be giving this review.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m fairly light skinned, but this lotion didn&#x27;t do much extra compared to other lotions I have used.  </li>
            <li> I was scared it was gonna make me orange or super dark.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the tanning salons tell you that lotions sold online are fake, they are just trying to protect their main source of profit - if you buy from a reputable online store then you will get the real deal</li>
            <li> If you need to get dark quick, this is for you.</li>
            <li> With this, I am SUPER dark.</li>
            <li> I have not ever got this dark so quickly before.</li>
            <li> I tanned for almost a month with a different tanning lotion &amp; it seemed like I could not get any further on my tan (which I hadn&#x27;t got far on in the first place)</li>
            <li> so I am by far not dark</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product, I was skeptical because some reviews indicated that it left an orange tint to skin, and that it wasn&#x27;t effective in accelerating darkening in a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you want a natural, deep tan without a lot of work!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and is very subtle.</li>
            <li> I will most likely get the black bottle of hempz tanning lotion next.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this from Amazon consistently for probably the last 3 years because it is SO inexpensive and it is in a big bottle for indoor tan lotion.</li>
            <li> smells decent too, not gross tanning aftersmell like others.</li>
            <li> And the tan is fantastic natural and the price is unbelievable inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different tanning lotions in the past and this one has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when the lotion arrived two days earlier than I had expected!</li>
            <li> I am of asian decent</li>
            <li> Im pretty sure this is a fake.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something much stronger in the Millenium Tanning line, then you can check out Pure Black.  </li>
            <li> I was very pale when I first used the lotion &amp; have gotten MUCH darker than I would&#x27;ve normally with another lotion.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly and I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you need basic lotion for the tanning bed!</li>
            <li> so I decided to give it a shot, because of the low price and high reviews.</li>
            <li> Major plus for me!</li>
            <li> Spent awhile researching different lotions looking for one that would give quick results but that did not have any tingle.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it is a genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its so cheap and works just as well, if not better, then the stuff they sell in the salons.</li>
            <li> I felt like I barely got any darker, except for the natural tanning process.  </li>
            <li> I tried this out in a sample at a local tanning salon because I forgot my normal lotion.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website</li>
            <li> I will never go back to normal tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> i would get more dark and did&#x27;nt from some other lotions</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lotion, only down fall is the Orange stain that gets left in between your fingers, if you get the chance before you tan definitely wash your hands....</li>
            <li> I should have spent a little more and got a lotion that I knew would work.</li>
            <li> Just expected a little more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> and I recently started trying new ones.</li>
            <li> I live in Michigan and only tan for 1 month between April and May.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy new lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to tanning, only having been about five times before this summer.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this late morning Tuesday (2/5/13) - and received it very quickly (today, Friday 2/8/13, in the morning).  </li>
            <li> The origainal price of $95 is miss leading, there is no way this product would be worth half of that.  </li>
            <li> This one makes my skin soft, not dry.</li>
            <li> It definitely has made me much darker in just a short time using it.</li>
            <li> so my arms and legs tan at the same rate as the rest of my body, otherwise my torso becomes much darker than the rest of me (my legs, especially!).</li>
            <li> the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it really doesn&#x27;t have the instant self tanners like it says.</li>
            <li> It took a few times to see any mild change.</li>
            <li> but it goes quick for heavy tanners.</li>
            <li> Nice product actual value approximately $20.</li>
            <li> Tried this after reading all the great reviews and after about six tanning sessions I have to say that it does not in any way enhance my tan (over and above normal outcome of a session without any lotion), it smells bad</li>
            <li> never turning back to my old one!</li>
            <li> But, the first time I used it, I had to use about twice as much as other lotions.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I love this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> Enjoy product, I don&#x27;t get as dark as I thought I would but love the tone that it provides, does not look fake or make you look orange as some do.</li>
            <li> Left my skin remarkably soft!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month now and haven&#x27;t seen major results yet.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was using Black Diamond which is ok, tried the Bombshell and was fairly dark after just one use, but I&#x27;m just not seeing the hyped up results with the Paint</li>
            <li> I generally go to the tanning bed all year round and had stopped using any tan lotions at all because I found that I get just as dark without them, and it looks much more natural.</li>
            <li> There is a slight bronzing effect but it rubbed off somewhat during the day/when I went to bed and of course it all washes right off the moment you take a shower.</li>
            <li> As long as your body is cool (not hot, sweaty, etc)</li>
            <li> It was cheap enough so can&#x27;t complain about that, but for giving a deep tan that&#x27;s not true</li>
            <li> While I have gotten a little darker, The reviews I read implied that I would be a golden goddess in no time.  </li>
            <li> The paint it black 50x has more of a manly scent, the Black Storm 60X&lt;</li>
            <li> Ok, seriously, &#x27;it doesn&#x27;t last&#x27; because its a bronzer!!</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks, and what I noticed was that when I first left the salon I would have a really dark and rich color,</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting tan since I have light skin but by the end</li>
            <li> and I have to shower right after whereas other lotions I&#x27;ve tried it smells the same as when it went on</li>
            <li> Very blendable and goes a long way while moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> (they apparently didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin color until I started using this product.)I</li>
            <li> As far as the lotion I have only used it once</li>
            <li> This gave me the natural deep tan</li>
            <li> but I apparently misunderstood its function.</li>
            <li> Apparently you must be a tanning bed user to benefit from it in terms of color.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> and thought I was pretty dark.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the lotion would occasionally give me hives.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and not dryed out.</li>
            <li> Its a deep natural bronze.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t believe people when they say that there was absolutely no post-tanning bed scent thanks to the lotion.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s value far exceeds its price, I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It does help get me dark pretty quickly,even in level 1 and level 2 beds.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and received it fast.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does make your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Your skin will definitely look darker, but the color doesn&#x27;t look natural on me.</li>
            <li> it made me sooo dark on my first tanning bed visit you wouldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> And as far as the smell, I know everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but all I smell is Vanilla after tanning.  </li>
            <li> I have used nearly 100 different lotions in my time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a glutton for punishment, apparently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tanned with this lotion once so far</li>
            <li> I have never gotten this dark this fast!</li>
            <li> This was my first tanning lotion, so maybe I wasn&#x27;t putting enough on or I wasn&#x27;t staying in the tanning booth long enough.</li>
            <li> I went tanning for three months with this crud and barely noticed a thing.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far in an indoor stand-up tanning bed (for just 10 minutes)</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick but smooths over your skin VERY well and really leaves your skin feeling sooo soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy into heavy music, so the packaging naturally attracted me at first.</li>
            <li> tanning\\&quot; smell, but it has its own weird musty smell.  </li>
            <li> I had to use it a few times to get the results I wanted, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> It has a worse after scent, but not horrible.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tan as nicely as the expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell its not a bad product.</li>
            <li> This was the first lotion I used when I started tanning (partly to help with skin issues, the other part vanity!).</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for a new indoor tanning lotion, so I tend to buy several different brands per year.</li>
            <li> Then, for the next two days, I really had a problem with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I complained to the salon consultant about their beds not being strong enough, and requested to try another bed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, any color you THINK you got washes right down the drain with the BRINZER, which is only body makeup.</li>
            <li> Left me very soft all over even my legs which were kinda scaley and gross.</li>
            <li> I personally use Crystal Faces by Australian Gold and my face is a bit lighter but its very natural in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not smell like \\&quot;clean cotton blossom\\&quot;  more like a vanilla fig or something like that which isn&#x27;t bad putting on, but I do smell like that gross sweaty burnt smell when I&#x27;m done tanning.</li>
            <li> I tan almost every spring and summer, and this is my first time using Paint it Black.  </li>
            <li> I noticed I looked darker the first session I used Paint it Black.</li>
            <li> The reason i say kept is because i started out tanning with the JWOWW Black Bronzer lotion for about 2 months(it didn&#x27;t get me darker or lighter...stayed consistent).</li>
            <li> Black, you can get their Black Storm for the same price through Amazon, and that is supposed to have slightly more bronzers.  </li>
            <li> first then move up to the 60x Black storm bronzer.</li>
            <li> It Black for the first time tonight</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty typical of a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> At first smell, the lotion smelled like a typical tanning salon smell.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me which is more than I can say about the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I pay $27 for 30 days of tanning, so I mainly use that and these lotions, and I recently had to go to the doctor&#x27;s for something, and the nurse actually asked me if I&#x27;m mixed</li>
            <li> the only con really is if you use too much you can definitely tell; the lotion gives your skin a heavy, greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet, but I have heard that it works very well (from other reviews).</li>
            <li> Other reviews claim to have not received the real deal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d imagine this would really work extremely well for</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, everyone is shocked at how quickly I&#x27;m tanning, countless people said that if I didn&#x27;t go to a name brand tanning salon (Sun Tan City)</li>
            <li> The outside of the bottle was masculine enough for me as well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not dry and itchy after tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read through the poor reviews and it seems most people only know about dha.   </li>
            <li> Skin does not dry out.</li>
            <li> Only reason for 4 stars is I am not extremely fond of the smell.  </li>
            <li> and it helps you get pretty dark as well!</li>
            <li> In only 2 tanning sessions, I see a MAJOR improvement in darkness of color and condition of skin.</li>
            <li> I am pretty white normally, tanning usually takes me several sessions to work my way up</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion as a replacement to my Black Orchid by Supre when I was first starting to tan.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel much softer or smoother, and my skin was definetly not that dark.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but it didn&#x27;t really make me that dark.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t spend too much on this, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Gets you dark fast...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried this will make you too dark too fast, don&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> Make you dark very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used other lotions before that seem to really give you that extra level of darkness this does not seem to do that.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one that actually left burn scars on any part of my body that directly touched the tanning bed (heels of my feet especially).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m at least a full shade darker.  </li>
            <li> but although i&#x27;m already pretty tanned, i still burned and after few times.</li>
            <li> The lotion isn&#x27;t heavy; but it is a tad greasy when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> I have been using tanning products for a few years now and always bought at the salon, this was the first time I&#x27;d bought one off the internet</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first few weeks after receiving.</li>
            <li> its not bad just not really amazing like all the hipe</li>
            <li> The price is $27.99 atm, but Pure Black is supposed to be 100x as opposed to 50x or 60x bronzers.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d say these lotions really make the difference when it comes down to it.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is the smell, it&#x27;s not a typical tanning lotion smell (coconuty) bit has more of a heavy, chocolate scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty pale for a while.</li>
            <li> Most of these reviews are fake, like every other review on amazon /: But this stuff is just like every other tanning lotion that comes in a cool hip bottle.</li>
            <li> The Auto-Darkening Tan Technology delivers extreme dark bronze tanning results through it&#x27;s super luxurious silicone emulsion blend.</li>
            <li> I usually tan right thru sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert, but i have used other lotions that don&#x27;t smell bad or smell good!  </li>
            <li> not super intense, nor is it fruity or florally.</li>
            <li> I have used paint it black for 2 days now, and already i am much darker than i was (without using a lotion).</li>
            <li> Got me a dark tan much quicker than using regular lotion alone.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is defective, not the real item or maybe just old</li>
            <li> It worked very well to achieve a deep dark tan</li>
            <li> The stuff is working only for a few first sessions.</li>
            <li> Only use this when you have a really good base tan because it does have a high power bronzer.</li>
            <li> If you are having a hard time achieving a tan, or would like to tan quickly for a low price...</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, didn&#x27;t get real dark, although I never do.</li>
            <li> but the tan is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> This product is low quality to say the least, it doesn&#x27;t absorb in your skin quickly and leaves you sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li> After five sessions in a tanning booth using this product with little to no results, I decided to only put the lotion on certain parts of my body and the rest of my body was lotionless.  </li>
            <li> I am someone with an olive skin tone that tans easily, I also have tried many tanning lotions and this one by far has been the worst.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical when I bought it,the tanning bed girl said everyone complained about its smell after you lay in the bed,but I found no offensive smell in fact it was extremely pleasant my skin was silky soft...</li>
            <li> 50X bronzers seems a little much to believe, there is no self tint added to your skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on before I mow the lawn and after the hard work I get to see a freshly mowed lawn and a tan.</li>
            <li> I saw very little results after first use and my sisters tan who has almost finished</li>
            <li> Other than that, the lotion leaves my skin very soft and after I shower.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad goes on good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money you can buy fake tan for cheaper and it look a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not good either.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s false advertising, and the poeple who marketed it were trying to rip us off, and my God have mercy on their souls!:)</li>
            <li> So, I did my research and came across the Millenium Paint it Black as a highly rated tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Some lotions I see at least an accelerated color right after tanning but with this lotion</li>
            <li> I always end up showering after leaving the tanning salon (which means a less developed tan) or smelling really odd throughout the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wet the towel first, squirt a little bit of tanning lotion on the towel, then scrub my back with it.  </li>
            <li> As for it tanning enhancers I didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic increase of color, pretty much normal rate.</li>
            <li> Another said it had a subtle fresh scent, and afterwards, didnt experience that \\&quot;after-tan smell\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This made my tan last much longer than usual and enriched my tan.</li>
            <li> I am actually liking it as much if not better than jwow.</li>
            <li> Haved used this kind of lotion for the past year or two and now am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> The lotion left my skin very soft, and the after tan smell did not last as long as what I noticed from previous lotions i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying, I am only in my second week of tanning and prior to purchasing this lotion, have never used a single tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but can already notice a slight difference..</li>
            <li> Not sunburned, not orange, but an odd dark reddish/black that looks exactly like the color</li>
            <li> It Black for only two sessions so far in \\&quot;10min beds\\</li>
            <li> I had a natural but dark tan.</li>
            <li> It might have worked if I could get past the smell, but I let my sister have it haha</li>
            <li> This past year I have improved so much because of this lotion specifically.</li>
            <li> and I usually tan very well without lotion at all.</li>
            <li> This also does not last long at all in terms of color, and I think the immediate tan look</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would say also that this product doesn&#x27;t last maybe as long as you would wish it would..</li>
            <li> For my back, I use my long scrubbing towel I use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> but it wears off in a few days, maybe that is just normal.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for two reasons, it had tons of good reviews and the price was reasonable enough that even if it was awful, I wouldn&#x27;t feel ripped off.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I am a new tanning salon user, so my opinion is perhaps a little slanted.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the fine print well enough, but I purchased this product under the impression that it in itself would give me a fake tan.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when a customer in another review mentioned that this lotion smells like Bath and Body Works&#x27; \\&quot;Warm Vanilla Sugar\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The other major plus to Paint it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a fairly new tanner, and had finally developed a solid base tan using a light tingler that was recommended to me by one of the workers at the salon.</li>
            <li> I recieved the product very quickly and I thank the seller for that, however, I was not happy with the product at all!  </li>
            <li> Overall, though, I&#x27;d say the Paint it Black and Black Storm work very well.  </li>
            <li> I started using this lotion on day one and could NOT get a good base tan after two weeks of tanning almost daily.  </li>
            <li> only (and minimal) complaints are that it leaves me slightly greasy in the unmentionable areas, which is nothing a quick shower cant fix, and that it doesnt seem to get me as dark as other reviewers said it could.</li>
            <li> It gives me a dark tan and it&#x27;s not ridiculously overpriced like some of the other tanning lotions around.</li>
            <li> Im naturally pasty but built my base tan already with some generic stuff from walmart that actually worked better than this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s marketed as if it will singe your skin off, but really, the Black Diamond was WAAAAY more painful.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a deep, dark tan in less time than it would normally take, then THIS is your product.  </li>
            <li> The only probably was that after using it for multiple tanning sessions it did about as much as my other tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> i have a feeling that this lotion may be a little old since  the bronzer didn&#x27;t stain my hands.</li>
            <li> Wow, afterwards I immediately noticed a little color.</li>
            <li> Good thing I spent less than $20 on this product or I would be mad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I used it once and smelled so bad after getting out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> kind of has a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> Usually, I have to wet my hands twice to cover my whole body.  </li>
            <li> I could tell it was fake or just cheap by the smell and</li>
            <li> Was looking for a lotion that would take me to the next level with a deep dark tan.  </li>
            <li> it will get you darker...but only maybe as dark as you would get in 6 sessions outside over the span of 4.  </li>
            <li> I signed up for a tanning membership to get ready for summer this year and was having trouble getting dark without defeating the purpose and laying in the sun all day long.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about getting this product because it had been so long since i had</li>
            <li> but it has a strange texture if you&#x27;re used to smoother lotions.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how long I always go</li>
            <li> I would say it only enhanced a minimal amount.</li>
            <li> I spent $70 on a lotion in the salon and got the same results.</li>
            <li> It does not take long to get there either.  </li>
            <li> Both times, I spent about 2 hours outside by the pool.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those people who turn beet red in the sun, then you might want to be careful using this product or just use it</li>
            <li> I cannot wear my clothes until 10 minutes later because i feel like my skin is not absorbing it at all.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected, I just wish it contained a tiny bit of spf to ensure I don&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> As far a tanning effect actuality none at all after a few tans...</li>
            <li> And it did NOT look like that had just happened through shipping, it looked like it had been there for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for a LONG time...</li>
            <li> I stopped going to the tanning bed for a few months and lost nearly all of my tan.</li>
            <li> It saved me a lot of money in the long run.  </li>
            <li> One thing that is cool is i personally find the smell to be unisex (as in it wouldnt be weird to smell like this product being a guy or girl).</li>
            <li> and I do not use nearly as much as I had to with the JWoww because it is not so thick</li>
            <li> Good for a beginner to get a base color.</li>
            <li> I already had a good base tan, but had reached a plateau and wasn&#x27;t getting any darker, that&#x27;s what made me want to buy this</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s definitely good to start out for a base tan.</li>
            <li> and I was bale to get a good base tan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 1/4 Irish, 1/4 English, and 1/2 Russian Jew, so I have a pale to olive complexion</li>
            <li> it gets you pretty dark after only a few times using it, but of course it all depends on the tanning bed or stand up you use as well, not just the lotion!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, using this has got me the darkest i have ever been, not a single bad thing i can say about this tanning oil!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - so much less expensive than at the Salon.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m considering of buying Black Storm as a next step and trying it out, but the bottle kinda makes me back off.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle several months ago and used it probably 8 times before just throwing it away (half a bottle left)</li>
            <li> it Black the day it came in the mail and after only using it a week my arms have fully caught up with the rest of my body and are actually getting darker!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m go back to Hardcore Black 30X by Australian Gold.</li>
            <li> I didnt expect this product to tan my skin so quickly because of its relatively inexpensive price, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t sealed so anyone could have opened it and put plain old lotion in there</li>
            <li> So right off the bat, I knew that I would not fly through this product as it seemed with the JWoww.  </li>
            <li> Although it does not take long to dry out the effect of the lotion is virtually nil, because no tans.</li>
            <li> I only got a slight difference in my tan from the session, it was much less than with a 2 year old bottle of Hempology by California tan.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how much darker it will make me versus other lotions.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m giving 4 starts instead of 5 is because the bottle is kinda hard to squeeze after 3-4 uses and especially towards the end, which makes the whole bottle a bit messy and slippery.</li>
            <li> I alternate every other day between the two.</li>
            <li> I have always burned before I tan, due to the red hair and freckles.</li>
            <li> there are other products within $20.00- $30.00 that actually work.  </li>
            <li> 60X Extreme Silicone Bronzer I was using and wanted to try something similar in style and price point.</li>
            <li> I cannot sun bathe anymore nor can I use a tanning booth due to medical procedures.</li>
            <li> This lotion turns you brown almost immediately but because it has a bronzer the deep tan doesn&#x27;t last long unless you go to the tanning bed everyday.</li>
            <li> he has tried other products but all ways come back to this one.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s open a little later.</li>
            <li> Tried 3 other ones and went back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I could definitely tell that my color stayed longer and was darker than when I have gone without tabbing lotion or with other products.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere recently that switching lotions daily actually gives you a broader spectrum of coverage in tanning, and I&#x27;m hoping that the Bombshell 100x (which is a slight tingler,) will break my tanning plateau, and allow me to get REALLY dark.  </li>
            <li> I have rather fair skin, and though I can&#x27;t speak for people with other skin tones, this product gives my particular skin type a truly tanned appearance, without any redness or fake, unrealistic hue that has sometimes occurred using other products.  </li>
            <li> where your skin just feels thirsty and dry.</li>
            <li> Feels dry to the touch, not greasy.</li>
            <li> (maybe for dry skin?)</li>
            <li> No difference noticed compared to a generic Walmart brand that is readily available and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Takes for ever to dry and did not increase my tan at all.</li>
            <li> It does have an orange fruity smell, however, does dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you want to get a dark tan fast, or deepen your tan past your tanning plateau.</li>
            <li> Not only do you get really dark but the tan lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> provides a decent base color, but does not last for more than a few days</li>
            <li> i actually had a nice base tan when i started using it...</li>
            <li> Did not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I have bought lotions for way too much money in the past and this product is a LOT less</li>
            <li> In the coming months I plan to purchase a couple other Millenium tanning lotions here on Amazon, and POSSIBLY also JWOWW&#x27;s lotion, which is half the price on Amazon than my local salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go every single day but still my results are not anything above average if that.</li>
            <li> My tanning salon closes early, but I was so anxious to try it, I payed for a single session at a salon</li>
            <li> Black\\&quot; did not provide even average tanning, especially for a product that has the name it does.</li>
            <li> It gives you a deep dark tan.</li>
            <li> I was by no means dark, but definitely had distinguishable tan lines.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a tanning bed for 5 years and never have I gotten such a dark tan.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does seem to have a TINY orange tint to it, but not enough that anyone will notice.</li>
            <li> I burn moderately and tan average.</li>
            <li> i used the product on half my body, left the other half naked and tanned several times:  </li>
            <li> Every time I try something else I&#x27;m let down and end up coming back to this.</li>
            <li> After being down the shore about 4 days my son and fianc√© have both went from cottage cheese white to BROWN....</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft, however I cannot hardly stand the smell of it.</li>
            <li> The fact that its black with skulls only helps!</li>
            <li> The only small downside maybe the smell, but that&#x27;s only after you tan</li>
            <li> I recently decided to step my tanning up a notch and went for Paint it Black.</li>
            <li> it Black 4 times and actually saw my tan get lighter.</li>
            <li> the next, and Millenium Tanning&#x27;s Black Night</li>
            <li> it black on about 15 minutes prior to tanning</li>
            <li> Everything from OC Ten X to Black 20XXX, including all those cheapy lotions in Sallys Beauty Supplies.</li>
            <li> And I was beyond perturbed when I saw the same JWoww lotion on here for $20.00 and sometimes less.  </li>
            <li> This was better than some of the expensive lotions I had purchased in that past.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve had BLACK, you will never go back !!!</li>
            <li> (and I am very pale skinned naturally.</li>
            <li> And I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> However the firt time i used it i burned a little bit but it only lasted a day</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this lotion it worked wonders, but the second time I got a extremely itchy rash all over my body it must have been fake.</li>
            <li> but i used this a few times and it helped tone my skin and get it a little darker it made me look natural</li>
            <li> After two I am close to my old Florida tan and that was dark!!!</li>
            <li> I will never be &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; but at least I am not pale.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused by all of the positive reviews of this lotion, because I unfortunately did not see much of a difference when I used it, whereas other lotions like Legs make a big difference.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as most others I have tried</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s not something I would want others to be able to smell on me.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I had been using a (not so great lotion with a nasty after tanning smell) and wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted.  </li>
            <li> My tan is dark and everyone started noticing how dark I was getting only after two visits to the tanning salon</li>
            <li> It gets you a dark tan, however may stain your hands.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is not worth buying a second time around</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t tan as I expected it to</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I expected considering it is a silicone lotion.  </li>
            <li> but I will pay the extra few bucks and continue to use Supre bronze no.9.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is not really desirable, and I like the smell of vanilla.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning off and on the last few years.</li>
            <li> and I got absolutely no response.    </li>
            <li> so not much lost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always spent 50-70 dollars on tanning lotions</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> I like to pack wet wipes in my tanning bag and wipe my hands after I apply the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of vanilla</li>
            <li> My product was just as I was told and the shipping was just as expected.</li>
            <li> better.(the bronzer is not very noticable).</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no tanning in this product.  </li>
            <li> I have now used it four times and absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably give this product 5 stars because it was as I expected...</li>
            <li> and I have some color no thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with clothing as it will stain.  </li>
            <li> indoors and after a few sessions you can totally tell you have color!</li>
            <li> The key is to go everyday...</li>
            <li> careful not to over it</li>
            <li> It arrived within one week and was the product I expected.</li>
            <li> It has this weird \\&quot;freshly mowed</li>
            <li> There was no real seal.</li>
            <li> I was so curious</li>
            <li> But there was definitely some dried residue around the bottle and the inside of the cap.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> The last few years, I decided to save my tanning bed money</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after using It only a few times.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> i am not very tan</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times</li>
            <li> Order was received way before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks, and I already have a nice base tan.</li>
            <li> I have a good base tan and it still turned be a few noticeable shades darker in just one session.</li>
            <li> Which, by that time, I had already built a nice base tan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have paper white skin, but I would consider myself on the pale side.  </li>
            <li> Believe me when I say,I was pale white before the summer began.</li>
            <li> all summer bc of my pale white legs!</li>
            <li> My sister in-law was in a wedding, and was worried about looking pale in her strapless, short dress.</li>
            <li> (I started out about as pale as you can get), enough that I notice a difference everytime</li>
            <li> But on a serious note, I have fair skin aka burns within minutes of being outside, so I always get a base tan before summer</li>
            <li> I have developed a nice, subtle base tan with no burning.</li>
            <li> I USE IT &amp; THE SOLID BLACK &amp; BLACK &amp; TAN ALL BY MILLENIUM TANNING.  </li>
            <li> Im so disappointed ive wasted 3 weeks and however many dollars later for nothing.</li>
            <li> have only used this dark tanning lotion a few times but worked well when i did.</li>
            <li> I am a regular tanning customer and I normally buy the expensive tanning cream.  </li>
            <li> I have never really been an avid user of expensive indoor tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> finally getting the dark tan i was looking for!!</li>
            <li> I tan approximately 1-2 times a week in a high intesity bed.  </li>
            <li> I usually use just plain old Banana Boat or Hawaiian Tropic oils.</li>
            <li> I got very little tanning though and even that did not last.</li>
            <li> Black.&lt;br /&gt;After a few times using Solid Black, I got streaky and orangey.</li>
            <li> Other than that it does the trick, I&#x27;ve been using paint</li>
            <li> It is an extremely distinctive smell and it is so pungent that others will smell it.</li>
            <li> I put it on one arm and not the other to see the difference..  </li>
            <li> Other then that I recommend it.</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> but with this product i will once every other day or even once every two days.</li>
            <li> AND ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS SAY IT WASHES AWAY IN THE SHOWER...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my other lotions.</li>
            <li> and it was due to this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I admit after buying this and using it for two weeks I tried other lotions I had never used before</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to go everyday for a long time to see results either.</li>
            <li> I am also Irish with freckles and usually burn.  </li>
            <li> Other lotions will turn you orange, but this one does not.</li>
            <li> had to tan every other day to get it to stick</li>
            <li> I am a tanaholic to the extreme.</li>
            <li> Maybe mine was a faulty product, but it smells just like described in other reviews.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and it does the job done .MILLENINUM</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to tan every day instead of like every other day.</li>
            <li> and this did not irritate my skin like other lotions</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn me like the other lotions with bronzers do</li>
            <li> I used this on one leg, and nothing on the other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use any other tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d have streaks like some other lotions.</li>
            <li> I have a couple other indoor tanning lotions and this one did not even come close to the others I have been using.  </li>
            <li> BUT i have to go tanning every other day to maintain my tan.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well.</li>
            <li> However, if it wasn&#x27;t rubbed in extremely well it would turn elbows and knees orange.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell and turned me some-what orange within the first use.  </li>
            <li> I have almost used the whole bottle, (only because I don&#x27;t like to waste anything) and my tanning results are not impressive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other people are smelling</li>
            <li> Everyone compliments me on my color, I also work out in the yard a lot &amp; after reading these other reviews am going to use it while doing that as well.</li>
            <li> With other lotions and without, I can stand the after-tan smell.</li>
            <li> i tanned 2-3 times before this product, (every other day i tan).</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as greasy as other lotions I have tried either.</li>
            <li> My color has also seemed to last longer then usual.</li>
            <li> I have found this lotion allows me to tan quicker than any other ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> This would have taken me a lot longer with other lotions.</li>
            <li> Other than Erythrulose, but that&#x27;s another story.</li>
            <li> I was using extreme tingle lotions that made my skin feel like it was burning -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times now, so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I put this product on one leg and baby oil on the other.</li>
            <li> The baby oiled leg was darker than the other one.</li>
            <li> It still carries the &#x27;tanning&#x27; smell, unlike other reviews noted that it did not.</li>
            <li> if one website says its in stock and the other no.</li>
            <li> I have always used designer skin in the past and am going back to their products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I haven&#x27;t tried other products online</li>
            <li> I actually prefer my Pauly D that I usually use</li>
            <li> I did however notice that I had some streakiness along the sides of my hands, but that was due to washing my hands immediately after tanning.</li>
            <li> (this has not happened to me with other products).</li>
            <li> Unless you put the lotion on one leg and not the other to test the results...then you can&#x27;t say \\</li>
            <li> works well for me and the other two people</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. :)</li>
            <li> My wife on the other hand appears to have had an allergic reaction to something in it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say I buy it every other time.</li>
            <li> I got darker after 2 sessions with this than 5 sessions with my other tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> not exactly what you think when it says bronzer....</li>
            <li> I would recommend washing your hands after application as it may stain, due to the bronzing agent in the lotion.</li>
            <li> , it takes me forever to build up a tan, so extreme bronzes are my friend, because I tan at the minimum times about every other day.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a strong smell but it&#x27;s manageable and not to bad.</li>
            <li> And it was half empty</li>
            <li> I was using it everyday religiously for a few weeks, &amp; in the shower</li>
            <li> I got dark in a few sessions and it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I am very very pale and recently started using a tanning bed about two months ago.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any extreme dark tan with this product.</li>
            <li> and I got dark with other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually thought I would try another lotion this year, in stead of my usual (paint it black)</li>
            <li> When I purchased the bottle, the lotion seemed to be quite thin, and although it smelled the same as previous bottles I have used, I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder if they had put something in it to make it go further.</li>
            <li> well..besides it feeling good on my skin due to the silicone..smells horrible</li>
            <li> Something in this product is not right</li>
            <li> absolutely love the subtle scent, and it is a tanning silicone based lotion that doesnt leave you feeling slimy and dirty after tanning.</li>
            <li> I had used some other tan accelerators to get my tan going, but after a month and a half I began using this.</li>
            <li> I am a male and have a hard time justifying $15 on some lotion that isn&#x27;t guaranteed to do anything for you at all.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m usually in a level 3), but noticed I was definitely a little darker immediately after only one use.</li>
            <li> However it sometimes gets hard to tell if youre tan from the lotion or actually getting tanner sometimes since it does add quite a bit of color...</li>
            <li> Seems to get you dark in half the time of other products.</li>
            <li> This is advertised as a silicone based tanning lotion, mine was very watery and had a weird tint.</li>
            <li> It is brown and it dries DARK brown</li>
            <li> So I came to my trusty Amazon and did a search for some tanning lotion to help me get dark.</li>
            <li> and I came home DARK...</li>
            <li> but i have gone 5 times at 10 mintes pe session in the last week and i am at least 3 shades darker.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the level of dark tanning I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> my friends started asking me how I was getting so dark</li>
            <li> and I get a dark tan.  </li>
            <li> Not a bronzer-which is wah off body make up that make you look dark unti</li>
            <li> and I got quite dark.</li>
            <li> but people kept telling me how dark I was.</li>
            <li> I was extremely dark and didn&#x27;t even realize it.</li>
            <li> And helped me achieve a dark tan color in just 6 tanning sessions.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the shape of the bottle-</li>
            <li> That 50X on the bottle will lead you to believe that this is going to get you dark before your UV tan kicks in,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you as dark as you would think.</li>
            <li> Makes me dark</li>
            <li> Never got dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average lotion</li>
            <li> didnt get as dark as thought hubby was relieved especally because of the name  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive and provides a dark tan.</li>
            <li> Dark tan.</li>
            <li> I bought from green web and not sure if its the actual company or the tanning lotion itself.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m getting dark at all.</li>
            <li> it got me dark.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten this dark without a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT watery, its tan-ish in color and has the consistancy of an average lotion.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I got two skily on skin and dark dark results</li>
            <li> Really dark color.</li>
            <li> No dramatically dark results, but I noticed a liiiittle color.</li>
            <li> it will get u dark.</li>
            <li> Some people would like to know if the lotion is a dark color, and it is.</li>
            <li> For that very reason I was skeptical of how this would perform.</li>
            <li> not quite as dark as I hoped</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as dark of a bronzer as I was expecting</li>
            <li> dark as the rest of me, but not with Paint</li>
            <li> didnt tan as dark as I wanted to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not worth buying</li>
            <li> Although those 2 made me(and my legs) quite dark,</li>
            <li> As for the &amp;#34;extreme dark bronze tanning results....</li>
            <li> I was so dark</li>
            <li> I used this tanning lotion and was as dark as I&#x27;ve ever been.  </li>
            <li> Will help get you dark faster.</li>
            <li> It also smells fairly good and doesn&#x27;t leave a terrible smell after you&#x27;re done tanning.</li>
            <li> :) I recommend to those who are fair-skinned looking for a base.</li>
            <li> but if your looking for a dark dark tan with less effort you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> its not super thick and its DEFINITELY not watery.  </li>
            <li> I felt let down.</li>
            <li> I have used this in both a lay down and stand up</li>
            <li> it does give me a pleatu after about 2-3 weeks but it could be that i go like every other day!</li>
            <li> I only bought this because they were out of stock on mine, and I needed something to use in the mean time.</li>
            <li> It Black Auto-darkening Dark Tanning Lotion, 50X, 13.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> take time i reccomend using a stronger tanning lotion for the legs and other parts of the body if you are looking for a very dark tan</li>
            <li> it black because I was not willing to spend 90 dollars on tanning lotions at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other tanning lotions make me darker within a few tans.</li>
            <li> it black 50x</li>
            <li> black lotion is no joke and with the price I&#x27;m not using it sparingly, already have a back-up bottle on</li>
            <li> Black</li>
            <li> Paint it Black</li>
            <li> In the bottle, it smells sort of fruity and floral but after tanning with it on, it smells like burnt popcorn and black licorice.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell all burnt after the session as some that I&#x27;ve previously used have.  </li>
            <li> It Black.</li>
            <li> Its not 50X black by any means.    </li>
            <li> it black tanning lotion</li>
            <li> No super greasy feeling or anything like that either.      </li>
            <li> It Black.</li>
            <li> If there is a slight stain, it washes off or fades within hours.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered the Desingner skin Black with 20 bronzers in it.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for about 3 &amp; a half weeks, &amp; I think I have already reached my tanning plateau with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Black</li>
            <li> it black</li>
            <li> I purchased this bottle of lotion about a month and a half ago.</li>
            <li> Nothing like Paint it Black...</li>
            <li> but I got this one for less than 15.00</li>
            <li> Black</li>
            <li> Paint it black?</li>
            <li> it black</li>
            <li> i wish i could give it less stars...</li>
            <li> they arent painting anything black with this garbage...</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of lotion this is by fare the worst.</li>
            <li> Black Storm</li>
            <li> I bought both Paint it black and Black storm</li>
            <li> it Black is that it doesn&#x27;t have that tale tale smell of tanning beds</li>
            <li> As with the face tanner, I got less color than I would with nothing on.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion because I ran out of the Black Storm</li>
            <li> but since ive been using paint it black</li>
            <li> it Black again.</li>
            <li> Less than $15.00 for a quality tanning product??</li>
            <li> Using less didn&#x27;t ease up the smell</li>
            <li> it Black Tanning lotion</li>
            <li> it Black is suppose to stain your hands because of the 50x bronzer</li>
            <li> it Black 50X.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years now and Amazon sells it for a lot less than the tanning salons in my town.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a product different than Australian Gold since they&#x27;re so expensive..</li>
            <li> it Black</li>
            <li> it black 50X.</li>
            <li> Paint It Black 50X</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I saw a drastic change in skin color, but I did notice a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I use Upgrade to Black</li>
            <li> I have been satified with Paint it Black, but it does not have the level of bronzing agents as the name might suggest.</li>
            <li> it Black.</li>
            <li> But Millennium Paint it Black lotion doesn&#x27;t contain that ingredient.</li>
            <li> I tried this Paint it black lotion.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 100x paint it black also</li>
            <li> My order came in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Paint it black reference to the Rolling Stones...</li>
            <li> it Black 1 year ago for about $15 on Amazon</li>
            <li> The product I bought was Jwoww Black Bronzer.  </li>
            <li> it Black and told her to just give it a try.</li>
            <li> It Black.  </li>
            <li> I also received Millennium&#x27;s Black Storm - can&#x27;t wait to give that one a go as well.</li>
            <li> Paint It Black.</li>
            <li> Black</li>
            <li> Black 50X</li>
            <li> It Black.  </li>
            <li> It Black.</li>
            <li> So with Paint it Black</li>
            <li> This product was delivered without a cap to the bottle which resulted in a messy package and I&#x27;m not sure if I even want to use it since it&#x27;s clearly not even sealed.</li>
            <li> Paint It Black.</li>
            <li> Kinda odd</li>
            <li> It Black</li>
            <li> It Black</li>
            <li> That means less trips to the Tanning Bed.</li>
            <li> It Black 50x</li>
            <li> I decided Paint It Black after reading mulitple reviews.</li>
            <li> It Black 50X Tanning Lotion at one time</li>
            <li> Saw no extraordinary results.</li>
            <li> It Black</li>
            <li> I thought how brown I&#x27;ll become or will tan much less</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like it as much as my previous product.  </li>
            <li> It Black 50X</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight color change, but again I just used it (about an hour ago).</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m certain I received a bad/faulty bottle because the smell was absolutely awful, and not just like I didn&#x27;t personally enjoy the scent - it just smelled wrong - I could barely use it at all.</li>
            <li> Well I had high expectations for this one and they failed me.</li>
            <li> No bad after tan burn feeling or bad smell.</li>
            <li> Crazy fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I squirt a small amount on wet hands and apply all over.  </li>
            <li> I LOOKED DARK FOR A FEW HOURS then</li>
            <li> Darkens visibly with the tanning bed and doesnt leave a mess on the bed itself.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just now as dark as I usually get after a week or 2 of tanning with other products.</li>
            <li> not real wild about the smell, doesn&#x27;t seem to make me any darker, pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> My legs have never been red after tanning where as with my regular bronzer I am brown but BOTH times my legs were red &amp; even painful after the second time trying it which I have never experienced on my legs.</li>
            <li> it Black from green web</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion changes a little after tanning but isn&#x27;t stinky</li>
            <li> but I like to have a little color during the summer</li>
            <li> and I did feel a little bit darker</li>
            <li> It does smells a little like cigarettes.</li>
            <li> Little ATO.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m a little darker than i was before.</li>
            <li> I have used this 4 times this week and I am twice as dark already!</li>
            <li> and i am already dark!.</li>
            <li> I use those little tanning stickers</li>
            <li> Purchased this product a little over a month ago after using Going Gaga for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> but I did get a little darker</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t try to go tanning and then go on with your day thinking that you won&#x27;t be a little fragrant.     </li>
            <li> and i bought this stuff too boost the tanning progress a little bit.</li>
            <li> Gave it 5 stars because it  does get your fricken dark!</li>
            <li> I had to rub it off and it felt like little pieces of glue coming off my skin.</li>
            <li> Thought I would use it for a little color before getting out in in my bathing suit.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on it smelled like a weird minty vanilla but after tanning I smell like a mixture of chocolate and vanilla ice cream!  </li>
            <li> I have never been so dark!</li>
            <li> it makes me so dark!</li>
            <li> just wears off a little quicker</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve tried lotions with 25X and it seemed to be a little stronger.  </li>
            <li> , little did they know that i have been tanning longer than they thought, but when i started using this everyone noticed.</li>
            <li> It may give boost your color a little.</li>
            <li> and when I wasn&#x27;t using this, it showed little results.</li>
            <li> After that started fading in the past 3 weeks with fall starting, i thought id get back to fake baking to maintain a fall/winter tan.</li>
            <li> I had when I was little</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s making me a little darker.</li>
            <li> I burned a little bit bc</li>
            <li> Just a little touch of broze to your skin.</li>
            <li> Everything else made me a little Orange</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to try and out and compare it to other lotions I had used in the past.</li>
            <li> so I can get really dark!</li>
            <li> makes you very dark</li>
            <li> I do not have any \\&quot;known\\&quot; allergies, and both times ive used it, my stomach and chest has broken out in little red bumps.</li>
            <li> and I clearly received a fake, substituted product.    </li>
            <li> Green Web, in my opinion, is clearly selling fake or substituted lotion.  </li>
            <li> it stinks to much..</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few weeks now (</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy from green web.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> So dont waste your money    </li>
            <li> i used to lay in the tanning bed everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it up since I don&#x27;t want to waste it, but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> and I thought this would help maybe I&#x27;ll try it again in a few weeks...</li>
            <li> I grabbed a few</li>
            <li> Or a self tanner, which tans you over a few hour; some turning you orange, some not,-but</li>
            <li> SO I have to vote this a waste of money for what it was sold for.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t completely waste my money.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY FROM GREEN WEB.    </li>
            <li> I emailed Amazon and Green Web complaining about the lack of a seal on the bottle</li>
            <li> I used when I went tanning for a few months before spring break.</li>
            <li> I am at the gym almost everyday</li>
            <li> Thin enough it doesn&#x27;t club in your hair on your chest, arms or legs.  </li>
            <li> I GOT TIRED OF PAYING SALON PRICES TO ONLY FIND OUT</li>
            <li> Only to be disappointed that my tan didnt last long at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine may 3 and got it the next day if that&#x27;s not great service</li>
            <li> , I would need to go tanning everyday.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a few things you should know.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned but few times</li>
            <li> and it feels greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> So, for me, it was a waste.</li>
            <li> it will stain your hands &amp; give uneven look if not spread out well &amp;  get wiped off your hands ASAP.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time or money.</li>
            <li> and I only tanned approximately 2 times/week.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the $75-125 lotions.</li>
            <li> I could not tell a difference until using a few times.</li>
            <li> kinda a waste of time and money for me.</li>
            <li> Probably not genuine.</li>
            <li> waste of money..</li>
            <li> and it has been a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Im heading on a tropical vacation in a few weeks and need some color</li>
            <li> I go tanning almost everyday...</li>
            <li> Product works if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with my hands and feet tanning</li>
            <li> &quot; and ive gotten a nice base tan already!</li>
            <li> but in a few hours it fades.  </li>
            <li> I went from white bread to wheat thin in two sessions.</li>
            <li> In the tanning bed after a few minutes my skin was wet/</li>
            <li> Green Web Inc. Im a redhead</li>
            <li> So I went tanning for a few sessions without any lotion to get my tan even again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked in a tanning salon for a few years, so I know my lotions - Paint</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion twice in one week and am already a few shades darker.</li>
            <li> I could see a noticeable difference in just a few tanning visits.</li>
            <li> I received the product a few days before the projected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I find that if you use this every day a few days in a row it starts to give off that orangy look.</li>
            <li> , it is working, it just takes a few sessions to get all bronzey.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Your not supposed to use a bronzer and then go home and shower within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge bronzer fan</li>
            <li> , I just am not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> As I went in during the past couple months I would write down what they considered their &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; $100.00 lotions and started looking around on here.  </li>
            <li> you get dark, and i mean DARK with this.  </li>
            <li> it black is not a bad lotion for beginners though when trying to get a base tan.</li>
            <li> IT BLACK!</li>
            <li> I usually use designer skin black 20x</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was a bit scratched up, and there was no safety seal - not sure if it had previously been opened and returned.</li>
            <li> Paint it black works so well on me!  </li>
            <li> the black 100x is what i recommend over this, gave me a deeper tan quicker!</li>
            <li> I figured since the salons push their product so hard and at such ridiculous prices, there had to be a cheaper option online.     </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, because I don&#x27;t normally spend this much on a lotion.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even hardly use the other ones before I ordered another one of this.</li>
            <li> I had been tanning with  for 2 months and my legs were still pale as  ever.</li>
            <li> I used it in the tanning bed and gradually got darker &amp; darker, and I&#x27;m a pale person.  </li>
            <li> I just started tanning again after losing all of my color from 6 months ago, so I am currently pale.</li>
            <li> So I was ghost pale.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have pale skin and are very impatient when it comes to seeing results, try forever black instead.</li>
            <li> This product WILL make you tanner in less time, but think something along the lines of \\&quot;Ill get tan in two days what I normally would in three\\&quot;, not some ridiculous</li>
            <li> I started going 5 minutes a session with some other lotion and the results have been slow.</li>
            <li> other lotions make me smell like my flesh is cooking slowly and giving off the grossest almost syrup-like odor for hours</li>
            <li> stiff roxxxs&lt;br</li>
            <li> The after tan odor is VERY slight, almost unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> I have used 40 or some lotions over the past 9 years.. and this has fallen to the bottom of the list (secondary to swedish beauty&#x27;s &#x27;Priceless&#x27;&#x3D; BAD BAD!)</li>
            <li> The lotion is not as thick as other tanning lotions I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> - I am getting the deep dark tan I was wanting!!!!!  </li>
            <li> he&#x27;s so dark now!!</li>
            <li> I even noticed a change in the way I walk, like I have a little hiccup in my step!</li>
            <li> Then, I went to the beach for a week and used it there, and I turned dark brown!!  </li>
            <li> I really recommend that lotion too, but you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the paint it black lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion seriously made me look really dark</li>
            <li> however, it doesnt make you very dark as it says!</li>
            <li> I read reviews and really focused on the bad ones before I tried this product.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure about the after tanning bed effects.</li>
            <li> Also when the girls at the salon saw it they tried to give me some talk about how they sell fake lotions online that don&#x27;t actually make you tan.</li>
            <li> So, it makes it difficult for me to give an actual rating.  </li>
            <li> Ill never buy from a tanning salon when I can get the same stuff on here</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see the results I usually do.  </li>
            <li> in the past, this 0ne</li>
            <li> I got a membership to Hollywood Tan&#x27;s 4 star beds, which are made to give the deepest tan imaginable, and are not cheap!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I discarded the last bottle</li>
            <li> Although I recieved this product quickly,I&#x27;m not satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> have in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for quite sometime, usually three times a week</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT MAGIC PEOPLE.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few shades darker and I haven&#x27;t burnt!</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle was delivered unsealed so I&#x27;m skeptical on what this product actually is.</li>
            <li> But after my interval in the tanning booth, I literally smelled like I&#x27;d been working in a horse stall for the past hour.</li>
            <li> Smells okay in the bottle, the after-tan smell is awful!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the expensive ones, just regular or mini-Ultimate with Facials.  </li>
            <li> I usually tan in the mornings so that my tan can sink in all day</li>
            <li> i usually reach a tanning platuae</li>
            <li> Also my skin has been itching which has Never happened when I have used this lotion for the past 8-10 year!I</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get past the post-tan smell.</li>
            <li> I did not love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt say results are immediate but you can usually see your tan lines after use, but this could just depend from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bottle for almost a year now and have used it weekly for the past 6 mths.</li>
            <li> I usually come home and shower</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know maybe I got the fake one, but it&#x27;s obvious that it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I usually buy Designer Skin</li>
            <li> not sure havent had chance to use fully</li>
            <li> I usually purchase my lotion from the salon that I tan at which usually cost up to $100.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for two weeks, lay for 15 to 20 minutes and never burn!</li>
            <li> I just received it a few days ago and already am darker than I&#x27;ve ever been!</li>
            <li> not exactly sure but to give a small comparison...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a year round tanner, tan at least 3x a week.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelming and unbearable.</li>
            <li> It only has a faint smell.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Swedish Beauty, and I will not stray again.</li>
            <li> I have used it two times in tanning bed, product is very thin &amp; white in color with no bronzer detected at all!  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference is less than a week!!</li>
            <li> i don&#x60;t mind going 2-3 times a week but 4-6 times seems a little ridiculous.</li>
            <li> And I NEVER tan and am extremely pale!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not even sensitive to scents so this is weird for me!</li>
            <li> As for the tingle factor.....pretty weak compared to some other brands that I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real happy with this product</li>
            <li> I am a very pale person</li>
            <li> and I was very pale to begin with.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and I take forever to get any color.</li>
            <li> When I do not tan I have very pale skin.</li>
            <li> I am even naturally very pale and have freckles so a lot of bronzers come out looking orange on me.</li>
            <li> After reading a few other user&#x27;s unhappy reviews, I also recommend buying this directly from Amazon and not from a third-party seller, because like those buyers, I have been seriously disappointed with the quality of cosmetics and other items bought from third-party sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this purchase and unfortunate because I was very excited to try this lotion!</li>
            <li> this is a staple item for the hard core tan nut.</li>
            <li> Hard to say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> it give you that dark tan that a lot of women want!!!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t smell bad, but it didn&#x27;t leave my skin really soft like some people said.</li>
            <li> WIthout this lotion, i&#x27;d have to go at least 10 times to get this color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at least 4x now and notice nothing.</li>
            <li> Which kinda of sucks</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews where people complained about the smell.</li>
            <li> this lotion sucks...</li>
            <li> and it sucks...</li>
            <li> I tan at least 3 times a week during the spring and summer, and have done so for about 8 years.</li>
            <li> The bronzers are not effective in this lotion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely SUCKS.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like leaving negative reviews</li>
            <li> She never said anything negative about it</li>
            <li> Sun poison alone sucks.</li>
            <li> Now I have to admit, you look darker after the initial tan and it fades as the day goes on, so that was disappointing.</li>
            <li> At least twice a week.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t react negatively to it.  </li>
            <li> At least I know what I have always used ~Designer</li>
            <li> Used it a couple times it sucks no results from it</li>
            <li> I am at least two shades darker.</li>
            <li> Some lotions are too thick and take FOR EVER to put on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale person that got tired of looking at her veins through her skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that there isn&#x27;t a terrible after tan smell like a lot of other tanning lotions have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone that already has a base tan.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t so dark to make it look like a fake tan and didn&#x27;t turn me orange.</li>
            <li> Very skeptical about buying it a third time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you black, has a fake bake tint to it, but it works.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a lotion to start out with or just want a subtle glow, I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Sorry Black</li>
            <li> Get this lotion because you know salons mark everything up ridiculously</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the lotion would be bad if it was a recent bottle.</li>
            <li> not a good tanning lotion @ all.</li>
            <li> just not a good tanning lotion---used it twice, didnt see any results.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT smell horrible after tanning, now you dont come out smelling fresh as a spring morning</li>
            <li> but I have read that doing that is not good for developing my tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> Small complaint when you look at the quantity and price!!</li>
            <li> The difference was hardly noticeable!  </li>
            <li> I noticed it is hard to keep my legs tan though!  </li>
            <li> i was as dark as the color i wanted to be within a week!!!!</li>
            <li> i am so dark!!!!  </li>
            <li> I ordered late saturday night and it was delivered monday morning!</li>
            <li> Then it left this dusty residue that got on my clothes, and I spent the rest of the day coughing over that awful smell.</li>
            <li> IT SUCKS!  </li>
            <li> i would have to pay at least 50 bucks in the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I had to return this product because the first time I used it, I had terrible itching reaction.  </li>
            <li> really thick and smells baad!</li>
            <li> After buying Black 2 White and noticing the horrific smell of that stuff</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had anything bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Poor service.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Everyone was asking me my secret.</li>
            <li> then my results would be poor.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot worse.</li>
            <li> Was not happy about this at all...</li>
            <li> My third time this year I used this &amp; holy crap</li>
            <li> It is a rather thin lotion that has no desiccative fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The absolute worst thing is that it starts &amp;#34;balling up&amp;#34;on</li>
            <li> It has bronzer and tightening without any irritating itchy tingle.</li>
            <li> And it gets worse (burnt grass clippings or something like that) after the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> , it smells worse.</li>
            <li> (i have had worse) but its still a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I try to develop a base tan to prevent 3rd degree beach burns.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken when I received this product, so I am wondering if it was refilled with something else.</li>
            <li> And having a allergic reaction is not uncommon to products.</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced burning.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY FALSE</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how body chemistry can make this product smell like burnt hair...or menthol..or any of the other crazy things here unless the solution was fake.  </li>
            <li> but the smell is so bad afterwards that I choose to shower (and as I read in other reviews..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty bad, but if you are planning on showering a few hours after tanning then its not all that horrible...</li>
            <li> main reason I don&#x27;t like it though, is that it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> It also does not leave a dirty bronzer film like some bronzing tanners I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell half bad either</li>
            <li> I have a decent base tan already and was hoping this lotion would help me achieve that dark bronzed glow without using &amp;#34;extreme bronzer lotions&amp;#34; Boy was I WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> In the past I have always used oils for self tanning, and absolutely hated the mess that they would always leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad atleast not to me and to a few others I know.</li>
            <li> the worst lotion I&#x27;v came across so far.</li>
            <li> I ideally never use tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I hated that feeling but was the only product I could get results with.</li>
            <li> i noticed my tan going down the drain :(</li>
            <li> the ProTan one I like is hard to find and Funky Monkey smells absolutely terrible and is expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the 5 star reviews, and I have to admit that I am a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed, but I did see results.</li>
            <li> which DOWNRIGHT sucks!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this until I used it a few times and saw the darkening in my tan.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok...not as dark as I thought I would get, and I already had a base.</li>
            <li> I used this tanning lotion after I had my base tan down</li>
            <li> At least I won&#x27;t have to worry about smelling bad.</li>
            <li> of weird.</li>
            <li> Not that fake Orange look....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an expired one or if it was a fake.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I had been tanning for a few weeks before ordering and receiving this product so I had already began to develop a base tan.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in an effort to save money, everyone knows buying lotions from the tanning salon is way expensive.  </li>
            <li> ,i would b totally ill.</li>
            <li> So confused!  </li>
            <li> - I have been purchasing lotions online for years and have never gotten anything questionable.  </li>
            <li> Some have a weird smell, others flake off and crumble, this one does not.</li>
            <li> well sorry</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I wish I could change about this lotion is the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> Anyways you don&#x27;t lose a tan  in a session you lose the fake and unless you shed skin like a snake or itch like a crackhead</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s weird and perfume-y in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sad.</li>
            <li> Personally, this is the worst tanning lotion ive ever used..</li>
            <li> it smells faintly like burnt hair?</li>
            <li> It smells like faint vanilla.</li>
            <li> but mine had a weird sort of menthol smell to it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this lotion didn&#x27;t make the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> and I am certainly not impressed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive even wholesale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I didn&#x27;t receive a fake...</li>
            <li> Ill probably continue to use it under sunscreen til I run out.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of trying it because it has a self tanner</li>
            <li> was like umm wtf?</li>
            <li> Even after a couple of hours of wearing all you can smell is fake tan.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve looked around you probably already know that tanning lotions can be EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Like, insanely expensive.  </li>
            <li> it a try if youre tired of oils!</li>
            <li> Not really impressed.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell that a lot of them have</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I saw that ill answer with my experince.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got that fake cloying smell, like plasic plus baby powder airfreshner..</li>
            <li> and i dont think ill be ordering anything else period.</li>
            <li> Sealed perfectly so no leaks.  </li>
            <li> perhaps Im wrong, but mine didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have a really difficult time finding a tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave me with that funky &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> and I got the wrong one.</li>
            <li> It doesnt make you look like a fake tan</li>
            <li> cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> , Ill stick to the Hero Worship</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by this lotion at all.</li>
            <li> read the reviews after buying it and was afraid I was going to get some weird concoction</li>
            <li> Gave me a base tan in about 3 weeks, and I am very hard to tan.     </li>
            <li> Sorry for the bad review, the truth hurts.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it broke my chest out really bad and had no bronzing effect for me.</li>
            <li> So, i was mainly afraid of streaking or turning orange.</li>
            <li> This lotion stinks.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not too crazy about the after tan smell that it leaves on your body.</li>
            <li> I thought it was supposed to be a sunless tanner which did not need any artificial assistance.  </li>
            <li> it stinks after</li>
            <li> Either this product doesnt have lots of bronzers or Millennium line of tanning lotions stinks.</li>
            <li> It does not leave you feeling slimy and dirty after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know someone who owns a tanning salon and this price is just crazy.</li>
            <li> so I dont burn like crazy when I get there.</li>
            <li> One thing that I am not too crazy about is the smell.</li>
            <li> disappointed but my friend or husband that is Cherokee Indian can use with no problems, but I still feel like they advertise it wrong</li>
            <li> I did get tan from this lotion, but it was pointless to be tan because i received a HORRIBLE rash around my lower stomach, boob, butt, and leg area from it.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with using it!</li>
            <li> Sorry....would not recommend, because I couldn&#x27;t get past that awful smell.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong when ordering this lotion!</li>
            <li> The smell is very faint</li>
            <li> and it will make your clothes smell really bad.</li>
            <li> THE BAD</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but it wasn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d like to smell like if I wasn&#x27;t tanning.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad compared to others.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it did increase my tan somewhat, BUT I think it responds badly to some skin types.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> Tanning makes you smell bad anyway, but this lotion made me embarassed to have to go anywhere after I was finished tanning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks.</li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t bad, so I went out on a limb.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave your hands orange looking and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor..</li>
            <li> and it was bad.</li>
            <li> smell wasn&#x27;t bad either like lots of others.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not smell bad like some others.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion isn&#x27;t bad, but I do feel like the smell changes after you get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t &#x27;stink&#x27; too bad using this lotion either, although I think that there will always be an odor associated with indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I dont think it smells bad</li>
            <li> Works well and doesnt smell bad afterwards either.</li>
            <li> My husband just makes me sick</li>
            <li> The product has a sickly smell.</li>
            <li> I hated the way it smelled in the bottle, and I hated it even worse after I got done tanning.</li>
            <li> so upset :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it made me swell up like a puffy balloon :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed with this product..</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t allow myself to tan anymore because tanning beds are very dangerous for your health.</li>
            <li> I also HATE THE SMELL of this post tan.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t base my tanning lotions on that claim.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate this product from PhotoTech.</li>
            <li> I Hate the smell</li>
            <li> I hate the smell after tanning though, and I just can&#x27;t wait to shower.</li>
            <li> I hate those kinds.</li>
            <li> Once I tan for a couple weeks and get the base color</li>
            <li> I do have a base tan and have been using an accelerator for some time.</li>
            <li> I had somewhat of a base tan and have been trying to enrich my tan for an upcoming wedding that I am in.  </li>
            <li> I do already have a base tan.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> And, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my fav but does the job and doesn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards either!</li>
            <li> but it wasnt bad and the lotion helped a lot!</li>
            <li> A real disappointment.</li>
            <li> I always hated walking around smelling like a tanning bed</li>
            <li> I hated this lotion, I threw it away and would never repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Try it y wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> just stinks!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this stuff.</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Will not buy again, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> , very disappointed feel like the reviews were written by friends of the makers</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was however still skeptical!!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this tanning lotion is horrible but it is the worst out of all the lotions I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> but the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too terrible.</li>
            <li> this morning I woke up horribly burnt!</li>
            <li> its smells disgusting!!!!</li>
            <li> AND it doesn&#x27;t have that horrible \\&quot;tanning bed\\&quot; smell at all!  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just me who didn&#x27;t like it, but my husband thinks it smells awful as well.</li>
            <li> ATO is AWFUL!!!</li>
            <li> Disgusting!</li>
            <li> The after tan smell is horrible, but haven&#x27;t found a lotion yet that I like the smell of after I tan.</li>
            <li> this lotion is terrible</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t horrible either.</li>
            <li> It also smells horrible afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> it stinks for one..and for two im getting LIGHTER from using this!!!</li>
            <li> And the \\&quot;idiot of the year\\&quot; award goes to me!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and doesn&#x27;t add any color to your skin when tanning.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Worst part of tanning is how you smell afterward...</li>
            <li> I broke out in a horrible rash wity hives after one use.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely miserable.</li>
            <li> The itching was terrible.</li>
            <li> This lotion is terrible.</li>
            <li> Smells real bad in my opinion and you will definanty need a shower after tanning.  </li>
            <li> The worst lotion I had.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an experienced tanner, I haven&#x27;t used very many lotions and don&#x27;t know quality from cheap tanning lotions, but I like the way this smells (for a tanning lotion) and I feel like it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> It was ok. Not my favorite although I did finish the bottle it kind of left a residue on my skin that would peel off sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Sort of weird. But ok overall. I bought a different bottle the next time.</li>
            <li> It was ok. I felt let down.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lotion, only down fall is the Orange stain that gets left in between your fingers, if you get the chance before you tan definitely wash your hands.... Other than that it does the trick, I&#x27;ve been using paint it black 50x but decided to try the 100x and I love it, it definitely gets you a nice golden brown tan! Not that fake Orange look....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad goes on good has a nice color gives a good tan............&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is it kinda feels slimy once u get in the shower</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you black, has a fake bake tint to it, but it works.  best thing about the product is the smell!! it smells AWESOME!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to me that a tanning lotion smells good and this one does. I have only used it two times in the tanning bed but it it a HUGE change from my last lotion. My boyfriend said that I looked noticeably different after tanning with this lotion. So glad I found it because I&#x27;d rather go to the tanning bed less times (not a big fan but I want to be tan for my wedding)</li>
            <li> used at my local tanning salon in every bed from level 1 thru level 5. A good smell to the lotion and the color was dark &amp; rich . i&#x27;d recommend to anyone whose is looking to take it to the next level with their tan ! also shipping was fast and product came intact.</li>
            <li> loved this product. it smells amazing and is perfectly priced</li>
            <li> I have not seen any improvement while using this product and will not be buying it again. I would have given it 1 star but it does feel good on my skin as a lotion so that is why it&#x27;s getting 2 stars.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t put any color on me at all. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t expect much for $14.00.</li>
            <li> One of the best tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used. It smells really good and it works.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Leaves my skin very soft not oily. Turned me a nice brown not orange. Good for a beginner to get a base color. Tan fades sooner than i would like so i will switch to one that has more bronzer. Good product though!</li>
            <li> This product is tighter than a nun&#x27;s butt.  Also, Seth Dinowitz delivers with the speed and power of Floyd Mayweather on rocket powered rollerskates.  Keep doing the thing!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - I LOVE the SMELL TOO!</li>
            <li> for the money, this lotion works better than most out there, and the price is right on. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this tanning lotion is horrible but it is the worst out of all the lotions I&#x27;ve purchased. It seemed to work appropriately on my body. My face however broke out everytime I used it. I gave my bottle away.</li>
            <li> provides a decent base color, but does not last for more than a few days so you must constantly tan in order to keep your color. I&#x27;m sure it may work well for others, but seems to not like my skin and doesn&#x27;t want to last.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion! Works great and smells like chocolate.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t tan as I expected it to</li>
            <li> Great price and good quality.  The tanning store told me about products that had been mixed with things - probably just hype but I was glad to find this one just like the one I purchased for a much higher price at the tanning salon</li>
            <li> I love how this lotion smells and feels on my skin, but I don&#x27;t really think it has the amount of bronzer it advertises.  I have been using this lotion for a few weeks now (indoor tanning 3-5x per week) and I don&#x27;t see a remarkable difference over tanning with no lotion at all.  I will use it until it is gone, but will more than likely try something else next time.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. Good thing I spent less than $20 on this product or I would be mad. Shipping was quick. When I got the product I immediately opened it, not in a sealed container. It appeared already open. Smelled good so I thought I would give it a try. This is advertised as a silicone based tanning lotion, mine was very watery and had a weird tint. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it. My results were like I went tanning with regular lotion on. I don&#x27;t know if I got an expired one or if it was a fake. Don&#x27;t buy from green web.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to a tanning bed in over a year. Tonight I went and used this product, wow! I can already see color! I&#x27;m loving it, so much I think I&#x27;m going back first thing in the morning. This paint it black lotion is no joke and with the price I&#x27;m not using it sparingly, already have a back-up bottle on it&#x27;s way. Im 100% satisfied, all pros, no cons. Thanx, you have got yourself a new loyal customer. Sheila B.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells &amp; how dark it makes me. It&#x27;s my favorite tanning lotion. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the color I got with this product.  It was equally as good as several that I had paid $60/bottle for at the salon!  (I don&#x27;t tan anymore, but used this when tanning before my wedding.)</li>
            <li> Great bronzing lotion! Great tanning results!</li>
            <li> I tanned for almost a month with a different tanning lotion &amp; it seemed like I could not get any further on my tan (which I hadn&#x27;t got far on in the first place) so I decided to try paint it black and even after the first couple times I tanned, I fell in love. It&#x27;s given me a great color which is hard for me to get, because I have fair-ish skin that prefers to burn &amp; takes a long time to build a tan! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is very good tanning lotion it works very quick and last a good while and I will definitely purchase it again as is as I&#x27;m out</li>
            <li> I just bought this tanning lotion. This week is my second week ever using a tanning bed. I got this product to help quicken my tan. As soon as a I put on the lotion it had a great smell that is not overpowerful. I tanned in the stand up bed for 6 minutes with this on and I I can definately tell a differnce and see tan lines from having my bikini on. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of tanning bed products.This one is my top choice,works very well taking your tan darker quickly.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this from Amazon consistently for probably the last 3 years because it is SO inexpensive and it is in a big bottle for indoor tan lotion. That being said, it is just an OK lotion and nothing to rave about. It makes your skin feel nice and silky post tan because it has silicone in it, but as soon as you get out of the shower you better have after tan lotion ready because you will get the \\&quot;tan feel\\&quot; where your skin just feels thirsty and dry. This also does not last long at all in terms of color, and I think the immediate tan look you get comes more from the color of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS WILL STAIN YOUR CLOTHES! It is brown and it dries DARK brown so if you have white clothes or towels it will stain. I also HATE THE SMELL of this post tan. It is not the best smelling stuff to start with, but after you tan it just stinks and it will make your clothes smell really bad. It is an extremely distinctive smell and it is so pungent that others will smell it. All the Millenium lotions have purchased and used have this same smell post tan and it is so off putting that I am looking for a new lotion.</li>
            <li> Daughter found product very good.</li>
            <li> I signed up for a tanning membership to get ready for summer this year and was having trouble getting dark without defeating the purpose and laying in the sun all day long. So I came to my trusty Amazon and did a search for some tanning lotion to help me get dark. I bought this item based on price and reviews, I have used almost the entire bottle...no I don&#x27;t go every single day but still my results are not anything above average if that. I look like I had a tan at one point (which I did from being outside a lot) but even with using this lotion every time I go to the tanning bed it did not make me bronze or increase my color at all really. I am trying a new product and hoping for better results. The smell isn&#x27;t all that great but no different than any other cheaper tanning lotion, consistency is alright, just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Great smell, last a long time, and really gets my skin dark. Allot cheaper then everyone else, and works just as good... if not better.</li>
            <li> It was cheap enough so can&#x27;t complain about that, but for giving a deep tan that&#x27;s not true I tan all the time and this didn&#x27;t even help get the nice tan I got in Mexico this spring.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion and you will be glad you got this product.  I really enjoy the scent of the lotion and its effectiveness.  It has a lot of bronzers to help get you darker quicker.  This is what you want if you visit the tanning bed once or twice a week.  It gives you a longer lasting and better looking tan.  The fact that its black with skulls only helps! Gotta be the coolest looking lotion to pull out of your bag by far!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It really works!!!  It smells great and helps you get a great tan.</li>
            <li> Best tanner I have ever used. Comes in 50x or 100x. Both are great.</li>
            <li> Great product...works as described and I got a great deal.  Only reason for 4 stars is I am not extremely fond of the smell.  Would still buy again for the price I got though...but would definitely never pay full price for this product!</li>
            <li> Not recommended!  Waste of money. I put it on one arm and not the other to see the difference..  The difference was hardly noticeable!  So dont waste your money    Chad Klimek  Fargo, ND</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the 50x fool you. You could use a triple bronzer and it would work the same.  It does not smell like \\&quot;clean cotton blossom\\&quot;  more like a vanilla fig or something like that which isn&#x27;t bad putting on, but I do smell like that gross sweaty burnt smell when I&#x27;m done tanning. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I expected considering it is a silicone lotion.  It does give you a nice golden (not orange) tan but will fade fast if if you don&#x27;t go tanning on a regular consistent basis.  It&#x27;s a good buy for the price but I will pay the extra few bucks and continue to use Supre bronze no.9.</li>
            <li> Smells almost like marshmallow.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it goes on really nicely.  Not greasy at all, and the scent after you tan still smells great.  Definitely made me darker after one use.  Left me very soft all over even my legs which were kinda scaley and gross.</li>
            <li> This product does help you reach a darker tan but the smell is terrible. I smell like burnt skin not like the flowery perfum smell it describes. Other then that I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned, and I&#x27;ve used this one time, and noticed a substantial difference. smells good, skin softening.. i recommend it 100% worth the money in gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get yours now!</li>
            <li> The stuff is working only for a few first sessions. Than I didn&#x27;t see if it was useful.</li>
            <li> Product gives you color with first application, but does not turn you orange. Would not be my first scent choice, but it DOES NOT stink. Company ships FAST!!!  A+++</li>
            <li> I am soo excited to have gotten my lotion today!!!  I placed the order on Tuesday and Got my Order on Thursday... I will certainly recommend you to my Friends!  Thanks Again!!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion smelled great and made my skin super soft and silky and gave me a very nice dark color, i saw the results after just one use of this lotion...the one thing i did not like is if i did not tan for 3-4 days the tan would start fading away....other then that good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for those who tan every day to every other day this is the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li> the smell was great and my skin felt amazingly soft afterwards, but i didn&#x27;t see a difference at all with a deeper tan after more than 6 uses (and I&#x27;m pasty pale white).</li>
            <li> Seems to be a decent tanning lotion, specially for the cheap price...   And it smells good too!   So save yourself lots of $$$ and buy this one instead of those crazyyyy over priced lotions in tanning salons!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about getting this product because it had been so long since i had last went tanning and i had lost my color. So, i was mainly afraid of streaking or turning orange. Not at all! i noticed a difference after laying in the tanning bed just once with this product! by the second time it was a beautiful color and the third i was at the color i wanted all along. It&#x27;s great because you Dont have to lay in the bed as much when you use this product. i used to lay in the tanning bed everyday but with this product i will once every other day or even once every two days. It saves you alot of money paying for the tanning bed and is better on your skin! two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This lotion is really good for such a low price... I just used this lotion today for the first time and I was pretty impressed with the results. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because I have a lot of better lotions and this one was only $15 but I was noticeably darker after tanning with this today. I&#x27;ll definitely buy another bottle when I&#x27;m finished with my first bottle</li>
            <li> Used this product one time and I am definitely pleased! After one tanning session I noticed a significant boost in my color. I had been using a (not so great lotion with a nasty after tanning smell) and wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted.  Paint It Black will help me reach my best color yet! Great price, nice smell (not a nasty after tan smell either!), lotion went on very smooth.  This is a definite must try for all tanners!</li>
            <li> THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS IVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE..NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE WAS WONDERFUL!! IN A TANNING SALON YOU PAY WELL OVER 100.00 DOLLARS AND HERE I GOT A STEAL WITH 14.95!! I USED IT ONE TIME IN THE TANNING BED AND RECIEVED A SIGNIFICANT TAN..AND ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS SAY IT WASHES AWAY IN THE SHOWER...TOTALLY FALSE YOU GET BROWN AND STAY BROWN..I GIVE 2THUMBS WAY UP!! AND THE SMELL IS VERY PLEASENT THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THE SMELL IS VANILLA WITH A HINT OF LEMON...</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the 5 star reviews, and I have to admit that I am a little disappointed.  For one, I do not find the smell appealing.  It does cover that \\&quot;just went tanning\\&quot; smell, but it has its own weird musty smell.  Also, I haven&#x27;t really noticed my tan getting any darker than it normally would.  However, I do notice that my tan seems to last longer in between my weekly maintenance sessions and it does seem to moisturize well enough.  Therefore, I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.  In no way do I consider this a 5 star lotion....if you are looking for that, I&#x27;d keep looking!</li>
            <li> For what the product is worth, it was okay. I didn&#x27;t really like the smell too much, and I have used tanning lotions a lot better than this. I used to work in a tanning salon and used ibronze and itan before... this is great for a lower end lotion that will help you tan, but I didn&#x27;t feel like I achieved the results I had desired.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It has a great scent and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy after tanning. It has a decent bronzing quality to it as well.</li>
            <li> not a good tanning lotion @ all. I was expecting better from the reviews I read. really thick and smells baad! my husband says it smells like burnt hair. when you shower it feels like goo coming of your  body. got the lotions pretty fast in the mail though. I&#x27;ve been tanning for about 2mths, already have a pretty nice tan. just not a good tanning lotion---used it twice, didnt see any results. I&#x27;ll stick to my other lotions.</li>
            <li> This lotion is one of the best that I have used! It really makes you darker &amp; leaves your skin feeling very soft. Great tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion shortly after buying my own tanning bed. Having been out of the tanning bed world for a while I just bought this to hold me over until I read some reviews and found a tingle lotion that I liked. It smells good at first but after tanning the smell isn&#x27;t very nice. I don&#x27;t leave lotion on after tanning so I am not sure about the after tanning bed effects. I just didn&#x27;t noticed too much of a differnce and wouldn&#x27;t buy this lotion again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I can definitely tell I&#x27;ve gotten several shades darker. Even my fianc√© noticed how great the lotion works! This lotion goes on super smooth and leaves my skin feeling great afterwards. The only small downside maybe the smell, but that&#x27;s only after you tan and it&#x27;s not too terrible. I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone. And having only paid $15 for this lotion it is awesome! I am looking forward to trying the next one!</li>
            <li> Decent product for the money. Smells great and tans well but it has a strange texture if you&#x27;re used to smoother lotions. Overall no complaints and the ordering process was excellent.</li>
            <li> I normally use Worship me by Designer Skin but I after reading the reviews on Paint it Black I went ahead and ordered it, I got it yesterday and used it today in the bed for 15 mins and I came home DARK... I am pretty fair skinned and this is by far the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;m not orange and my palms aren&#x27;t either... I won&#x27;t ever go back to another lotion again.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve tried so far! It works fast and leaves an allover great looking tan! It has a nice smell to it as well.</li>
            <li> I love to tan and this is BY FAR, thee best lotion that I&#x27;ve come across.  If you&#x27;re looking for a deep, dark tan in less time than it would normally take, then THIS is your product.  And, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all!  In my opinion, silicone based lotions are now the ONLY lotions that I will purchase.  It makes yuor skin feel great, less smell, you seem to tan quicker, and your tan lasts longer.  GREAT PRODUCT!  Don&#x27;t buy it from the salon........you can get the same exact product for A LOT cheaper on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion last week and i have been using it every day. I am a very pale person and i just started tanning about a month ago getting ready for summer. I started going 5 minutes a session with some other lotion and the results have been slow. I dont know what is in ths stuff but i have gone 5 times at 10 mintes pe session in the last week and i am at least 3 shades darker. However the firt time i used it i burned a little bit but it only lasted a day and then it was gone.</li>
            <li> Especially considering the value of this lotion, I will never buy another lotion at a salon again.  In the coming months I plan to purchase a couple other Millenium tanning lotions here on Amazon, and POSSIBLY also JWOWW&#x27;s lotion, which is half the price on Amazon than my local salon.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a strong lotion with a lot of bronzing power, Paint it Black is it.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is ok but I prefer the Australian Gold Black better. I wish I would have purchased that instead.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a lark since I had just run out of White2Black (my normal lotion). When it arrived, it was not sealed so I&#x27;m not sure if it is a genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I don&#x27;t like it though, is that it smells terrible. It doesn&#x27;t work well with my body chemistry at all. Maybe this isn&#x27;t meant for guys? In the bottle, it smells sort of fruity and floral but after tanning with it on, it smells like burnt popcorn and black licorice. I have to immediately shower. Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to darken as much as White2Black does. I&#x27;m going to use it up since I don&#x27;t want to waste it, but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Great smell and definitely increases your tan. I bought this a couple years ago so my memory on every detail of this product isn&#x27;t the greatest. I don&#x27;t tan anymore. But I do remember it being a great buy. Its so cheap and works just as well, if not better, then the stuff they sell in the salons. I&#x27;ve paid $100 for a tanning lotion that didn&#x27;t even work as well as this. Although I don&#x27;t think its very good for your skin, if you&#x27;re tanning in the beds then you&#x27;re probably not too concerned with that. I&#x27;m very fair skinned naturally and this gave me a nice dark color. Probably would have worked even better in a higher level bed.  Also when the girls at the salon saw it they tried to give me some talk about how they sell fake lotions online that don&#x27;t actually make you tan. They&#x27;re just trying to sell you stuff, this stuff works great. I bet they even buy the lotions offline themselves. Thats all. :)</li>
            <li> I was expecting way better results from this lotion since it has so many bronzers but I didn&#x27;t really think I got very good color from it after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This product is very good. My tan is dark and everyone started noticing how dark I was getting only after two visits to the tanning salon and it was due to this tanning lotion. I am very pleased with the results. I recommend this product and I will purchase this lotion again.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, didn&#x27;t get real dark, although I never do. Was worried about becoming orange, but had no problems in that area. Over i&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is not really desirable, and I like the smell of vanilla. I have used it for a month and have yet to really see whether it is accelerating my tan. Probably would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> been using this product for the a year now, works and smells great.don&#x27;t streak or turn your skin. well through it&#x27;s money!!</li>
            <li> I like the scent of the lotion and it goes on very smooth. I haven&#x27;t seen the level of dark tanning I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Let me just start off by saying... the smell of this stuff is awesome.  After buying Black 2 White and noticing the horrific smell of that stuff this is just incredible.  Its also smooth and velvety when you apply it, it adds instant glow to your body and works amazing.  I admit after buying this and using it for two weeks I tried other lotions I had never used before (I was on a try new things kick) and they all just paled in comparason to this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work, I have used it for more than 2 weeks and i would do just as good without anything! And it makes you stink!</li>
            <li> The tanning lotion I bought is normally 100 dollars in retail sale, but I got it for 13. When it came in the mail the return address sticker had been taken off so I wouldn&#x27;t know where to send it. It wasn&#x27;t sealed so anyone could have opened it and put plain old lotion in there or it was diluted. It supposed to be a bronzer too but I don&#x27;t see a difference. When I called the number on the back for Milennium, they said it most likely is not real</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS LOTION! It gives you a great bronze and the smell is amazing... you can leave the tanning bed and not smell like you just left the tanning bed. Also the lotion leaves your skin feeling soft. Of all the bronzing tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used this one is by far the best!!! I definately recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, and I have tanned in the past where I was going everyday almost and had tried many different lotions. This is the first lotion that I have used where I really saw results quickly and I don&#x27;t have to go everyday for a long time to see results either. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using indoor tanning bronzer for a few years &amp; tried many different products with various results &amp; I do not believe that the product I received is anything more then a scented lotion. I have used it two times in tanning bed, product is very thin &amp; white in color with no bronzer detected at all!  THANK GOD I didn&#x27;t tan for more then 10 min each time &amp; after looking at product only putting it on my legs.  My legs have never been red after tanning where as with my regular bronzer I am brown but BOTH times my legs were red &amp; even painful after the second time trying it which I have never experienced on my legs. I think this is just scented lotion &amp; I am returning this product to amazon &amp; encouraging them to hopefully STOP CARRYING PRODUCTS BY GREENWEB!!! COME ON AMAZON, WE DESERVE BETTER THEN THIS!</li>
            <li> I just want to say I am not payed to write this I am a real person!!!! I boughtt this lotion a week ago and used it for the first time last night in a level 2 bed for 9minites that&#x27;s how long I always go I have been using an intensifier and I am still very new to tanning I use this product my 5th time tanning and this morning I woke up horribly burnt! NO TAN BURNT! Thankfully I didn&#x27;t put it on my face im so upset :( I haven&#x27;t been burning at all and I thought this would help maybe I&#x27;ll try it again in a few weeks... Smells good very light colored and very watery and thin</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this product allows me to hit a tanning bed less often with good color. I went 5 times (that&#x27;s it!) and got tons of compliments on my tan. WIthout this lotion, i&#x27;d have to go at least 10 times to get this color. It smells yummy afterwards too. The after tan odor is VERY slight, almost unnoticeable. The smell of the lotion changes a little after tanning but isn&#x27;t stinky</li>
            <li> This lotion is only okay.  Not the best product out there, but it&#x27;s very good for the price.  I love the smell, but it didn&#x27;t give me the \\&quot;50X\\&quot; tan that I thought I would get.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells good, no worries about leaving lines or uneven spots. Got me darker better than Freedom.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works well, like the bronzers in it, gives u a natural looking tan</li>
            <li> Favorite lotion!!! Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I tan almost every spring and summer, and this is my first time using Paint it Black.  I also recently relocated, however, and I believe that the tanning salon I&#x27;m using currently isn&#x27;t as good as the one I previously used.  So, it makes it difficult for me to give an actual rating.  However, this lotion is incredibly moisturizing and does seem to improve my tan quality.  It doesn&#x27;t smell all burnt after the session as some that I&#x27;ve previously used have.  I actually am pretty happy with it and have recommended it to my friends.  If you&#x27;re going to a good salon while using this lotion I think it would be wonderful. Definitely do plan to reorder when I run out!</li>
            <li> I am bit of a tanaholic and want a lotion that gives me a great tan and has a nice scent to it.  There are days when I tan on my lunch break and can&#x27;t shower afterwards so I need something that is functional.   This lotion has a great refreshing scent to it and leaves no streaks.  You want the ultimate darkest tan?  This lotion will help do the trick!</li>
            <li> I was scared it was gonna make me orange or super dark.  Nope.  Great color.  Okay smell.  Great price.  I would recommened this to anyone.  I have tried a lot of different products and this one is better then most.  It also arrived quickly and on time.</li>
            <li> I have actually never used tanning lotion before so I shopped a bit before choosing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tan within a week-so I guess it did the job! Also, the tanning lotion goes on smooth, actually smells good and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li> I have used California Tan products for YEARS. I love the Beach Bum Rum step 2....but I decided to take a chance on this product because of the ratings and price.    This product does what it says and the color you receive is a good tan color, not orangey or fake looking. I was skeptic because the reviews almost led me to beleive this was a bit of &#x27;self&#x27; tanner...it doesn&#x27;t come out that way...it just adds a real boost to your indoor tanning. The consistency is thick but smooths over your skin VERY well and really leaves your skin feeling sooo soft. I take a shower immediately after tanning and my skin was still soft after my shower so the moisturizers are of good quality and don&#x27;t wash off. I can&#x27;t say anything about the claim that it is &#x27;firming&#x27;...who knows if those claims about anything really is accurate. I figure if that works then its a special bonus but I don&#x27;t base my tanning lotions on that claim. I have fair coloring and freckles, I tan maybe twice a week for about 10 minutes so I am by far not dark but I like to have a little color during the summer and this product will work well for me because of the extra boost of bronze.     THE BAD: One of the reasons I love CalTan products is for the delicious smells they have. Women love &#x27;smell good&#x27; lotions and tanning lotions should have a &#x27;tanning&#x27; type smell. Something you connect with going to the beach or the pool. This lotion stinks. Its like flowery or something. Reminds me of my grandma&#x27;s make up counter. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion through Amazon and I paid a fraction of the retail price...I got 2 bottles for $27 with free shipping. It&#x27;s got a nice soft smell, not overpowering like many tanning lotions. The smell says cotton blossom, but I would say it smells more like vanilla. I had been tanning for a few weeks before ordering and receiving this product so I had already began to develop a base tan. I noticed I looked darker the first session I used Paint it Black. The lotion doesn&#x27;t leave skin an orange color like many lotions with bronzers do. Applies easy and leaves skin feeling soft. After just 2 tanning sessions using the lotion my friends started asking me how I was getting so dark (they apparently didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin color until I started using this product.)I purchased this product in place of Born to be bronze which designer skin has discontinued. This tanning lotion is one of the best that I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried many. The only lotion that has given me faster results are lotions with tingle which I can&#x27;t use anymore because my skin has become more sensitive. This is a great for people who cannot use tingle factor and want to get dark faster</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion works very good! So far its one of my favorites and the shipping was fast! I ordered late saturday night and it was delivered monday morning! Great product and great response to my order!</li>
            <li> I researched and read reviews of all the top tanning lotions and decided on this one.  I am not impressed to say the least.  It smells really good, and feels great, but as far as darkness of color, it hasn&#x27;t done much for me.  I think everyone&#x27;s skin is different and you just have to try different products.  Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this tanning lotion but not amazed as some of you are. it does work but nothing too impressive. So i guess it just depends on what \\&quot;type\\&quot; of tanner you are. I would recommend this for beginners though. It does smell really good! and leaves your skin feeling smooth and shiny (moisturized) But if you&#x27;re trying to decided between any bronzer, this does not compare to smoke. Smoke has got to be the BEST bronzer Ive used, personally. Im sticking to tinglers though...</li>
            <li> Smell was pleasant but did not Bronze as much as I had hoped. Did not live up to the hype. Color was okay but washed away in shower (several hours after tanning).</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing and worth every penny. I noticed a difference is less than a week!! It smells really good as well.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, and after 4 - 5 tanning bed sessions, I was as tan as I usually am in mid-summer. Great product! I would recommend this if you want to get a dark tan fast, or deepen your tan past your tanning plateau. I will definitely stock up on this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product by internet.  It did not state it had bronzers which I am allergic to, requiring washing your hands after applying.  I wll never use it and feel the product is not represented as appears.</li>
            <li> It smells good....makes me tan...and its cheaper than buying it in a tanning salon.  Ill never buy from a tanning salon when I can get the same stuff on here</li>
            <li> This lotion came within 2 days of ordering it and I chose standard shipping so I was very pleased with its speedy delivery.  As far as the lotion I have only used it once but it smells great even after you tan and I did feel a little bit darker but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to tell after using it more than 1 time.  It doesn&#x27;t make you itch or tingle so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> My only down point is the scent is not as good as others. I think it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> This lotion got me over the tanning platau.  has a great smell, good for after you have a base tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past couple of weeks and the results are just amazing!  I was ecstatic the first time I used it and have continued to darken even further.  I am also Irish with freckles and usually burn.  This gave me the natural deep tan that those blessed with better pigment than I have had.  It smells great and I&#x27;m super picky.  I can use less of this product because it goes on so smoothly too.  I&#x27;m placing another order for 3 more bottles for my friends and family.  I highly recommend this lotion.  I just love it!</li>
            <li> I read all of the customer reviews before I bought this, and they all conflicted, but I still wanted to give it a try. After I placed the order, I asked the manager at the tanning salon what she knew about the brand, and she told me to never buy tanning lotion off the Internet, that it could be anything in that bottle. Maybe that was just her wanting me to buy from the salon- when I showed it to her, she did have to eat her words...she admitted it was authentic, but couldn&#x27;t place the smell. One review said this smells like warm vanilla sugar- my bottle does not. Another said it had a subtle fresh scent, and afterwards, didnt experience that \\&quot;after-tan smell\\&quot;. That was confirmed...I stopped at a gas station right after tanning, and the guy working asked what perfume I was wearing! I already had a good base tan, but had reached a plateau and wasn&#x27;t getting any darker, that&#x27;s what made me want to buy this, some reviews said it&#x27;s just wonderful, and they are so much more tan, etc. It does have good moisturizer. I&#x27;ve left my Mom and BFF both use it and they like it. And the smell? I have Shout gel stain remover...that&#x27;s the closest I can think of to describing the smell..but thats not a bad smell...</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it has lived up to everything it says it dose. If you are looking to bronze up while tanning for a great price, I would try Paint It Black.</li>
            <li> Great for indoor tanning. The scent isn&#x27;t too over powering and I like the gradual color I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for two weeks. If it is actually \\&quot;auto-tanning\\&quot; don&#x27;t see much in results. It&#x27;s a fine cream I suppose, but if you&#x27;re looking to darken your complexion then it doesn&#x27;t offer much.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best tanning lotions I have ever used... and I have tried MANY!</li>
            <li> This lotion works fairly well. I enjoy the light refreshing smell and that it is not a very thick lotion. I think I will continue to buy this product because of its reasonable price</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. Its one of my favorites! This lotion should be used only after a nice base tan is gained if you want the best results. This lotion left my skin a lovely goldon brown and I continued to get more color every time I used it. I am interested in trying out the other products similar to this one!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scent is clean and fresh. This lotion is a caramel color and is easy to apply before your tanning session.</li>
            <li> I also got the x60 and they both are great. No bad after tan burn feeling or bad smell. Grab this up when it is this cheap, even working in a salon and getting a discount from reg prices this is still wayyyyy cheaper!! I grabbed a few cuz this is all I will use from now on, this and the x60. I change them out everyother time!</li>
            <li> Its ok.  I dont feel like I get as bronze as I would like.  Its not 50X black by any means.    Just ok, Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this tanning lotion.  If you have darker skin, this is not the product for you.  Maybe it works better for those with fair skin.</li>
            <li> I read all sorts of good reviews on this product, how dark even the whitest person was able to get....  it didn&#x27;t smell bad, but it didn&#x27;t leave my skin really soft like some people said. And it did nothing for wonderful color.  If someone gave this to me I would use it again but I would not buy it.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical when I bought it,the tanning bed girl said everyone complained about its smell after you lay in the bed,but I found no offensive smell in fact it was extremely pleasant my skin was silky soft...it was just awesome</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly &amp; in good condition. Haven&#x27;t used this yet, but I have heard that it works very well (from other reviews). Excited to get my tan on!</li>
            <li> its smells disgusting!!!! and NOT as good as reviews recommend.. I will NOT buy again.. and UNLESS you like the smell of a burnt coffee bean, I DO NOT RECOMEND!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in an effort to save money, everyone knows buying lotions from the tanning salon is way expensive.  I saw this lotion, and read the reviews and it seemed like a good deal.  I went tanning 3 times, in the best level beds for my skin and I didn&#x27;t see the results I usually do.  My skin didn&#x27;t feel much softer or smoother, and my skin was definetly not that dark.  I would never pay $100 for this lotion.  I&#x27;ve gotten much better results from other lotions, looks like I&#x27;ll be switching back to my old Australian Gold XOXO Kisses.</li>
            <li> I burn very easily without tanning lotion, but when I use this lotion, I don&#x27;t burn at all and I get a dark tan.  Other lotions will turn you orange, but this one does not.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews for this lotion and i thought wow! just had to try it. I have tanned for several years and this is the worst lotion I&#x27;v came across so far. I&#x27;v heard of salons selling it for as much as 95.00, so glad i did not pay that much 4 it,i would b totally ill.It does nothing of the sort as it claims,very dissappointed. I believe next time im n the market for tan lotion I will be buying from a salon were i can purchase a sample first instead of getting stuck with a $20.00 bottle of junk,even if i have to pay more cuz u never know what your really getting from these internet sites(sad but true) and i was so looking forward to this product(oh well) shoulda known better to buy into the hype.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this brand since the price was so low (15.95).  It does feel silky when applied and doesnt leave a stain on my hands.  I&#x27;ve been tanning over a week using this lotion &amp; have gotten a nice tan so far so I think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Dont like the scent but i love the results. Leaves my skin soft and it helps me maintain my tan.</li>
            <li> I have tried probably hundreds of lotions, but paint it black is by far the best.. the moisturization is provides is incredible, and at this price, you can&#x27;t afford not to try it.</li>
            <li> Paint it Black is a great all around lotion for a nice base tan.. It is smooth and smells good when you put it on.. You get nice color, however you will notice that it fades pretty quickly the next day.. For the price, the lotion is definitely a great buy and soo worth it! However, I&#x27;m not too crazy about the after tan smell that it leaves on your body. It&#x27;s pretty bad, but if you are planning on showering a few hours after tanning then its not all that horrible... Love how it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and the greatest part about this lotion is that I can use it outside in the sun too :) Happy tanning!</li>
            <li> THEY LOTIONS ARE A GREAT PRICE, WORK AS GOOD AS THE ONES YOU BUY AT THE SALONS FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE.  PLUS THEY SMELL SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion because 1-there were decent reviews, and 2-I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on tanning lotion.  The transaction went very well-I recieved this in only 3 days after ordering.  As far as the product goes, however, I did not like this lotion.  I have used Designer Skin tanning lotions prior to trying Millenium&#x27;s \\&quot;Paint it Black\\&quot;...this lotion is greasy for a tanning lotion.  It does not have a good \\&quot;after tan\\&quot; smell, and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly into the skin.  I would not recommend this product; instead I would suggest spending some extra money on a better quality lotion.</li>
            <li> I noticed everyone raved that the lotion kept them from smelling like tanning bed after their tan.  I did not experience this. Also, I&#x27;m fairly light skinned, but this lotion didn&#x27;t do much extra compared to other lotions I have used.  With all that being said... the lotion smelled great, and it did its job; it kept my skin hydrated!</li>
            <li> I worked in a Tanning Salon and have used many many lotions. I was curious about this product and hoped for amazing results, but the lotion fell short of all expections. For anyone that is looking for a deeper, softer skin, longer last tan, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both got whiter when we use this.But is does smell pretty good, just dont count on it for a good tan.</li>
            <li> I couldnt believe how good this worked compared to everything else I have tried and its SUPER cheap</li>
            <li> They chose a good name for this product. Bcause \\&quot;painting you\\&quot; is what it does. I simply wanted a good tanning lotion that would help men tan betten in my indoor tanning bed. Not a bronzer-which is wah off body make up that make you look dark unti you that a bath or shower. Or a self tanner, which tans you over a few hour; some turning you orange, some not,-but ALL stinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product s a nice moisturizer. It really is. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It certainly does NOT smell like cotton blossoms or vanilla sugar. It smells like suntan lotion. Tropical. It doesn&#x27;t stink like a self tanner, or turn your palms, or anything else orange)Even it you don&#x27;t wash your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, any color you THINK you got washes right down the drain with the BRINZER, which is only body makeup. Huge disappointment. But bonzers are just that-body makeup. Don&#x27;t expect it to be anything more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it applies smoothly. No is does not stink, and you can go back to work and not smell wierd all doay. Also, you will have soft, moisturized skin. But when you take that shower that night, you won&#x27;t be any better off then if you had just used a regular moisturuzer.  SO I have to vote this a waste of money for what it was sold for. Now, if it was sold as a long lasting moisturizer with a slight bronze glow that washes off at the end of the day, it&#x27;s a great 5 star product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As a 50X paint it black tanning lotion, it&#x27;s false advertising, and the poeple who marketed it were trying to rip us off, and my God have mercy on their souls!:)</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it was inexpensive, and had good reviews. When I first used it, I instantly noticed that my skin was darker after tanning, but it faded quickly. Good for someone who goes tanning frequently. The smell was...interesting. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because it seemed that every review said it smelled like something different. It wasn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but it wasn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d like to smell like if I wasn&#x27;t tanning. An employee at the tanning salon gave me lots of flack about buying lotion online and how it&#x27;s probably not even real lotion, etc. but I thought it was fine. Did the trick while I could save up to purchase one of the fancy lotions from the salon.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time &amp; in good condition. I have used it 3 times so far and all has been good.  The only problem is that people expect you to have a tan when they next see you !!!!!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying, I am only in my second week of tanning and prior to purchasing this lotion, have never used a single tanning lotion. I figured since the salons push their product so hard and at such ridiculous prices, there had to be a cheaper option online.     I am a male and have a hard time justifying $15 on some lotion that isn&#x27;t guaranteed to do anything for you at all. I took the plunge, and so far I am happy. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and can already see the difference. As far as moisturizing, I don&#x27;t really know too much about that but I&#x27;m not dry and itchy after tanning. The lotion doesn&#x27;t give you a burned skin smell either when you are finished. The outside of the bottle was masculine enough for me as well.No super greasy feeling or anything like that either.      I will continue to use this lotion until it runs out and will probably not try another one, since this one is doing what I need it to do. Definitely order this stuff online though, I&#x27;m pretty positive my tan place was getting $50 for it.     So I recommend it to:    Beginner tanners  Male tanners (my gf borrowed it and liked it too, so female tanners too)</li>
            <li> This is PERFECT. You don&#x27;t turn orange AT ALL, and you can see your color progress through the day. Smells fine, goes on good, and leaves skin feeling AMAZINGLY soft! I bought two :)</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with Paint It Black. I would alternate between the two and I got quite dark. These lotions work well and leave your skin feeling great. I didn&#x27;t think they were working as expected and felt kind of pale but people kept telling me how dark I was. So I decided to take a picture of myself and wow they were right. I was extremely dark and didn&#x27;t even realize it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this stuff. \\&quot;Paint it Black\\&quot; did not provide even average tanning, especially for a product that has the name it does. Yes it smells good. Yes it spreads easily. I got very little tanning though and even that did not last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in conjuction with the Black Storm and have had amazing results. Both are great by themselves, but I have found I have had better results using them together I alternate every other day between the two. Both smell amazing and leave your skin silky smooth. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product, I am fair and I have a very natural, deep tan that I am very happy with. Also the seller was amazing...quick turn around, a pleasure to do business with. I will absolutely be a return customer.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, but I apparently misunderstood its function. This is NOT a sunless self-tanner.  Apparently you must be a tanning bed user to benefit from it in terms of color.  I thought it was supposed to be a sunless tanner which did not need any artificial assistance.  Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was! It&#x27;s only a nice moisturizer but gives no color at all if you are a non-tanning bed user.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in March and used in almost daily at the salon.  I felt like I barely got any darker, except for the natural tanning process.  The salon owner suggested another product and within days of using the new product and was darker.  It just doesn&#x27;t bronze very good.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband cause the outside of the bottle is not as girly as others.. I didn&#x27;t expect too much because it was around 13 dollars, but that&#x27;s what I get for thinking! It is a GREAT lotion, moisturizes well, and gives you a beautiful mocha color (on my fairly light skin,) and it helps you get pretty dark as well! My husband just makes me sick he&#x27;s so dark now!! You should try it!</li>
            <li> I too was mistaken. No where in the description did it say this is for tanning beds or possibly outside(?). I thought it was a self-tanner as I don&#x27;t go tanning in salons. I assumed \\&quot;auto-darkening\\&quot; meant tanning automatically no extra work required. I guess I can try it outside and see if it helps so I didn&#x27;t completely waste my money. It does smells a little like cigarettes. I kept wondering where do I smell smoke but it was me!</li>
            <li> This product is nice because its cheap and smells good.  The only downside i see is that there doesnt seem to be any real bronzing or color adding agent.  If there is a slight stain, it washes off or fades within hours.  I have used other lotions before that seem to really give you that extra level of darkness this does not seem to do that.  I do like the smell and it seems to moisturize well but if your looking for a dark dark tan with less effort you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this on eBay for about the same price, because I wasn&#x27;t able to use PayPal through Amazon for some reason. I just used this today and I must say it&#x27;s AMAZING. It smells like a sugar cookie, before and after you tan. And it completely neutralizes that after-tan smell. My skin is so ridiculously soft right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had plateaued some, but I just used this on my legs and seen a huge difference. Amazing amazing.</li>
            <li> made my very fair skin pretty dark but wore off at first. had to tan every other day to get it to stick</li>
            <li> the l0ti0n came very fast and was just what was advertised. but c0mpaired t0 0ther l0ti0ns ive b0ught in the past, this 0ne imp0rticular did n0t give me as much c0l0r while tanning. the smelll is alright, and the feel is silky and sm00th.</li>
            <li> Just got back from Cancun without a burn.  Although this is not a sunscreen, it allows you to be tan and spray sunscreen over.   I did apply prior to the trip so the darkening began before the beach.  It was so wonderful to look tan, not worry about covering up light skin, and stay in the shade.  This product is worth the investment, especially for us light skinned folks.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion, even if your just starting or maybe trying to even out your tan. It works great, smells great, and makes your sking feel fantastic!:)</li>
            <li> I think this is a good option for the price. I didn&#x27;t get any extreme dark tan with this product. I would say it only enhanced a minimal amount. I was very pleased with the consistancy and smell of the product. It absorbed very easily into my skin, felt great and did not have an overpowering smell. I&#x27;ve had lotions before that all I wanted to do was gobhome and wash it off because it smelled so strong. With this lotion I could workout afterwards and even then it didn&#x27;t bother me.    So if you&#x27;re looking for a lotion to start out with or just want a subtle glow, I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product May 26.  It is June 9 and still have NOT received it.  Poor service.  Will NOT order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL ON THIS LOTION IT SMELLS GREAT AND I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because I think it would work better for someone that doesn&#x27;t have fair or sensitive skin. I on the other hand, do have sensitive fair skin (but I can tan without issue typically--Bella Black from this same company works great for me) and I broke out into hives and it leaves me a little orange tinted when I use it. If you&#x27;re naturally medium or dark toned, this will probably work great for you as long as you&#x27;re not sensitive skinned!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. I am a tanaholic to the extreme. This lotion seriously made me look really dark so the name is a defffff good name for this lotion!</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion on the planet! I actually thought I would try another lotion this year, in stead of my usual (paint it black) So I ordered the Desingner skin Black with 20 bronzers in it. I have been tanning for about 3 &amp; a half weeks, &amp; I think I have already reached my tanning plateau with this lotion.  I know I can be darker, so I am getting this old favorite! I did, however order the Austrailian Gold crystal faces lotion for my face, and I absolutly LOVE it! It has Derma Dark bronzers in it, plus 20 vitamins and minerals to keep your face glowing and healthy!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It works great and smells fantastic! Normally at the salon its about 50 per bottle so ordering on here saved me tons!</li>
            <li> Got this product and it&#x27;s good for the use and gives me a slight tan but it&#x27;s barely noticeable. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I liked this lotion, the smell was better than average, although the reviews of a great smell, etc....seemed a bit over the top to me. A good lotion does make a difference when tanning, so give it a try.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion because one it smells good and two it gets you really dark but the tan is not long lasting. Its almost like if you miss a day of tanning or don&#x27;t use the lotion one day you are significantly lighter so that was an upset considering that I don&#x27;t want to have to live in a tanning bed to keep my color.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It makes my skin feel hydrated after tanning, and it makes my \\&quot;fair\\&quot; colored skin turn a nice brown color instead of red. It also smeels great, so I dont have to wash it off before I go somewhere. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked in a tanning salon and have used $100+ bottles of tanning lotion and this compares! This is a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion as a replacement to my Black Orchid by Supre when I was first starting to tan. This lotion smells good kind of like brown sugar, and it smelled okay after tanning, but I don&#x27;t really think it helped me tan. I used this for a few weeks, and what I noticed was that when I first left the salon I would have a really dark and rich color, but as the day went on the color would fade. I guess the auto-darkening has a time limit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning off and on the last few years. I purchased this product the first time in 2010 based on all the great reviews and amazing price. It was my first indoor tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I had good results but decided to try more expensive Designer Skin lotions. Ive used Luminary, Bombshell, Phoenician, Obsidian, Black Noir, Rue La La and most recently Splurge. So I&#x27;ve dabbled a bit! I thought DS lotions were overpriced and made my skin super greasy. After my time away from Paint it Black I  am happy to say I am back! For me I get the same results or better, with non greasy skin for cheap with Paint it Black! Try it...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well from the color I&#x27;ve developed but not the best I&#x27;ve tried. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells and feels!! Its so cheap too!!!</li>
            <li> Not only does This stuff make my tan darker, it makes my skin feel like silk. I need to order myself another bottle üòé</li>
            <li> When I recieved my product the box was sealed but the tanning lotion was not. And it was half empty there was probably 8 oz. in the bottle. I have bought this product before and it was normally sealed and full.  I was not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I get a nice even tan and the bronzer helps my stretch marks not stand out so much :)&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> Excellent !!! Fast service !!</li>
            <li> I like it, but it didn&#x27;t really make me that dark. For the amount of bronzers it says it doesn&#x27;t seem to help that much. It is very moisturizing and smooth going on. (plenty of silicone) Smells good. Little ATO.</li>
            <li> Being someone who&#x27;s worked at a tanning salon before and have had tried many different lotions I would say this lotion isn&#x27;t the best. For the amount of bronzer this lotions claims to have I wasn&#x27;t impressed by it. I didn&#x27;t feel like it really made me any tanner but the smell is good and it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!  I just used it for the first time yesterday and I&#x27;m at least a full shade darker.  I had read the reviews on here before buying and everything they say is true - it really helps you to get a darker tan AND it doesn&#x27;t have that horrible \\&quot;tanning bed\\&quot; smell at all!  It smells fresh and light and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I always hated walking around smelling like a tanning bed and now I don&#x27;t have to!  The tanning salon I go to has this on sale for $40 so this is definitely an amazing deal, I might go ahead and buy another bottle for when this one runs out!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely does not make me darker. The smell is nice I will give it that. I&#x27;ve used it at least 4x now and notice nothing.</li>
            <li> The lotion is silky smooth and keeps me moisturized long after I&#x27;ve left the salon! The smell after tanning isn&#x27;t as pleasant as I&#x27;d like but the product does work!</li>
            <li> Works great, smells awesome, and does a great job of darkening my fair skin and for a redhead that is quite difficult.  Thank you for the awesome product!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, especially for the price, I&#x27;ve used many different lotions and this one is definitely with the best ones.</li>
            <li> Paint it Black 50X indoor tanning lotion is a great value for the price. It&#x27;s kept my skin soft and smelling great (completely negates the nasty \\&quot;just tanned\\&quot; smell). And helped me achieve a dark tan color in just 6 tanning sessions. I didn&#x27;t notice a tingling sensation (good- I didn&#x27;t want!), or any self-tanner added color (no orange streaks at all!). My only complaint is the shape of the bottle- I sometimes have difficulty squeezing the lotion out w/ just one hand. Small complaint when you look at the quantity and price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not allergic to many things, but it seems I broke out in hives when I used this product.  Which kinda of sucks, b/c the product is amazing.  If you aren&#x27;t generally allergic to lotions I&#x27;d tell you that this product is perfect, however, if your skin is sensitive I&#x27;d recommend staying away from this product.</li>
            <li> Paint it black tanning lotion is great! I have bought this product 2xs and Im sure I will again!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.It gives you a nice bronze tan faster than most lotion.I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and I will use it again and again! I got a wonderful tan with this product. No streaks, no orange.... I LOOKED GOOD!</li>
            <li> The product Paint It On Black 50X works well in the way of moisterizing and helping give a better tan.</li>
            <li> Very good price and results</li>
            <li> For the inexpensive price, this lotion is definitely worth it! I bought this lotion primarily because I wanted something that smells different than the typical, weird-scented tanning lotion; I honestly didn&#x27;t think that it would work as well as it does. After using Paint It Black, I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed. The 50x bronzing agents actually work (and you definitely have to watch, because a lotion that advertises as a 75x bronzer may not even bronze well)! I have been tanning daily for over a month and it wasn&#x27;t until I used this lotion that I could notice a significant darkening in my skin tone. The smell, also, is absolutely wonderful. I was a little skeptical when a customer in another review mentioned that this lotion smells like Bath and Body Works&#x27; \\&quot;Warm Vanilla Sugar\\&quot;. But - it really does! The clean, vanilla-y scent of this lotion makes it seem like you&#x27;re applying a fragrant body lotion, unlike many other tanning lotions on the market. Overall, I would recommend 100%. It&#x27;s efficient, creamy, and affordable. What more could you want in a tanning lotion?</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well. I think that companies just put on a lot of X&#x27;s and numbers on their bottles to trick you, but this lotion actually made me FEEL darker. Who knows if it actually made me look darker, because no matter what I was tanning so I was going to get darker. The smell isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> So confused!  I see so many great reviews for this lotion, but it actually SHIELDED the bulbs from giving me my full tan. I got a membership to Hollywood Tan&#x27;s 4 star beds, which are made to give the deepest tan imaginable, and are not cheap! I started using this lotion on day one and could NOT get a good base tan after two weeks of tanning almost daily.  I complained to the salon consultant about their beds not being strong enough, and requested to try another bed.  They assured me over and over that the membership I had for the 4 star bed was one of the best, and to stick with it.  Finally after they tried to sell me a lotion of theirs to \\&quot;enhance\\&quot; my tanning effect, I thought I should experiment with my own.  At this point I had already worked my way up to the full 10 minutes and was getting no where. I went in one time with no lotion at all, and got pretty red/tan...first time I saw major results. I then tried another lotion, and got tons of color as well. It is clear to me that the whole time it was this lotion, and I stopped using it immediately. Maybe mine was a faulty product, but it smells just like described in other reviews. Maybe it works well after you have reached your full tan effect, but it did nothing other than act as sun screen for me. I think I&#x27;m going to request a refund. :|</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion, I have never gotten this dark before!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff because EVERY OTHER tanning lotion on the market (and I&#x27;ve tried about a hundred) make me smell HORRID when I get out of the tanning bed. Ugghhhhh- other lotions make me smell like my flesh is cooking slowly and giving off the grossest almost syrup-like odor for hours &amp; I have to jump in the shower as soon as I get home from the tanning bed. NOT THIS STUFF! I pretty much wanna eat my arm when I get home from tanning now. I don&#x27;t know how to even explain the smell but I&#x27;m not lying when I say its DELICIOUS! Highly recommend this stuff people!</li>
            <li> This stuff truly works without all the markup salon costs.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and have ordered it twice now.  Helps to get a great, even, dark tan. I first used it before taking a Caribbean cruise. I was in the sun for seven days and never got red.</li>
            <li> Okay folks, here&#x27;s how this bottle of lotion works.  I previously have purchased this bottle from my salon where the workers told me that this particular lotion does not come SEALED when bought from the regular manufacturer/dealer.    The lotion which I just received in the mail smells and feels EXACTLY how the lotion which I just ran out of feels/smells. Unfortunately I discarded the last bottle so I can&#x27;t tell you how the lotion literally stacks up.. But this lotion from the amazon seller (NOT green-whatever) passes my own frugal/skeptical legitimacy test.  This is the second time I bought this particular lotion from amazon, as I am a seasoned tanner and lotion junkie.    paint it black DOES smell really good putting it on  DOES NOT smell horrible after tanning, now you dont come out smelling fresh as a spring morning but you smell clean and presentable enough for work buddies to not notice.  you get dark, and i mean DARK with this.  if you are a beginner tanner i highly reccommend that you do not use this product until you are fairly tan without bronzers because this is a dha rich concoction which will look orangy on you if you are not already fairly dark (think full time in a medium bed no burning tan)  The silicones in the bottle are one of the best on the market thus far.  Its ridiculously moisturizing and wonderful feeling for like hours after tanning.    all in all, I reccommend this for tanners with a good base tan and a love for lotions :)  Cheers!</li>
            <li> Paint it Black works great! You see the results right away. It seems to last pretty good too and not fade away so quick. I plan on ordering it again.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was very excited to get this lotion.  I&#x27;ve used it several times now and it doesn&#x27;t do anything more for me than the cheap stuff I buy at the store.  It does smell good and goes on well.  I wouldn&#x27;t be rushing to buy this again.  I will try something different next time.</li>
            <li> Very good tanning lotion for an awesome price!</li>
            <li> Although I recieved this product quickly,I&#x27;m not satisfied with my purchase. I have used this lotion on several occasions and it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This lotion was okay. Not bad, but not good either. I was not a fan of the smell. It kind of smells like your run of the mill store bought tanning lotion. From other users reviews of this product I thought it would have smelled better. It has gotten me some color though and I was very pale to begin with. I would probably not repurchase it though.</li>
            <li> After one tan i was noticeably darker!!!! I have loved this brand for years and am never disappointed. Just glad I thought to look on Amazon and could get it on a discounted price!</li>
            <li> I think the best thing about this lotion is the price! I spent $70 on a lotion in the salon and got the same results. It smells really good, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, has NEVER stained my clothes(including my white shorts!), and i kept my color with it. The reason i say kept is because i started out tanning with the JWOWW Black Bronzer lotion for about 2 months(it didn&#x27;t get me darker or lighter...stayed consistent). I really recommend that lotion too, but you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the paint it black lotion.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY works. Doesn&#x27;t tingle and works fast</li>
            <li> For the price, I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I dont think it is the best tanning lotion ever, however, it still does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, this is one of the best smelling tanning lotions out there.&lt;br /&gt;Its not super intense, nor is it fruity or florally. The smell is kinda hard to explain, but its good and I think it is unisex.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS LOTION!!  This one is second lotion that I try since that, I&#x27;m hooked  my favorite ever. It gives my skin a golden tan. You only need a small amount and it does the job done .MILLENINUM products is the best. The smell is so light and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely recommend this to everyone that wants to get a golden tan.</li>
            <li> I was told to try this by a friend and I found it at a good price so why not. It does a good job at giving me more color than i was getting, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I feel like I have to tan every day instead of like every other day. but i&#x27;m a little darker than i was before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bottle of lotion about a month and a half ago. I use it about twice a week, and I am developing a nice tan. My skin tans relatively easily already though, and I wonder about how much it is actually helping me. When I purchased the bottle, the lotion seemed to be quite thin, and although it smelled the same as previous bottles I have used, I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder if they had put something in it to make it go further. It also did not come in its original packaging, presumably to save on shipping. It was a great price obviously, but it&#x27;s just something to think about...</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY FROM GREEN WEB.    I purchased Paint it Black from green web and I clearly received a fake, substituted product.    There was only a piece of scotch tape over the top of the bottle without any kind of seal around the top or between the bottle and the top.    After five sessions in a tanning booth using this product with little to no results, I decided to only put the lotion on certain parts of my body and the rest of my body was lotionless.  Guess what?  No difference between the two.      Green Web, in my opinion, is clearly selling fake or substituted lotion.  I emailed Amazon and Green Web complaining about the lack of a seal on the bottle and I got absolutely no response.    Maybe this lotion works well but just make sure you buy it from a reputable dealer as I clearly got a fake product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites! Works very well and smells amazing</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It smells good and works amazing. I used when I went tanning for a few months before spring break. I have a hard time getting tan since I have light skin but by the end I had a natural but dark tan. So if you have light skin then this should work for you. I even bought another bottle when after I used up the first one. I&#x27;m using it again so i&#x27;m tan before this spring break in vegas! Hope this helped</li>
            <li> I bought this product because at my gym there is a stand-up tanning bed.  I am at the gym almost everyday so using the tanning booth is pretty convenient.  My girlfriend uses it more than me and she loves it because she gets tan quickly.  I bought a whole bottle because it was priced well and would be cheaper than buying individual packets of lotion at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Best thing about it is the price. The tanning salon I go to seels the very same for 60.00 a bottle!! I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent tan &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry skin.  You don&#x27;t need to over apply, last long &amp; smells good.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for 13 years now and I have tried so many lotions.  This is definitely one of the best bronzers out there!  My skin does not tan easily but I was very pleased with the results, I think I broke through a plateau with this lotion.  Also it smells wonderful!  It is a fresh scent that smells good even after you tan.  You can NOT beat this price, $13 !!! Don&#x27;t let the tanning salons tell you that lotions sold online are fake, they are just trying to protect their main source of profit - if you buy from a reputable online store then you will get the real deal - I have been purchasing lotions online for years and have never gotten anything questionable.  As far as Millenium Paint it Black goes, I read the numerous positive reviews and decided to try it - and very glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week and haven&#x27;t notice much difference.. The scent is fine, got it at a great price here so not much lost I guess.  I want an accelerator not a bronser so much.</li>
            <li> Good tanning lotion, it is colored, so just a warning on getting it on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Get this lotion if you can find it at a cheap price. At the end of the day, all these lotions are over-priced hype. They hydrate your skin so that it is more receptiive to the UV rays that tan them.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for the first time ever yesterday and I love it!!! Others have noticed the difference after just one use. I can see an obvious difference no orange color or anything!! I normally use Bombshell by Designer Skin, but was willing to try some new things. I&#x27;m getting married this summer and wanted to make sure I could perfect my color before time so I&#x27;m not an orange bride!!! Would definitely use again!</li>
            <li> Works great, especially if you&#x27;re fairly hairy.  Thin enough it doesn&#x27;t club in your hair on your chest, arms or legs.  Best stuff I&#x27;ve found, even better than Designer Skin products,  and they&#x27;re good too, just doesn&#x27;t go on as well or get me dark as quickly as this does, and this is way cheaper!</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have used that wasn&#x27;t Designer Skin brand.  I had high hopes based on other reviews.  Based on the results it provided for my fair to medium skin tone, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again.  I&#x27;ve had better results with the Designer Skin brand and will be returning to those products now.  I didn&#x27;t want a builder but I was hoping for a little bit more boost with the \\&quot;50x\\&quot; bronzer.  Didn&#x27;t get it.  I used it at the end of last season and have been using it at the beginning of this one.  The results just have not been satisfactory on any level.  The best thing I can say about it is it smells good with almost no detectable scent afterwards and doesn&#x27;t make my Irish skin burn after 20 minutes in a regular bed.</li>
            <li> The stuff works wonders. I&#x27;m fair skinned and don&#x27;t tan. But when I use this and go to the tanning bed - I&#x27;m darker!! It really creates an even, beautiful tan. Something I&#x27;ve never had before! Everyone was asking me my secret. However, I don&#x27;t allow myself to tan anymore because tanning beds are very dangerous for your health. Now I use Loreal gradual color moisturizers. Nothing like Paint it Black...but at least it&#x27;s safe!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I bought two bottles, one for me and one for my sister. We both had been tanning for a few days before we received it and after the first time we used it we were soo much darker!  We both have light skin but my sister is lighter than I am. After she used it the first time she wasnt red at all! She had a nice tan glow after just one use! The price is amazing! A product like the purchased in a salon would  easily cost $30+. I also received it quicker then what I had expected which was awesome!  I will most likely be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product, but I always bought it at tanning salons. I took a chance and bought it online, and I am completely satisfied with the great service of the company that I bought it from. As a matter of fact, I bought another a week later and I&#x27;m getting ready to buy another from this same company. GREAT JOB!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion. I have used lotions from all different companies. Some have a weird smell, others flake off and crumble, this one does not. It&#x27;s very smooth and silky to the touch after tanning. It has a coconut fragrance, which I love as well. I have very fair skin and, while using this product I was able to achieve darker results faster than other lotions. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin like other lotions have in the past. I will definitely buy this lotion again! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting on my 2nd bottle to arrive, I&#x27;ve gone to the tanning bed every spring to prepare for summer and this has been my favorite lotion by far and the cheapest. I&#x27;ve always spent 50-70 dollars on tanning lotions but I got this one for less than 15.00 and I love the results. I absolutely love this lotion!</li>
            <li> definitely a great tanning lotion. i saw results the moment i used it. it smells good, feels good, and the only problem i had was that i burn, but that&#x27;s just my skin type, so of course it could be different for someone else. i&#x27;d definitely buy it again :)</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL.. IT WOULD COST ME 10X MORE AT THE TANNING SALON I GO TO.. I GOT TIRED OF PAYING SALON PRICES TO ONLY FIND OUT THE TANNING LOTION DIDNT EVEN WORK THAT WELL,, THIS WAS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS TANNING LOTION.WHEN I RUN OUT I WILL BE BUYING MORE FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could ever tan this fast! I have always burned before I tan, due to the red hair and freckles. This time, I got a deep bronze tan within two weeks. I am in love with this lotion. :) I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> Perfect tanning lotion for tanning beds at a fraction of the cost! Our daughter is in love with it so far!</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion. This is the first time my fair skin has ever been this dark. I have tried several different lotions, and this is definitely, by far, the very best. I saw some reviews where people complained about the smell. I think it smells fabulous before and after tanning. I can&#x27;t imagine any lotion working any better. I tanned for about seven days using a tingle lotion, then bought this. I noticed an immediate difference. So pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was leary of this product bc of the price/value! OMG....dont shy away , it is an amazing tanning lotion! works wonderfully! I have used several high dollar lotions over the years and this by far, is the best quality , not to mention the best PRICE!</li>
            <li> It gave me a great base tan, smells delicious, moisturize  really well as well. For the price is a great buy! The only thing I&#x27;m giving 4 starts instead of 5 is because the bottle is kinda hard to squeeze after 3-4 uses and especially towards the end, which makes the whole bottle a bit messy and slippery. I would love it 100% if had pump on it.. Now I&#x27;m considering of buying Black Storm as a next step and trying it out, but the bottle kinda makes me back off. I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice pump bottle of lotion, but cannot find any that&#x27;s on the same price range as the Millenium Brand.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to notice a difference after tanning with paint it black compared to others I have used but I think I have used others I liked better.  It does not smell bad compared to others.  I only tan once or twice a week so maybe if you use more often you would have better results.  It does not streak.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for two reasons, it had tons of good reviews and the price was reasonable enough that even if it was awful, I wouldn&#x27;t feel ripped off.  I love this lotion, everyone is shocked at how quickly I&#x27;m tanning, countless people said that if I didn&#x27;t go to a name brand tanning salon (Sun Tan City) then my results would be poor. But I still went to a locally owned little tanning salon, and with this lotion I&#x27;m Loving the results. Absolutely No orange hue to my tan at All, good even coverage, and it doesn&#x27;t smell half bad either :) I will buy this product again and again</li>
            <li> Good product if you have hit a plateau in tanning. A good lotion if you go tanning several times a week, not so good for someone who doesn&#x27;t go tanning very often.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and boom - it was at my doorstep.  This stuff is terrific!</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this last summer while I was beginning to tan for summer and I thought maybe I would give it a spipn again and I will def say NOT DISAPPOINTED! It doesn&#x27;t burn me like the other lotions with bronzers do and it&#x27;s good for outside use as well as tanning bed use although I saw better results with a tanning bed. I am Irish and burn very easily (1 hr in sun and I&#x27;m burned) this product helped give me the natural tan without turning orange or feeling like my skin is about to burn off my body. It smells great and goes on so smoothly too. I highly recommend this lotion. I just love it!</li>
            <li> I recently decided to step my tanning up a notch and went for Paint it Black. I loved my old lotion, so it had a tough go at winning my heart. It smells amazing! Its a nice, light sweet scent without smelling like youre giving the coconuts a run for their money or like an over fried churro when your 15 min are up. It leaves my skin soft and light. only (and minimal) complaints are that it leaves me slightly greasy in the unmentionable areas, which is nothing a quick shower cant fix, and that it doesnt seem to get me as dark as other reviewers said it could. Overall, I Couldnt have been any happier with my choice!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this lotion after reading all the positive reviews.... Only to be disappointed that my tan didnt last long at all. I was using it everyday religiously for a few weeks, &amp; in the shower i noticed my tan going down the drain :( I wouldnt purchase this lotion again &amp; the smell isnt all too shabby either.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I ordered and it was here the next day, Amazing service! It smells wonderful and works great. I absolutly love this lotion and would recommend it to everyone wanting a golden brown tan from the tanning salon with no streaking marks. Well worth the money and I am going to purchase my second bottle very soon. A+++++++</li>
            <li> Would I buy again, don&#x27;t think so.  I will keep looking for something that I love.  Sorry Black but it didn&#x27;t do nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I had great expectations for this lotion and wasn&#x27;t dissapointed. It goes on easy and blends right in, the smell is excellent and the tanning is unreal. One of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - so much less expensive than at the Salon.  Works great - I am getting the deep dark tan I was wanting!!!!!  Shipped very fast and would recommend to anyone!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Item was shipped fast.  Smell is good and lotion makes your skin feel smooth.  Better smelling by far from the old bronzers!</li>
            <li> Fast and very friendly customer service. I loved this product and will purchase again. They had lots of different products to choose from and at very good prices. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion! It certainly gets you bronze, and I am already very tan. Tans legs very well! this item is well worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> This stuff is in-credible. I&#x27;m fairly fair, I have some Irish back there somewhere in my family, but this stuff makes me look like Al Jolsen. I even noticed a change in the way I walk, like I have a little hiccup in my step! It looks really cool if someone&#x27;s playing some bass-type music, cuz I can strut like a pimp to it! Like I have my own superfly theme song. Anyway, this tanning product does that for you. It makes cool on the downlow or whatever. Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, so I&#x27;m not really the right person to be giving this review.  It was her request, so I would imagine she likes the tanning lotion?!</li>
            <li> The lotion is very liquidy, almost like water. It seems as if something was put into the bottle to replace the actual lotion.</li>
            <li> Works but stains clothing beware!!!!</li>
            <li> This product really helps getting a dark tan, and the smell is pleasant and not strong at all. When I finish the bottles I bought I will but this product again.</li>
            <li> Good seller I just Dont like the product.</li>
            <li> I have used many tanning lotions and can tell you first hand that this product is average at best. I&#x27;ll just automatically assume that whoever rates this at 5 stars is being motivated to do so by the low price. Out of about 6 different bronzers I have personally tried this one comes in last. That 50X on the bottle will lead you to believe that this is going to get you dark before your UV tan kicks in, well sorry but thats not going to happen. Is this better then using nothing a all? Yes it is. and if it was priced about 40% lower I would say that its a good deal but keep in mind that this is just average bronzer not any different than the free or cheap samples that they offer you at the tanning shops. If you want a bronzer that gives you a tan before you actually get a tan then your going to spend a little more but get lots more in return.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion for indoor tanning.    Much better price here than in the salon!</li>
            <li> Shipping was SO fast. I ordered on Friday afternoon and it arrived Sunday morning! I used this lotion today and the smell is amazing and it gave me very good color without being orange! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for quite sometime, usually three times a week and thought I was pretty dark.  I got to a point that I didn&#x27;t seem to see additional results.  After using Paint it Black 50X two times I saw amazing results.  I didn&#x27;t think I could get any darker but I was wrong.  This lotion made a big difference.  The fragrance is nice and not overpowering.  It makes your skin feel so smooth.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast ship time. The product does give one a GREAT tan. I am very fair and experienced fabulous results. The only thing I wish I could change about this lotion is the terrible smell. I thought maybe it was just me who didn&#x27;t like it, but my husband thinks it smells awful as well. Now I just have to shower and rinse off the lotion when I get home from tanning. Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read through the poor reviews and it seems most people only know about dha.   This lotion works great for me.  If I remember properly you are supposed to wear a bronzing lotion a minimum of 2 hours.  You don&#x27;t actually tan from any exposure somewhere around 24 hrs afterward.   Anyways you don&#x27;t lose a tan  in a session you lose the fake and unless you shed skin like a snake or itch like a crackhead you will not come out of a tanning bed lighter .  Don&#x27;t confuse the 2.  Now anyways, I read through the ingredients, it has an awesome ingredient in here that people pay a ton of money for in true skin care products.  I&#x27;m sure the people people that have used this lotion have noticed real antiaging effects.   I just wanted a cheap lotion to tan and was pleasantly surprised.   It works almost as good as the best skincare tanning lotion I have found and use.  The difference in price and this company uses more than a very light bronzer, should make this the best lotion for the money anywhere.  You may not know what I&#x27;m talking about because most tanning salons use the large company brands but if you think they are the best you are sorely mistaken.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this lotion.  She has been an avid tanner for quite some time and really enjoys this lotion.  She is going to definitely buy this one again....</li>
            <li> have only used this dark tanning lotion a few times but worked well when i did. smells decent too, not gross tanning aftersmell like others.</li>
            <li> This was my first lotion that I purchased here and the name really sold me. But it did not stand up to its name for me maybe good for someone else</li>
            <li> i got noticablly darker and it smells so good. and when you get out of the tanner, it smells like lotion instead of burnt skin [:</li>
            <li> It works great for the price better then the $60 at a tanning salon</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and love it! I had lost all my tan from last year so I wanted something to kick start my tan for this summer. I have used this 4 times this week and I am twice as dark already! I tan fairly easily but I have never tanned this quick in only 4 sessions in the tanning bed.I would absolutely urge anyone to get this that wants a great tan quick!</li>
            <li> I love this product so far! It goes on nice and smooth and does not make you smell weird after. Shipping was on time also.</li>
            <li> I always have a problem with some bronzers turning me orange. This is the absolute best I have ever used. I got dark in a few sessions and it lasted a long time. I recommend this product highly and I will definitely be purchasing it again. It leaves your skin silky smooth and smelling great. Thank you for an exceptional product!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT MAGIC PEOPLE. You will not see (or should want to see) results after one time. I have used this for about 3 times and I, the woman whose legs have always been see thru white are finally looking a golden tan color. I will keep using it but so far it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping too thanks guys!</li>
            <li> This is my second order for the Millenium Tanning \\&quot;Paint it Black\\&quot; 50x. My wife and I were impressed with the product on our first order compared to much more expensive tanning lotions so we ordered two bottles this time. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me which is more than I can say about the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried in the past. You can&#x27;t beat the price and it keeps us nice and golden brown.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s worked good. Smells good and quick color.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I used it twice and could see a difference.  Great value!!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I expected at a great price!  It smells great and feels amazing o your skin.  Also the name is very fun!</li>
            <li> This bronzer works wonders. I am a fair skinned person who gets burnt very easily. I have used this product indoor and outdoor tanning and both work great! I have gotten a few shades darker and I haven&#x27;t burnt! The smell is really good too!</li>
            <li> Already seeing results! Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Paint it Black is my FAVORITE lotion EVER. I usually stay tanned but haven&#x27;t been able to go to the tanning bed because of my classes and busy schedule (college kid). So since I lost most of my tan, I was looking for something to get it back and quick. I&#x27;ve used it twice and I am amazed. It didn&#x27;t get me too hot in the bed, the results came quick, and the price on Amazon compared to salon&#x27;s prices can&#x27;t be beat. You don&#x27;t stink when you get out of the bed either! I did a lot of research for the best lotion (probably more than necessary :  and this is what I came up with. I was right. I&#x27;ve never had a lotion do what this one has.</li>
            <li> i bought this as one of my bronzers in my lotion rotation.  i think the smell is just \\&quot;ok\\&quot; ... it&#x27;s weird and perfume-y in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the ATO is AWFUL!!! my boyfriend always knew when i&#x27;d go tanning because he could smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got a medium brown with this but it didn&#x27;t get me \\&quot;black\\&quot; like it suggests!</li>
            <li> Smells really good &amp; is very moisturizing. Doesn&#x27;t make you as dark as you would think. Also, the bottle was delivered unsealed so I&#x27;m skeptical on what this product actually is. I like it but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Granted, I am a new tanning salon user, so my opinion is perhaps a little slanted. But I tried this stuff, and after just a couple uses, I&#x27;m ready to throw the whole bottle away. Yes, it did increase my tan somewhat, BUT I think it responds badly to some skin types. For one, when you first put on the lotion it smells... okay. It&#x27;s greasy and sticky, and never feels like it really absorbs into the skin. But after my interval in the tanning booth, I literally smelled like I&#x27;d been working in a horse stall for the past hour. Disgusting! I&#x27;ve never had another lotion do that to me. Then it left this dusty residue that got on my clothes, and I spent the rest of the day coughing over that awful smell. I&#x27;m sure this stuff works for other people, but try to get a sample packet before you buy a whole bottle. If it reacts to your skin type like it did to mine... gag!  Paint it black? No thanks.</li>
            <li> Makes me dark I love the product doesn&#x27;t make you smell after !!! Will def buy again, and recommend for others</li>
            <li> I was recommended to buy &#x27;Paint it Black&#x27; by the women who own the tanning salon I go to because most of the employees that work there use it. I always used mostly Designer Skin products until I bought this Millennium product. I feel that Paint it Black gives me somewhat of color and extends my tan somewhat, but I have used tanning lotions that give me a lot better results in all aspects. From extending to color to nourishment to scent, I have used better lotions than this one. Its not terrible.. I have used a lot worse. I would recommend to spend your money on something else like \\&quot;Masquerade\\&quot;, \\&quot;Bombshell\\&quot; which is a tingle lotion, or \\&quot;Luminary\\&quot; Those are a few of my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great product Love the smell of the lotion to.</li>
            <li> i just started tanning 3 days ago and I&#x27;m already darker than i would be using another lotion. i am light skinned and usually have a hard time tanning, but i dont have any problems with tanning any more! buy this lotion, i will be buying another</li>
            <li> I used this on one leg, and nothing on the other.  The leg with nothing got darker....sad. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> When you first get out of the bed you look great, but it fades so quickly! My 3x bronzer (Hempology) works better and was much cheaper. Very disappointed, because I don&#x27;t normally spend this much on a lotion. HOWEVER, the silicone emulsion makes your skin feel awesome. Sometimes I layer this with a better bronzer just for the extra skin goodies.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion gave me a great overall coloring.  It remained dark in between tanning sessions and left a nice smooth texture to my skin.</li>
            <li> This product helped me get a great tan and quick. No orange effects from it. I used it 3-4 times and saw obvious results.</li>
            <li> Never got dark. But you get what you pay for. Spent a lil more on austrailian gold vintage gold and I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> Was looking for a lotion that would take me to the next level with a deep dark tan.  Did not get it with this product.  Got better results with a cheap beauty supply store product.  The after tan smell is horrible, but haven&#x27;t found a lotion yet that I like the smell of after I tan.</li>
            <li> I have used the product several times and have gotten quite a bit darker.  It does not take long to get there either.  I can tan 3 days in a row in a higher level bed and stay tanned for over two weeks before I start to fade.  I tan easy but I tend to lose my tan extremely fast.  I am pretty busy so it really works for me!</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Does what it should do!!!  Doesn&#x27;t have the best odor, but for the price it is excellent!!!  Def Recommend!!</li>
            <li> Lotion works well and smells good too! The lotion is not as thick as other tanning lotions I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and this lotion is works wonders for me. It has a very nice smell unlike other tanning lotions that can be overpowering. I had to use it a few times to get the results I wanted, but it was well worth it. I highly recommend washing your hands after application or you will get orange streaks in between your fingers. I like to pack wet wipes in my tanning bag and wipe my hands after I apply the lotion.</li>
            <li> I like this product! Definatly extends and darkens the tan. This is the first lotion I have used where I have noticed a difference right away. The only thing I would change a bit would be the smell. It&#x27;s not really bad, but could be better!</li>
            <li> I like the lotion, It has a really good scent. It didnt make me smell like burnt skin after the tanning bed. It was silky and smooth to apply. It did not leave streaks at all. Pretty decent Lotion for the price! I will def use again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year. im 21 and have been tanning since i was in high school. i have tried MANY different products, but this one is the best. I had stopped tanning for about the last 5 months. i just got really busy with college and didn&#x27;t have the time. Today makes a week tanning agin, not on a every day basis and the beds here are not even as good as my normal tanning salon and i am already dark!. it smells really good, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about that orange stain color between your fingers and toes! LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a very good moisturizer. It makes my skin feel very soft, however I cannot hardly stand the smell of it. I&#x27;m not really a fan of vanilla so maybe that is why. As far as color I believe that it helped me tan and not a fake color.</li>
            <li> Great scent, but not dark at all. I think I actually lost a couple shades while using this. NOT what I was hoping for at all.</li>
            <li> I love my Tanning lotion i was as dark as the color i wanted to be within a week!!!! &#x3D;) buy it you&#x27;ll love it too!!!!</li>
            <li> I am inlove with this tanning lotion. it smells soo good and it came ahead of schedule!! i also love the color it works very well</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It smells great and spreads easily. Iy absorbs quickly and has really accelerated my tanning process. I will be buying a few more bottles soon.</li>
            <li> I ideally never use tanning lotion but when I seen this and it said paint it black I new it had to of been good! I love it. Smells good, not that strong tanning lotion smell. I did burn the first time I used it but after that it left me feeling tan and wonderful</li>
            <li> i have to say i love the millenium tanning lotion. the 100x bronzer is my favorite &amp; i always have a bottle to use. the 50x is pretty good, but there&#x27;s not much difference in price, so go ahead &amp; get the 100x. this is a staple item for the hard core tan nut. i suggest using the 100x &amp; 60x &amp; you will be summer fun ready &amp; smell great. thumbs up!!!!</li>
            <li> Just bought this lotion about a week ago and I&#x27;ve only tanned 4 times with this lotion but I can alreay tell a huge difference. I use those little tanning stickers and wow I wish I could post a picture of the heart shape. Usually when I tan it takes me about 10 sessions to even be able to tell a small difference. But this stuff is AMAZING! The smell is ok but the texture is awesome. It&#x27;s not too thick and not too thin. So if you want fast results without frying yourself this lotion is the way to go. I&#x27;ll never use any other tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped super fast and was exactly what I wanted.. Thanks! A great seller</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion. It leaves my skin feel awesomely smooth. I like the scent, because it&#x27;s not as pi√±a coladish as the most of the tanning lotions. Even though it doesn&#x27;t give me the \\&quot;50X\\&quot; tan, I would still recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> No wonder this lotion is a best seller! Works almost immediately with long-lasting results! Has a GREAT smell, very light and tropical. Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes like most other tanning lotions. I would highly recommend if you want a natural, deep tan without a lot of work!</li>
            <li> Good bronzing lotion with a great scent. Just make sure it is dry before you put on your clothes because it will stain them.</li>
            <li> I have fairly light skin, but I can tan. Judging from the reviews I decided to go ahead and try this lotion. I did not notice myself getting any darker, and almost seemed to take longer then if I was to not use any lotion at all. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the lotion would occasionally give me hives. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The product works decent at first, but the color fades very quickly, even for a bronzer.  For $25, it&#x27;s okay... but I&#x27;m definitely glad I didn&#x27;t pay more.</li>
            <li> My product was just as I was told and the shipping was just as expected.</li>
            <li> Tried this after reading all the great reviews and after about six tanning sessions I have to say that it does not in any way enhance my tan (over and above normal outcome of a session without any lotion), it smells bad and I suspect it is a total ripoff.  I know that this should be taken with a huge grain of salt but the lady that owns the tanning salon I go to says any of the lotions you buy on-line are fraudulent.  I don&#x27;t know . . . I&#x27;m sure she prefers that people buy this stuff for fifty bucks from her . . . but I do know that it did nothing for me and the stuff I bought from her did make a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion smells great and works great too! You don&#x27;t have to worry about blending perfectly or else you&#x27;d have streaks like some other lotions.</li>
            <li> Perfect for that dark deep tan you are looking for and this stuff works fast!!!!</li>
            <li> Personally, this is the worst tanning lotion ive ever used.. I have used 40 or some lotions over the past 9 years.. and this has fallen to the bottom of the list (secondary to swedish beauty&#x27;s &#x27;Priceless&#x27;&#x3D; BAD BAD!) The lotion feels sticky and greasey even after tanning with it. It has an unpleasent smell too.  I saw absolutley no results when i used this product. The price is low, but you get what you pay for.. there are other products within $20.00- $30.00 that actually work.  I bought this bottle several months ago and used it probably 8 times before just throwing it away (half a bottle left) I wouldn&#x27;t even use it outside or as a moisturizer.. it just didnt work, and felt gross!! Keep on looking- there are better products out there! :)</li>
            <li> It made my skin 2 shades darker but all of a sudden it goes away within 2 days... very stange...</li>
            <li> Has no fragrance which is really good, really nice silicone smooth.  Good amount and the prices excellent.  Great product.  Running out of words for this review.  It makes me want to type of more and more and more</li>
            <li> II have fair skin and only go to the tanning bed three months out of the year, I have tried many lotions, and after reading the reviews I decided to try this lotion. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t turn my fair skin a weird color, and it smells nice!</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions, this by far has to be my favorite!</li>
            <li> Paint it Black is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! I was very pale when I first used the lotion &amp; have gotten MUCH darker than I would&#x27;ve normally with another lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, it goes on very smoothly &amp; absorbs very well!  The smell is wonderful!  I actually think it smells a little like warm vanilla sugar from bath &amp; body works.  The smell is very faint so it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you, &amp; I imagine guys would also enjoy using this lotion!  Great product, with a great amazon price means I&#x27;ll definitely order again! :)</li>
            <li> The title and appearance is misleading. This product did not make me tan at all! i was very disappointed. I am someone with an olive skin tone that tans easily, I also have tried many tanning lotions and this one by far has been the worst. Sorry for the bad review, the truth hurts.</li>
            <li> amazing glow with no orange tint!!! love love love!</li>
            <li> I like it done what it said but I liked black storm better order both used both I just got darker when I used BS</li>
            <li> I recieved the product very quickly and I thank the seller for that, however, I was not happy with the product at all!  I have a couple other indoor tanning lotions and this one did not even come close to the others I have been using.  It seems as though it blocks the bulbs!  I even sold one bottle (I purchased two) to a coworker of mine and after three uses she also went back to what she was using.  Not satified at all with the product but I don&#x27;t think it is the sellers fault.  I would definitely purchase from the seller again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will defnitely buy from Vita Supply from now on - I bought this item on June 9th and recieved it June 11th! That is amazing! Anyway, this lotion was so inexpensive! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. The lotion itself is really thick and goes on so smooth, your skin feels great before and after tanning. The scent isn&#x27;t too bad either. I definitely noticed immediate results... the only con really is if you use too much you can definitely tell; the lotion gives your skin a heavy, greasy feeling (I can feel my pores crying haha).</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate this product from PhotoTech. I bought this from a different seller a couple years ago and LOVED it....eh at I got this time had no bronzer in it at all, and I got ZERO color from it. Will not buy again, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it gets me a great tan. it took about a week to start sinking in and then it started developing. really like this product, smells great too.</li>
            <li> Great loving it!!! I got some good color after only using a few times</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion, gives a great bronze look and holds color a lot longer. Smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always concerned about if a bronzing tanning lotion will leave streaks.. This 1 didn&#x27;t! It is a great product! I&#x27;m already wanting more and I still have sum in my bottle. It left my skin feeling soft and not dryed out. It also smells really good and I loved walkin around smelling my arms haha.. I wud recommend this 2 ne1.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! My friend and I like to sit by the river and try to get our tan on and we were looking for something to enhance and extend our color that wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily or leave our skin orange. We have found it! It smells good and goes on just like any other moisturizer and the results are fast. After only two trips to the river, I&#x27;m darker than I was by the time the entire summer ended last year using oil. Definitely recommend and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I ordered mine may 3 and got it the next day if that&#x27;s not great service I don&#x27;t know Wat is. Anyway I love the product it gives me more color on top of my ran already and I&#x27;m a nice golden bronze. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t give you that burnt flesh smell like other lotions. Try it y wont be disappointed! ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge bronzer fan but I really loved this lotion, it gave me great color, was not orange at all. I saw a change in my color after two tans. It felt great one and left my skin smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have tried it and is shows not as much \\&quot;darkening\\&quot; and I was expecting...</li>
            <li> Love it! Made tanning in the sun so much easier.</li>
            <li> I gave this one star just because it smells alright, nothing special. I used this for a few months in high quality tanning beds, and it gave me no results! When I would buy a packet of tanning lotion by another company at the salon, I would get WAY more color than with this. This tanning lotion seems like nothing more than lotion. It did not accelerate my tan at all. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Got me a dark tan much quicker than using regular lotion alone. This is my first real tanning lotion so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. Will purchase from seller again. Very inexpensive tanning lotions!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was new to tanning, it was cheap, and it had about 175 raving reviews. First off, when I recieved this lotion mine smelled like bath &amp; body works coconut lime verbena &amp; when I&#x60;m finished tanning it smells faintly like burnt hair? &amp; i&#x60;m not a hairy person LOL. I&#x60;ve been using this lotion for about a month, it gives good results BUT i have to go tanning every other day to maintain my tan. &amp; I want to be even darker than what it makes me, so that means to achieve that, I would need to go tanning everyday. this is NOT what i want from a lotion. i don&#x60;t mind going 2-3 times a week but 4-6 times seems a little ridiculous. this does seem like a good product for the price, but i won&#x60;t be purchasing again. i rather spend more money and save my time.</li>
            <li> works as promised, and i am loving the quick tan.  I put it on before I mow the lawn and after the hard work I get to see a freshly mowed lawn and a tan.</li>
            <li> The wife had me order this for her, she seemed to like it, so that is all that matters to me</li>
            <li> this product worked great! i thought that the 50x bronzer would be too intense for me but it made my skin nice and dark and i didn&#x27;t burn. Wasn&#x27;t so dark to make it look like a fake tan and didn&#x27;t turn me orange. The extreme silicone made my skin so soft and smooth, really helped my skin look great!! love this lotion! never turning back to my old one!</li>
            <li> Works Great! Nice smell</li>
            <li> Works great! Don&#x27;t let the tanning salons fool you into thinking you have to buy a $50 lotion to achieve a great tan! I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I&#x27;m tan as they come! Skin feels great - and it smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Works decently think I&#x27;m ready for something stronger though</li>
            <li> I tried this out in a sample at a local tanning salon because I forgot my normal lotion.  It turned me bright orange!  I don&#x27;t have paper white skin, but I would consider myself on the pale side.  The smell was nice, but it took me two days to get the orange off my skin and to get my skin looking even again.  I would reccommend trying this out before you buy it if you have fair or light skin.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion was a great price, a steal in fact!  I love trying out new tanning lotions, it is an obsession of mine.  And the fact that it has a skull on it, great!  But, the first time I used it, I had to use about twice as much as other lotions.  It doesn&#x27;t spread very well, it just absorbed right in.  Then, for the next two days, I really had a problem with dry skin.  The bronzer gave okay color.  I still use the product on occasion, but now I know ahead of time that I need to lotion well before and after tanning.</li>
            <li> i have been going tanning for 10 years.... ive tried a lot of things... this lotion is terrible i wish i could give it less stars... i had been trying to figure out what that smell was for days... finally realized it was the after tan smell... it is digusting... smells like an old people home...  this lotion sucks... i actually had a nice base tan when i started using it... my tan is now much lighter... dont buy it... it stinks after and it sucks... they arent painting anything black with this garbage...</li>
            <li> good price, quick shipping. i have a feeling that this lotion may be a little old since  the bronzer didn&#x27;t stain my hands.</li>
            <li> I Hate the smell and I didn&#x27;t get results.&lt;br /&gt;-Experienced tanner</li>
            <li> Ok I wanted to purchase an inexpensive yet closest to high end quality tanning lotion. The tanning lotions (even with member discount)at my tanning salon are outragiously priced!!! So, I did my research and came across the Millenium Paint it Black as a highly rated tanning lotion. I came to Amazon, looked it up, and started reading the reviews. Most of the reviews were good. I was however still skeptical!!! Well let me tell you, I recieved it yesterday and I went tanning today, and OOOOOOWEEEEEE it is great!!! Believe ALL of the good  reviews, cause they&#x27;re 100% true LOL. I&#x27;m biracial, but I&#x27;m very fair, so I can tan really well, but if I don&#x27;t have a good lotion, my legs, WILL NOT tan.I had been tanning with  for 2 months and my legs were still pale as  ever. Well on my  way out of the tanning salon, one  of  the  girls that work there  said, \\&quot;man you&#x27;re really tan, you look great\\&quot;, I was delighted! Well I&#x27;m  not done, when I  got  home my hubby said, \\&quot;babe you look so tan  and  nice\\&quot;, (he likes me tan LOL) Anyhoo, I&#x27;m still not done. I picked my 16 year old  daughter up from school, and  she  said, \\&quot;Ooh mom you look really tan, I love it\\&quot;, and we all know 16 year olds rarely notice anything except their next text lol. Needless to say I love this tanning lotion! AND it smells great, before and after tanning. Oh and guess what...my legs are finally golden tan...NOT orange, no streaking at all...enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> This product smells really good, but I noticed no acceleration in my bronzing. I tan pretty easily and this really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Does what you need it to do, considerably cheaper here on Amazon then at your local tanning salon where it is 70.00 + easy... Smells okay, I switched to the 60x bronzer recently through the same manufacturer, smells better w/better results!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years and have used ALOT of lotions, but I have to say  this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> it works as a tanning lotion, very moisturizing, but i have used spellbound by designer skin with quadruple bronzer, and the immediate results are a lot better, i will probably buy that to use instead.</li>
            <li> I like this I just got to try it reccently and its got a good clean scent for those of you who dont like a strong smell it also has 50 bronzers in it soo it will make you super dark, the lotion itsself is like a light pinkish brown tone very light color but once you get it on and jump in your bed it WILL get darker!!! Just try it and see I am A TANNING addict and I give this lotion 5 stars for just being amazing like you cannot beat it for the price , I also think it makes your legs look ahhmazing!!!!! GO PAINT IT BLACK!</li>
            <li> I love the sugary, vanilla scent.  Its NOT greasy at all.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my tan and my skin - its darker and softer.  This is the best tanning lotion that I have ever used and I&#x27;ve been tanning for years!</li>
            <li> This made my tan last much longer than usual and enriched my tan. I LOVE it! It works extremely well. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of lotion this is by fare the worst. For the last month I have been using Worship me by Designer Skin. I decided to try a different lotion that had more bronzers in it. I used Paint it Black 4 times and actually saw my tan get lighter. Either this product doesnt have lots of bronzers or Millennium line of tanning lotions stinks. I have gotten darker using tanning lotions from cvs. Do not buy this product. I recommend using the Designer Skin line. This line is so much better.</li>
            <li> Got a great deal on this lotion, but didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of color....and was a little thin. Would be great for a beginner.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and I take forever to get any color. I used this lotion and I love it. I am noticably darker and people have complimented me on how tan I look. I only tan for 8 minutes at a time! I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another lotion. I am not crazy about the smell of the lotion but it isn&#x27;t horrible either.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because it had so many positive reviews and reasonably  priced. I&#x27;ve had it for a while and just used it again today, and it reminded me of why I like other lotions better. The consistency is nice enough and it goes on smooth. The smell (when you first put it on) reminds me of vanilla and spice. Not too girly a smell, I think it is kind of a unisex smell and a guy could probably use it. I hate the smell after tanning though, and I just can&#x27;t wait to shower. It works well enough that I will probably finish the bottle eventually, but I won&#x27;t get this again.</li>
            <li> Ive actually had this for quite a while but just recently started using it, I&#x27;m really light skinned and its made a huge difference for me as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> This product is good for tanning but would not pay $90 for product. If you can get it on sale I would get it. For $90 I should put it on and be tan, not have to go to the tanning bed lol!  Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> Smells okay in the bottle, the after-tan smell is awful!! Dried my skin and I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my color. Mind you, I like instant gratification (but who doesn&#x27;t) and this just isn&#x27;t the product for that. It took a few times to see any mild change. I will attempt to use the rest of this bottle to not waste, but I will for sure be going back to California Tan products!!!!! Glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much on this, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love Millenium Tanning products through Amazon, but if you are going to get Paint it Black, you can get their Black Storm for the same price through Amazon, and that is supposed to have slightly more bronzers.  If you&#x27;re looking for something much stronger in the Millenium Tanning line, then you can check out Pure Black.  A-Z Wholesale Tanning sells it through Amazon, but its not Amazon guaranteed yet.  The price is $27.99 atm, but Pure Black is supposed to be 100x as opposed to 50x or 60x bronzers.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing it soon to see how it compares, but honestly I&#x27;m kinda new to the whole tanning thing, and I have yet to try the entire Designer Skin line to compare these to, and they seem to be the most popular.  Overall, though, I&#x27;d say the Paint it Black and Black Storm work very well.  I live in Indiana, and I try to hit the tanning bed every day.  I don&#x27;t use the expensive ones, just regular or mini-Ultimate with Facials.  I use regular beds 2 days, then I hit a facial tanner one day, and I keep alternating at that rate unless there are none of one availabe, then I&#x27;ll just take what&#x27;s open.  I pay $27 for 30 days of tanning, so I mainly use that and these lotions, and I recently had to go to the doctor&#x27;s for something, and the nurse actually asked me if I&#x27;m mixed lol.  I&#x27;m 1/4 Irish, 1/4 English, and 1/2 Russian Jew, so I have a pale to olive complexion and I tan really well, but I&#x27;d say these lotions really make the difference when it comes down to it.  And the price difference from these as opposed to Designer Skin lotions is just too much for me to ignore, so I stick with Millenium Tanning.  I&#x27;m about to try a whole new routine where I&#x27;ll be using Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell 100x one day, Black Storm the next, and Millenium Tanning&#x27;s Black Night 60x the next, and then start over.  I read somewhere recently that switching lotions daily actually gives you a broader spectrum of coverage in tanning, and I&#x27;m hoping that the Bombshell 100x (which is a slight tingler,) will break my tanning plateau, and allow me to get REALLY dark.  I guess I&#x27;ll find out soon because I ordered them all through Amazon, and they&#x27;ve all been shipped.  Just waiting on their arrivals now.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is amazing! It has a wonderful scent, and I do notice a difference in my tanning. I am getting more color when I was at a plateau.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and was excited to use this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and...well, I&#x27;m pretty sure if I sat in a bathtub filled with coffee grindes I&#x27;d get a better tan than I&#x27;ve gotten from using this. All these \\&quot;AMAZING\\&quot; reviews ?!?!?! What the heck man? What I was expecting wasn&#x27;t at all what I got. I usually tan in the mornings so that my tan can sink in all day and I shower at night. Well, I put this on, tan, and when I shower..I swear the tan washes away with the lotion. It goes on very smoothly &amp; smells good but other than that, it was a waist of my 13 dollars!</li>
            <li> I bought both Paint it black and Black storm thinking id use the 50x bronzer first then move up to the 60x Black storm bronzer. Well they both work the same, except the Black storm smells better and I felt like the bronzer did work a hint better.(the bronzer is not very noticable). For the price, its good. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Really good. Doesn&#x27;t turn you orange.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell and it went on easily and smoothly. However, if it wasn&#x27;t rubbed in extremely well it would turn elbows and knees orange. The results were fast. I noticed a difference in my tan after the first use.</li>
            <li> I read that this stuff was amazing, and I like it, but I still feel like I was darker last summer using a different lotion.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say,I was pale white before the summer began.I work outside a lot on a hot days with a lot of sun,this stuff works great! A great price and brought me at least 4 - 5 tones darker in 2 weeks with 3 days a week use.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR TANNING BEDS</li>
            <li> Paint it black is a decent tanning lotion but I have used better for the price I paid.  Smells nice and has good consistency.   Doesn&#x27;t enhance tan much.  I&#x27;m light skinned so maybe it is just me.  Does prevent burning so that is a plus.  Won&#x27;t buy this tanning lotion again but a good try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion for a while but it reaches a point where you don&#x27;t get any darker and it does fade fairly quickly. I&#x27;ve used about three bottles of it now and I recently started trying new ones. I switched to denim and diamonds by swedish beauty, I personally like it a lot more. Paint it black is not a bad lotion for beginners though when trying to get a base tan.</li>
            <li> This lotion did not work good for me at all. I just got burnt in the tanning bed &amp; was only in there 8 minutes. I thought it was just me so I used it 3 more times &amp; just burnt again!!  I do tan very good, but this didn&#x27;t help me tan. I am not at all pleased with this &amp; would like to send it back &amp; get my money back!!!  I had to buy a tanning bed lotion at the place where I tan that cost $32.00.  Was not happy about this at all...</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I have ever used. Only one I will buy from now on.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product a little over a month ago after using Going Gaga for quite some time.  No negatives.  Smells great!  Have been passing it around at the family pool because everyone is very envious of my tan this year.  I will buy it again...</li>
            <li> I got this lotion thinking it&#x27;s gonna be great.  Well come to find out the person I bought it from sent me a old one.  The shelf life of lotions is about a year or so.  It has a weird smell and turned me some-what orange within the first use.  I Garantee they sent a really old bottle.  It had scotch tape on the top of the lid to hold it on.  I will not be buying from this seller again.  What a rip off!  I don&#x27;t think the lotion would be bad if it was a recent bottle.</li>
            <li> i just started tanning again indoors for the  first time in years.  this stuff works awesome.  i got compliments the first day i was using it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice so far and while I didn&#x27;t notice any results after the end of the first day, after the second day of using this product, I am definitely and significantly darker than I was when I woke up this morning. The tan is also even and smooth, not blotchy, and the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave behind an orange tint like so many other tanning products. Both times, I spent about 2 hours outside by the pool. So far, I would recommend this product. After reading a few other user&#x27;s unhappy reviews, I also recommend buying this directly from Amazon and not from a third-party seller, because like those buyers, I have been seriously disappointed with the quality of cosmetics and other items bought from third-party sellers on Amazon. Now I make a point of buying directly from Amazon and I&#x27;m usually very satisfied with all of my purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a few things you should know. While I look fair-skinned, one side of my family was Mediterranean - so even as a child, I never got any sunburns, and there was no such thing as sunscreen back in the day. I mention this only to explain that your results as a light-skinned person using this product might be very different. There&#x27;s a huge difference in skin tones between a fair-skinned Mediterranean and a fair-skinned Irish person. If you&#x27;re one of those people who turn beet red in the sun, then you might want to be careful using this product or just use it one one arm first and test out the results.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product. I used it for 3 weeks and still could not tell i was any darker. I usually use designer skin black 20x and i cant wait to order another bottle of that! I wasted my money. I would not recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Love it and got here quick!</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this lotion! I&#x27;ve had the hardest time getting my arms to tan and catch up with the rest of my body, I started using Pain it Black the day it came in the mail and after only using it a week my arms have fully caught up with the rest of my body and are actually getting darker! Another benifit of Paint it Black is that it doesn&#x27;t have that tale tale smell of tanning beds, it has a suttle fresh scent to it! I am planning on purchasing more when I have finished this bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth. Feels dry to the touch, not greasy. Major plus for me! Overall, it smells good (vanilla-y).This was a great product for the price. I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
            <li> Love the smell! It smells like faint vanilla. Great even bronzing, too. I use it every summer when I go tanning. I let my boyfriend try it and now he uses it!</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the fine print well enough, but I purchased this product under the impression that it in itself would give me a fake tan. However, it&#x27;s basically just like a tanning oil that enhances a tan you would get in a tanning bed/out in the sun. Maybe it&#x27;s my fault for not reading carefully enough, but I saw it in the self-tanner section and I just sort of assumed that was what it was. I returned it right when I realized and am still waiting for my refund.</li>
            <li> perfect for outside tanning in the sun too. my results were amazing after 2 days of use, no streaking. I&#x27;ve recommended this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Meh-- didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Amazing for the price!!! Works great I already am tan and see results! You would pay triple the price for this at the store!!! Great purchase!! Highly recommend if you need basic lotion for the tanning bed!</li>
            <li> I really liked this tanning lotion, it gave me that nice glowed tan that I love. I thought that it smelled great too.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It gives me a good color &amp; I don&#x27;t get red, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make me stink after tanning like some other lotions do.</li>
            <li> I read through almost all the reviews for several different tanning lotions listed on Amazon. I chose this lotion because of the positive reviews and the reasonable price. I have almost used the whole bottle, (only because I don&#x27;t like to waste anything) and my tanning results are not impressive. I have used Wal-Mart lotions with better results. I tan at least 3 times a week during the spring and summer, and have done so for about 8 years. I would not recommend this lotion to anyone, ever. It also smells horrible afterwards. Tanning makes you smell bad anyway, but this lotion made me embarassed to have to go anywhere after I was finished tanning. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion! It goes on so smoothly and easily and it really did help darken me fast. I will likely buy this again when I run out. Also, the smell is really good. More fruit smoothie than coconut and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Okay I got this based on all the good reviews and now I feel some must be planted. I tried this thinking it would work like Swedish Beauty but it doesn&#x27;t. It just doesn&#x27;t compare and it does nothing, no tingle nothing ! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.!!!</li>
            <li> Paint It Black works best as a tanning enhancer, in the tanning bed or the sun. It smells fabulous and moisturizer great! This didn&#x27;t seem to work as strictly a self tanner but it worked great in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.  The bronzer really does its job and the silicon additives are just an extra bonus!!!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! It gets you dark really quick and that to me is a good thing. This is the seconded time I have bought this lotion. Great price and fast shipping!!  GREAT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> I am really fair skinned and for my tan to be even and not blotchy, I have to use something w/ a bronzer.  This product is really good and does what it says.  My skin was softer, and my tan was even and not streaky. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I wished this would have worked for me like everyone else. Sadly, it broke my chest out really bad and had no bronzing effect for me.</li>
            <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  As soon as I got it in the mail I opened up the cap and smelled it.  I don&#x27;t know what other people are smelling but mine had a weird sort of menthol smell to it and I was automatically turned off.  It&#x27;s average lotion and I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> I read review after review of this and thought o yeah...so I had the girls at my tanning place order some packets...it stinks for one..and for two im getting LIGHTER from using this!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Its a great lotion and smells good and works well. I haven&#x27;t used it that much but I&#x27;ve noticed that it takes a lot of lotion in order to spread around your body. I haven&#x27;t tanned but few times and I noticed that I only have like 80% of the bottle left. Im planning on buying another but it goes quick for heavy tanners.</li>
            <li> Im halfway done with my 1st bottle &amp; needed to order another so I wouldnt run out so I ordered 2 so i would get free super saver shipping. After just 3 tans I noticed a considerable difference in my skin color. Its a deep natural bronze. Not orangy at all. Everyone compliments me on my color, I also work out in the yard a lot &amp; after reading these other reviews am going to use it while doing that as well. Its super soft, leaves your skin silky all day long. Also smells good. Its a wonderful value for the money. I was worried about it staining my clothes since Ive never used a bronzer but it does not at all. Defintely recommend!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00147FGJ8 Millenium Tanning New Paint It Black Auto-darkening Dark Tanning Lotion, 50X, 13.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been tanning for a lot of years now, indoors and out so I have tried them all, cheap runny ones, tingling ones to the ultra high priced ones. I needed some new lotion this year and picked this one based on reviews and of course price. I live in Michigan and only tan for 1 month between April and May. I went one time so far this year, used this lotion and just after one time, 10 minutes in a stand up, I have a tan. People at work were like \\&quot;Wow! How did you get a tan already!\\&quot; So I am very happy as it worked this good after one 10 minute session I should be good to go from here on out.</li>
            <li> And the \\&quot;idiot of the year\\&quot; award goes to me! For buying this product!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. I usually use just plain old Banana Boat or Hawaiian Tropic oils. I have found that I like Arizona Sun as well but its a bit more expensive than the others and I have to order it online. Regardless, all three give me nice brown skin. I was doing some research on why my face doesn&#x27;t tan as well as the rest of me and in looking for face tanners, I came across this.  Auto-darkening you say? Deep bronzing you say? Well, you lie.  As with the face tanner, I got less color than I would with nothing on.  Save your money and stick with the tried and true drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion because I ran out of the Black Storm 60X Extreme Silicone Bronzer I was using and wanted to try something similar in style and price point. This lotion is a great value, if you&#x27;re looking for an effective indoor tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot but still gets the job done. It has a nice scent and I have been really nice color since I started using it. I recommend it highly and will probably re-up when I run out.</li>
            <li> skin feels really soft after tanning, it smells good also, but although i&#x27;m already pretty tanned, i still burned and after few times. i still don&#x27;t see any better tan than before when i wasn&#x27;t using it</li>
            <li> i usually reach a tanning platuae but since ive been using paint it black ive been getting darker and darker.&lt;br /&gt;great smell great price why not? salon prices are a rip off! i&#x27;d def recommend this product to friends. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of lotions and this one is probably the best.&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY TANNING!</li>
            <li> didnt get as dark as thought hubby was relieved especally because of the name  I wasnt all that happy but I did get a little darker</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t believe people when they say that there was absolutely no post-tanning bed scent thanks to the lotion. Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- it does smell nice during the application, and the after smell certainly was more pleasant. But don&#x27;t try to go tanning and then go on with your day thinking that you won&#x27;t be a little fragrant.     That being said, I will most definitely be buying Paint it Black again. I&#x27;m very happy with the texture, thanks to the silicone, and my skin still feels soft after my tanning session. And the price is great, too! Less than $15.00 for a quality tanning product?? You cannot find that anywhere else. I highly recommend this to any price-savvy tanner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still doing my own investigation to see if the product is same lotion you would purchase from a tanning salon....just being a sceptic.</li>
            <li> My skin is so light I could glow in the dark, but this lotion has gotten me dark so quick, and leaves my skin soft. I have never had a lotion work this well before.</li>
            <li> This lotion does exactly what the company says it will! I have recently begun tanning indoors and this lotions is the key to my beautiful dark tan. I get results no matter what level bed I use, but the results are maximized when I use it on the higher level beds. I ordered a bottle a month ago and have just ordered two more so i can give as gifts!</li>
            <li> I have tried many many tanning lotions, and this one gives you a great tan, but fades quickly. The smell reminds me of a stinky vanilla cigar. I have to shower immediately after tanning. Would not recommend this product if you are wanting a lasting tan.</li>
            <li> Theres a reason its only $13.00 The bronzers are not effective in this lotion. I have been tanning for 6 plus years and tryed many. Designer Skin makes some good lotion, go with there&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> my friend introduced me to this. i love it, i use it both at the beach and at a tanning salon. if you are familiar with bath and body works it smells like warm vanilla sugar lotion.</li>
            <li> for the cost this stuff is amazing! deff. going to be purchasing it again!! really recomend it if you want a dark tan fast!</li>
            <li> Love it for getting a good summer tan I&#x27;ve used it for a couple years now really like it much thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big time tanner, but this seams to be one of the best lotions I have used. The product doesn&#x27;t not stink and rubs in very well. You can feel the difference between this product and another. You can feel then tan coming on.</li>
            <li> This is better then the 100x, the 100x makes you orange due to the bronzing in it, this one just gives nice tan and a great scent.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this lotion would meet my expectations because the price is great and lots of people seem to be having good results. Unfortunately, this lotion didn&#x27;t make the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and in new condition. I have used it twice but the smell is so bad afterwards that I choose to shower (and as I read in other reviews..the color --bronzers-- DO run off...turning the water tann-ish). I&#x27;m not getting any more tan than I would have been without the lotion. With other lotions and without, I can stand the after-tan smell. This one isn&#x27;t okay. Using less didn&#x27;t ease up the smell either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will spend the extra $15 on Black20x which I have had better results with on previous occasions. At least I won&#x27;t have to worry about smelling bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that does tans very often.  It was hard for me to find a product that did not smell like a girl -- this works great!  Much cheaper on Amazon vs purchasing at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and provides a dark tan. Great value!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Dark tan.</li>
            <li> It has a nice coconut smell to it and also good about keeping your skin moist and not oily like most tan lotions</li>
            <li> I am inlove with this lotion. I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the best one yet! It&#x27;s cheap and it makes me so dark. I&#x27;m super white and this makes me look as if I&#x27;ve been to the beach. I love this. This is my 5th purchase of this and I stock up when I can. I have 3 bottles at home! :) Best Lotion Ever!</li>
            <li> I bought the Paint it Black Tanning lotion and I wasnt impressed at all. I bought from green web and not sure if its the actual company or the tanning lotion itself. From the many many reviews Ive read Paint it Black is suppose to stain your hands because of the 50x bronzer but that wasnt the case at all.  I have fair soft skin and I was surprised at how watery this product was and how light the color of the lotion seemed. If anyone else whom purchased this lotion and recieved great results can you send me a video of its consistency because Im almost certain Im not recieving the same lotion as everyone else.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this stuff! It literally made me so tan the first time I used it. Love the smell of it too! Fast shipping I got it the next day! I will be putting in an order in once I am close to finishing the one that I have now!</li>
            <li> The lotion did not meet my expectations, Within in 7 days of use I saw no improved color, would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing! Didn&#x27;t work at all used for a month and nothing!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product but no sun screen got really dark</li>
            <li> Crazy fast shipping! Smells great!! It&#x27;s a tanning product!! What do you expect for it to smell like fresh linens!?? It smells like vanilla! Deep dark and beautiful</li>
            <li> Received my shipment two days after I ordered from Amazon (Not Green Web, I saw many negative reviews). My bottle was neatly and safely packaged in a bag within a box. This was a very great deal, I think I paid about $26 for the lotion plus two day shipping. (I&#x27;m in a hurry to get tan!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it TWICE on a level one, BASIC bed, and I already have color! I have not burned at all, even after I started off at 11 minutes, and my skin is moisturized very well after I lay in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular lotion is a bronzer, so it does not have the tingle factor (not a fan of tingle factors!!). The bronzer, however, does not leave orange or brown streak marks around your knees or elbows. I have also noticed it does not leave bronzer residue on my palms or in between my fingers, like alot of self tanners or bronzers will do. The smell with this lotion is great too, with a very fresh, clean smell. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this from now on, simply because this product WORKS and I can&#x27;t believe the results after two days! My mom is also a believer, and will be purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Loved Paint it Black 50X. Seen great results in only a few days. Haved used this kind of lotion for the past year or two and now am addicted to it. Definatly recommended for anyone who wants fast results and beautiful tanned skin!</li>
            <li> WOW! For $15 this is a STEAL!  Smells great and works great!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> i bought and tried this, once i went in water, my skin was all gooey and slippery and i looked like a shedding lizard, guessing this product is mostly for tanning bed, if your in the sun and laying on raft in pool, i would highly recommend Austalian Gold bronzing dry oil spray intensifier with color boost maximizer, for a great great tan,</li>
            <li> This product has a ncool bottle, and for so cheap It was a good buy.  The lotion left my skin very soft, and the after tan smell did not last as long as what I noticed from previous lotions i&#x27;ve used.  Overall a good product, but I think if I could re do it I&#x27;d spent a bit more money &amp; get a different product.</li>
            <li> Its OK not what I expected when I read all the other reviews it sounded good , but it could have been better. Won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells all my favorite indoor tanning lotions at the best prices. I have been indoor tanning for almost 20 years and never found prices anywhere like these. And the products are always new and packaging is always professional. This is a very popular auto tanning lotion, which gives a deep, dark, rich tan and the scent is great!</li>
            <li> I didnt expect this product to tan my skin so quickly because of its relatively inexpensive price, but I was wrong. This product&#x27;s value far exceeds its price, I definitely recommend it! It also smells great!</li>
            <li> I just decided to go to tanning salon since spring is at the corner and i bought this stuff too boost the tanning progress a little bit. But after just a couple of times, I decided to stop using it and considering throwing it away. It IS a tanning lotion so i did get a bit tanner. Though, i don&#x27;t like the smell when i apply it on my skin and it feels greasy and heavy. I cannot wear my clothes until 10 minutes later because i feel like my skin is not absorbing it at all. So basically, after a tanning session with this product. I feel smelly and greasy and i don&#x27;t feel comfortable at all. I&#x27;m sure some people may like the smell or don&#x27;t mind that heavy texture of the lotion. (maybe for dry skin?) But i think you just test it out before you get the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> this product smells like warm vanilla sugar! it goes on smooth and helps keep you moisturized while tanning. 50X bronzers seems a little much to believe, there is no self tint added to your skin.</li>
            <li> The price is wonderful, but as far as quality, it&#x27;s not worth it. It has an extremely wonderful, silky smooth feel - but it actually broke me out on my chest and around the back of my neck and shoulders. It also smells fairly good and doesn&#x27;t leave a terrible smell after you&#x27;re done tanning. The only thing is - I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m getting dark at all. It had good reviews here on Amazon and it was a great price - but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I should have spent a little more and got a lotion that I knew would work.</li>
            <li> maybe it was just me they didn&#x27;t seem to get me any darker than the stuff I was using before</li>
            <li> Pretty good like it !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and smells good to :))</li>
            <li> I really like this tanning lotion!!  Does a great job!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell is great! But it didn&#x27;t have enough bronzes for me</li>
            <li> product is a great value for the money!!  seems to be the real deal salons charge way too much for tanning products definatly recomend!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, it has an awesome tint/smell to it and does not turn your skin orange like many other bronzing tanning lotions. I use this every time I go tanning :)!</li>
            <li> Iv been using this tanning lotion for months now! I love it! It doesnt make you supper tan real quick but still works great quick, it took me about a week of going everyday to get a great tan started. The smell is great (every time I go tanning and come home my bf tells me how great I smell) Its not to sticky, its prob more sticky on me because I use alot most of the time when I go, you do not need to use much at all but I do. Every time I order this lotion I get between 2-5 bottles and always will. The price of 5 bottles here is the same as 1 bottle at my tanning place and this works better then most of the stuff iv tried there. I will always buy this lotion! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Turned my hands orange. Smells okay. Nothing special. Definitely didn&#x27;t give me any amazing results. You&#x27;re better off spending more money on a better lotion.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin, and this lotion works great! The smell is amazing and is very subtle. There is virtually no ato. I noticed color after the first time using it. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The #1 reason I love this tanning lotion is because even though it has bronzers it does not stain your skin at all. It also does not leave a dirty bronzer film like some bronzing tanners I have used in the past. The smell is pleasant and it isnt greasy at all. I dont think it necessairly has tanned me better than others I have used, but it has given me a very nice even brown tone that I love. I&#x27;ve now ordered this multiple times from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lotion smells awesome, but I&#x27;m figuring out that bronzers just don&#x27;t work with my skin. So, for me, it was a waste.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion and I use a tanning bed. Better results with this lotion than any other I have tried. Skin does not dry out. Lovely tan. Way more lotion and bang for your buck. Highly recommend it! Order was on time and I am supremely ecstatically pleased. Thank you! Love the smell too! Will for sure buy again :-D</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is the best that I&#x27;ve ever used!  I used it in the tanning bed and gradually got darker &amp; darker, and I&#x27;m a pale person.  Then, I went to the beach for a week and used it there, and I turned dark brown!!  I got so many compliments on my tan, and I&#x27;ve never been that dark in my life.  I highly, highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this to get a quick tan and that I did....I have only used it 3 times and have a tan line....yea</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion! Gets ya dark quick!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a tanning lotion you just put on and it tans you.  Not a lotion you put on and use the sun to darken.  It&#x27;s a nice lotion, but didn&#x27;t darken the skin to give you a tan.  Also did not leave orange color like some tanners do.  I wanted a darkening lotion that just tsns without sun.  This is not it.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a strong scent. It works pretty nice. Helps give a natural looking tan. I like it and would recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! really helps my skin turn nice pecan brown:) smells good too!</li>
            <li> ive been using this product for a month now and still haven&#x27;t noticed a difference....but it smells nice</li>
            <li> Gave it 5 stars because it  does get your fricken dark! I had been to the tanning bed only twice before this arrived &amp; was just seeing some results. My third time this year I used this &amp; holy crap it got me dark. My only dislike is which so much bronzer it it will stain your hands &amp; give uneven look if not spread out well &amp;  get wiped off your hands ASAP. It did stain my hands, elbows &amp; knees but I did it to even out without any problems. If you want to have a great dark color quick this is for you. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I tan at planet fitness after my workouts and always use this tanning lotion. Their tanning beds don&#x27;t have high power and adjustable levels so you almost need to have a tanning lotion if you want to get darker faster. Smells like vanilla and goes on easy. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and leaves me with an even tan every time :) will be purchasing again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale person that got tired of looking at her veins through her skin. This stuff works really well for me and I&#x27;m now looking a nice tan color! Good price and I&#x27;ll buy it again once I run out. I think it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not sure if we didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;real\\&quot; thing, but the bronzers did nothing.  Worship Me by Designer Skin produced great results. I thought this was supposed to be great tanning lotion, but have been pretty disappointed.  The smell is good, but it just didn&#x27;t produce good results.  Again, the problem could have been that I didn&#x27;t get the real stuff.  The bottle was not sealed, but are any of them?  When I&#x27;ve bought lotion in the salons at double the price, they aren&#x27;t sealed either. My family will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and I actually acidently bought two and boy was I glad I did. I love this lotion and it was here the next day!</li>
            <li> All my clients have loved this lotion. It has a great instant tan with bronzers that don&#x27;t turn you orange!</li>
            <li> Liked how light the lotion is and doesn&#x27;t have the normal tanning lotion smell but expected way more for a product that was selected as #2 of Top 10 Best tanning lotions. Expected better results. I&#x27;ve been using for almost a month and I&#x27;m just now as dark as I usually get after a week or 2 of tanning with other products. Would not recommend and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product was worth the money. I did intend on getting so much darker than I am but I am only going 2-3 times a week. It does leave my skin soft and the scent is nice. My tan is noticable, I have gotten several comments on my skin color so I know it works. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this lotion at all..well..besides it feeling good on my skin due to the silicone..smells horrible and I only use it now if i&#x27;m mixing it with another lotion. Seller was great though.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st time using a tanning lotion. I used to &amp;#34;dry tan&amp;#34; which only led to my tan literally flaking off. This product worked fast and left me with a &amp;#34;deep tan&amp;#34; that doesn&#x27;t come off when I shave my legs!</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion every used</li>
            <li> I first came across this lotion from a client in the tanning salon I work at . I bought some and totally loved it! Our salon cant get it for that price. I tell my clients about it, and i myself have  gotten 5 bottles from here, for friends and myself. Im the darkest I have ever been the results are just awesome. Deliver time is super quick 3 day max.</li>
            <li> So far it has been great. I am actually liking it as much if not better than jwow. Would recommend for sure! Also great smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It also enhanced my tan when I already had one. The smell was Great as well.!!</li>
            <li> after reading all the wonderful reviews and searching for a product with a high bronzing factor,i ordered this product.  IT SUCKS!  there are no bronzers in it, it does NOTHING!  i used the product on half my body, left the other half naked and tanned several times:  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE. DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok. I know I wont buy it again. I personally dont like the smell.</li>
            <li> i tanned 2-3 times before this product, (every other day i tan). i made sure i rubbed it in really good until dry but didnt have a chance to wash my hands!!! :/&lt;br /&gt;results - 5 stars. i deff saw results waaaaaaay better than without it. and noticeably darker. only tanned for 10min just to see and also NO problems with my hands. all i had available was to wipe them off as good as i could on the wash cloth. BONUS no problems no streaks, no orange or discolored palms so thats a BONUS to me :)&lt;br /&gt;-would deff buy again :)</li>
            <li> Ive used numerous tanning lotions, i found that snooki&#x27;s line works best for me. I bought this to try after I was already tan and i didnt see results, maybe because i am already so tan to begin with. I like that it doesnt leave a &amp;#34;burnt skin&amp;#34; smell afterwards.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no tanning in this product.  It is a rather thin lotion that has no desiccative fragrance.  I do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found. Every time I try something else I&#x27;m let down and end up coming back to this.</li>
            <li> The tanning lotion is great!!! I would recommend it to everybody that loves Great Tanning Lotion!!!</li>
            <li> This works fairly well, but I think I had better results with the 100X. The bottle I received was a bit scratched up, and there was no safety seal - not sure if it had previously been opened and returned.</li>
            <li> the lotion for tanning bed paint it black is wonderful it get you really dark,within 2 session (wow)   and its good for your skin i would recommend this product to everyone that tans (indoor) so pick ur up today and you wont regret it !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years now and Amazon sells it for a lot less than the tanning salons in my town. This lotion has bronzers in it for a quicker tan but also, since they are bronzers they wear off w/o continued use. It smells great and leaves my skin very soft. I won&#x27;t be switching any time soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! i have used many lotions before and none have worked as well as this one! after tanning only twice and using the lotion i have a good tan! i love getting my tan on, and this lotion allows me to do just that! to the creators...score!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. It has a fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t turn into that \\&quot;tanning bed smell\\&quot; and works well!! Thanks! I will be ordering this product again!</li>
            <li> It does help get me dark pretty quickly,even in level 1 and level 2 beds. For the price you just can&#x27;t beat it. I really like the fact that there isn&#x27;t a terrible after tan smell like a lot of other tanning lotions have.</li>
            <li> i take this to the gym with me. i used to take frequently to get a dark color tan, but now i tan less frequently becuase thi slotion give me awesome long lasting color  and great smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Great shipping speed and came perfectly. The lotion has a strong smell but it&#x27;s manageable and not to bad. It hasn&#x27;t done much for me when it comes to bronzing.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I read that someone used this outside and decided to try it because I don&#x27;t really care for tanning beds. It smells good and rubs in just like lotion. I got a nice tan in a short period of time. I will definitely continue to use this product for my outdoor tanning needs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> Great smell and good results</li>
            <li> great lotion and a lot cheaper than the salons! I have fair skin and this helped me get a nice tan without burning! I was using a cheap Walmart lotion before I got this and I was amazed at the diff after just 2 tanning sessions. I haven&#x27;t tried using in just the sun yet but image it would work just as well. the smell is ok, ive smelled better but its not bad. its a vanilla type smell. I personally just don&#x27;t like the smell of vanilla anything.lol  it arrived on time but wasn&#x27;t sealed or wrapped in anything. which when u buy at the salon it wouldn&#x27;t be sealed either. I ordered thru prime and it said sold and fulfilled by amazon so just checked my bottle soon as it came in to make sure it was legit and it was.  this is the only place I will buy tanning lotion from now on! try it u will love it!! so happy not to be stuck wearing blue jeans all summer bc of my pale white legs! finally have nice tan!!</li>
            <li> love it. Was very good lotion and gets you dark quick without the tingle. I hate those kinds. I would deff reccommend this.</li>
            <li> Such a smooth formula. Works just as expected, I just wish it contained a tiny bit of spf to ensure I don&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever. I have never gotten this dark without a tanning bed. I plan on ordering more of this. Definetly worth the money</li>
            <li> Perfect will order again</li>
            <li> moisturizes and provides a nice bronze color. Non greasy and also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner and have worked at a tanning salon for many years. After just one use of this lotion I became shades darker. I highly recommend this to anyone that already has a base tan.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a product different than Australian Gold since they&#x27;re so expensive.. I was not too thrilled with this. It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest and it smells even worse after I tan. Not a fan. Also doesn&#x27;t give me a good tan. Back to Austrialian Gold products I go!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles. I think  it is fantastic. It gives you a quick tan look. I dont see a expiration date on bottle but its working fine. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this tanning lotion because I was already using back in blaque (which is also awesome) and she said it will give my tan an instant boost. So the first day I tried it I was very happy, so then the next day I put the paint it black on about 15 minutes prior to tanning and then right before i got in the bed i put on the back in blaque and WOW talk about being tan! I looked amazing, and the best part was, was that I was NOT orange! Great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far so great! The lotion is light an not heavy, with no horrible smell to it. Had no problems with shipping or receiving my package. Lotion is great and with the silicone makes your skin smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought the Paint it Black and I am certainly not impressed. I work in a tanning salon and have used many products with alot less amount of bronzers and have recieved much better color. Also is says silicone but i could not even find a hint of silicone in the product, I found that it went on greasy like a cream lotion.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! My skin is allergic to many lotions - not this one. And the tan is fantastic natural and the price is unbelievable inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The color with this bronzer is good, but it leaves my skin dryer than other bronzers.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten darker then I was with Paint it black 50X. This tanning lotion also gives me more moisturization then a bottle of hempz.. sometimes I just put it on for that alone. I swear by this stuff!</li>
            <li> For $18.95 you can&#x27;t get a better lotion! The lotion isn&#x27;t heavy; but it is a tad greasy when you first put it on. When you tan it absorbs into your skin so when you leave the bed/hex the silicone leaves your skin silky smooth and not greasy. It gives you a deep dark tan. The affects of the lotion will last for around 2 days; so it is safe to tan every other day. This lotion gets 5 stars from me because it is super inexpensive ($18.95) and it gives good results.   I would NOT however purchase this lotion at full retail. If it were $100 I would give it 3.5-4 stars because there are better lotions you can get for the price.</li>
            <li> Paint It Black 50X Extreme Silicone Auto Darkening Tanning Lotion 13.5 oz   is a great product you see results after your first tanning sesion and is also a great after tanning mositerizer. i will be purchasing this product again</li>
            <li> Smells good, works great. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> A bit about me: I having been tanning on and off for 8 years. When I do not tan I have very pale skin. I just started tanning again after losing all of my color from 6 months ago, so I am currently pale. I have tried many tanning lotions, and being an impatient person I LOVE strong bronzing tanning lotions, and I am not afraid to try them even though my skin is light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression: The package arrived within two days and the bottle was not sealed (They are not suppose to be). The consistency seemed to be legit. I tried it out, and after reading reviews I was expecting to see a noticeable tan immediately. I didn&#x27;t and neither did my friends. I waited 12 hours and assessed it again...still nothing. I have now used it four times and absolutely no results. As a bronzing lotion I would rate this a 0. However, it is a decent (not the best) moisturizer and has the best &amp;#34;no tanning&amp;#34; smell scent of ALL the lotions I have used. I prefer a very similar product called &amp;#34;Forever Black&amp;#34; by DC. The moisturizer is much better and the results are phenomenal.  It has a worse after scent, but not horrible. If you are like me and have pale skin and are very impatient when it comes to seeing results, try forever black instead.</li>
            <li> great for the price, shipped in a timely manner, worked well but, it doesn&#x27;t have the best of scents. I would still recommend to others</li>
            <li> Good product. Would buy again. Tanned with it 4 times and was very tan. Has a good smell, not over powering.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used this for a couple years. Love it, and would recommend this product to everybody. :)</li>
            <li> Let me tell you guys about my experiences with this product...first off..I&#x27;m a guy..I wanted this product to get a pretty good jump on the tanning season..and living in Southern California in April that&#x27;s pretty easy to do.  When I started using this product... I was by no means dark, but definitely had distinguishable tan lines.  I have fair skin (burn rather easy) but also tan rather easily.  I will also state that I do not use tanning beds, only the real sun.. so I cannot comment on what beds would be like (but I&#x27;m sure they would work better or at least as good).  First off...I see lots of things about people saying it smells like flowers...or it smells like burnt hair (lol)..  Well my bottle smells like sugary vanilla... if it doesn&#x27;t smell like something ants would want to invade...then it probably isn&#x27;t real..  Also the consistancy is more of a tan color and its the consistancy of an average lotion...its not super thick and its DEFINITELY not watery.  When I&#x27;ve used this product outside...after I&#x27;m done tanning it smells exactly like when I put it on..you just smell like vanilla ice cream...I don&#x27;t know how body chemistry can make this product smell like burnt hair...or menthol..or any of the other crazy things here unless the solution was fake.  The product works decently well..it will get you darker...but only maybe as dark as you would get in 6 sessions outside over the span of 4.  I&#x27;ve learned that this product does not work very well if you put tanning oil on first... so with that said for best results you would have to go SPF-free using this product outside...which I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for very long (maybe 30 mins on each side at most).  I got better results also by leaving the product on for 3-4 hours AFTER tanning without washing it off.  I did not find that this product causes streaks..but I definitely would put more effort into making sure its even and smooth than I would with basic tanning oil just to be sure... and use common sense..do not use this product on your face...use a more natural face bronzer or just let it be slightly different colors and let it be.. I personally use Crystal Faces by Australian Gold and my face is a bit lighter but its very natural in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So things you may have learned from review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This product smells like Vanilla Ice Cream, or something very sugary vanilla that ants would like.&lt;br /&gt;2) This product is NOT watery, its tan-ish in color and has the consistancy of an average lotion.&lt;br /&gt;3) This product WILL work outside.&lt;br /&gt;4) This product works BETTER outside without sunscreen (atleast in my experiences, if you put sunscreen on I&#x27;d give it a full hour to dry so you make sure the bronzer can still absorb completely).&lt;br /&gt;5) After use this product smells exactly like it does when applied.&lt;br /&gt;6) This product WILL make you tanner in less time, but think something along the lines of \\&quot;Ill get tan in two days what I normally would in three\\&quot;, not some ridiculous \\&quot;I used this product for  10 minutes and now am darker than people in the Carribean.\\&quot;  ....atleast if you&#x27;re using it outside, can&#x27;t really state results of tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say also that this product doesn&#x27;t last maybe as long as you would wish it would.. I would say you may can get 15-20 full body uses out of one bottle, but don&#x27;t expect it to last all su mmer.  I&#x27;ll probably give this product 5 stars because it was as I expected...it smells nice..it definitely works better than not using it..and its a very good price (considering what you get is actually real).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps..I tried to cover things that were my questions when I gambled on this product initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Paul</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion. I just ordered more. It also makes my skin feel so good. A must have for tanners that don&#x27;t like the tingle !!!</li>
            <li> really did not work...kinda smelly</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price!! I am definitely a lot more tanned and didnt take long to gain color. Everyone asks me what lotion I use when tanning.</li>
            <li> This lotion really gives you nice color when used in indoor tanning salons. I have never used it outdoors. However, the smell after on my skin after I finished tanning was kind of gross. Initially before sun expose it smelled kind of good but not afterwards. If you are looking for a nice dark color though this does work.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is awesome. Gives a great fake tan after you put it on. Gives a great real tan after tanning. Smells awesome and leaves skin really soft afterwards. Definitely going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> works great used it before</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for a new indoor tanning lotion, so I tend to buy several different brands per year. I cannot say that I saw a drastic change in skin color, but I did notice a slight difference. The thing I like the most about this particular lotion is the scent and the feel of it. The scent is pleasant and very clean and it does not give you that &amp;#34;tanning bed skin&amp;#34; smell afterward. It isn&#x27;t as greasy as other lotions I have tried either. It does not leave you feeling slimy and dirty after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for someone who is looking for a lotion that smells good, refreshes your skin and maintains your tan. Definitely worth the price here on Amazon verses the price in the actual tanning salons.</li>
            <li> Absolutely SUCKS. I purchased this  after I got a lotion from the salon. Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t make you darker, turns u into a light orange shade. However, this is good for people who are pale so they can build up a light tan and for paler people on a budget. But not so good if you are you tan and want to be darker.  If you&#x27;re looking to get a nice deep color I highly recommend looking into some Ed hardy products. I use Upgrade to Black and I recommend spending the money on that.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted !&lt;br /&gt;Very good !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. It has such a good smell, gets you tanned faster, and my skin feels great after I apply it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product I have purchased many times &amp; will continue to. Works amazingly &amp; the bronzer doesn&#x27;t leave a orange coloring behind highly recommended &amp; came very fast &amp; sealed</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion because compared to other lotions i have tried it smells really good even after you have tanned wearing it, you don&#x27;t get that burnt fake tan smell. It smells kind of like vanilla which I like much better then the super sweet fruity smells that most other tanning lotions smell like. Anyways, not only does it smell great but it also goes on extremely smooth because its silicone so it dries quick and isn&#x27;t greasy it leaves your skin super duper soft. I put it on right before i tan and it definitely gave me that boost of color I was looking for without making me orange at all. My color has also seemed to last longer then usual. It really is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different tanning lotions in the past and this one has exceeded my expectations. I have only used the stand up two times and only for 5 minute intervals and I can see a big difference in this lotion.</li>
            <li> Works really good and does not leave the after smell that most other tanning lotions leave on your skin! The tan is even and no where close to orange! It gives you a very natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> When I received this I was so excited to try it because it seemed like it would work really well based on the claims and other reviews I read. However, I&#x27;m certain I received a bad/faulty bottle because the smell was absolutely awful, and not just like I didn&#x27;t personally enjoy the scent - it just smelled wrong - I could barely use it at all. I did try it a few times anyway, but it did not make me more tan at all!!! As another review said, I think it actually didn&#x27;t let the booth tan me, like it blocked the light. I hated this lotion, I threw it away and would never repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I can not tell one bit of difference since getting this lotion and using it....it doesn&#x27;t compare to the lotions at the salons for sure.  Very disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> Its a good tanning lotion and it works very well. not the best ive ever used but i was impressed.</li>
            <li> So starting off I&#x27;d like to say that I swear by Designer Skin brand and will use nothing else.  I have Conceited in route to my house as I review this lotion.  My sister uses this lotion and I used it when we went tanning just to see how it worked.  It went on very nicely and smelled ok during application but after I was done it reminded me of a combo of burnt skin and cheap body wash.  I saw very little results after first use and my sisters tan who has almost finished the bottle is moderate at best.  Since the lotion is relatively cheap through Amazon it maybe ok to use with a stronger bronzer but using it solo is almost a waste.  Better off spending $10 more dollars and get a better lotion like Conceited or Luminary.</li>
            <li> It did nothing...no noticeable deeper color at all, very disappointed feel like the reviews were written by friends of the makers</li>
            <li> I love this! It smells so good and after the first couple times of tanning i noticed a difference. Great stuff</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells amazing! Will be buying again!!!</li>
            <li> Gets you dark fast... Love it</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! After first use I got a nice color. I see a lot of people that go tanning and they turn orange cuz of the lotion there using!! This stuff gives you a nice deep rich brown bronze color. This is deffinetly one of my favorites!! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product and it has always worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy at all, but can have a smell after a while if you do not shower all day.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;Enhances tan even after first use.</li>
            <li> I had never bought a auto tanning lotion.  I allowed the name of product to influence my purchase.  I have been satified with Paint it Black, but it does not have the level of bronzing agents as the name might suggest. The origainal price of $95 is miss leading, there is no way this product would be worth half of that.  Nice product actual value approximately $20.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used a lot of different tanning lotions, and this hands down is my favorite. It has the perfect amount of bronzer, and doesn&#x27;t leave those browns lines if you don&#x27;t get it rubbed in all the way. I have found this lotion allows me to tan quicker than any other ones I have tried. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who enjoys getting the perfect brown tan.</li>
            <li> THis is the best smelling tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. And it actually works. I actually saw a difference when I tanned. The thing is....how do they sell it so cheap? I know someone who owns a tanning salon and this price is just crazy. This stuff is expensive even wholesale. So I&#x27;d say buyer beware. We might not be getting the real thing - or maybe it&#x27;s expired. Hard to say.</li>
            <li> I have been going to a tanning salon for about 2 years, i go between twice and 4 times a month. I was buying a lotion that worked great but it costed about $60 in promotion. I have been using paint it black for about a month now and it works great, also my tan lasts more than a week. the color is nice, does not look yellowish. and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I say it works, but its not the BEST product I&#x27;ve ever tried.. but for the price its pretty darn great!</li>
            <li> Liked product a lot. As an experienced tanner you enjoy good products that benefit your skin. This one makes my skin soft, not dry. The bronzers work really well in this. If you have a trip planned and need a quick tan this is great, but only if you are already a tanner. Not for beginners. The seller also got this to me as promised.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter.  Compared prices and buying 2 for 1 from amazon was the best way to go.  She seems to like the product.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product. It smells rather funky, but the feeling you get after suntanning is great. It leaves your skin soft and silky, not sticky like others I&#x27;ve tried. I would purchase this immediately again. :)</li>
            <li> Paint it black works so well on me!  I am super dark and there is no nasty after smell to it.  It worked fast and got me really tan!  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am a strawberry blonde with blue eyes therefore you know I do not tan easily.  This product works for me to get a nice color.  I will never be &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; but at least I am not pale.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Within a week I had a nice dark tan. This would have taken me a lot longer with other lotions. I have tried several tanning lotions but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion never did it give me streaks or smell funny I think it&#x27;s amazing but....I&#x27;m giving 4 stars bc when I first received my package it was a bottle of asprin I called customer service and they fixed the problem promptly</li>
            <li> Can i use it under sun ?</li>
            <li> This lotion is a complete waste of money.  Smells terrible and doesn&#x27;t add any color to your skin when tanning.  I&#x27;ve tanned for years and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve not been satisfied with.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last year and was stocking up just in case.It wasn&#x27;t till the last week that I started using it and this Is Not the original Paint it Black.It comes out too light a color than the original.The absolute worst thing is that it starts &amp;#34;balling up&amp;#34;on your skin like in flakes and I had tanning lotion debri All Over Me an hour after tanning I had to rub it off and it felt like little pieces of glue coming off my skin.Also my skin has been itching which has Never happened when I have used this lotion for the past 8-10 year!I also moisurize Very Well so that&#x27;s definitely not the problem.I would like to be contacted about this b/c I would like a refund,</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and received it fast.</li>
            <li> Honestly it was not what I initially thought it was due to the name it gave. But that being said it works very well and am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I order this lotion and was very pleased with how quickly I got it. I tan regularly and saw results, definitely didn&#x27;t leave me orange there are no bronzing properties so there&#x27;s no need to wait to shower or anything. The smell was OK not to strong I would definitely recommended this lotion.</li>
            <li> Works great and love the price. I&#x27;d pay double at a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Great for the tanning bed and that dark look</li>
            <li> It works good, i would recommend it to anyone, but you always need to switch lotions to get the darkness you desire.</li>
            <li> This is really nice lotion.  It&#x27;s just like from the salon, but a lot cheaper.  I love the scent.  It reminds me of a vacation in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice and it looks like I have been tanning all week. If you need to get dark quick, this is for you. Also, the tan that I have gotten from it is natural looking. I don&#x27;t look like Snooki, so I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li> I received my order before estimated arrival date, I am more than happy with my experience :)</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion out there expensive if you buy in salon 50$ when i saw it for 10.00 per bottle I got two skily on skin and dark dark results Its one of the best by Millenium I would also try there others 100 x auto darkening paint it blk is 50x  they have about 5 in this catagory try it great price buy only from the Milleium site ......shipped faster then it was suppose to be...Very very HAPPY WITH THIS COMPANY AND THERE TANNING LOTION BOTTLES ARE bigger buy from amazon I wouldnt buy anywhere else prices are so awesome</li>
            <li> No difference noticed compared to a generic Walmart brand that is readily available and less expensive. Very disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  you can see the difference after one use and the smell is soft and floral unlike many others with bronzers that high.  The silicone leaves my skin feeling soft all day.  I asked my girls at my tanning place and they said that bottle there would run around $95 and I got it for $13 here on Amazon.  This is a MUST buy!!!</li>
            <li> Great price!!! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love it! By far my favorite</li>
            <li> Works great! Great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the reviews and everyone saying how great it was, but I am not impressed.  Maybe its my skin, it dont know, but there is no tingle factor to it and after 4 times I didnt get any darker.</li>
            <li> Works very well. I plan on buying again. Don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving self tanner streaks like the 100X.</li>
            <li> Love this product for couple years. Easy to apply and will not leave marks. Nice even tan. I use it even when outside.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and works really well. It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange or have that tingling feeling either! Very glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the up-sell at tanning salons! You must order this through Amazon for a great price. Perfect for indoor tanning!</li>
            <li> I have always loved these products but after using Black and Tan this seemed to not give me any color.</li>
            <li> Tans your skin really fast!!!  Love this product</li>
            <li> I have been using since I purchased it and have not noticed much. Its not something I will purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no dummy when it comes to what to use in a tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;This stiff roxxxs&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Works into the skin well and leaves no residue. Leaves skin feeling soft and silky. I would purchase this again</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a &amp;#34;mind blowing&amp;#34; difference that everyone is talking about. The lotion is OK. Smells fine, but it seems to be kind of watery. I&#x27;m hoping I didn&#x27;t receive a fake...</li>
            <li> this product smells great. it is awesome. so much cheaper than if you buy it at the tanning salon. great</li>
            <li> Ive used it several times. couldnt tell that it did anything. Thought I would use it for a little color before getting out in in my bathing suit. I usually tan right thru sunscreen. And couple of times out boating and I have some color no thanks to this product. I like the smell. Sort of sweet and summery. Has a nice soft feel on the skin. Since I have it Ill probably continue to use it under sunscreen til I run out. But wont be buying anymore.</li>
            <li> Felts as though it was advertised as SUNLESS tanning lotion, but really it&#x27;s Tanning bed or outside bronzed only.... I think I was misguided and they made it seem as though it was a popular sunless tanning lotion, not a tanning bed lotion !!!!!!, I have had skin CA and I don&#x27;t lay in cancer boxes, disappointed but my friend or husband that is Cherokee Indian can use with no problems, but I still feel like they advertise it wrong and I got ripped off!!!</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Bought this to switch it up from the Australian Gold Cheeky Brown that I had been using, should have stuck with what I had. I have not noticed a difference in my color at all since using this. Going to try to use the rest of the bottle but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a really good tanning lotion, I noticed a good deal of a difference after the first, the second, &amp; now the third use. Which, since I started using it I upgraded to the next level tanning bed. But still. I know it&#x27;s the lotion that&#x27;s made the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients contain Tyrosine &amp; L-Tyrosine which are accelerator ingredients, which helps tan you faster. Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) which is a key ingredient found in bronzing lotions. Other than Erythrulose, but that&#x27;s another story. Do the research on that if you&#x27;d like. But Millennium Paint it Black lotion doesn&#x27;t contain that ingredient. Which is quite alright though..&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still a very good tanning product! I gave it 4 stars because I know there&#x27;s gotta better out there.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. It smells good and the bronzer is amazing. No splotchy spots or streaks.  Quick noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Didn&#x27;t have any kind of reaction as I did with the one I bought from the tanning salon for much more money.  I will be buying this again when I&#x27;m finished with my current bottle!</li>
            <li> I did not see much of a tan after using it for two weeks everyday. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time or money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned.  Once I tan for a couple weeks and get the base color I use this to boost my skin darker.  I was using extreme tingle lotions that made my skin feel like it was burning - I hated that feeling but was the only product I could get results with. Big problem w/ tingle lotions is you can&#x27;t use on your face or it can create spider veins.  I tried this Paint it black lotion.  I was skeptical of trying it because it has a self tanner but it doesn&#x27;t smell like it or make you orange.  This is now my favorite lotion!  It&#x27;s a great price and works great to boost your color darker when you plateau. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone of any skin color to get darker results.</li>
            <li> very good for the price it does work and get you a nice brown tan and hydrates the skin very happy with it</li>
            <li> It smells great and has a light sweet smell. It gives a great natural tan color too. This is exactly what a great bronzer does. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and the silky feeling after I&#x27;ve tanned. It give great color and the price is just perfect!</li>
            <li> love the bronzing effect</li>
            <li> Love it.  Really dark color.</li>
            <li> Works great...arrived on time</li>
            <li> The paint it black works great. I have noticed a nice color after a few uses. I would purchase this again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty pale for a while. July is almost here and I haven&#x27;t tanned since December. So I&#x27;m pretty white now. I used this lotion and only went on the first level bed. Wow, afterwards I immediately noticed a little color. It must be the bronzer I guess. But I wasn&#x27;t expecting any color right away so I&#x27;m pretty amazed! This smells so delicious too! When I first put it on it smelled like a weird minty vanilla but after tanning I smell like a mixture of chocolate and vanilla ice cream!  The after tan smell is definitely the best part (which is rare!). People are already telling me how great and yummy I smell. Wow. For this price and for the results, this is definitely a lotion you should consider. This is perfect for women who are pale or haven&#x27;t tanned in a long time. Give this a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.  Decent lotion, smells nice and isn&#x27;t oily. Does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do.. Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tan as nicely as the expensive lotions. Big bottle however just wished it worked better. Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Great accelerator for tanning; not much smell, but that&#x27;s okay. Works beautifully!!! Saw results the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion lasted me over 6 months which is a really long time and also a great value. It didn&#x27;t have much scent, but I&#x27;m okay with that as I don&#x27;t like for others to smell/notice that I&#x27;ve been tanning. It definitely helped with bronzing and I only tanned approximately 2 times/week. I would recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> So many people have said all the great things about this product, and guess what..... THEY ARE RIGHT! It is a very lightly scented lotion. After using the tanning bed I don&#x27;t smell like burned skin thats trying to be masked with some tropical scent. It&#x27;s just perfect. I love the way it makes my skin feel after each use and i don&#x27;t feel the need to run home and wash up as soon as possible. I am not bothered by it at all. I am also not self concious about smelling like I have been sitting in a tanning bed. The product helped me immensely in improving my color. It didn&#x27;t make me orange at all, in fact it brought out a very golden brown that I couldn&#x27;t have achieved otherwise. I am very happy with this product and will most certainly purchase this product again. VERY happy customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for almost a year now and I&#x27;ve tried a number of different lotions. This is the only one that actually left burn scars on any part of my body that directly touched the tanning bed (heels of my feet especially). I don&#x27;t like leaving negative reviews but I hope someone else doesn&#x27;t get burnt because of this review. :/</li>
            <li> This is very good tanning product and keeps my skin from drying out while tanning  My skin feels good when I get out instead of dry like other products I have used and gives you a good color.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as great as I hoped... Seemed like it worked for a week or two, then I stopped getting any darker.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this lotion, and I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it smells and makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I actually use this as a self tanning lotion.  I have had friends ask if I lay out and that in itself is a good bonus.  I like the feel of the lotion on my skin and the smell.  You have to be careful with clothing as it will stain.  If you want some color just use this.</li>
            <li> This lotion was pretty cheap, and it worked ok, but it wasn&#x27;t anything wondrous - I tanned with it, but it didn&#x27;t make me super super dark like it says it would.</li>
            <li> I liked the way this lotion smells the best. It did work very well. I just stopped indoor tanning however it was good while i used it.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice scent and provides even subtle color. No dramatically dark results, but I noticed a liiiittle color. Most importantly the color I achieved was a bit of brown and NOT orange! :) I recommend to those who are fair-skinned looking for a base.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine purchased this on my account. I don&#x27;t tan and have never used this. She never said anything negative about it so I assume it worked fine</li>
            <li> I love the product, the price is so good for that quality. Thank you i really appreciate! I&#x27;m really happy!</li>
            <li> After being down the shore about 4 days my son and fianc√© have both went from cottage cheese white to BROWN....with my sons spf 80. I am using this and another spray bronzing spray that has an spf 15 since skin cancer is a very real thing. Sun poison alone sucks. But 4 days beach sun rays!!! Nothing...</li>
            <li> love it  i will def ordered again  wonderful stuff  i am so dark!!!!  AWESOME YES IT DID AND KEEP WEARING IT!</li>
            <li> THIS LOTION IS TOP OF THE LINE!!!  I USE IT &amp; THE SOLID BLACK &amp; BLACK &amp; TAN ALL BY MILLENIUM TANNING.  I ROTATE ALL 3 &amp; HAVE GOTTEN FANTASTIC RESULTS!!!  WORTH THE $$$!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and I have been very pleased. Great scent as well :)</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking is was a sunless tanning product only to find out that it&#x27;s for use in tanning booths or for actual sun tanning.  It smells so good though that I used it anyway until my daughter wanted it for use in a tanning booth.  She loves it!  I cannot sun bathe anymore nor can I use a tanning booth due to medical procedures.</li>
            <li> I have never been so dark! I love this stuff! In the tanning bed or out on the lake it works great!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny . . .</li>
            <li> I LOVE the price of this lotion, esp since so many dark tanners are around $50 at the salon! But I took the chance despite my fear I would turn orange and streaky. That did not happen! NO STREAKS, NO ORANGE! And I NEVER tan and am extremely pale! Now I have to admit, you look darker after the initial tan and it fades as the day goes on, so that was disappointing. But I think if I go twice a week I can keep a killer tan! You just can&#x27;t beat the price of this lotion. Very much recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! it makes me so dark! it does give me a pleatu after about 2-3 weeks but it could be that i go like every other day!</li>
            <li> This lotion turns you brown almost immediately but because it has a bronzer the deep tan doesn&#x27;t last long unless you go to the tanning bed everyday. But it&#x27;s good for a quick tan.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because of the price. I did tan well with this product but I couldn&#x27;t get past the post-tan smell. It reminded me of self tanner odor. If you can get past the smell its not a bad product. I ended up paying a whole lot more for Aphrodisiac at the salon because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of Paint it Black.</li>
            <li> I loooooove this stuff!!!  Gets you tanned soooooo much faster than with no lotion at all!!!  I squirt a small amount on wet hands and apply all over.  Usually, I have to wet my hands twice to cover my whole body.  For my back, I use my long scrubbing towel I use in the shower.  I wet the towel first, squirt a little bit of tanning lotion on the towel, then scrub my back with it.  Yaahooooo it works!  No orange color!!!!  No nasty streaks!!!!  No fading!!!!  Just a gorgeous, natural tan ... FAST!!!  It makes you look like you&#x27;re an exotic island girl!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to tan. I am 20 and take very good care of my skin. I always burned. This year I get in the tanning bed twice a week with this stuff as well as go to the beach and lay in the sun with it on. This stuff works and if your fair skinned like I am go to the tanning bed for a few weeks and you will see a differcene!</li>
            <li> Great price, Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 bottles of this and wish i hadn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used one bottle and it didn&#x27;t do anything so i bought something from the tanning salon.Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Totally gives you color and this is one of the first ever tanning lotions that I started using when I would tan indoors and after a few sessions you can totally tell you have color!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS LOTION. WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li> good price excellent tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. I am not sure if it is defective, not the real item or maybe just old but it does not produce the results as promised. I use a variety of tanning products (some better than others) but this is the first one that I purchased that does absolutely nothing. Its like using water. I would not recommend buying this product, especially from this shipper. I wish I had a better review because I was looking forward to using this product.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in color when I did or didn&#x27;t use this. Maybe it only works for people who tan super easily. Smells nice though.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this stuff. it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as most others I have tried</li>
            <li> Good lotion with dark bronzed just make sure you wipe your hands good then wash them when your done or your fingers will be orange</li>
            <li> Best indoor/outdoor tanner out there. I worked in the tanning industry for 4 years and used this in the beds and outside when I lay out. You can really achieve a deep color and the smell is great! Don&#x27;t waste your money on the $75-125 lotions. This will blow all of them out of the water.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and makes my skin so soft. I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times now, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it tans you just yet. I will probably buy again, though considering I can notice a difference in my skin tone just after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Gives me a tacky feeling until I shower...Kind of makes me orange too. Good price but I cannot recommend...spend a little more than this a look elsewhere. Better than nothing!</li>
            <li> I bought this on amazon because it seemed popular. It made me darker but I could not stand the smell. I hated the way it smelled in the bottle, and I hated it even worse after I got done tanning. It might have worked if I could get past the smell, but I let my sister have it haha</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it and it seems good, just enough bronzer to make a little difference. I could not tell a difference until using a few times.</li>
            <li> I put this product on one leg and baby oil on the other. Laid out for 4 hours. The baby oiled leg was darker than the other one. Gave the product away</li>
            <li> My hunch is this stuff might be a little older than what you&#x27;d get in the salon, which is fine. It still works the bronzer just wears off a little quicker and I have to remember to shake the bottle up before using it. The smell is pretty sweet. Vanilla like as others have mentioned but it doesn&#x27;t leave me stinky after. I also havent ever noticed any staining on myself or my clothes after using it which is a huge plus. Overall for the price I wanted to pay this did the trick. I&#x27;m not looking to be Jersey Shore tan. Just a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I did not love this lotion. It smells good but it did not help me get a darker color. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion and the cost is great! I bought the 100x paint it black also and like that one better because I feel like the bronzer is better . If I didn&#x27;t have the 100 x to compare it to I would like the 50x just fine. I do switch between the two and am satisfied with my purchase. Also they came only two days after ordering so that was a plus!</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion to start tanning with before you go to a darker one, it goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion for tanning in a bed. The price is about 1/10 of what they want in a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only gone tanning using this lotion a couple of times,and I love the color that I am getting!  This might just be my new go to lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion gives a nice and quick base color as well as a nice glow. It still carries the &#x27;tanning&#x27; smell, unlike other reviews noted that it did not. Recommend if your looking for a nice glow tan.</li>
            <li> My tanning salon offers this lotion for $50. I got it here way cheaper than that. Gotta love amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many tanning lotions over the years and paint it black is the best one i&#x27;ve used so far, I definitely will not being switching anytime soon. I recently started tanning again after having my daughter so I was starting off from scratch, no base tan or anything. After two 8 minute sessions in a level 2 bed, I have an awesome tan, not just a base either. definitely way darker. The lotion smells great and the silicone really makes your skin so so soft. I recieved my order VERY quickly and I would definitely buy from this user again.</li>
            <li> Well I purchased this product a couple days ago and just now received an email confirming it ..however Vitasupply company website says my lotion is on back order...now I went  back to search for this lotion again and it says its in stock.  I am eager to get this lotion but do not like the fact that I feel I have to months before I can actually get it ..if one website says its in stock and the other no.</li>
            <li> Well I thought this product would be good, and it turned out not to be all that great. My theroy of tanning beds are; the employees try to push tanning lotion on people, and I really don&#x27;t think that tanning lotion works. If anything it is a blocker not a helper. So this product DON&#x27;T work for me. I ordered it and used it 22 times. I stoped using tanning lotion, and have gone 16 time and I am darker than I have ever been using tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It worked for me in just the first week. The key is to go everyday...</li>
            <li> There is power in a name; there is truth in this one.  This product has to be the best flavor of lotion I have ever used since I started to go to the electric beach [3 years to date].  I heard that this is suitable for the natural sun as well; I have decided to test drive it and report back in the fall.  Stay tuned for the update. See you in September.  G.</li>
            <li> Tried this product as soon as I got it in the mail.. I&#x27;ve tried billions of tanning lotions. Everything from OC Ten X to Black 20XXX, including all those cheapy lotions in Sallys Beauty Supplies. THIS ONE IS THE BEST! I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but can already notice a slight difference.. I know if i keep going my color will build in NO TIME.. Absolutly the best lotion for me. Would deffinetly recommend!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smooth. It has a good smell (not like some of the other lotions that smell like &amp;#34;tanning bed&amp;#34;). I haven&#x27;t used it for very long to see how fast it tans, but it goes on good and smells great! Love it!</li>
            <li> In only 2 tanning sessions, I see a MAJOR improvement in darkness of color and condition of skin. It absorbs fast, smells great (no stinky bronzer smell) and you can go about your day without feeling like you have grime on your skin. My skin even feels softer overall. For someone who doesn&#x27;t normally get dark, I am very impressed already.</li>
            <li> After all of the reviews on this product I just knew it was going to be great. After using it several times I could tell no difference at all. The stuff didn&#x27;t even stain my skin to look like a self tanner. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does make your skin soft. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> this product turned me a faky orange copper color. I LOOKED DARK FOR A FEW HOURS then was like umm wtf? like im still white(kind of orange) and Im olive toned skin. This seller  stated this S*** was worth $99. Its only  worth about $5. I checked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tanning beds for quite a while, and this is the most unusual lotion I&#x27;ve ever encountered. Simply put, it makes your tan look &amp;#34;brick red&amp;#34;. Not sunburned, not orange, but an odd dark reddish/black that looks exactly like the color most bricks are. Your skin will definitely look darker, but the color doesn&#x27;t look natural on me. Don&#x27;t be surprised if people start singing the Commodores&#x27; old song &amp;#34;Brick House&amp;#34; when you walk by them...</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> For my first tanning lotion, I could say it does the job. After the third session of tanning, my skin came out golden brown.The only issue is the smell. When you first put it on, it smells pretty good. Like vanilla. BUT, once you&#x27;re finished tanning, you smell like burnt popcorn. I&#x27;ve heard that you aren&#x27;t supposed to shower until many hours after tanning, but the smell leaves me no choice. It makes me feel gross and sticky. I always end up showering after leaving the tanning salon (which means a less developed tan) or smelling really odd throughout the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars because it also leaves my skin extremely soft. BUT MILLENNIUM REALLY OUGHT TO WORK ON THAT SCENT.</li>
            <li> This is one very good tanning lotion,</li>
            <li> The best lotion for tanning</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me...  kinda a waste of time and money for me.</li>
            <li> Good lotion and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> My order came in less than a week. I absolutely love this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. It makes my skin so soft as smooth and smells fantastic. I recommend this tanning lotion to everyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this after deciding that I needed a quick tan before a weekend getaway. Spent awhile researching different lotions looking for one that would give quick results but that did not have any tingle. After reading numerous reviews I decided on Paint It Black, partly because of the great reviews and also because of the price. I have pretty fair skin so I was nervous that I would either burn or end up orange and streaky. Thankfully I am neither of those things and I actually have a pretty great tan! Even after just one session in the tanning bed I noticed a difference. The color is very natural and I didn&#x27;t have any streaking. careful not to over it foley a shower and a scholar still look great afterward. My one complaint is the smell, it&#x27;s not a typical tanning lotion smell (coconuty) bit has more of a heavy, chocolate scent. But im still using it because the odd smell doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it is an awesome tanning lotion with quick results!</li>
            <li> I would reccommend this product to any indoor tanners. It has bronzer and tightening without any irritating itchy tingle. It arrived within one week and was the product I expected.</li>
            <li> Smells great , started tanning five days ago and can see a difference now.skin has a move glow again.thank you</li>
            <li> Enjoy product, I don&#x27;t get as dark as I thought I would but love the tone that it provides, does not look fake or make you look orange as some do.</li>
            <li> I happen to work in radiology, so anything skeleton related always catches my eye.  Paint it black reference to the Rolling Stones...well...how could I resist the double wammy.  I love the smell and it works just as well as the stuff they charged me twice to three times what this cost to get through Amazon...amazing amazon. gotta love em.</li>
            <li> makes my gf smell awesome</li>
            <li> super dark, soft skin, unbeatable price!!</li>
            <li> This is all my husband will use. he has tried other products but all ways come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Loved this product.  The bronzer wasn&#x27;t too overpowering.  The lotion smelt great.  Also, the effects were worth the price o</li>
            <li> This product does help with the color, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  I tan pretty well, and most lotions usually help excelerate the process with me, but this one, not so much.  A little disappointed, but I did see results.</li>
            <li> another great purchase.  thanx Amazon</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly to get me a good base tan for the summer.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion and have used for years.  It doesn&#x27;t tingle and you still get a great tan while your skin stays hydrated...and its a great price.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great but, all it does for you Is make you orange and streaky. Even after a couple of hours of wearing all you can smell is fake tan. Don&#x27;t waste your money you can buy fake tan for cheaper and it look a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> Top rated tanning lotion. Its good. Im a male. So the black bottle looks more for men.</li>
            <li> The first lotion that  has actually been getting me tan!</li>
            <li> I loved this, Smelled amazing even after baking in a tanning bed for 20 minutes -lol- But on a serious note, I have fair skin aka burns within minutes of being outside, so I always get a base tan before summer so I don&#x27;t spend the summer months inside whining about my sun burns, I used this product twice a week for a month and was darker than I had ever been!!! I will stick with this product till they run out or I get skin cancer :P&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I haven&#x27;t had one sunburn all summer :D :D</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled good when I first opened the bottle, but while I was applying it to my skin I realized I did not like it.  It has this weird \\&quot;freshly mowed lawn\\&quot; scent instead of anything tropical.  And it gets worse (burnt grass clippings or something like that) after the tanning bed.  And I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my tanning.  I&#x27;ll finish the bottle (probably), but would NOT buy again.</li>
            <li> I picked up my bottle from the USPS.. Opened it and it looked brand new. It honeestly smells amazing and when I used it for the first timeI saw definate results.. I do have a base tan and have been using an accelerator for some time. This is the first bronzer that I used and it worked first time I used it.. I will keep you guys updated.. This is not a fake post this is absolutely real!!</li>
            <li> This if u are just starting ur tanning u can use this....  the smell is ok. it will get u dark.</li>
            <li> My package arrived on time, but the lotion was not as good as i expected it to be.  it says it has 50X bronzer...but i&#x27;ve tried lotions with 25X and it seemed to be a little stronger.  it smelled amazing and my skin was super soft for that day.  but, i probably won&#x27;t be buying this product again.  and it was also not sealed...which i am worried about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion twice last week and i have already seen a difference from using nothing at all. I have gotten alot of compliments saying i look darker, little did they know that i have been tanning longer than they thought, but when i started using this everyone noticed. I felt better about myself. Some people would like to know if the lotion is a dark color, and it is. I have heard that the darker the lotion color the better results you will get.</li>
            <li> I used this product since the first of March. I have some color but it isn&#x27;t satisfying enough. I also noticed the color fading and I would burn easily.</li>
            <li> I have to say the first time I used this I fell in love. It is so easy to put on and is priced great on this site! It went on smoother than any of the others I have used and leaves me so soft. Most other lotions leave me itchy for days even after I shower and I have had no problems with this lotion. It smells good too. I have a good base tan and it still turned be a few noticeable shades darker in just one session. After two I am close to my old Florida tan and that was dark!!! I have no complaints with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! For $15.00 I couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal and at first I was a little unsure about it, but I absolutely love it. It smells wonderful even after you tan. I recommend this lotion to anyone that wants a darker tan!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this tanning lotion. it made me sooo dark on my first tanning bed visit you wouldn&#x27;t believe it. which i tan really easy anyway but still its a miricle</li>
            <li> Product arrived with a cheap piece of scotch tape over the top. There was no real seal. Probably not genuine.</li>
            <li> I bought Paint it Black 1 year ago for about $15 on Amazon and it is amazing! People are always wondering about me and how good my tan looks! I am darker than most of my friends and they look up to me and are always asking to borrow it. It smells great, like a vanilla with a little hint of citrus. This past year I have improved so much because of this lotion specifically. I am almost out of it and most definitely will be ordering some more. I literally don&#x27;t think I could live without it! Now out of my group of friends, only one girl is darker than me because she is of Puerto Rican descent, so that says a lot about this bronzer &amp; don&#x27;t even think twice about buying it! You will NOT regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice on very hot days, the stuff looks like a creamy brown coming out of the tube, it goes on and is nice and cool like sunscreen. The odor is very sweet smelling and smells very nice and not overbearing. Doesn&#x27;t take much, I sit out in the sun for 15 minutes (i usually wait or workout after sitting in the sun, you don&#x27;t notice immediately a change in skin color but trust me you will begin to notice your skin turn from a pale to a nice golden COMPLETELY natural skin color. I love it, if you wanna get sexified try this out.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, does everything the product says it will. However after you shower and I waited six hours on the first time I used it to shower and eight hours the second time I used it to shower the color washes right off. It looks as though you did didn&#x27;t go to the tannning bed at all. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li> You definitely notice a difference in your tan. I use this in a tanning bed, and outside. It works in both areas. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s not something I would want others to be able to smell on me. It definitely smells like a tanning product, but with a hint of coco butter smell and coconut.</li>
            <li> Its okay, dont think i would buy it again though. It has no smell. And that  is one of the things i like best using tanning acceleerators  . Also my tan fades fast after a few days.  I have always used designer skin in the past and am going back to their products. Cost a little more but quess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years, and have never had a problem with tanning lotions. I did get tan from this lotion, but it was pointless to be tan because i received a HORRIBLE rash around my lower stomach, boob, butt, and leg area from it. I stopped tanning for a week thinking i was reacting to the lights in the bed, but when i went back to tanning using the lotion i received the rash all over again. This time i stopped using the lotion and switched to another kind and my rash went away! I gave it to a friend of mine to use to see if she got the same reaction and she received the same rash within the next week....DO NOT BUY !!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE than anything you can buy from a tanning salon, and my tan always looks natural and stays strong.  I&#x27;ll probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> I read reviews thought I was getting a great deal..but NO.&lt;br /&gt;There was no seal on the bottle and it didn&#x27;t have much of a smell when I applied it. As far a tanning effect actuality none at all after a few tans...waste of money..buyer beware</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this 3 years in a row.  I&#x27;m light skinned, blue eyed blond hair so I burn and get red easy.  After the first use I&#x27;m darker then all my friends that use spray tans and tanning beds.  The best thing about this is the color is a natural bronze.  No orange color to it.  And I have very dry skin and this has such great conditioners in it.  My husband even used it on his white legs and was really happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Truly amazing product for the price. If you&#x27;ve looked around you probably already know that tanning lotions can be EXPENSIVE. Like, insanely expensive.  For that very reason I was skeptical of how this would perform. I have to say it meet my expectations and went far beyond. I am even naturally very pale and have freckles so a lot of bronzers come out looking orange on me. Not this one. As a fair skinned person, I want something with as much bronzer as possible, without turning orange, so that I don&#x27;t have to fry myself looking a normal shade of tan. :) I swear, this helped me get an amazing tan really quickly. Last summer I got so  many compliments on my tan it was incredibly! This is my new go to for sure!</li>
            <li> this is a great product smells great and works real good makes you very dark i will purchase this product again</li>
            <li> The product has a sickly smell. Although it does not take long to dry out the effect of the lotion is virtually nil, because no tans. A real disappointment.</li>
            <li> In the past I have always used oils for self tanning, and absolutely hated the mess that they would always leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im also incapable of becoming tan without help because I burn incredibly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended to me and I would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the subtle scent, and it is a tanning silicone based lotion that doesnt leave you feeling slimy and dirty after tanning. I wouldnt say results are immediate but you can usually see your tan lines after use, but this could just depend from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try if youre tired of oils! I dont think you wil be dissappointed!</li>
            <li> I use to tan all the time a couple of years ago and started up again in November, 2012.  Of course, I got sucked into buying a $75.00 bottle of lotion at the salon when I signed up with their &amp;#34;discount.&amp;#34;  The product I bought was Jwoww Black Bronzer.  I loved the smell and it seemed to work fine.  For some reason, I did not even think to look on Amazon for lotions.  And I was beyond perturbed when I saw the same JWoww lotion on here for $20.00 and sometimes less.  So, I swore I would never buy from the salon again.  As I went in during the past couple months I would write down what they considered their &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; $100.00 lotions and started looking around on here.  I found most of them on here from the $15.00 - $30.00 range (again, a bit upset with myself for falling for the salon girls).  I figured, since they are so &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; compared to the salon online, I can afford to actually try different ones.  After reading, this one seemed to be one of the higher rated, and most bought.  The ones for $100.00 at the salon actually did not have stunning reviews.  I ordered this late morning Tuesday (2/5/13) - and received it very quickly (today, Friday 2/8/13, in the morning).  I was so curious so I hopped in the truck and went tanning.  It was very smooth to put on and I do not use nearly as much as I had to with the JWoww because it is not so thick - I think it is the silicone that makes it easier to apply.  So right off the bat, I knew that I would not fly through this product as it seemed with the JWoww.  When I got out of the tanning bed, I looked in the mirror and realized I was brown (I already had a very nice tan that I have been working on in the beds for the past few months).  But I realized at that moment I was actually orangish from the JWoww - - I was impressed by this color.  And as far as the smell, I know everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but all I smell is Vanilla after tanning.  It smells so good still and it has been a few hours.  I guess I will know for sure if it happens to be bad after a few more sessions, but I can already tell that it is great.  They wanted $68.00 for this lotion at my salon, I got it for $14.95 with free Prime shipping on here.  You cannot beat it and it is the same stuff at the salon.  Hope this helps!  I recommend highly.s.  I guess I will know for sure if it happens to be bad after a few more sessions, but I can already tell that it is great.

            <li> I mainly got this lotion because it got generally good reviews and I wanted to see what a cheaper lotion could do. It&#x27;s okay I guess. It may give boost your color a little. My main problem with it is that the smell is very strong and is less than desirable and it seeps into everything (e.g. clothes). I use it when I have nothing else.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website</li>
            <li> Would recommend for a cheap and effective tanning lotion. Also smells very good. I will be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, hello beautiful tan.  Product works great!</li>
            <li> Good product and good price</li>
            <li> Same as the one I paid a lot more for! Its great stuff</li>
            <li> Smells and works great!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  It helps moisturize, get a tan and also maintain my tan while using indoor tanning.  The smell is good, this is used by both a man and a women and it is good for both of us! No nasty after smell either!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for 7 years (on and off, that is) and have never been so satisfied with a tanning lotion. I really feel darker than I have ever been. Now, granted, it may be because I have been laying in a realllly good bed, but still the lotion has helped I think. Not to mention, it smells and makes your skin feel amazing.    DOWNSIDE:    When I received the product it had some of the lotion (which is a tan color) dried around the top of the bottle opening. I don&#x27;t know if this is just a really old bottle, or someone had tampered with it or used it? But there was definitely some dried residue around the bottle and the inside of the cap. And it did NOT look like that had just happened through shipping, it looked like it had been there for a long time. Makes me wonder.....    Overall I recommend it, its definitely cheaper on here than stuff you get at a tanning salon that probably wont work as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many tanning lotions at all still. I&#x27;m a guy into heavy music, so the packaging naturally attracted me at first. The price wasn&#x27;t bad, so I went out on a limb. I&#x27;ve liked the results SO much, though, I didn&#x27;t want to try others. I tan in a high pressure bed two times a week and when I wasn&#x27;t using this, it showed little results. With this, I am SUPER dark. It also protects my skin afterwards. AWESOME STUFF.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a quality product.  I know I was worried about this item being a counterfeit or \\&quot;fake\\&quot; item, but it appears to be what it says it is.  This is probably my second favorite lotion I have tried, my first being made by matahari.  It has a nice scent though not my favorite but not terrible either.  Also, I do not notice that after tanning \\&quot;stink\\&quot; that I have noticed with lesser tanning lotions.  My skin is pretty fair naturally, so I have to work to maintain color.  At least twice a week.  And this lotion has worked perfectly for that.  I have been able to maintain my color by going to the salon two or three times a week. I have pretty much no complaints!  Get this lotion because you know salons mark everything up ridiculously and yet they sell you the same lotions you can get on Amazon!  (just 80 bucks more!)</li>
            <li> From a recommendation through a buddy at the gym I purchased this product.... It works well, has a nice scent and leaves your skin smooth. I have a nice, even color and you can&#x27;t beat the price.......Ordered it one day and received it a couple days later! You don&#x27;t need alot of product at one time and it does the trick for me!</li>
            <li> I have been using tanning products for a few years now and always bought at the salon, this was the first time I&#x27;d bought one off the internet and I&#x27;m very impressed with it, it&#x27;s definitely good to start out for a base tan. I am pretty white normally, tanning usually takes me several sessions to work my way up (I had one salon tell me to never go above 10 minutes - I do actually fine at 15 mins now) I have used this in both a lay down and stand up and I feel it moisturizes incredibly, and smells wonderful. It definitely works and continues to moisturize well after the session. Definitely can&#x27;t beat it for the price, and totally worth a shot. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I haven&#x27;t tried other products online yet so I have not very many things to stack it up again besides the Swanky Girl Temptress Cafe that I&#x27;d used for years, but I paid 3x more for it and I feel it Swanky Girl worked slightly better.</li>
            <li> The bottle says \\&quot;auto-darkening tan technology\\&quot;, but unless you have a tanning bed available to you, I did not see any natural bronzing or darkening going on after a diligent use of this product for two weeks.    Although the ingredients show it contains DHA (Dihydroxyacetone), I have used cheap DHA products from Walgren and Walmart that were much more effective.  Buyer beware if you&#x27;re hoping for a bronzing effect WITHOUT a tanning bed (in my case, the nearest tanning bed is a two hour drive....).     On a positive, yes, it does smell very nice.  All my best...</li>
            <li> smells great gives a great color!! I recommend this product 110% to anyone who is interested in getting a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Rash and blistering hives.     I do not know what was in this that caused it but it made me swell up like a puffy balloon :(</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! If you are looking for a lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave your hands orange looking and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor..this is it!! This lotion works great and it giving me a natural looking tan. Only used about 5 times and can tell a big difference.</li>
            <li> At the gym (Gold&#x27;s gym) I used to work for over a year we, after installing 5 tanning beds, were given a plethora of sample lotions. I have used nearly 100 different lotions in my time. From the tingle ones that hurt, to the ones that do nothing but make you smell nice. This is THE BEST one I have ever used, and for this kind of price it is a steal! I have seen trial sized lotions at my tanning place go for $7.99 and why would anyone buy that when you can spend just a few more bucks and get this? I may go to this rands 60X, but I am very happy with this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this years ago and it was great, but I recently purchased this again and it was bad. It had an expired smell and didn&#x27;t do anything for my tan. So needless to say I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> love this product and you can&#x27;t beat the price...i would have to pay at least 50 bucks in the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> product was very good at adding to my tan, in fact it kept me from getting too burnt in the carribean</li>
            <li> Great service..exactly what I was looking for!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Im heading on a tropical vacation in a few weeks and need some color so I dont burn like crazy when I get there. I bought some of this stuff and its great. It smells like Armani Code cologne.</li>
            <li> I do not believe that this product is what it is labled as. I never have a problem using bronzer lotion and this bottle did not give me any color, even after months of using it. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this lotion for the last year and it&#x27;s awesome!!! much cheaper than buying it at the local store and the smell is great. I have sensitive skin and the lotion doesn&#x27;t react negatively to it.  I&#x27;m a happy long-term customer!</li>
            <li> The product arived on time and is what it was claimed to be. All is good. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I am a tanning lotion junkie, so I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING!!! Paint it Black is my favorite bronzer without a doubt. My sister in-law was in a wedding, and was worried about looking pale in her strapless, short dress. She started tanning about two weeks prior to the wedding with not much result, as she doesn&#x27;t tan easily. About four days before the wedding, I gave her the rest of my last bottle of Paint it Black and told her to just give it a try. She was amazed with the results. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is now her \\&quot;go to\\&quot; lotion!</li>
            <li> Not really impressed. I&#x27;ve had other tanning lotions make me darker within a few tans. Didn&#x27;t spend much money on this so I&#x27;m not going to complain to much.</li>
            <li> After reading so many good reviews,I just had to try Paint it Black.  The only probably was that after using it for multiple tanning sessions it did about as much as my other tanning lotion.  I am going to try the x100 by millenium and see if its better but who knows.  At least I know what I have always used ~Designer Skin Obsidian, will work.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got this lotion after reading all the good reviews. I&#x27;ll be honest, I used it once and smelled so bad after getting out of the tanning bed. 15 minutes in a tanning bed with this lotion on me made me want to vomit. I went home and immediately took a shower. Not to mention threw out the lotion. I wont buy this ever again.</li>
            <li> The product works okay, I haven&#x27;t noticed that it works any better than any other lotion. My big concern is that the bottle had no seal on it, so how do I know that it wasn&#x27;t filled with just a cheap lotion that has no tanning effects at all?  I guess that&#x27;s why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I have tried other lotions this is very nice and smells great the price is very good also you cant go wrong......</li>
            <li> ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time! I work at a gym/tan salon and own my own bed, I wouldnt go anywhere but here!</li>
            <li> not quite as dark as I hoped</li>
            <li> This product smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that icky tanning bed smell. It&#x27;s non greasy too. I think it does a good job with enhancing my tan since most people can notice I&#x27;ve tanned after only a couple tanning visits.</li>
            <li> I go tanning almost everyday...I absolutely love this product...leaves my skin moisturized &amp; smelling wonderful...&amp; I acheive the prefect desired color that I love with this lotion/bronzer!</li>
            <li> good lotion, lasted a long time, not extremely smelly and no glitter (always a plus). Always count on Amazon for a good deal on what you need when you need it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a cheap lotion.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price! Everyone always ask why is was so cheap compared to the tanning salon prices of 50-60 bucks. Not sure why but I like the cheap price and it seems to work great. The salon workers always worn me of fakes but I feel that is just another fear based marketing scam to take people&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  It worked out really great and would reco this to anyone trying to get a good base</li>
            <li> Works very good, wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but now I&#x27;m looking more colored than before :)</li>
            <li> It smells good, but I&#x27;d thought it would have a tingle and it didn&#x27;t. Works for darkening, so it is functional; I just love the tingle factor.</li>
            <li> Works well. Smells decent.</li>
            <li> Product works if you use it everyday.After one day of not using you start fading.The smell not bad if you stay away from everybody.I&#x27;m not real happy with this product but others are so i guess for some it works fine but not for me.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer my Pauly D that I usually use</li>
            <li> I saw no difference after a month, and I am pretty fair skinned. All it did was make me smell good.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as dark of a bronzer as I was expecting and I went through this bottle very fast.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles of this stuff. I have used this before! Great product and the price blew me away!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it. The smell is great too.......well if you like tannin lotion smell like I do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bottle for almost a year now and have used it weekly for the past 6 mths. I don&#x27;t know what everyone else is talking about a &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; scent, but NO it does not. Not mine. I don&#x27;t like the smell and I noticed after I tan, it smells worse. (Not my B.O.) I usually come home and shower but I have read that doing that is not good for developing my tan. So I am switching to another tanning lotion (JWOWW). I don&#x27;t think mine is expired but who knows, I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and I needed a lotion that will bronze me and not just make me red or burned. This is awesome! I have never looked so tan and my skin feels amazing when using this! The bottle is big and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for a LONG time...never thought to check Amazon!  I use it for regular tanning outside...not tanning beds.  Works great and bought two bottles!</li>
            <li> Used it every day for a week, didn&#x27;t do a thing. I bought this item because of it&#x27;s popularity on amazon, it cost me 21$ including shipping, but broke my heart. I use Johnson&#x27;s Baby sleeping lotion that gives me tan from the first day and costs 2$ at my local store. My friend who tans easily used it also, but without result. I don&#x27;t know maybe I got the fake one, but it&#x27;s obvious that it didn&#x27;t work for me so be careful.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years.  The last few years, I decided to save my tanning bed money and I strictly tan&lt;br /&gt;outside in the pool.  I love this lotion and I will not use anything else ever again.  I work 6 days a week and am&lt;br /&gt;only able to lay in the pool on Sundays.  My tan is a gorgeous dark brown, my husband calls me his dark brown sugar.&lt;br /&gt;My tan does not fade during the week, my color glows daily.  I have always had trouble with my hands and feet tanning&lt;br /&gt;as dark as the rest of me, but not with Paint It Black.  My hands, feet, fingers and toes are as brown as the rest of me.  The smell is very refreshing and this lotion keeps your skin from drying out from being in the sun.  I have bought 4 bottles this summer and I will be a repeat customer next summer...........</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and assumed because I tan fast/well that I would get the good results I read about with this lotion. However when using it I did not notice any real difference in my tan, not even immediately after tanning. Some lotions I see at least an accelerated color right after tanning but with this lotion I only got a slight difference in my tan from the session, it was much less than with a 2 year old bottle of Hempology by California tan. Think I will just order a new bottle of Hempology.</li>
            <li> I havent been in a tanning bed all summer, and grew a nice farmer tan. After that started fading in the past 3 weeks with fall starting, i thought id get back to fake baking to maintain a fall/winter tan. With the shirt off, im pretty white. I&#x27;ve used Paint It Black for only two sessions so far in \\&quot;10min beds\\&quot; and ive gotten a nice base tan already! Im pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than the salons prices, same lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell. (Think vanilla/coconut) Im a guy and i dont mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a session, the silicone leaves  your skin very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great color results, Natural looking tan, not oompa-loompa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im 6ft, 200lbs...i dont think the 13.5oz bottle will last me too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest this lotion to anyone looking for a good indoor tanning product.</li>
            <li> I bought paint it black because I was not willing to spend 90 dollars on tanning lotions at the tanning salon! This product smells nice and helps give you great color! Especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to say that i am an avid tanner, the girls on Jersey Shore have nothing on me and this is the best lotion i have ever used and i&#x27;ve tried them all. i&#x27;ve paid fifty and sixty dollars for lotions then couldn&#x27;t even hold a candle to this. it doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell that a lot of them have and it goes on smoothly. the results are amazing as well, i noticed a big difference after just the first few times using it. definately buy it from amazon because salons ask about triple what they do.</li>
            <li> I just received my lotion today. My tanning salon closes early, but I was so anxious to try it, I payed for a single session at a salon that&#x27;s open a little later. I only payed to use a level 1 bed (I&#x27;m usually in a level 3), but noticed I was definitely a little darker immediately after only one use. I didn&#x27;t even go the full time. The lotion smells great, and I didn&#x27;t notice any ATO. It is very light, and went on very easily. My skin seemed to absorb it quickly. I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it. After just one use, I can say it is a great product, especially for the price. I also received Millennium&#x27;s Black Storm - can&#x27;t wait to give that one a go as well. Definitely recommend Paint It Black. :)</li>
            <li> Paint it black sun tan lotion is the best value for the money , my wife used it and she never tans and with this sun tan lotion she did ,looks like she just came back from the beach , I used it all so and it made me look like I just came back from the tropics , I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would work great and smell great too, this was perfect. I read the reviews on it and decided for the price it was a good gamble. I&#x27;m glad I did! The tanning salon I was going to was selling this for $80+. I bought this as well as the Australian Gold Body Kisses Daily Moisturizer to put on after tanning and they worked very well together.  Very great product, I see some complain about the smell of Paint it Black but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad atleast not to me and to a few others I know.</li>
            <li> Results were great but just didn&#x27;t like the smell afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! &amp; it smells so good! Worst part of tanning is how you smell afterward...with this stuff you still smell delicious after! and can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! It has such a good smell, gets you tanner faster, and my skin feels great afterwards!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00147FGJ8 NEW 2008 Paint It Black 50X Auto-Darkening Dark Tanning Lotion - 13.5oz]]This product is not bad but I don&#x27;t feel like it is as good as the \\&quot;Back in Blaque\\&quot; which is only 20X instead of 50X.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of tanning lotion from this seller, and I&#x27;m *sold*!  Fantastic service, awesome pricing, and... well... I will most definitely be back again and again!  Did I mention I got my order in three days?  Can&#x27;t beat the price or the service!</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and we only carry certain lotions i went outside the salon looking for a good bronzer and i decided on this product the 50X bronzers are amazing i found that your results wont be instant but a few hours later you will see the bronzing effect not to mention the silicone in this lotion leaves your skin soooo soft and it amells great! overall its a great product i would recamend it to any of my customers</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product after reading reviews.  It looks great right after I get out of the bed...but in a few hours it fades.  I have olive toned skin and it just didn&#x27;t have the darkening effect I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty advanced tanner, and I have been tanning for many years so I have tried LOTS of lotions.  The smell isn&#x27;t spectacular, but it isn&#x27;t offensive like some I&#x27;ve tried (\\&quot;What smells like burnt chicken?  Oh, it&#x27;s me...\\&quot;).  Unlike some lotions, you can continue to run errands after tanning and feel confident knowing that people are staring at you for other reasons aside from your \\&quot;just tanned\\&quot; odor :)  The best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve tried is Black Diamond, but I think that only because it reminds me of the Perfume Pretty Barbie I had when I was little (don&#x27;t judge me, you know you had her too!).  I do indeed love the texture and consistency of the Paint It Black.  Some lotions are too thick and take FOR EVER to put on.  This stuff slips right on, and it doesn&#x27;t take a long time for it to smooth out and soak in.  A+ for that.  Now, the color... I&#x27;m a tingle person, but I thought I would give this a try since everyone and their dog seems to love it.  I&#x27;m not overly impressed with my results.  Non-tingle people may love it, but I&#x27;m used to being lobster red when I leave the salon, stinging for hours aferward, and having to blot myself dry after I finally shower it off (you gotta give the bronzers time to work yo!)  For tingle people, I had awesome ONE-USE results from Bombshell.  It&#x27;s marketed as if it will singe your skin off, but really, the Black Diamond was WAAAAY more painful.  I&#x27;m a glutton for punishment, apparently.  Anyway, I was using Black Diamond which is ok, tried the Bombshell and was fairly dark after just one use, but I&#x27;m just not seeing the hyped up results with the Paint It Black. Next time around, I&#x27;ll be buying the Bombshell.</li>
            <li> I love the bronzer, it really gives you a little golden look as soon as you step out of the bed. I have not ever got this dark so quickly before. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.  Could not tell a remarkable difference after 5 sessions.  I will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on tuesday and got it friday, the packaging was good. Okay so the lotion i love that it feels soooo amazing because of the silcones in it, when i got out of the tanning bed, i seen a slight difference. Mind you when i got this product i also got bombshell tingle lotion 100XX and i got hooked and used that first, so i got spoiled with the tingle and didnt even give this one a chance. But maybe for someone else it will have better results, everyone is different. but with that said its a great product and smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion was manly enough for me to use at the gym tanning booths.  Fortunately the bottle is black and has a skull on it, so I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed carrying it around either!  It doesn&#x27;t smell feminine at all, especially not after you&#x27;ve baked for 15  minutes.  Wish I could darken a little more with this product as I have with others.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of tanning lotions and this one is seriously my favorite. I&#x27;ve repurchased it 10+ times, and have even got friends hooked on it as well. Gives you an instant boost of color after your first tan. Doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like tanning lotion afterwards. Love it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok...not as dark as I thought I would get, and I already had a base.</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion is the sh*t!!! it really is! after 20 minutes in the sun you get awesome color! I love this product</li>
            <li> Used it a couple times it sucks no results from it</li>
            <li> It says 50x bronzer... But after 4 sessions i did not notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a packet of lotion from the tanning place with only 14x bronzer and i noticed it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wont buy again</li>
            <li> This is a good product to use. It gets you a dark tan, however may stain your hands.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is not worth buying a second time around</li>
            <li> I read reviews and really focused on the bad ones before I tried this product. I want to first speak of some of the reviews I saw that ill answer with my experince. It isnt Build A Tan product those who bought it for that deserve what they got. Smell Im not fond of the smell but its not bad just not really amazing like all the hipe One thing that is cool is i personally find the smell to be unisex (as in it wouldnt be weird to smell like this product being a guy or girl). Does it help? Amazingly!!! Wow I ran out of a 45 dollar bottle I dont have on hand that I got from my Tanning spot. It worked pretty good but due to price and results it wasnt the greatest. I got this product and WOW its great. 20 bucks +- shipped this is an amazing tanning lotion. It really helps with the tanning and it leaves your skin feeling great. Also I find putting it on a day before tanning and the day after really helps with results.</li>
            <li> I generally go to the tanning bed all year round and had stopped using any tan lotions at all because I found that I get just as dark without them, and it looks much more natural. I stopped going to the tanning bed for a few months and lost nearly all of my tan. While just looking around on here I came across this product and the reviews peeked my interests so I decided to give it a shot, because of the low price and high reviews. The first thing I want to say after using this lotion for about a week is that the product description word for word couldn&#x27;t be more accurate. It does everything that the company claims it will. Love the scent, love the way my skin feels after using it, love how fast I got my tan back. Not saying this product will work for everyone, but it certainly did for me. I am ordering my second bottle now because I dont want to run out!</li>
            <li> The lotion arrived in a timely manner. It was in a sealed bottle so I knew it was new. It worked great and smelled great too.</li>
            <li> Worked great and darkened me up really quickly and smells nice too. I didn&#x27;t have any skin issues with this tanning lotion and I have no complaints for the price.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve only tanned with this lotion once so far but I felt like I got decent color from it.  Also smells great even after tanning.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I use it in addition to masquerade. Switching the two up gives me a really nice color. One thing that I am not too crazy about is the smell. It kind of smells like skittles.. If that makes any since.</li>
            <li> I got the lotion fast. Everything was perfect! It was clearly brand new like it was stated because the packaging was unopened. Everything went great! Two thumbs up! And this product works fantastic!!!!! It made me tan in barely a few sessions! :)</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this and I decided to try it and I think it is a great product, will buy more!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell even after tanning and the smoothness of this lotion allows it to go on easy.  It does not streak either.  I was expecting it to have more effect faster but I am pleased with the results I got.</li>
            <li> I got this to try because it got really good reviews so I thought I would try it out and I really liked it I got a nice tan from using it overall really liked it.</li>
            <li> If you are having a hard time achieving a tan, or would like to tan quickly for a low price... this one is for YOU! Not crazy about the smell, but is definately decent enough to handle! Always wash your hands with use, especially in between the fingers as I always noticed an orange tint in that area. The color you achieve always lasts for a good bit!</li>
            <li> I had to return this product because the first time I used it, I had terrible itching reaction.  I would not recommend it. Better stick to other well known brands.</li>
            <li> I give Paint it Black 4 stars because it does its job nicely for a great price! I usually buy Designer Skin but my last purchase made me splotchy, and as you know those lotions aren&#x27;t cheap. So with Paint it Black it goes on easily and smells good before tanning, but for some reason after the tanning bed I just smell AWFUL (reminiscent of cooked skin), but because of the great price I can bypass that factor. Tanning wise, I did notice an accelerated tan within 3 sessions.</li>
            <li> I was given this lotion by a friend, and I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about it. But I saw nothing good about it! It smells okay, but my tan actually faded using this product. I never got any darker, and it halted the entire tanning process. It looks and sounds good..but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Paint it black tanning lotion works great I was very white and now have a beautiful tan I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments:)  Seller was also great! Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Love it. 2nd time buying. This is quality for price point.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;tingler&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It smelt really good but I never noticed a difference in my tan, and I got a bigger size but I felt like I ran out really quick.</li>
            <li> It was a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Works really well. The smell is nice too. I have used other products from Millenium and this is by far my favorite. The bronzers in it are strong, but not so much that it leaves steaks. I did however notice that I had some streakiness along the sides of my hands, but that was due to washing my hands immediately after tanning. Once I stopped that the streaks went away and evened out. Another nice thing about this is a little goes a long way. This bottle lasted quite awhile because I didn&#x27;t need to use tons. All in all a pretty great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome tanning lotion and it&#x27;s smells great!</li>
            <li> Wanna get a good dark tan? Buy this!!! I went from white bread to wheat thin in two sessions.</li>
            <li> Went on smooth, absorbed quickly. Nice bronze color, not orange at all. Smell reminded me of lemon meringue. No ATO. My boyfriend said I smelled good. Left my skin remarkably soft! Will definitely buy again !</li>
            <li> I love the way it spells and works just fine  , I have been buying tanning lotions from places I use to go to Tanning and I saw same product witch I bought for $20  for $55  wowww I was shocked and very happy that I bought from AMAZON</li>
            <li> Like the amplifying amount of sun. I can tan weekly or monthly. After initial burn, tan develops very well indeed.</li>
            <li> This lotion is ok.  didnt tan as dark as I wanted to.  It smells good though.  Just would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice in the bottle, would agree it smells sweet like sugar/vanilla. Not the best smell after tanning, I feel like I can still smell that &amp;#34; tanned skin&amp;#34; smell after tanning. It is very moisturizing. In the tanning bed after a few minutes my skin was wet/ sweaty from this product (this has not happened to me with other products). Did it work- yes after one use I am noticeably tanned. My skin type is fair, but able to get tan by going slow in the beds. Would I re purchase? No, but its not a bad price.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST TANNING LOTION I HAVE EVER USED, AND EVEN BETTER THAT I FOUND IT AT SUCH A LOW PRICE! I HAVE RECOMMENDED TO ALL MY FRIENDS!</li>
            <li> not sure havent had chance to use fully im sure it will be fine i do belive i used a couple years ago livin in arizona pretty much all the good lotions work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for decades and used a looooot of lotions but since i started ordering from amazon none of the lotions are even close to those from salons..they are fake,,mixed with god knows what,,many of you are attracted to fruity scents but thatsvthe last thing u should look at....</li>
            <li> I have used paint it black for 2 days now, and already i am much darker than i was (without using a lotion). I love the smell of it, the moisture it provides, but this product does break out my skin. I do not have sensitive skin. I do not have any \\&quot;known\\&quot; allergies, and both times ive used it, my stomach and chest has broken out in little red bumps. I suggest using a smaller pouch of this product before purchasing the bottle to make sure you wont break out from it.</li>
            <li> . . . the only issue for me is the fragrance. It&#x27;s nice enough when applied, but the smell of cooked sugar stays on my skin for hours and hours after tanning. I&#x27;m go back to Hardcore Black 30X by Australian Gold.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product. I used it at the tanning salon for the time today. For a lotion without tingle it works exceptionally well. I would very much recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pasty to begin with so when I seen this and all the good reviews I had to try it...now almost a month later iv got a beautiful tan going on and I&#x27;m very pleased with this lotion it smells wonderful and feels great on my skin</li>
            <li> Not enough bronzing in product and im fair skin</li>
            <li> Works great for indoor and outdoor tanning</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned in a tanning bed in several years.  Therefore, I am not that familiar with the lotions on the market.  I bought this based on the Amazon reviews, and I have a very nice color after one month of tanning.  I am very fair-skinned and tan well once I get going but it does take a while for me to get color.  I think this lotion has probably done a fine job of accelerating the tan.</li>
            <li> great bronzing lotion</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it has a unique fragrance. I don&#x27;t use it every day so the darkening factor I don&#x27;t notice much.</li>
            <li> Product was a described, but I&#x27;m just not a fan of the lotion.  It didn&#x27;t seem to help the tanning process at all.  Didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again.  (not amazon&#x27;s fault... just not a fan of the lotion)</li>
            <li> Most awesome tanning lotion ever</li>
            <li> Smells great, using this has got me the darkest i have ever been, not a single bad thing i can say about this tanning oil!! will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> love this lotions works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only one my dad will use. It works and smells great!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin. I&#x27;m blonde with freckles. This hasn&#x27;t helped speed up my tanning or maintain it. Very disappointed. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells great! The product is worth the purchase. I&#x27;m already getting darker because of the product. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am new to indoor tanning and wanted a lotion that had high remarks... I decided to buys this one based off the amazon reviews and it was such a great decision!!! I LOVEEEE this lotion! It gives me such a nice tan while leaving my skin feeling super soft and smelling great! I have gotten a ton of compliments on how great it smells! I will definitely be purchasing this lotion again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and I love it! It gives me a dark tan and it&#x27;s not ridiculously overpriced like some of the other tanning lotions around.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.  Maybe it got to hot and broke down the bronzers or something while shipping, smelled good, felt good but didnt do a thing for my tan.</li>
            <li> feels soft on my skin</li>
            <li> This product was delivered without a cap to the bottle which resulted in a messy package and I&#x27;m not sure if I even want to use it since it&#x27;s clearly not even sealed. There&#x27;s not even a cap to the bottle anywhere in the box. Very disappointed in this purchase and unfortunate because I was very excited to try this lotion!</li>
            <li> This stuff really is great for the price, love the smell and texture.. It really gets you hard VERY quickly I could tell after my first use! Not greasy and no unpleasant after tanning smell! Def worth 13 dollars ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got that fake cloying smell, like plasic plus baby powder airfreshner.. I can&#x27;t use it.. as for the actual tanning I can&#x27;t say.. it stinks to much..</li>
            <li> Most of these reviews are fake, like every other review on amazon /: But this stuff is just like every other tanning lotion that comes in a cool hip bottle. It smells like tanning lotion, nothing special about it. Unless you put the lotion on one leg and not the other to test the results...then you can&#x27;t say \\&quot; It&#x27;s the best tanning lotion ever!!! \\&quot;</li>
            <li> Im getting married in 2 months so i thought i better start getting my tan on so i purchased this product from Green Web Inc. Im a redhead so i cant get tan without the bronze. Ive went tanning off and on for 3 weeks now thinking what the heck! There is no bronzer in this bottle and quite frankly im frightened because what have i been rubbing on my skin.Im so disappointed ive wasted 3 weeks and however many dollars later for nothing.This makes me question Amazon and i dont think ill be ordering anything else period.</li>
            <li> For the price this tanning lotion is good! It&#x27;s not my fav but does the job and doesn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards either!</li>
            <li> Now this is a product I Love!! Bronzes you up beautifully, and leaves your skin silky soft all summer! It&#x27;s all I Use!!! A Must Try!!:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused by all of the positive reviews of this lotion, because I unfortunately did not see much of a difference when I used it, whereas other lotions like Legs make a big difference.</li>
            <li> This lotion gives a great colors for indoor tanning.  It will take you color and boost it right up. The smell is great and texture feels great on your skin. I use with a tingle lotion by the same company and they magic together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for months and never had any problems with it! I recently wanted to take it to the next level so I got Solid Black.&lt;br /&gt;After a few times using Solid Black, I got streaky and orangey. So I went tanning for a few sessions without any lotion to get my tan even again and now I&#x27;m back to using Paint It Black. Can never go wrong with using it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! And they sell the same one at my tanning salon for 100 dollars. This is a huge deal! I will never buy my tanning lotion anywhere else!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion smells great. I could tell a difference after using It only a few times. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy new lotion. The price is great also. :)</li>
            <li> Much better than paying $100 for paying for same thing at tanning salon. Sealed perfectly so no leaks.  Will book mark u for future purchases. Got here very fast.</li>
            <li> purchased this for my sister. She loves it for tanning</li>
            <li> would recommend it to anyone frenda family because it does great laying in tanning bed or not.quick use for vacations and the beach.</li>
            <li> It seems to help somewhat but it&#x27;s  not my favorite</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a basic, good tanning lotion- this is it. I have bought lotions for way too much money in the past and this product is a LOT less and I get the same results. Smells like a tanning lotion, its not bad (i have had worse) but its still a tanning lotion. Big bottle- i would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good lotion! Indoor tanning and outdoor! I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will buy it again.  The price is awesome too.</li>
            <li> I chose this product after searching out a product that wasn&#x27;t overly priced yet produced quality results.  I had somewhat of a base tan and have been trying to enrich my tan for an upcoming wedding that I am in.  I tan approximately 1-2 times a week in a high intesity bed.  While the lotion is moisurizing and does leave your skin smelling good - not like your typical tanning chemicals.  I have not really seen the dark and amazing results others have spoken of. While I have gotten a little darker, The reviews I read implied that I would be a golden goddess in no time.  Decent product - I have paid a lot more for products in the past. Just expected a little more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> Works very well for an inexpensive lotion, only downside it it leaves a burnt smell after tanning.  Nice deal otherwise.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when the lotion arrived two days earlier than I had expected! I have only used it once, but so far so good! It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t linger on you after you&#x27;ve used it. I would recommend this lotion! It&#x27;s a good product, at an even better price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked in a tanning salon for a few years, so I know my lotions - Paint it Black is up there in my top 5!!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is wonderful, and the texture so creamy - makes skin so soft&lt;br /&gt;I was super impressed with the colour as well... noticed a difference on the second tanning session.  The application doesn&#x27;t streak and the colour is the perfect sun kissed bronze! (not orangey at all!)&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY sensitive skin also, and have had no reaction to this lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is so highly rated.  I&#x27;ve been using this lotion in a mega bronzing bed and I have not seen any results.  I know that it&#x27;s not me because I used to work in a tanning salon and I got dark with other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not worth buying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all what the reviews commented on. I use a 30X Bronzer which works twice as well as this. I only bought this because they were out of stock on mine, and I needed something to use in the mean time. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Obviously for the price, this lotion is not as good as the more expensive brands. However, I had a tanning membership for only a month and this got the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. I use it in the stand up bed, and outside at the pool. I&#x27;ve never really had anything bad to say about it. It smells yum, good price, gets you dark after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I noticed is if you dont exfoliate often while using this lotion you will get peeling  shedding skin, and your color will come off too!! So exfoliate before, and after every tan session.</li>
            <li> Applies easily and makes your skin feel really smooth. I don&#x27;t find it stains either my clothes or hands but I wait until it dries to get dressed and wash my hands as soon as I finish applying. Great product for a really dark tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and works great. No complaints</li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well!</li>
            <li> Really love. Helps get that deep tan you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even been tanning an entire month and it looks like I&#x27;ve been tanning for several. This lotion is awesome. I was nervous to purchase it because I&#x27;m pretty pale and don&#x27;t tan really easily. After about an hour of research and looking up reviews (sigh...I know), I went with this one. It arrived in the mail quickly. I don&#x27;t think any lotions come sealed...perhaps Im wrong, but mine didn&#x27;t. Anyway, I&#x27;m sold and sticking with the brand unless I stumble upon something better. I&#x27;m looking for the Millenium brand maximizer now that I&#x27;ve got a great base tan. Any recommendations?</li>
            <li> Works great, makes me smell great when I get done tanning. I just wish I would&#x27;ve gotten the darker kind.</li>
            <li> I like this product although I don&#x27;t have much experience with tanning.  This is my first tanning bed tanner and it works well.  Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. As for the tingle factor.....pretty weak compared to some other brands that I&#x27;ve purchased! Delivery was very quick though...that&#x27;s always nice:)</li>
            <li> much cheaper than at the tanning salon and works great. best stuff you can get. goes on welll and isnt sticky</li>
            <li> I am a regular tanning customer and I normally buy the expensive tanning cream.  I am glad that I agave this a tried because this works just a good as a 80 dollar bottle.  you wont regret the buy.</li>
            <li> I think it smells great. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and it&#x27;s making me a little darker. My husband has olive skin and it didn&#x27;t really help him tanning, but I like it. Ive only used it a couple times though. So far so good</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times. I like the smell and the results. Everybody has different tastes buit for me this is a great product and I get fast results. I will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the price.  It wasn&#x27;t as amazing as I had hoped but still a great product.  It has a light floral smell.</li>
            <li> I was scared to try this product after some of the reviews but I took the chance anyways. It was sold and shipped from Amazon warehouse. It works ok I noticed results after the first use with a ten minute session.</li>
            <li> I have tried this lotion every time I go tanning and to me I do not see it working at all.</li>
            <li> finally getting the dark tan i was looking for!! after only 2 times of using the tanning lotion I was noticably darker!</li>
            <li> IM NOT GETTING THE RESULTS I THOUGHT I WOULD RECEIVE FROM THIS TANNING LOTION BUT ITS OK , THE SHIN FIMING IN THIS IS GREAT</li>
            <li> One of the best bronzers I&#x27;ve ever used, smells like marshmallows when you get out of the tanning bed. Kinda odd but I live marshmallows. :)</li>
            <li> this is my second bottle of this stuff. It works great and smells good too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product about 4 times. I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned so it takes longer for me to tan but so far I like this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand before and was happy.  I tried this one and it actually get me a LOT darker in the same beds.  Will be sticking with this from now on.</li>
            <li> The stuff really works! I lay out sometimes and I use the tanning bed sometimes but it doesn&#x27;t matter the Auto-darkening lotion works well with either method. Seems to get you dark in half the time of other products. Worth the money if you want a beautiful dark tan.</li>
            <li> I love the color this gives me!! Its not orange at all like a lot of lotions do...it give you that dark tan that a lot of women want!!! And it does it fast too i was dark after the first 3 uses!!</li>
            <li> good product although ppl have warned me many times not to buy tanning lotion off line this one did not have anything wrong with it. wasnt switched with urine or anything.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion twice in one week and am already a few shades darker. I have never gotten this dark this fast! I usually purchase my lotion from the salon that I tan at which usually cost up to $100. I can no longer afford to blow that much money on one bottle of lotion so I decided to purchase from amazon. This was better than some of the expensive lotions I had purchased in that past. Definitely going to buy this one again!</li>
            <li> works well for me and the other two people i have leant it to, and it was a very good price (around $10 if i recall correctly).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference when using this product. It also has a strange smell that wasn&#x27;t appealing to me. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this lotion. I could see a noticeable difference in just a few tanning visits. I love the fast results!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion, not only am I of Irish descent and is very faired skin but my skin is ver sensitive to products. I used Paint It Black and it was awesome I tanned in a couple of sessions and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about skin irratation. The smell is incredible and it leaves your skin silky smooth to the touch. After using Paint It Black I will never go back to normal tanning lotion. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great smell...  Skin feels great after using this product....  Seems to work well...  Overall happy with product!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is the best!! Not only do you get really dark but the tan lasts a long time.  That means less trips to the Tanning Bed.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used. I have been using a tanning bed for 5 years and never have I gotten such a dark tan. It keeps skin soft and right after you look very tan with a glow and the tan does stay. I would recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion works well with my fair skin tone and has a light after scent. Also, the delivery service was exceptional. I received the product a few days before the projected delivery date. Overall satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very excited to use this product just haven&#x27;t yet. ): it smells yummy though. Ill let you know how it works:)</li>
            <li> Love it, not greasy and smells really nice.  I would recommend this products to friends and family.  The price is good as well</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Smells like vanilla sugar. The lotion was delivered with in only a couple days! I have fair skin and have used this in tanning bed and haven&#x27;t burnt at all, just TAN!</li>
            <li> great product and service. arrived when they said it would and product did all it said it would do. smell wasn&#x27;t bad either like lots of others.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last week and it worked great! I went for a motorcycle ride and wore a tube top and put it on my shoulders.  I burned a little bit bc I was in the sun ALL day but it wasnt bad and the lotion helped a lot! It smells good and makes your skin silky soft!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more bronzing effect from this lotion. It works fine as a moisturizing tanning lotion but thats about it. Oh, and no it doesnt smell good.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not smell bad like some others. and good moisture. But i thought cause had a lot  bronzer  i would get more dark and did&#x27;nt from some other lotions i have tryed all though the price is a steal. So i will finsh the bottle try something new.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this product.  I had similar results with other products that I was able to purchase at the Grocery Store.</li>
            <li> I am naturally fair skinned with auburn hair. The sun is traditionally my enemy. So before I go somewhere warm I try to develop a base tan to prevent 3rd degree beach burns. I love Paint in Black. For the price you can&#x27;t beat the results. I have developed a nice, subtle base tan with no burning. The lotion moisturizes well and smells good. When I leave the tanner I don&#x27;t seem to have that tanner smell that so many lotions leave in their wake. Overall, I think this is a fantastic tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell, awesome results.  Was really impressed by the quality and also, the fact that you can use this both indoors and when tanning outside.</li>
            <li> So I was ghost pale. I used this for like a month and I became very tan. It works very well. It has a great smell I guess for a tanning lotion. It tanned everything well but my arms.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. No orange look, smells good and helps get ur tan there in no time!</li>
            <li> I have a really difficult time finding a tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave me with that funky &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; smell.  This lotion is great...works great and smells awesome.  No after tan smell.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of difference in my tan.  I already had a tan and thought this might darken it.  So far not much difference.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, for a decent price.. You actually get a lot of bang for your buck. Works quickly, and gives you a nice tan glow.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!! Tans great outside(I don&#x27;t use tanning beds) smells good, and leaves my skin very soft. Good deal for the price!! I use it year-round.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a horrible rash wity hives after one use. Something in this product is not right I can&#x27;t even get a refund because I threw the bottle out</li>
            <li> Love it. Not alot of time for tanning anymore these days&lt;br /&gt;but with this Lotion it makes the most of my few moments&lt;br /&gt;Nice rich color lasts longer than I thought it Would</li>
            <li> I wanted to love the product. However, for 1 month of Level 1 tanning, 2-3 x a week, I was Not getting any darker! I had hoped for exceptional results, and didn&#x27;t even get minimal results. My friend hadn&#x27;t seen me in a month and I wasn&#x27;t darker. It smells good, is a nice size bottle, but that&#x27;s about it. How do I return?</li>
            <li> Love! Smells amazing! Great price! Great results! Quick results! I use it everyday for two weeks, lay for 15 to 20 minutes and never burn!</li>
            <li> i am not very tan but i used this a few times and it helped tone my skin and get it a little darker it made me look natural the areas it works best on are the arms stomach chest and back the legs take time i reccomend using a stronger tanning lotion for the legs and other parts of the body if you are looking for a very dark tan this is a great beginner tanning lotion smells great</li>
            <li> Not that appealing of a scent. Does not do well as far as a bronzer go.</li>
            <li> This was no lie! I&#x27;m fair and this worked great w/ indoor tanning sessions.  You should see results w/ in a wk or two max.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great discount on Amazon! I am fair skinned and in 5 tanning sessions with this product already have people acknowledging how &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; I am! Goes on smooth like body lotion and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> tan didnt last long....think it was not stored correctly</li>
            <li> I rated the Paint It Black 50x five stars because I am obviously very satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fairly new tanner, and had finally developed a solid base tan using a light tingler that was recommended to me by one of the workers at the salon. The first two to three weeks using tinglers I was absolutely miserable. Itchy, red, irritable, cranky.. The itching was terrible. There were two nights that I absolutely could not sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After FINALLY finishing that bottle of the tingling lotion, I decided I would switch to something with a bronzing effect. I decided Paint It Black after reading mulitple reviews. I was anxious to try it, and with good reason. I LOVE it. I love the way it smells, feels, and the GRADUAL bronzing effect it delivers. My skin looks good! And I&#x27;m not irritable at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like the warm brown sugar scents from Bath and Body Works. My boyfriend absolutely loves the smell. It also leaves my skin feeling silky smoth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no complaints here. I will also add that if you&#x27;re looking for a bronzer with more instant effects, this is not the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles of this Paint It Black 50X Tanning Lotion at one time just because of the ingredients that are in this product, and was I ever so happy I did because this technology is the Grreatest break through in the Tanning Lotion Industry it&#x27;s like Beauty in a bottle, you get a natural bronze tan with an awesome after tan smell and absolutely  devine, smooth and silky skin. Thank you Millennium for such a great invention.</li>
            <li> This lotion was 1. priced just right 2. Leaves your skin feeling very soft, even when you shower you can feel it coming off. 3. The smell is not overpowering; and not tropical like most lotions. 4. Gave me a base tan in about 3 weeks, and I am very hard to tan.     Overall I give this product a 4 only b/c once I was done with the bottle I was at a tanning plateau and needed something different. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this through lotion through amazon, from a-z tanning wholesale and the bottle and cap are different. Other than that, the lotion leaves my skin very soft and after I shower. As for it tanning enhancers I didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic increase of color, pretty much normal rate. Overall I will go back to supre smoke even though its smaller its definetely my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sizzle lotion. It&#x27;s fragrance is not bad though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for about 2 months now and this is the 3rd lotion I&#x27;ve tried. After going about 3x a week and not seeing much result as quickly as I wanted to (I&#x27;m getting married next summer/have engagement pics coming up soon and don&#x27;t want to look like Casper), I decided to look for a lotion that would make me darker more quickly. If you&#x27;re worried this will make you too dark too fast, don&#x27;t be. It has gotten me considerably darker since I started using it (I started out about as pale as you can get), enough that I notice a difference everytime I tan, but it&#x27;s a gradual difference. My only complaint is that it does seem to have a TINY orange tint to it, but not enough that anyone will notice. I&#x27;d recommend this lotion if you&#x27;re looking to get color quickly, but not so dramatically that it&#x27;ll look like you spray tanned over night.</li>
            <li> I have never really been an avid user of expensive indoor tanning lotions. I tan fairly easily but had not been indoor tanning in a few years. I haven&#x27;t found this lotion to increase my tan noticeably; on that same note, there is nothing that I dislike with this lotion either. The scent is pleasant. Overall, worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Well I had high expectations for this one and they failed me. I don&#x27;t care for the scent and the lotion is watery/thin. Takes for ever to dry and did not increase my tan at all.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion of all time! Only use this when you have a really good base tan because it does have a high power bronzer. The smell is really nice. It&#x27;s not too strong either so I don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a salon all day. This is my favorite tanning lotion of all time. Definetly reccomending this to everyone who tans on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Really good, dark tanning lotion. You don&#x27;t get orange hands, and it smells really clean and cottony, which helps prevent a more burnt skin smell you get when using fruit scented lotions. Very blendable and goes a long way while moisturizing at the same time. Good touch up lotion if your someone who doesn&#x27;t go regularly. Gives you noticeable color after a use or 2 and keeps helping you get darker. Would defiantly recommend to anyone, beginner or advanced tanner and its a super good price.Dont let the cheap proce fool you, it is high quality.</li>
            <li> I thought i would give this a try because it was a pretty good price for tanning lotion and had good reviews, but i was wrong about it. This doesn&#x27;t intensify my tanning what so ever. i feel like im better of just using baby oil. Try a different lotion!!</li>
            <li> I am very very pale and recently started using a tanning bed about two months ago. I had used some other tan accelerators to get my tan going, but after a month and a half I began using this. It definitely has made me much darker in just a short time using it. It smells good and absorbs into the skin fast. Even with my extremely fair complexion, I have already seen my skin getting darker in just a week than I did in a whole month using an Australian Gold product. I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> It has some benefit...ultra hydrating and provides a great tan in 2-3 uses. The smell is the only drawback for me...has a sugary smell to it that isn&#x27;t quite vanilla but isn&#x27;t quite coconut either. Not bad when you first apply, but after tanning...kind of has a bad smell to it. You&#x27;ll need to shower shortly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the tanning qualities, it works great. Have seen results after just a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was so excited to purchase this item. I have been tanning at a salon for a few years now and reached my tanning max, but wanted to get much darker. The seal was broken when I received this product, so I am wondering if it was refilled with something else. It smells really good but does not work at all. I used it a few times at the beach because it says it works great outdoors, but I got no color at all! It almost seemed like I put on spf 50 or something cause it prevented me from getting any color at all and I usually tan very well without lotion at all. Hopefully you have better luck if you purchase this. I recommend the brand Smoke or even Snooki&#x27;s lotion works well too.</li>
            <li> It has a good smell but not sure if it makes me as black as it says it should.....just not so sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion is supposed to have a 50x bronzer! I was better off using store brand I will not be returning</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work well at all, will not purchase this item again. Tried to use it several times didn&#x27;t do a thing to my skin and I am pretty fare skinned.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion primarily because of the large number of positive reviews. I am an avid tanner -- very light natural skin tone but tans easily. Pros: Inexpensive. Very pleasant scent, kind of like brown sugar or cookies. Also, feels great on my skin for the first few hours, very moisturized and silky. Cons: Did not give me any color or make me darker at all whatsoever. There is a slight bronzing effect but it rubbed off somewhat during the day/when I went to bed and of course it all washes right off the moment you take a shower. Even though my skin feels great right after putting it on, about 12 hours later my skin is dry and much more flaky than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use tanning lotion so my arms and legs tan at the same rate as the rest of my body, otherwise my torso becomes much darker than the rest of me (my legs, especially!). This did absolutely nothing to help tan my legs/arms and that is with using it both in the tanning bed and in the sun. So far the best products I&#x27;ve found that keep my legs as tan as the rest of me are ProTan Dangerously Sexy and Australian Gold Funky Monkey. Although those 2 made me(and my legs) quite dark, the ProTan one I like is hard to find and Funky Monkey smells absolutely terrible and is expensive. So for Paint It Black&#x27;s fantastic price and availability I was really REALLY wanting it to work and I really tried to like it but bottom line is it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> The tanning lotion works great. I like the way it smells and I don&#x27;t burn with it. Great price and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> DIDNT WORK FOR ME....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT WAST TIME OR MONEY ON THIS..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I USED IT 3 TIMES AT THE TANNING BED AND YOU COULDNT TELL I HAD USED IT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THREW IT AWAY!!</li>
            <li> The wife and I have used these lotions for indoor tanning for quite sometime. We have had great luck&lt;br /&gt;with this product. It is very silky and smooth. It goes on evenly and has a nice smell. Who wants to spend&lt;br /&gt;$100 when you can spend $15? The paint it black 50x has more of a manly scent, the Black Storm 60X&lt;br /&gt;is my wife&#x27;s favorite, it smells of light perfume.</li>
            <li> Tried this at a friends house and it worked wonderfully. So I bought two bottles so I could share too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, smells amazing and definitely works for tanning. Gives you a great dark tone, no orange look at all. Goes on smooth. Perfect texture and thickness. Love this, will continue to buy it as long as its available!</li>
            <li> works great wife looks tan and dark</li>
            <li> I have used the product for a week and I am fine. Seems to be working well. My wife on the other hand appears to have had an allergic reaction to something in it. Broke out in rash and face is swollen. I am sure that many have used it and are just fine. And having a allergic reaction is not uncommon to products. Just be careful, make sure to test it on yourself as recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this in town for WAY more. I was discouraged when the local tanning shop tried to sell me a packet for EIGHT DOLLARS!&lt;br /&gt;This huge bottle was five bucks more, and it came in TWO days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, like regular body lotion not fruity like other tanning lotions. Works great. BEST DEAL!</li>
            <li> i would NOT SAY it is the best, as it has not done anything after two uses, but it did make my skin feel VERY SMOOTH... I hope more color will show after a couple more uses,,,,,&lt;br /&gt;good thing is , it DOES NOT HAVE TINGLE!!!! :)</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found tanning lotions on amazon for such LOW PRICES! Compared to how much the salons charge for lotions, this is a steal! This lotion is great for anyone who loves a deep, dark tan. I just received it a few days ago and already am darker than I&#x27;ve ever been! Definitely not a lotion that turns you orange or leaves streaks. Would definitely recommend this lotion to anyone!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel very soft, and I thought it smelled really good. It doesn&#x27;t make you orange, or stain your hands. Just a little touch of broze to your skin.</li>
            <li> I strongly favor lotions that have good bronzers in them. This lotion is one of my many favorites. Will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> I did not burn ever using this lotion and I was bale to get a good base tan.  I would say for my intentions of going from ghostly white to nice bronze were accomplished.</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite tanning lotion.  Other reviews claim to have not received the real deal.  My bottle was absolutely the real deal.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion was Okay.  I bought it because the price is not bad compared to some others - so I thought I would give it a try.  I certainly doesn&#x27;t make you darker quickly.  I am always worried about the smell of tanning lotions, and this one didn&#x27;t bother me.  I do not regret trying this product, but in the future will probably be sticking with a different lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion !  It protects well and it&#x27;s making me darken up - and the tan looks natural - like I&#x27;ve been out in the sun all summer.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this lotion.</li>
            <li> This was my first tanning lotion, so maybe I wasn&#x27;t putting enough on or I wasn&#x27;t staying in the tanning booth long enough. It did the job eventually but it was something I would continue using</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference in my tan after using this over almost two months.  Maybe my skin hit it&#x27;s max on color, not exactly sure but to give a small comparison...  I purchased the standard indoor tanning lotion from walmart and besides the textures and smells being different their wasn&#x27;t a result in my tan or skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing/fast transaction! I absolutely love this product &amp; will continue to order it! It has the perfect amount of bronzers &amp; acts as a moistuirzer - leaving my skin golden &amp; silky smooth! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I&#x27;ve purchased some online in the past and they say the smell is pleasant but you get it and it doesnt smell good and certainly doesnt smell good after you tan.  BUT this lotion is wonderful!  It smells very good, and also smells good after you tan.  I&#x27;ve used it twice this week and my tan is amazing!  I&#x27;m a year round tanner, tan at least 3x a week.  Very happy w/ this product!  Glad I purchased it!  Reviews really do help me when ordering a product!</li>
            <li> I have used all types and brands and this is one of my favorites. Doesn&#x27;t leave any bronzer residue on clothes or hands but really works. Everything else made me a little Orange but this is a true brown color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m olive skinned and tan very easily. This product does nothing to enhance or speed up the tanning process. It&#x27;s okay as a moisturizer. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Oh, and the smell isn&#x27;t good. Out of the bottle it&#x27;s okay, but after the booth you need a shower. Skip it for something else</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing. Ideal for sensitive skin. My tan looks incredible and thus lotion helps keep it that way. I&#x27;m definitely a fan.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer! I was noticeably tan after 1 use! This lotion glides on so smoothly because it has a good amount of silcone in it. I was using Supre Sweet and Sexy bronzer and barely got a tan after a couple uses but this bronzer is awesome!! It smells good too!</li>
            <li> This lotion is one of my favorite lotions will buy more love it</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Just rub it on before you get your tan on, look darker in minutes.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I am an avid outdoor tanner. I tried this for the first few weeks after receiving. Saw no extraordinary results. It does have an orange fruity smell, however, does dry out your skin. I am going back to my favorite Hawaiian tanning oil.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I buy it every year.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite tanners</li>
            <li> Love it!!! No tingle, not tooo much bronzer, just perfect.  Tried 3 other ones and went back to this one.  Didn&#x27;t even hardly use the other ones before I ordered another one of this.</li>
            <li> Ordered this via verified Amazon purchase. I. Love. It. It rubs in like a true lotion, which so many other tanning lotions lack. It smells like candy going on and after I&#x27;m done tanning, I smell like a toasted marshmallow.... The irony of this is not lost on me, but it&#x27;s a great smell. The bronzing aspect for 50x isn&#x27;t the darkest in the world but it&#x27;s great for a base tan. I would recommend the 100x for anyone who has hit a plateau. For the record, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with rashes or breaking out. After tanning, I don&#x27;t shower but I do use sea breeze on my face. The combo works wonders for those with sensitive skin, as you&#x27;re not &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to use body tanners on your face. It&#x27;s a simple hack. Make sure you drink enough water, lather with a good lotion after every shower, and this should be an ace in the hole for you.</li>
            <li> The package arrived the next day thanks to my Prime (love Prime) and I opened one bottle to check out how the lotion smells. I dispensed a tiny amount and rubbed it on my hand. I immidiately started smelling like a baked dorrito&#x27;s chip and haven&#x27;t even tanned yet. I showered later and the scent lingered still....had to wash my hands a few more times for it to disappear. Sorry....would not recommend, because I couldn&#x27;t get past that awful smell. It might very well be a great tanning lotion...just stinks!!</li>
            <li> I really try to get something new every time I need lotion. I&#x27;m a bit of a lotion snob, always looking for something better. This is it. I first tried this a while back and I&#x27;d say I buy it every other time. I keep wanting to try new ones and this is always better (including Solid Black, which is supposed to be a better version of this). The smell is the best. And my skin is the best combo of tan and healthy looking. I&#x27;ve started pairing it with Designer Skin&#x27;s Juicy after tan lotion, and it is perfect. My skin has never been softer and the color is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The Auto-Darkening Tan Technology delivers extreme dark bronze tanning results through it&#x27;s super luxurious silicone emulsion blend. Experience stunning dark tan color and ultra moisturization that last all day.. This is what the back of the bottle says. Yes this lotion is silicone based and goes on smoothly, evenly, and does not require a &amp;#34;ton&amp;#34; of lotion to cover your body. As for the &amp;#34;extreme dark bronze tanning results.... This product lacks!!! I have a decent base tan already and was hoping this lotion would help me achieve that dark bronzed glow without using &amp;#34;extreme bronzer lotions&amp;#34; Boy was I WRONG!!! I have been using this lotion for a week now, and I notice NO difference in my color at all.. (I go 15 minutes in the Hot bed, or 10 in the stand up) I was excited when I read the positive reviews about how dark this lotion has made others... For me this lotions is just not cutting it! (and I am very pale skinned naturally. Blonde hair blue eyes and freckles)</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times so I&#x27;m not sure how much darker it will make me versus other lotions.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other lotions and is easy to evenly apply</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it works incredibly well.  I like that the lotion absorbs well without feeling like you&#x27;ve bathed in custard and the bronzer doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothes.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> excellent bronzer with moisturizer! great price!! For beginners or tanners who are dedicated.  Recieved before deadline with smooth purchase! Great buy</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion based on the customer reviews, as well as the price. So far, this lotion has been working great! I have only been using it for a few weeks, and I already have a nice base tan. The smell of the lotion isn&#x27;t bad, but I do feel like the smell changes after you get out of the tanning bed. This lotion does not leave streaks, or give an orange look after tanning.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HESITANT ABOUT ONLINE TANNING PURCHASES THAT I HAVENT TRIED, HOWEVER, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND WORKS AND SMELLS GREAT, IM SOLD!!</li>
            <li> Make you dark very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for indoor and outdoor tanning. I don&#x27;t use it anymore because I don&#x27;t tanned anymore. But totally recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a satisfactory tanning lotion. I have def used better and more effective ones!  Bombshell is the best tanning bed lotion on the market as far as I am concerned!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of tanners and this one worked well but not as well as Jwoww&#x27;s lotions. Seems like all of her stuff always works the best. For the money? Definitely not a bad choice</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. The smell is not overwhelming and unbearable. It works great in the tanning bed and in sun. I have used Designer Skin Tao for years and wanted to try something different...so glad I did! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Order was received way before the expected delivery date. I was at a stand still in my tanning and within the first use of Paint It Black I could clearly see a difference. It also gave me a nice even brown color, no orange tint. I will be ordering this product again and again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this tanning lotion. I used to work at a tanning salon and this was one of my favorites. There are two options from the same company that made this  &#x27;above&#x27; this lotion (there may be more now) and I liked this the best and it was the most affordable. Overall great lotion. You don&#x27;t &#x27;stink&#x27; too bad using this lotion either, although I think that there will always be an odor associated with indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> I used this in a tanning bed 5 times and didn&#x27;t notice that I was darker than just tanning without it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month now and haven&#x27;t seen major results yet. It has given me a little color, but I tan better without lotion.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  But beware, no sunscreen</li>
            <li> Yes this lotion smells nice but I don&#x27;t see ANY change to my skin after I tan. I threw it out. I tried it 2 times and nothing. I thought how brown I&#x27;ll become or will tan much less but nope...</li>
            <li> Moisturizer &amp; tanning</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion and also has a great smell</li>
            <li> I could definitely tell that my color stayed longer and was darker than when I have gone without tabbing lotion or with other products.</li>
            <li> I got this tanning lotion for my mother and so far it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;Ide surely recommend this to anyone who wants a great dar‚Äãk tan.</li>
            <li> not real wild about the smell, doesn&#x27;t seem to make me any darker, pretty disappointed or maybe it just don&#x27;t work for me I give it just an OK rating it was cheap so I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> This product has totally worked for me. I seen huge results just from the first tan. will continue to use!!</li>
            <li> Amazing tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for about 2 years now therefore i have purchased many lotions and accelerators. This product is low quality to say the least, it doesn&#x27;t absorb in your skin quickly and leaves you sticky afterwards. I give this lotion 2 stars because it smells very nice, unlike many tanning products. This lotion is very comparable to a $8 lotion at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a product that a friend recommended and I got the wrong one. It isn&#x27;t a bad tanning lotion but I have used much better bronzers than this.</li>
            <li> great buy works great tanning great love this product</li>
            <li> Price was good and it was delivered on time but I didn&#x27;t like it as much as my previous product.  I did use it and it worked ok.</li>
            <li> this product works very well for a first time tanner and a pro tanner. It doesnt make you look like a fake tan it smells good and it was shipped to me very fast.</li>
            <li> This has lasted a long time and smells great! Fast shipping and good price! I will be ordering more when my bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> this product is streaky.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer! First time I used it I seen a difference and I am a very fair skinned person! Love!</li>
            <li> The exact sale lotion as the tanning bed places sail for 1/3 the price I say well worth it 100%</li>
            <li> I just finished a bottle of Paint It Black 50X, it smells awesome, it&#x27;s a GREAT mositrizer does not feel greasy AT ALL, feels light and GREAT on your skin. But...for me, I&#x27;m already pretty dark as it is, and I honestly can&#x27;t tell a diffrence in color when I get out of a 15 minute high pressure bed. It&#x27;s a great lotion maybe for beginners getting their base tan, but not for someone who is more advanced.</li>
            <li> Beachy smell. Creamy brown lotion. I tan 3-4 times a week alternating between regular tannings beds and a stronger tanning bed and have seen no result with using this lotion and using tanning stickers to test the lotion. It has been one week and i tanned 4 times.  I will continue to use it until i get white again.  Im naturally pasty but built my base tan already with some generic stuff from walmart that actually worked better than this.  Next i used hempz 25x bronzer in a blue bottle and that stuff was great.  I will most likely get the black bottle of hempz tanning lotion next.  Their lotion smells awesome too.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product, I was skeptical because some reviews indicated that it left an orange tint to skin, and that it wasn&#x27;t effective in accelerating darkening in a tanning bed.  I still ordered it; however, because I couldn&#x27;t resist the price!  Now I&#x27;ve ordered this product three times and will again. It&#x27;s inexpensive, yes; but more importantly, it gives me a nice rich bronzed hue (not orange). I have rather fair skin, and though I can&#x27;t speak for people with other skin tones, this product gives my particular skin type a truly tanned appearance, without any redness or fake, unrealistic hue that has sometimes occurred using other products.  The other major plus to Paint it Black is that it smells great! A rich vanilla scent is how I can best describe it.  There are many tan accelerants/moisturizers that have a cheap perfume scent to them that might smell good upon first use, but after a while they tend to have this waning fragrance that you can&#x27;t wait to rinse off.  Some have a scent that people around you know you just went tanning because you smell like a sweaty beach.  This product, on the other hand, has people around me exclaiming, \\&quot;Something smells good! What is that?\\&quot;  It also works as a great skin moisturizer on days I&#x27;m not planning to tan.</li>
            <li> I have gotten such amazing color from this lotion, my skin is so smooth too! It&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; color tanning lotion, it gives a natural looking tan that is awesome! The lotion itself goes on very smooth and I have had zero problems with streaking, even in the hard-to-reach areas on my back. The smell is great, it&#x27;s not overpowering whatsoever and there is no after tanning &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; at least not that I have or my husband has noticed. For the price you pay on Amazon this is a huge steal. I did a lot of online research before I purchased this lotion, looking for THE BEST one out there as I am pretty fair-skinned, and this one was always in the top 5 or top 10 for best lotions, so I took a chance and I am glad I did! I am almost out of my lotion now, so I have purchased a Jwoww lotion and will see if that can take my tan to its next level!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to try and out and compare it to other lotions I had used in the past. This lotion is terrible. i received no additional help tanning from this. Spens $8 more and get something that will actually work.</li>
            <li> this product works pretty well, as far as i know! i&#x27;ve been getting significantly tanner ever since i started using this product. however, the one thing that i absolutely cannot stand about this product is the smell. initially smelling the lotion, it smells very fragrant and sweet - similar to vanilla. however, when i get out of the tanning bed i absolutely cannot stand how i smell. if i run errands after tanning, i can literally smell myself without even trying. now i go and tan when i know that i have time to rinse off afterwards or else i smell (and feel) repugnant after tanning at the tanning salon. i&#x27;m not even sensitive to scents so this is weird for me!</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion is awesome.  Had no idea it would smell so good and be so smooth.  Great price too.  Saved me a bunch of money compared to what they sell lotion for in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Great price. Wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion seems to do the job, especially for 12 bucks. If it were anymore than 12 bucks I would have to take a star off, but if you want to be a cheap skate and still have a decent tan, get this. Other than that you&#x27;re going to have to spend about 20 to 25 bucks for the good stuff on amazon. The designer skin line seems to be pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> Arrived much quicker than I was expecting! It works just great.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I got so tan and I never get tan. Simple as that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before. It does what it is supposed to do. It is a bronzer as well as a lotion. What I don&#x27;t like about is that it is stickier than I would like and doesn&#x27;t always absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great, great price, and gets you tan! cant go wrong. Buy buy buy!</li>
            <li> It broke my skin out and I can not use it again!</li>
            <li> This product smells great, applies nicely, and has helped darken my tan.</li>
            <li> Was affordable and was a pretty decent lotion.</li>
            <li> Ah it&#x27;s not that great. Smells ok I guess. I was so dark when using I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> i have fair skin with pink undertone. it doesn&#x27;t work. however I had a friend with olive skin tone and it worked great for her.</li>
            <li> Works well. Wish it had more of a bronzer in it so you could see where you apply and the spots you missed but other than that works excellent-- it gets you pretty dark after only a few times using it, but of course it all depends on the tanning bed or stand up you use as well, not just the lotion!! Safe tanning everybody!</li>
            <li> I truly love this tanning lotion. This is my second year purchasing this product and I will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Great price for product fast shipping by seller</li>
            <li> You Can&#x27;t Beat the price. This same bottle costs $75 with an Ed Hardy label. This product causes my naturally tan skin to shimmer and i love it.</li>
            <li> Smells real bad in my opinion and you will definanty need a shower after tanning.  I&#x27;m no expert, but i have used other lotions that don&#x27;t smell bad or smell good!  It does have a lot of bronzers in it but it wears off in a few days, maybe that is just normal.</li>
            <li> Smells great, helps add color to my tan, just like putting on lotion.</li>
            <li> This probably is cheap but gives you an orange tint. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this not knowing if it would smell like flowers. It doesn&#x27;t. It only has a faint smell. I have no problem carrying this into a tanning place either. Gotta love the skulls! As far as it&#x27;s effect, I could have shown a bit more color but then again, I&#x27;m Irish.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin. I burn moderately and tan average. I just used Paint It Black for the first time tonight and i love the results. I am at least two shades darker. I do already have a base tan. I am not crazy about the smell. I dont think it smells bad and i didnt have an odor after tanning. Love the results and for the price i would definitely repurchase. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different kinds of Lotions, I am a weekly tanner, at times bi-weekly tanner, so when i tan i need to see color immediately. and this does that!! I am of asian decent so my tan is pretty brown golden. this made me more golden that the Luminosity. which DOWNRIGHT sucks!! at first after a month of using that, i thought i liked it, the smell was Good. BUT THE COLOR.. was non existent. so i switched back to this is when I really started to appreciate the color it gave me. however, I don&#x27;t like the scent. the black 100x is what i recommend over this, gave me a deeper tan quicker!</li>
            <li> Smells good and darkens me up!</li>
            <li> If you need a good tanning lotion to give you nice natural color you should try this product, great price, good smell and it really help you to get color faster.</li>
            <li> Great product and price!</li>
            <li> Pay no attention to the 1-star reviews!  They are simply salon owners that are trying to make you buy these lotions at their salon prices!  I paid $65 for this lotion at my salon, and I still have the bottle.  I have compared them both side by side and they are the same product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the prices salon owners are paying in the first place before they up the price!  Never pay more than Amazon prices!!!</li>
            <li> so much cheaper than any tanning salon! and the product works just as it says! no complaints on this end!</li>
            <li> LOVED IT! Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Im pretty sure this is a fake. The worst lotion I had. I could tell it was fake or just cheap by the smell and the bronzer did not work. I went tanning for three months with this crud and barely noticed a thing. Then I went to Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and got a low end lotion there that worked better than this one! DO NOT BUY, SCAM SCAM SCAM!</li>
            <li> good moisture lotion for the tanning bed</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this lotion it worked wonders, but the second time I got a extremely itchy rash all over my body it must have been fake. Very skeptical about buying it a third time.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st lotion from Millenium Tanning I&#x27;ve tried and started using it around my 2nd week of tanning. I&#x27;m so impressed with this lotion! It has a nice light scent (nothing like Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27; \\&quot;Warm Vanilla Sugar\\&quot; like another reviewer stated, thank goodness) and has little to no after-tan odor. It glides on easily and is absorbed quickly and because of the silicone emulsion, my skin feels great for hours and never feels sticky or greasy when I use this. The bronzers work great and don&#x27;t cause an orange tint and last about 3 days for me (with daily showers). All in all, a great lotion that I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> This is a great value compared to the $40-$60 lotions you would find in a salon, and just as effective! I have a medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> I thought with 50x that I&#x27;d be getting the darkest bronzing ever however I only got a nice textured good smelling lotion with what appears to be no bronzer. Good for price but I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have just used this product for the first time, and I have to say I am quite happy with it. I have noticed a slight color change, but again I just used it (about an hour ago). The number one thing I love about this lotion is that it doesn&#x27;t give you the oily feeling a lot of lotions tend to do. My skin feels moisturized, but not greasy which I appreciate since I have relatively oily skin to begin with. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell but after putting it on it felt sticky afterward like I wanted to take a shower when I came home from tanning. It&#x27;s got a nice bronzer but have used other lotions with stronger bronzer.</li>
            <li> have purchased many tanning products in the past and this one&lt;br /&gt;smells good, has the perfect amount of bronzers and leaves skin&lt;br /&gt;moisturized</li>
            <li> it is ok isnt working like i thought it would, but has given me fast color, just not dark color</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion on a Sunday and it arrived the next Wednesday - the shipping was super fast! I have only used it once so far in an indoor stand-up tanning bed (for just 10 minutes) and I have already noticed a change in my skin tone. I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it so I can get really dark! My skin is pretty fair right now, but I am Italian and tan very easily, so I can&#x27;t speak for those with naturally fair/pale skin. It smells really great, spreads on evenly (no streaks) and leaves your skin feeling sooo smooth. The only downside is that I paid almost $19 for this (including the shipping) and the bottle is not that big. I just hope it lasts a while but I will most likely be ordering more when I run out. This seems to be the best deal there is on tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin.  I can not tan whatsoever without this stuff.  I put a light sunscreen, and then this.  I tan within a week if I use it consistently along with sun exposure.  It does however break out my acne prone skin on my face.  So I no longer use it for my face...</li>
            <li> I am a new tanner. I find that if you use this every day a few days in a row it starts to give off that orangy look. I am buying a non bronzer lotion to use in between uses of this. smells great goes on clean and doesnt leave me greasy afterwords.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, great price, great smell !!! You will never want to use anything else after you try this product. Like the saying goes... Once you&#x27;ve had BLACK, you will never go back !!!</li>
            <li> Smells great works and applies well love the effects</li>
            <li> The brown lotion makes it seem like I got color but washes off when I shower several hours later. I will not purchase this lotion again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to tanning, only having been about five times before this summer.  I tried an australian gold bronzer from the local tanning salon previouly which was $40 and only worked okay.  Read all the great reviews on amazon and decided to give this baby a try.  It smells wonderful, glides on your skin evenly, doesn&#x27;t create any streaks, is super hydrating AND turns you a nice brown.  You notice a difference when you get out of the tanning bed but the bronzers sort of wash off the next morning.  I was disappointed by this until I used it a few times and saw the darkening in my tan.  It only took about three sessions for me to notice how evenly brown &amp; tan I was getting!  So don&#x27;t be dismayed if at first it seems to wash off the next day in the shower, it is working, it just takes a few sessions to get all bronzey.  And of course, you have to keep it up by applying and tanning some more, but I go pretty sparingly, perhaps three times a month and still am a nice tan instead of my usual paleness.  I noticed it is hard to keep my legs tan though!  Everywhere else it works great, maybe thats just me.  Give this a try.  For the price it&#x27;s a great deal, you get a lot of product and you smell pretty good even after tanning!</li>
            <li> Excellent tanning lotion, love the silicone feel &amp; the smell is the best for an auto bronzer. Price is fantastic compared to salons.</li>
            <li> I tan every year and I tan very easily. I waited until I used this entire bottle to leave a review. The lotion smells really good and noticeably has a lot of silicone in it, which I love. It gave me a great base tan in 3 weeks and tightened my skin as well. This lotion sells for well over $50 in my tanning salon for $14 on here was an amazing deal. If your looking for a great smelling lotion that will get you a very nice base tan and doesn&#x27;t have any tingle, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I have used many different lotions and this one by far is the best, texture, smell! Overall this is the very very best</li>
            <li> Lotion worked pretty good to get my tan going.  Smell was OK and was a little greasy.  Kept my tan for  awhile.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this brand. I like how it smells and it doesn&#x27;t make you sizzle why you are tanning. It gives you a good even tan without making you look like you were left in an oven for to long.It&#x27;s also a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Legs are always the hardest to tan so I wanted something to boost up my tan for the summer and this works.  I rubbed it into my legs and laid out in the sun for 30 minutes and got a tan without burning.</li>
            <li> It may not glide on like Bronze bunny, but pretty close. I haven&#x27;t burned using it, unlike many other tanning lotions... and I&#x27;m using stand up beds. The bronzers hold its color pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is a bottle of tanning lotion  that I am giving to a friend for his birthday in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle that i have bought.This a great product and will buy again. Works well and doesnt smell bad afterwards either.</li>
            <li> Tanning lotion is good smelling and super smooth feeling when you put it on.  Darkens visibly with the tanning bed and doesnt leave a mess on the bed itself.</li>
            <li> My result&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t all that . The smell was nice but the tan was normal . I could not tell I was using anything .</li>
            <li> Great indoor tanning lotion and price is amazing</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and do not tan well.  HOWEVER.  I used this tanning lotion and was as dark as I&#x27;ve ever been.  Now this does not mean I was black or even bronze, but I was light tan which is still WAY darker than I had ever been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d imagine this would really work extremely well for somebody who tans easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it smells great!</li>
            <li> I have loved using this lotion so far!  It does not streak or leave you looking orange!</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion works very well. It also has a really great smell. I really like this tanning lotion all together!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Australian Gold fan, but decided to give something new a try. I&#x27;ve been really pleased with this lotion. I feel like I&#x27;m getting the tan I want and it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering odor. I would definitely purchase this indoor lotion again. Thank goodness Amazon makes trying new lotions so affordable.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great, I can see why this is top-rated!</li>
            <li> i like it i use it alot however, it doesnt make you very dark as it says! But the price was great!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this lotion but after I was done tanning the smell isn&#x27;t that great.. I feel like I smell like plastic and I have to shower right after whereas other lotions I&#x27;ve tried it smells the same as when it went on and I don&#x27;t need to shower after I tan which I&#x27;d rather not do but with this lotion so have to cause of the smell.. Kinda disappointed with this product..</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and works wonderfuly! It&#x27;s also a great size bottle so it lasts quite a while. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was the first lotion I used when I started tanning (partly to help with skin issues, the other part vanity!). I am more tan than when I started, the smell is Meh, the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would buy this product again because there is so many other products out there that I would like to try. I would recommend it only if someone asked directly about &#x27;Paint it Black&#x27; or something super cheap.</li>
            <li> I tried to find out if this had a bronzer in it and after a use or two I THINK it does.  It&#x27;s hard to tell.  Definitely makes me darker.  The smell is good. I&#x27;d prefer a tanning lotion without the bronzing effect but I&#x27;ll use this bottle up before switching to another.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. But my jwoww lotion does better. It doesn&#x27;t really give me a good tan. Then again Inhave fair skin. I&#x27;ll still to my other one, it gives me more color.</li>
            <li> One of the best tanning lotions that I have every used! A great price,with reasonable shipping.You won&#x27;t go wrong when ordering this lotion! I&#x27;ll order again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> I never saw a difference. I didn&#x27;t hate it but I didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> Thank you ! Fast delivery. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is not what the bottle says it is</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was so worried from going from a 10x bronzer to a 50x that i would be too brown or possibly yellow or orange.  It was stunning.  It saved me a lot of money in the long run.  I got darker after 2 sessions with this than 5 sessions with my other tanning lotion.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> a cheaper option for tanning, does its job</li>
            <li> read the reviews after buying it and was afraid I was going to get some weird concoction but this stuff worked really well and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and live where its difficult to get any sun.  I was worried about this product because I didn&#x27;t want to turn orange but it works amazing.  Ive used it three times and look like I have an amazing tan!  Give it a couple tries, its wonderful!  Also it smells incredible and makes your skin feel like silk!</li>
            <li> Great full bottle.  Came quickly. I could really tell it helped me tan quicker.</li>
            <li> I love the product but this is the second time I have ordered this product and it claims to have been delivered but wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion in 2 days after I ordered it! I used this lotion twice so far and I have a nice tan! You do not look orange and I only ya 2 times a week during this winter season. I would def recommend this product it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This lotion does work really well, I just am not a huge fan of the smell. Im a guy and I prefer more of a masculine scent, Ill stick to the Hero Worship</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great bronzer and silicone. This is the one for you. It smells delightful and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This is okay, but not the best!</li>
            <li> I cant say enough how much i love this product its Amazing</li>
            <li> I am a big tanner so I have used just about every lotion out there. I originally purchased this lotion because of the PRICE...&lt;br /&gt;I think I paid like $12.95 for the bottle...and I after using it for about a two weeks now I can say that I love not just the price I love the product. I began to see results after just two sessions. I will say that my skin takes very well to tanning...&lt;br /&gt;The scent is also a plus...if you like the after tan smell this is the lotion for you...the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it really doesn&#x27;t have the instant self tanners like it says. I don&#x27;t mind because I did get color results quickly but if you are looking for a bronzers/self-tanners this is not for you...Happy Tanning &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is amazing !&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s an indoor tanning lotion , but I broke the rules and used it outside too and it&#x27;s AMAZING !&lt;br /&gt;It works VERY GOOD indoor and outdoor . It smells great .&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you wash your hands really good after you apply it on you  :)</li>
            <li> I used this tanning lotion after I had my base tan down pat It worked very well to achieve a deep dark tan</li>
            <li> not exactly what you think when it says bronzer.... it works as a great lotion though!! will be trying a different one next time..</li>
            <li> This is one awesome bronzer! Definitely worth the money and works perfect. Will help get you dark faster. I didnt have any issues with oranging...even on my hands. The smell is pretty typical of a tanning lotion. Try this for sure, cheap and does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> THIS DOES NOT WORK. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I used this product last year and loved it. easy to apply and great tanning coverage. can&#x27;t wait to use it this year</li>
            <li> Smells good, and bronzers were pretty good for the price I&#x27;d use again.</li>
            <li> This product is great for men.  It does have a bronzer and I have been getting noticeably darker since using it.  It does not smell like a ladies powder and great color effect for a man.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this tanning lotion! Enjoyable scent and I have not experienced burning. I am fair skin, freckled with blonde hair and blue eyes. I don&#x27;t burn easily, but I do turn red and pink after sun exposure instead of tan. Using this lotion in combination of a tanning bed I have got a good tan glow going on that I had trouble getting using other lotions. It&#x27;s good stuff, worth it!</li>
            <li> Well, first of all, this shipment took 9 days to reach me. Which, by that time, I had already built a nice base tan. I applied this about 30 minutes prior to tanning. At first smell, the lotion smelled like a typical tanning salon smell. Coconut-y and butter-y. But, as I applied it, the smell changed to something very pleasant! 8 hours later, and it still has a nice smell! While I was tanning, I noticed that my skin was extremely soft and silky. I wouldn&#x27;t say that this is magic lotion by any standards. But, compared to the $50+ lotions being sold at my salon, this is defiantly a bargain. This DOES NOT MAKE YOU SUPER TAN WITH ONE USE. As with all good tanning, you have to keep tanning. But, I can already see a hint of extra bronze on my skin, especially on my sides and arms. All in all, I would advise you to buy this lotion if you want to see some bronzing on your skin!</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion did nothing to help me achieve a tan. i very very upset when it did not work</li>
            <li> I love this product! I love the smell and the color that it gives you after just one session is amazing! I love it</li>
            <li> The initial vanilla scent is wonderful and it works very well without streaking. This is my first tanning bed lotion and I love it. But you do get a cooked smell at the end which was something I could go without.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion smells wonderful. I have compared it to other lotions, and this seems to work just as well or better. I would recommend washing your hands after application as it may stain, due to the bronzing agent in the lotion.</li>
            <li> love love love the paint it black it has just enough bronzer to tan you but not to make you look orange, and doesnt leave you smelling burnt after!</li>
            <li> I have used this product prior to both indoor and outdoor tanning. Each time I use it I get an amazing tan afterwards and certainly look much darker than if I tan with just oil or no lotion. It also smells pretty decent. However it sometimes gets hard to tell if youre tan from the lotion or actually getting tanner sometimes since it does add quite a bit of color...still, works great</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion. I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have used several different tanning lotions and this one is by far my favorite. It leaves your skin really smooth and the smell is nice it doesn&#x27;t make u smell like u just got cooked! It also gives you a nice color not orange or too dark. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a recomendation from a friend and after using it twice broke out in a rash everywhere I applied it.  Took over a week to go away.  I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin so I am not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> Ok, seriously, &#x27;it doesn&#x27;t last&#x27; because its a bronzer!! Bronzers tint your skin and DO fade. Your not supposed to use a bronzer and then go home and shower within a few hours. to maximize the color, it needs to be on your skin for several hours. The lotion is perfect consistency, it&#x27;s not runny or so thick. It&#x27;s a tan colored lotion (hence the 50x BRONZER part in the name) this stuff smells like sweet vanilla. And it&#x27;s pleasant enough to tan before work and work all day. If you don&#x27;t put a whole bottle on yourself, it won&#x27;t be greasy. It&#x27;s greasy after you get out of the tanning bed and for maybe an hour or so after that. As long as your body is cool (not hot, sweaty, etc) your skin is not slick or greasy. I don&#x27;t tan easily, it takes me forever to build up a tan, so extreme bronzes are my friend, because I tan at the minimum times about every other day. I do not burn with this lotion at the tanning bed times that are appropriate for my skin tone, but I also dont purposely burn myself. If you can&#x27;t tell a difference, use tanning stickers to see how well tanning lotions work.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously people, know how bronzers work before you say they don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been using bronzers off and on for years now, and once my tan is built up, it&#x27;s a natural looking tan. By no means is it oompa-loompa color.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by this lotion at all. I usually buy Swedish Beauty, and I will not stray again.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years &amp; love it! Doesn&#x27;t streak, gives a great color in the tanning bed or in the sun!</li>
            <li> Would buy this product again. Love the nice tan color it leave. Would recommend to beginners or anyone wanting a nice tan.</li>
            <li> The lotion gave me great color , but I didn&#x27;t see any results until after a week . It was a really nice smell and its smoothing on skin . Most lotions leave your skin dry after tanning , but this lotion keeped my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell and it really work like a you got your body painted darker. Good stuff and the best price in the market</li>
