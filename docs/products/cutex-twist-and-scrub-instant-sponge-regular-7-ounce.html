            <li>So much better than cotton.  </li>
            <li>I first experienced this design with an Italian brand that was high-end and perfect and removed the polish after one quick insert.</li>

            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>

            <li>Takes off nail polish quickly.</li>
            <li>The sponge is great, just takes a few swipes to remove my nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The tiny sponge included on a wire is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite nail remover products so far.</li>
            <li>There moms will love it too because there will be no mess.</li>
            <li>There is a lot of nail polish remover in the cup and sponge when you first get it.</li>
            <li>You will still need a bottled polish remover and cotton for toes, so I would suggest just buying the bottle in the first place.</li>
            <li>First there was a blood like substance on one jar.</li>
            <li>Both were replaced, but the first ones were inspected end thrown away.</li>
            <li>Not as much of a chore anymore!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different nail polish removers in different forms and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually doing my nails more because its so easy to redo than spend tons more time to apply extra layers of polish hoping it would last longer.</li>
            <li>Removes really well and fast.</li>
            <li>Sponge inside is very durable.</li>
            <li>tje priduct cane really fast</li>
            <li>Makes things so much easier.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It just makes life that much easier.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>So much easier to just stick my fingers inside versus cleaning each finger separately and dealing with the cleaner and cotton.</li>
            <li>Arrived super quick faster than expected.</li>
            <li>when done using make sure the cap is really tight</li>
            <li>love the sponge removers, just insert finger give a few twists and polish is gone.</li>
            <li>Polish remover take off nail polish fast with no mess .</li>
            <li>I almost always put two coats on and this has been the case for me unless it was time for a new container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other brands are kind of loose and flimy feeling</li>
            <li>Easy, neat, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll take that walk to my local beauty supply store like I should have done in the first place</li>
            <li>With such a generous amount I will have clean sparkling nails for a very long time.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old loves it.  </li>
            <li>so they became nearly obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To clean little sponge, repeat as you would your finger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up on buying this type of remover, because the other brand&#x27;s sponges inside were wimpy, and no wand for your toenails.  </li>
            <li>Removes nail polish faster than most things I have tried but it gets a bit gross after a while and does a poor job of cleaning along the nailbed.</li>

            <li> Removes nail polish faster than most things I have tried but it gets a bit gross after a while and does a poor job of cleaning along the nailbed.</li>
            <li> the product removes nail polish quickly however when the lid is place on tightly it still leaks a little bit</li>
            <li> It works pretty well except it gets dirty after a while, but it was still worth it.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t think of any other reasons, but in my opinion, the above mentioned reasons are plenty enough!</li>
            <li> and when you lift your figures out of the bottle, instead of your hand being wet for the nail polish remover it dries instantly.  </li>
            <li> Simply stick your finger or thumb in the middle of the sponge and work it back and forth a few times.</li>
            <li> This makes doing my nails so much easier, and less messy.</li>
            <li> but as I go to check my orders I came across the total of this product which I was not aware of at all!</li>
            <li> Fingernails, put one finger inside at a time and twist, takes nail polish off in less than one second.  </li>
            <li> And far less messy.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little toenail remover swab on a wire thingee too (like how technical I got there?).</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as I expected it</li>
            <li> I just ordered this a few days ago and is currently waiting for it to get here..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly a nail painting guru so anything to make it easier is a bonus.</li>
            <li> they get all wet!!</li>
            <li> Less mess and smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less mess because it contains it all inside the container</li>
            <li> Mine came with a little wire swab to use on your toes.</li>
            <li> What you get is a shallow jar with star cut out sponge inside, plus solid &amp; thick wire with a little sponge on end.</li>
            <li> It requires a lot less effort on my part, which I&#x27;m all about, because I do tend to be lazy at times.</li>
            <li> so you can wipe small spots.</li>
            <li> I have had this for the past three years</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t too horrid, either, compared to usual nail polish removers.</li>
            <li> No more cotton ball pieces stuck to your fingers.. or everywhere else for that matter.</li>
            <li> They were both hard when it came to removing the nail polish.</li>
            <li> It slowly dries out</li>
            <li> no more cotton balls!</li>
            <li> No more cotton balls for me!</li>
            <li> I always hated to use cotton balls and dreaded painting nails for that reason.</li>

            <li> Makes removing nail Polish so easy!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy. Love it!</li>
            <li> There is a lot of nail polish remover in the cup and sponge when you first get it. It slowly dries out but you can always just add more nail polish remover. Removes really well and fast. Arrived super quick faster than expected. super cheap, great buy!</li>
            <li> Great. Takes off my nailpolish faster than non-acetone removers. Sponge inside is very durable. Other brands are kind of loose and flimy feeling and you have to twist a dozen times to get all your polish off but this worked in one twist.</li>
            <li> tje priduct cane really fast and it works great. The jar is s good size and should last a while. I like the toe nail dauber that comes with it, just wish it was thinner - not to catch at the corner of the nails and remove the nail polish on the nail.</li>
            <li> love the sponge removers, just insert finger give a few twists and polish is gone. and the wand is great for removing toenail polish</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It works just as advertised and makes taking off nail polish easy and painless. I always hated to use cotton balls and dreaded painting nails for that reason. With this jar, I can do so whenever I please. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love these things!!!! Makes things so much easier. Less mess and smell.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and takes the polish off effortlessly!</li>
            <li> Easy, neat, and long lasting. The tiny sponge included on a wire is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> take nail polish off really easily. I love using this! no more cotton balls! The formula also seems to be really good becuase the nail polish will come right off!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Ordered for my grand-daughter&#x27;s so they don&#x27;t spill the remover.  I have used it before and like it.  No sense buying the more expensive brand when this does the job.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well except it gets dirty after a while, but it was still worth it.  It comes with a stick with a cotton ball so you can wipe small spots. One of my favorite nail remover products so far.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many brands of this type of nail polish remover, and this is the BEST!  The sponge is great, just takes a few swipes to remove my nail polish.  And...it has a separate wand for your toe nails. I was ready to give up on buying this type of remover, because the other brand&#x27;s sponges inside were wimpy, and no wand for your toenails.  So glad I found this!</li>
            <li> This a great product and works really good and quick. Very happy and satisfied with this product and will order more.</li>

            <li> Love it! Came earlier than it said it would (:</li>
            <li> What you get is a shallow jar with star cut out sponge inside, plus solid &amp; thick wire with a little sponge on end. Fingernails, put one finger inside at a time and twist, takes nail polish off in less than one second.  For toe nails, use wire and sponge to remove. To clean little sponge, repeat as you would your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed is impressive. No cotton swabs, qtips, just a jar and your hands. I&#x27;m actually doing my nails more because its so easy to redo than spend tons more time to apply extra layers of polish hoping it would last longer.</li>
            <li> I have had this for the past three years and I love it ! It&#x27;s speeds up the nail polish removal process. And even if there is no product left, you can replace it with any nail polish remover of your choice. Love this.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. It makes me like 1000 times easier. I&#x27;m not exactly a nail painting guru so anything to make it easier is a bonus. I remembered my mom or aunt having this product as a child and when I decided to start painting my nails I knew I needed to get this. It comes with a little toenail remover swab on a wire thingee too (like how technical I got there?). Smell isn&#x27;t too horrid, either, compared to usual nail polish removers. And far less messy.</li>
            <li> The jars leaked during transit.</li>
            <li> Love it! So easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. It&#x27;s a huge sponge inside a jar filled with polish remover. What do i do with it? If I remove the sponge, It drips all over. IfI stick my fingers they get all wet!! Nonsense!!</li>
            <li> i love this product very good when it come to removing nail polish off my nail real quick and dry up real quick..the seller did a real good job in shipping this item fast a well pack</li>
            <li> Works great.  My 10 year old loves it.  Can&#x27;t see to find it anywhere else!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazinggg!!</li>
            <li> I first experienced this design with an Italian brand that was high-end and perfect and removed the polish after one quick insert. This Cutex stuff is unfortunately not that awesome, but it&#x27;s still SO much more convenient than a bottle of acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is simply a jar of acetone (etc.) with a sponge that has a hole in it for inserting your finger. You put your finger in, twist it around a bit, remove, and the nail polish has been removed.  It&#x27;s quick and easy. Your finger does get stuff all over it, but frankly it&#x27;s not that much different from a cotton ball and acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just makes life that much easier.</li>
            <li> the most useful thing ever</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I saw a review on YouTube by my favorite beauty guru, DulceCandy87&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and when it arrived It was very easy to use and it smells great for a polish remover. It does help to have clean hands before and after use, just like the directions say. If hands are not washed, it could leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product a 5 star rating because of its&lt;br /&gt;- Ease of use&lt;br /&gt;- Speed&lt;br /&gt;- technique&lt;br /&gt;- smell</li>
            <li> &#x3D;It works but leaks from the container sometimes. Not helpful when in need of cleaning excess polish though... it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This makes doing my nails so much easier, and less messy. No more cotton balls for me! This is a great product, and I will be repurchasing again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and I really like it. Mine came with a little wire swab to use on your toes. Product is exactly as I expected it</li>
            <li> Great function. Easy to order. Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Removes nail polish faster than most things I have tried but it gets a bit gross after a while and does a poor job of cleaning along the nailbed. You will still need a bottled polish remover and cotton for toes, so I would suggest just buying the bottle in the first place.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this a few days ago and is currently waiting for it to get here.. but as I go to check my orders I came across the total of this product which I was not aware of at all! The item is $2.50 but the shipping and handling is $62 and some change! oh no no NO! this definitely has to go back immediately and I&#x27;ll take that walk to my local beauty supply store like I should have done in the first place</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!!! With such a generous amount I will have clean sparkling nails for a very long time. I must consider this product for &amp;#34;Goodie Bags or Stocking Stuffers.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> First there was a blood like substance on one jar. Both were replaced, but the first ones were inspected end thrown away.</li>
            <li> the product removes nail polish quickly however when the lid is place on tightly it still leaks a little bit</li>
            <li> I love this nail Polish remover take off nail polish fast with no mess .</li>
            <li> Works great!  Get&#x27;s all my nail polish off and when you lift your figures out of the bottle, instead of your hand being wet for the nail polish remover it dries instantly.  Love it, great price!</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this product. So much easier to just stick my fingers inside versus cleaning each finger separately and dealing with the cleaner and cotton.</li>
            <li> when done using make sure the cap is really tight</li>
            <li> There are so many reasons why I love the twist and scrub sponge nail polish remover by Cutex.&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s a lot less mess because it contains it all inside the container and you simply replace the container when you notice it isn&#x27;t quite doing the job you want it to anymore.&lt;br /&gt;2. It requires a lot less effort on my part, which I&#x27;m all about, because I do tend to be lazy at times. Simply stick your finger or thumb in the middle of the sponge and work it back and forth a few times. Once you remove it, it should be clean. I almost always put two coats on and this has been the case for me unless it was time for a new container.&lt;br /&gt;3. No more cotton ball pieces stuck to your fingers.. or everywhere else for that matter. I despise cotton balls and look forward to the day that my toes will be able to have something like this so they became nearly obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of any other reasons, but in my opinion, the above mentioned reasons are plenty enough! Happy nail polish removing! Not as much of a chore anymore!</li>
            <li> Works great!  So much better than cotton.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Takes off nail polish quickly.</li>
            <li> I can find a nail polish remover I like... until now! I&#x27;ve tried the remover pads and the liquid stuff both. They were both hard when it came to removing the nail polish. However, this stuff is great. They is a sponge and nail remover inside of the jar. You put your finger inside of it and twist. It comes right off! I will definitely buy it again.</li>
