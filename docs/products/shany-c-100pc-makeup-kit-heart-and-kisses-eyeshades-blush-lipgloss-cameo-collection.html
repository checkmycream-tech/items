            <li>me and my girls truly love it!</li>

            <li>My daugther love it</li>
            <li>She is thrilled and pleased with all the different products provided to make a beautiful face.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a teen, colors are beautiful and the little case is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It has a great selection of colors and rinses off better then the childrens generic makeup.  </li>
            <li>I recommended strongly.</li>
            <li>Great present!</li>
            <li>It was perfect because it wasn&#x27;t a little kid one and has real make up.</li>
            <li>I do caution that if you give this to a child you warn them to be careful, but everything arrived in perfect condition and in fact, came a day early.</li>
            <li>It is a very cute set if only the powder hadn&#x27;t cracked and spread throughout the kit.  </li>
            <li>Ups threw it on my porch and destroyed almost the whole thing!!</li>
            <li>I would buy again probably as it came in a pretty box and was a nice compact starter kit for a teen or addition to the basics.</li>
            <li>And the little girl loved it.</li>
            <li>The heart shaped make up is so cute and there is enough variety here</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the package has exactly what is shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>I knew she love anything with hearts and the colors that were offered are in the category of colors she likes, especially purple.</li>
            <li>If ever I need to update my makeup kit this would be my first choice.</li>
            <li>This is a good value, but I got it for my 9 yr old and its kind of complicated for her.</li>
            <li>that I think the little one will find it amazing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for your attention, I hope to buy them soon</li>
            <li>I Imagine that the gloss will get messing after sometime, but other than that it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li>Was extremely excited to open it.</li>
            <li>If you are the slightest bit rough with pulling out any of the parts, they break off easily.</li>
            <li>I bought this make up kit for a 9 yr old girl who wants to play dress up.  </li>
            <li>Only to fine the entire contents destroyed powers fell all over her and the carpet.</li>
            <li>considering I have no time to wait on a new one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not made for a kid though, obviously with so much makeup for that age, but just an FYI for anyone else thinking about it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 7 year old as a play makeup kit.</li>
            <li>we stay sassy and classy</li>
            <li>Not a big deal since its for a 7 year old, but if it were for me, I&#x27;d return it.</li>
            <li>It was good that I sent it to myself instead of to the receiver of the gift, as that would have been an even bigger disappointment.</li>

            <li> I bought this make up kit for a 9 yr old girl who wants to play dress up.  The heart shaped make up is so cute and there is enough variety here that I think the little one will find it amazing.  I do caution that if you give this to a child you warn them to be careful, but everything arrived in perfect condition and in fact, came a day early.</li>
            <li> blush portion slider box was not attached so I had to attach it myself. The blush was smudged looking like someone had tried to attach the slider portion and failed. Otherwise decent product, just disappointing that I have to give it to someone with smudges in the makeup considering I have no time to wait on a new one.  I would buy again probably as it came in a pretty box and was a nice compact starter kit for a teen or addition to the basics.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pre-teen niece. It was perfect because it wasn&#x27;t a little kid one and has real make up. It was inexpensive enough that she could use it for play too though. Great present!</li>
            <li> This is a good value, but I got it for my 9 yr old and its kind of complicated for her. If you are the slightest bit rough with pulling out any of the parts, they break off easily. It&#x27;s probably not made for a kid though, obviously with so much makeup for that age, but just an FYI for anyone else thinking about it.</li>
            <li> I got this for a little girl and it was the cutiest thing I have ever seen. I wanted it for myself. The makeup seem to be a good quality. I just but some blush on my arm the see how it felt. I Imagine that the gloss will get messing after sometime, but other than that it&#x27;s so cute. And the little girl loved it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the set I ordered came as others have mentioned; complete with crumbled hearts, powder all over, and the slide function to reveal other makeup broken. Too bad, because I really liked the heart shaped shadows. It was good that I sent it to myself instead of to the receiver of the gift, as that would have been an even bigger disappointment. I guess this is the sort of thing you don&#x27;t buy online.</li>
            <li> My daugther love it and I do too. Its beautifull. Perfect for teenagers. The Color are fantantics! I recommended strongly.</li>
            <li> Received this case and was disappointed.  I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daugther.  It was a little pricey, but I knew that she would lvoe the heart shaped makeup and colors.  The case is very small, the color sections are very small.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I should have my granddaughter here to write this review cause they were for her, i know she hasn&#x27;t complained about them so I find that a good thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters 5th B-Day causse she loves putting on makeup for dress up!

So great makeup, just flimsy container.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old as a play makeup kit. Everything shown in the photo is correct. My only complaint is on of the pieces that &#x27;slides&#x27; to the side to expose the makeup on the bottom, is broken. Not a big deal since its for a 7 year old, but if it were for me, I&#x27;d return it. Otherwise, the package has exactly what is shown in the photo.</li>

            <li> Mine also came broken.  Powder everywhere.  I remembered the other reviews and opened it over the bathroom sink.  It is a very cute set if only the powder hadn&#x27;t cracked and spread throughout the kit.  I am sending it back and looking for another.</li>
            <li> Actually a Christmas gift to my daughter-in-law. She is thrilled and pleased with all the different products provided to make a beautiful face.
