            <li> Leaves hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> mosturizing effects are not as great as I expected, my hair is thin and curly, usually feel dry hair again after about 12h.</li>
            <li> This was a lighting deal not to long ago</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS LONG</li>
            <li> Pro- V Color Preserve Volume Conditioner works wonders on my long color treated hair!</li>
            <li> The color preserve part of it is not really the feature I would flaunt with this product though.  </li>
            <li> Have tried other products but prefer Pantene Pro-V.</li>
            <li> and the conditioner does not weigh it down, it actually helps give it some fullness which I need with my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> The only brand conditioner that always leaves my hair silky and soft without adding a nasty oily texture.</li>

            <li> This was a lighting deal not to long ago and I bought it.  I have enough hair conditioner for quite awhile.  These are nice huge bottles, work great on my colored hair and make combing it wet very easy.  I had my hair cut about shoulder length recently and the conditioner does not weigh it down, it actually helps give it some fullness which I need with my thin hair.  Once again, a good price, good product and a package of three large bottles will last quite awhile even with me washing my hair every day.</li>
