            <li>So this stuff is kind of like a scent stew where the perfumer took every nice smelling thing he could think of and threw them all in because he couldn&#x27;t bear to leave anything out.</li>

            <li>Best deal I have ever found on the  number #1 rated men&#x27;s fragrance by men&#x27;s fitness magazine in an independent test taken by women for their favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>That is to say, while most sellers claim this is a combination of &amp;#34;citrus, lavender, sandalwood, and spicy berries&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I get kind of a citrus and freshly showered vibe up front, followed by something that you could kind of describe as &amp;#34;spicy berries&amp;#34; I guess.</li>
            <li>i love that</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and it lasts all day.</li>

            <li>this is one of my favorite scents and for the price , its a real bargain ,great product,service, well packed, no damaged a 5 star for sure</li>
            <li>Online pricing is just better than going to department stores.</li>
            <li>The only cologne my husband wears, he loves it smells great!</li>
            <li>Love the smell, price is much better than in stores.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m ok with this cologne</li>
            <li>I love it too.  </li>
            <li>but this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>fast delivery, good price.</li>
            <li>Perfect, exactly as expected!</li>
            <li>But if you go easy on the trigger</li>
            <li>Smells good and fast free shipping from amazon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this as much as Cerruti 1881 (which is similar but better, more sophisticated, and more restrained imo), or Azzaro Pour Homme, but I do still like it a lot.</li>
            <li>and well it smelled cool popel3@columbus.rr.com</li>
            <li>Love this smell - it&#x27;s a timeless classic.</li>
            <li>Once I forgot this wasn&#x27;t Cerruti and applied as many sprays as I do for Cerruti and then instead of the &amp;#34;spicy berry&amp;#34; cacophony that eventually dries down into a nice pine, I smelled like burning tires all day.</li>
            <li>On the other hand its a pleasant cacophony.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind he ever asks for.</li>
            <li>Only kind my husband wears.  </li>
            <li>Old Favorite.</li>
            <li>I live in a house full of women who think it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>The drydown is piney and makes me think of a slightly sweet smelling evergreen forest floor, which I actually really like.</li>
            <li>The price that I paid was very reasonable, shipping was on time, packaged well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Pretty well packaged and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>and I had to get more of the same.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t own a full sized bottle when I first reviewed this, but I do now because it can be applied after a swim in a chlorinated pool, which cannot be said of either of my regular daily wearers.</li>
            <li>Similar scent but not as strong as it was before.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this for almost 10 years and it smells like the real deal.</li>
            <li>The knockoffs of this product just don&#x27;t measure up to the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Real product</li>

            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of high school dances.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Clean smelling...lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Its a big, powerful 80&#x27;s fougere (</li>
            <li>Works well with my new chemistry (unlike before when I was smoking).</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than at local retailers.</li>
            <li>Quite a strong cologne and affordable,  last at least for the whole day.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the one cologne I never get bored of , very refreshing.</li>
            <li>got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Smells the exact same as it always has, lasts all day long &amp; definately is not a knock off!!</li>
            <li>given the amount you should apply it should last a very long time at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> given the amount you should apply it should last a very long time at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent especially when I&#x27;m wearing it but for what I received, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t really last quite as long as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
            <li> May have been watered down too much or is not original product.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s hard to describe cologne, it&#x27;s very personal and the smell is different from body to another</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a big 80&#x27;s scent all the way, which is why some people love it and why others hate it.</li>
            <li> different notes: Basil, Rosemary, Green Mint, Verbana, Lemon (top), Angelica, Wormwood, Juniper, Coriander (heart), and Oak Moss, Patchouli, Cedar, Pine Needle, and Balsam (base).</li>
            <li> came before bit was due..</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s &amp;#34;fern&amp;#34; in  French, but the truth is ferns have no scent, so its the name the French gave perfumes base around a citrus-lavender-vanilla combination, which in modern men&#x27;s colognes often morphes into citrus-lavender-sandalwood/cedar).</li>
            <li> AM VERY , VERY, TICKED OFF AND UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS .</li>
            <li> Since I was a little kid during the 80&#x27;s you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be nostalgic about this stuff, but actually I never smelled it until I was over 30.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT IN THE PAST, AND I WAS VERY&lt;</li>
            <li> It loses it&#x27;s fragrance almost immediately</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews -</li>
            <li> I also now see why some people hate this though it IS easier to over apply than anything I&#x27;ve used myself.</li>
            <li> Those reviews were posted by idiots!!!</li>

            <li> My wife loves this scent especially when I&#x27;m wearing it but for what I received, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. May have been watered down too much or is not original product. Similar scent but not as strong as it was before.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s hard to describe cologne, it&#x27;s very personal and the smell is different from body to another but it&#x27;s the one cologne I never get bored of , very refreshing. The cheapest price was on Amazon $24 for 3.4oz (100ml ) and delivered in 3 days, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Best deal I have ever found on the  number #1 rated men&#x27;s fragrance by men&#x27;s fitness magazine in an independent test taken by women for their favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Been wearing it for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> This might be the quintessential 80&#x27;s cologne. Since I was a little kid during the 80&#x27;s you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be nostalgic about this stuff, but actually I never smelled it until I was over 30. I have to say though, I like this a lot. Its a big, powerful 80&#x27;s fougere (That&#x27;s &amp;#34;fern&amp;#34; in  French, but the truth is ferns have no scent, so its the name the French gave perfumes base around a citrus-lavender-vanilla combination, which in modern men&#x27;s colognes often morphes into citrus-lavender-sandalwood/cedar). This is a big 80&#x27;s scent all the way, which is why some people love it and why others hate it. That is to say, while most sellers claim this is a combination of &amp;#34;citrus, lavender, sandalwood, and spicy berries&amp;#34; (whatever those are), Guy Larouche actually lists 15 (Yes 15!) different notes: Basil, Rosemary, Green Mint, Verbana, Lemon (top), Angelica, Wormwood, Juniper, Coriander (heart), and Oak Moss, Patchouli, Cedar, Pine Needle, and Balsam (base). So this stuff is kind of like a scent stew where the perfumer took every nice smelling thing he could think of and threw them all in because he couldn&#x27;t bear to leave anything out. On the one hand, I don&#x27;t know about you, but my nose simply isn&#x27;t up to the task of picking out 15 separate notes, so Drakkar Noir is something of an Olfactory cacophony to me. On the other hand its a pleasant cacophony. I get kind of a citrus and freshly showered vibe up front, followed by something that you could kind of describe as &amp;#34;spicy berries&amp;#34; I guess. The drydown is piney and makes me think of a slightly sweet smelling evergreen forest floor, which I actually really like. I didn&#x27;t own a full sized bottle when I first reviewed this, but I do now because it can be applied after a swim in a chlorinated pool, which cannot be said of either of my regular daily wearers. I don&#x27;t like this as much as Cerruti 1881 (which is similar but better, more sophisticated, and more restrained imo), or Azzaro Pour Homme, but I do still like it a lot. I also now see why some people hate this though it IS easier to over apply than anything I&#x27;ve used myself. Once I forgot this wasn&#x27;t Cerruti and applied as many sprays as I do for Cerruti and then instead of the &amp;#34;spicy berry&amp;#34; cacophony that eventually dries down into a nice pine, I smelled like burning tires all day. But if you go easy on the trigger I feel this is a nice scent, and given the amount you should apply it should last a very long time at a reasonable price.</li>
