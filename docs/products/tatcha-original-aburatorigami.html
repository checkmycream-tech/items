            <li>I have to say these are the best blotting papers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The packaging is beautiful and as are gold flaked papers!</li>
            <li>Best thing ever!  </li>
            <li>Great product for oily skin!</li>
            <li>These blotting papers are so great!</li>
            <li>Great blotting papers - the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>they are really good!</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking to move up from products you used as a teenager, these are quite nice!</li>
            <li>Most blotting papers will pick up makeup as well as oil; Tatcha does not REMOVE makeup!</li>
            <li>Anyway, absolutely love this and recommend!</li>
            <li>I always carry these in my bag, and I love the elegant and beautiful packaging.</li>
            <li>Tatcha blotting papers are simply amazing.</li>
            <li>These work amazingly well.</li>
            <li>nice packaging</li>
            <li>I also love the fact they don&#x27;t have additives like powder or fragrances; my guy friends sneak and use them all the time!&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
            <li>I can still see that these are picking up oil, and my skin looks better afterwards, so I think they&#x27;re working,</li>
            <li>No need for touch up powder, these work like magic.  </li>
            <li>So, so lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to oil up my face more just</li>
            <li>so I can bust these babies out more often.</li>
            <li>I have been using Boscia&#x27;s blotting papers for years, but these seem to be better.  </li>
            <li>Pretty AND effective!</li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for oil/combo skin--they lifted off more makeup than oils--  </li>
            <li>Wow is it a beautiful package.</li>
            <li>Best of all they&#x27;re all-natural and great for all types of skin, including dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>they might work better for light touch ups in a drier climate or for someone with balanced skin.  </li>
            <li>for special nights and those picture moments, they do work!</li>
            <li>The linen sheets from Mary Kay or the paper sheets with powder work best for extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li>Tatcha blotting papers are simply a delight to use and work well, the papers are beautiful with flecks of gold in them and tho</li>
            <li>This packaging was so pretty, but it&#x27;s just not as effective as I would have hoped.  </li>
            <li>The large size is nice because it means I have to use fewer sheets.</li>
            <li>As someone who lives in New York City and endures some of the grossest, hottest summers I&#x27;ve ever known, these are perfect for the inevitable excess sweat that will pool on your face after being underground for a while.</li>
            <li>Geishas definitely knew what they were doing when they used this to absorb oil without removing their impeccable makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Their packaging is superb and I love the history behind the brand.</li>
            <li>happy to be sharing in on their small but powerful trick :)</li>
            <li>it takes as many as 5 of these little sheets to get your face to look good for 1 Night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>trust me, the package doesn&#x27;t have that many for it to be all that worthwhile to keep using on a daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re reasonably effective for me, but I didn&#x27;t realize how many other products were out there.</li>
            <li>Also, very pretty packaging.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li>the entire thing including package is compostable and I love how pretty it is!</li>
            <li>At this price, I had a higher expectation than cheaper brands</li>
            <li>first time using this brand....</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even aware I had that much oil on my face until I saw how saturated the paper was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Clean &amp; Clear oil absorbing sheets for years.</li>
            <li>And the little gold flakes are a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>you have really oily skin as I do</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to stop having to re-apply make-up to get rid of shine.</li>
            <li>Really soaks up the oils on my face.  </li>
            <li>Really do the job well - remove oil and don&#x27;t touch your foundation.</li>
            <li>who doesn&#x27;t like real gold flakes?</li>
            <li>Not only are they the most effective oil blotting sheets I&#x27;ve used, they are very delicate and pretty as well.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try something new because my skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>I rate them highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>And I love the little gold-colored</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve applied my makeup in the morning, it takes about 3-5 hours before I start having a \\&quot;shine\\&quot; along my T-zone (and I never like to apply more makeup- feels too heavy).</li>
            <li>These may become a new must-have for me.  </li>
            <li>Except no other, these are the real deal.</li>
            <li>They definitel absorb better than any blotting papers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why I love these over cheaper blotting papers out there, but the size is bigger and they really do the job.</li>
            <li>They clearly care about quality and aesthetics too.</li>
            <li>These blotting papers take away the shine leaving my makeup completely intact.</li>
            <li>I try to only use them when I really need it.</li>
            <li>The paper is a decent size and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>(They did take a little eyeshadow off when I tested them on my eyelids, but it wasn&#x27;t much.)</li>
            <li>They are slightly pricier than other sheets I&#x27;ve bought, but in my opinion the price difference it worth it.</li>

            <li> Too bad they&#x27;re so expensive.  </li>

            <li> The Work!&lt;br /&gt;They really do get the oil and shiny under control, sometimes for a few hours even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Problem?&lt;br /&gt;If you have really oily skin as I do it takes as many as 5 of these little sheets to get your face to look good for 1 Night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And trust me, the package doesn&#x27;t have that many for it to be all that worthwhile to keep using on a daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for special nights and those picture moments, they do work!</li>
            <li> Tatcha blotting papers are simply amazing. They&#x27;re are so versatile; you can use them to remove excess oil, as a powder alternative to set makeup, or to prep skin for makeup after applying lotion. Most blotting papers will pick up makeup as well as oil; Tatcha does not REMOVE makeup! Their packaging is superb and I love the history behind the brand. Best of all they&#x27;re all-natural and great for all types of skin, including dry and sensitive.  I also love the fact they don&#x27;t have additives like powder or fragrances; my guy friends sneak and use them all the time!&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
            <li> Tatcha blotting papers are simply a delight to use and work well, the papers are beautiful with flecks of gold in them and tho it is a tiny part of my daily face care they make me feel luxurious. Also the company gives personal attention to each order, that is something of a rarity these days. I started with one packet, and just ordered the holiday package of four. Wow is it a beautiful package. They clearly care about quality and aesthetics too.I rate them highly. I am writing under my husbands account name btw.LOL.</li>
            <li> I have to say these are the best blotting papers I have ever used. After I&#x27;ve applied my makeup in the morning, it takes about 3-5 hours before I start having a \\&quot;shine\\&quot; along my T-zone (and I never like to apply more makeup- feels too heavy). These blotting papers take away the shine leaving my makeup completely intact. I always carry these in my bag, and I love the elegant and beautiful packaging. I was hesitant to try something new because my skin is pretty sensitive and I didn&#x27;t want to break out (as I have with other blotting papers- namely the ones with a powdery finish).  I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and looks like my skin loves it too. Anyway, absolutely love this and recommend!</li>
            <li> they are really good!</li>
            <li> At this price, I had a higher expectation than cheaper brands but sadly it is comparable to cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clean &amp; Clear oil absorbing sheets for years. They&#x27;re reasonably effective for me, but I didn&#x27;t realize how many other products were out there. I got a packet of these Aburatorigami papers in a subscription box so I&#x27;ve been trying them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these perform well. They generally do not remove makeup from my nose, forehead, chin, etc. (They did take a little eyeshadow off when I tested them on my eyelids, but it wasn&#x27;t much.) The large size is nice because it means I have to use fewer sheets. The paper texture and brown color seems less artificial/more natural than some of the cheaper, competing products out there. And I love the little gold-colored flecks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the appearance of these after use undergoes a less dramatic change than the appearance of a Clean &amp; Clear sheet does. I can still see that these are picking up oil, and my skin looks better afterwards, so I think they&#x27;re working, nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to move up from products you used as a teenager, these are quite nice!</li>
            <li> No need for touch up powder, these work like magic.  The thin paper does not move your makeup around and gets rid of shine now!  Except no other, these are the real deal.</li>
            <li> If you have very oily skin, you need to use at least three sheets at a time. So for me, I used  at least six to eight sheets a day and my fingertips became oily with each use. The linen sheets from Mary Kay or the paper sheets with powder work best for extremely oily skin. The gold flakes are a useless novelty that added no value whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for every woman. It leaves your skin feeling fresh and glowing. The packaging is beautiful and as are gold flaked papers!</li>
            <li> So, so lovely. As someone who lives in New York City and endures some of the grossest, hottest summers I&#x27;ve ever known, these are perfect for the inevitable excess sweat that will pool on your face after being underground for a while. Geishas definitely knew what they were doing when they used this to absorb oil without removing their impeccable makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to be sharing in on their small but powerful trick :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cheaper smaller blotting papers before and didn&#x27;t like the added powder that never matched my medium tan complexion. These have no pesky powder, are larger and don&#x27;t take my make-up off. I recommend this to anyone who wants to stop having to re-apply make-up to get rid of shine.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well....first time using this brand....nice packaging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to oil up my face more just so I can bust these babies out more often. Not only are they the most effective oil blotting sheets I&#x27;ve used, they are very delicate and pretty as well. They are slightly pricier than other sheets I&#x27;ve bought, but in my opinion the price difference it worth it. They make my shiny forehead look matte. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really soaks up the oils on my face.  Too bad they&#x27;re so expensive.  I try to only use them when I really need it.</li>
            <li> Great blotting papers - the best I&#x27;ve found. Really do the job well - remove oil and don&#x27;t touch your foundation.</li>
            <li> the entire thing including package is compostable and I love how pretty it is! who doesn&#x27;t like real gold flakes?</li>
            <li> I wrote one for this product previously</li>
            <li> These may become a new must-have for me.  I have been using Boscia&#x27;s blotting papers for years, but these seem to be better.  For one thing, they&#x27;re almost twice the size!  Also, very pretty packaging.  And the little gold flakes are a nice touch.  Pretty AND effective!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I love these over cheaper blotting papers out there, but the size is bigger and they really do the job.</li>
            <li> When I discovered that my usual store brand blotting sheets have mineral oil, I wanted to switch to something different.  This packaging was so pretty, but it&#x27;s just not as effective as I would have hoped.  The sheets are hard to manage, and require firmer pressing, even over obvious shine spots.  So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for oil/combo skin--they lifted off more makeup than oils--  they might work better for light touch ups in a drier climate or for someone with balanced skin.  Will keep looking for a replacement to the drugstore brand...</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!  The paper is a decent size and goes a long way.  Pricey but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great product for oily skin!</li>
            <li> These blotting papers are so great! I use them almost daily - they lift away the extra oil on my skin and don&#x27;t leave me feeling dry at all. There are a TON of them in every pack so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m being cheated. They definitel absorb better than any blotting papers I&#x27;ve used in the past. Must have for everyday, especially when I&#x27;m on the go!!!</li>
            <li> These work amazingly well. I wasn&#x27;t even aware I had that much oil on my face until I saw how saturated the paper was. I always use these now after applying foundation.</li>
