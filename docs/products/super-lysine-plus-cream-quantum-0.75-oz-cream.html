            <li>smells very good</li>
            <li>The Lysine cream worked great in some skin healing that my wife was undertaking.  </li>

            <li>Great you can buy this at Walmart cheaper</li>
            <li>great for genital herpes</li>
            <li>This cream works great and in conjunction with taking the Lysine capsule, it is very effective.</li>
            <li>I will buy more EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Improved healing and pleasant smell, non geasy and no adverse side effects.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Love this lip stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It does not offer any kind of cosmetic coverage like a cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle ointment, but, so far, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We plan on purchasing more as we cannot find this in the stores around here.  </li>
            <li>In any case, we are glad we chose to use this cream.</li>
            <li>What more can I say, It works for me.  </li>
            <li>if you are thinking about getting this --just get it! :)</li>
            <li>The prescription anti-virals (Acyclovir, etc.) work about as well for me as the lysine cream, but of course they cost more, are oral medication</li>
            <li>I still get the sores, but they&#x27;re much more manageable.</li>
            <li>It is not as effective as the original Lysine+.  </li>
            <li>feels nice and works quickly.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply and has a light smell.  </li>
            <li>Very cost effective product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used the oral l-lysine pills and powder, which are also effective, but again they affect the whole body</li>
            <li>I wont be with out this product true to what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>-Super Lysine Plus Ointment-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the description too quickly, thinking the tube contained 7.5 oz, when in fact it was .75oz</li>
            <li>We rely on this ointment and sometimes the supplements for a fairly quick and thorough relief.  </li>
            <li>I am also taking the super Lysine supplements which I hope is helping too.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very well into my skin and feels comfortable on the lips.</li>
            <li>and it was well worth</li>
            <li>It requires frequent application, especially at first.</li>
            <li>Most have a kind of numbing agent and attempt to put a white, sort of papery layer over the sore, but the stuff winds up everywhere in your mouth but the actual spot you need leaving your tongue half-numb and your mouth full of goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this stuff goes to work very fast and soothes pain as well as speeds up healing.  </li>
            <li>stuff I like very much.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Try this stuff; it&#x27;s already made a big difference in my life for the better.</li>
            <li>If you can put some on when you first feel one coming</li>
            <li>one might be better gotten locally rather than having it shipped.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased at how less noticeable this one is.</li>
            <li>it really works and very very very fast--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had herpes for the last 40 years and get outbreaks with multiple sores one right after another, so the idea of an off-the-shelf, reasonably priced topical treatment seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I purchased lysine lip clear - also a product of quantum health - to use until my order for super lysine arrived.  </li>
            <li>Well-worth its reasonable price..</li>
            <li>This size is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>very</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a taste</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this ointment...</li>
            <li>tried Abreva once and don&#x27;t remember that it did anything exceptional, and the next time I went to use it the stuff had dried out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that this is actually an ointment, not a cream.</li>
            <li>Medication is causing me to experience for the first time in my life mouth sores - They are very similar to Cankar sores.</li>
            <li>when super lysine arrived, it looked the same as regular lysine</li>
            <li>I use it daily, and really helps in controlling fever sore breakouts (does not prevent them, but does reduce number of occurences)</li>
            <li>It feels natural and works as a conditioner on the skin and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend Super Lysine Plus Ointment, as long as you are seeking a clear ointment.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty clear and I just put a lot of clear lip gloss on my other lip to balance out the glossiness</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really work as expected.</li>
            <li>It soothes it and it goes away much quicker than the other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I use a generous amount as soon as I&#x27;m aware of the sore, keep applying it every few hours, and get immediate relief of pain and itching.</li>
            <li>No problems noted, very helpful, less discomfort time.</li>

            <li> It was much too small for the purpose intended.</li>
            <li> so they affect the whole body, and it&#x27;s a pain to have to get prescriptions from my doctor every year at least.</li>
            <li> I applied it directly to the sores and after a few minutes the pain was almost gone.</li>
            <li> This product works better in helping &#x27;cold sores&#x27; heal faster than any other I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> the regular lysine worked well and cost half the price.</li>
            <li> stuff.(The stuff in the little tube w/ the blue</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores by me, and have only found the larger size (21 grams) on-line.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Lysine, zinc and other ingredients work together to create a healing balm for inflamed, sore skin.</li>
            <li> there are a couple other ones I tried, and they just seemed to put a seal on it</li>
            <li> but then again I had been trying all of these other products</li>
            <li> Really helps when you have a cold sore.  </li>
            <li> but when applied to my outbreak of shingles - it was a sticky mess!  </li>
            <li> It doesnt smell bad or taste funny.</li>
            <li> Sores don&#x27;t get as bad and last only 2 to 4 days instead of 5 days to a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually get abreva</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several remedies for cold sores.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I feel the tingling of the cold sore coming in, I use it and the next day the pain is gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten one or two cold sores a year for the last 20 years....</li>
            <li> It always sucks and</li>
            <li> Have only used it once on what felt like the start of a cold sore.</li>
            <li> Definitely relieves and shortens life of cold sores</li>
            <li> In the past I would often get painful sores whenever I was in the sun for an extended period such as hiking or fishing</li>
            <li> Works extremely well for cold sores.</li>
            <li> It suppresses cold sores before they get red and angry.</li>
            <li> seriously do yourself a favor and get it... if you want this thing gone sooner!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the expensive drug store</li>
            <li> cream feels oily, has a faint smell, and isn&#x27;t a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> - Just as painful and tough to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When either my husband or I are under a lot of stress or fall ill, we&#x27;ll sometimes get rashes or cold sores.  </li>
            <li> Served it&#x27;s purpose and kept the cold sores at bay.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a cold sore break out since (knock on wood)...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t try to create a coating or numb anything.</li>
            <li> I use it whenever I feel a cold sore coming.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t stop it it will shorten the length of time the blister is painful.</li>
            <li> keeps the cold sores at bay!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna deal with the ugly annoying thing for a week or so....</li>
            <li> It smells like a petroleum base.  </li>
            <li> The cold sore never comes !!!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several remedies for cold sores.  This one seems to reduce the severity and length.  It&#x27;s not a miracle ointment, but, so far, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve used.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It smells like a petroleum base.  It is not as effective as the original Lysine+.  It wouldn&#x27;t buy this product ever again.</li>

            <li> The Lysine cream worked great in some skin healing that my wife was undertaking.  She was using Acyclovir but we opted to switch and it was well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We plan on purchasing more as we cannot find this in the stores around here.  Hopefully that changes.  In any case, we are glad we chose to use this cream.</li>
            <li> this stuff goes to work very fast and soothes pain as well as speeds up healing.  great to have around</li>
            <li> I have been using Lysine Plus Cream for lip sores about two years.  In the past I would often get painful sores whenever I was in the sun for an extended period such as hiking or fishing but since I started using this cream I have not had any noticeable soars. What more can I say, It works for me.  I use it every morning and evening.  This size is a real bargain.</li>

            <li> blown away by this product-- it really works and very very very fast-- very happy-- if you are thinking about getting this --just get it! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had herpes for the last 40 years and get outbreaks with multiple sores one right after another, so the idea of an off-the-shelf, reasonably priced topical treatment seemed too good to be true. This stuff really works. I use a generous amount as soon as I&#x27;m aware of the sore, keep applying it every few hours, and get immediate relief of pain and itching.

The prescription anti-virals (Acyclovir, etc.) work about as well for me as the lysine cream, but of course they cost more, are oral medication so they affect the whole body, and it&#x27;s a pain to have to get prescriptions from my doctor every year at least. I&#x27;ve also used the oral l-lysine pills and powder, which are also effective, but again they affect the whole body and I don&#x27;t like taking big doses every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels oily, has a faint smell, and isn&#x27;t a miracle cure. I still get the sores, but they&#x27;re much more manageable. Try this stuff; it&#x27;s already made a big difference in my life for the better.</li>
            <li> I read the description too quickly, thinking the tube contained 7.5 oz, when in fact it was .75oz.. It was much too small for the purpose intended. However, i recommend the actual product.</li>
            <li> Great you can buy this at Walmart cheaper</li>
            <li> When either my husband or I are under a lot of stress or fall ill, we&#x27;ll sometimes get rashes or cold sores.  We rely on this ointment and sometimes the supplements for a fairly quick and thorough relief.  This is always in our medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> it works excellent- I will buy more EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!!!! I wont be with out this product true to what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> This product does work to stop a fever blister. If you can put some on when you first feel one coming it&#x27;s very likely this may stop it from forming. If it doesn&#x27;t stop it it will shorten the length of time the blister is painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but seriously I am so impressed with this product I had to spread the word! I&#x27;ve gotten one or two cold sores a year for the last 20 years.... It always sucks and I&#x27;ve always just excepted I&#x27;m gonna deal with the ugly annoying thing for a week or so.... I usually get abreva so I feel I&#x27;m doing something, but I never feel like it helped... there are a couple other ones I tried, and they just seemed to put a seal on it and it got bigger yellower and crustier. THIS ointment I&#x27;ve been applying every two hours and it is already significantly smaller in just 4 days... I like the way it seems to just keep it lubricated instead of scabbing up. It goes on pretty clear and I just put a lot of clear lip gloss on my other lip to balance out the glossiness and I was very pleased at how less noticeable this one is. I am also taking the super Lysine supplements which I hope is helping too.  I highly recommend this ointment... seriously do yourself a favor and get it... if you want this thing gone sooner! And the itchiness is lessoned a lot as well.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once on what felt like the start of a cold sore.The feeling went away by the next day.</li>
            <li> Medication is causing me to experience for the first time in my life mouth sores - They are very similar to Cankar sores. - Just as painful and tough to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried literally about 10 options before stumbling onto this one. Most have a kind of numbing agent and attempt to put a white, sort of papery layer over the sore, but the stuff winds up everywhere in your mouth but the actual spot you need leaving your tongue half-numb and your mouth full of goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff I like very much. It doesn&#x27;t try to create a coating or numb anything. I applied it directly to the sores and after a few minutes the pain was almost gone. It requires frequent application, especially at first. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a taste but then again I had been trying all of these other products so my taste buds may have been off. The sores started to heal and are still a work in process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all I tried, this was the best for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay attention to who is the seller on these - No problem if you place the order with regular shipping. It will take about 9+ days. If you attempt to \\&quot;expedite\\&quot; shipping you will still get the product in 9+ days time but you&#x27;ll be charged a premium that exceeds the cost of the product. In my case for $5.56 of product, the shipping premium was almost $12 and the only thing expedited was money out of my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one might be better gotten locally rather than having it shipped.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works besides lemon balm oil, switch these two as needed, lemon balm is also called Melissa oil found in health food store.</li>
            <li> Definitely relieves and shortens life of cold sores</li>
            <li> I purchased lysine lip clear - also a product of quantum health - to use until my order for super lysine arrived.  when super lysine arrived, it looked the same as regular lysine but when applied to my outbreak of shingles - it was a sticky mess!  no, I would not recommend this product to anyone.  the regular lysine worked well and cost half the price.</li>
            <li> great for genital herpes</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I use it whenever I feel a cold sore coming. It absorbs very well into my skin and feels comfortable on the lips. I always keep some at home and at work. It doesnt smell bad or taste funny. It feels natural and works as a conditioner on the skin and moisturizer.</li>
