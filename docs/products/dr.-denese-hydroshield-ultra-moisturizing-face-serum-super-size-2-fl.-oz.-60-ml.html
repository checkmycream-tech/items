            <li>It works great for me</li>
            <li>I do use the resurface wash and the hydrating dream cream along with this, but I think even alone, this is a great product.</li>

            <li>this is one of the best products to make my skin feel smooth before you apply moisturizer.unfortunately</li>
            <li>I need a good moisturizer to keep the peeling to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Our skin is healthy and glowing!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find any spectacular results from it.</li>
            <li>You are better off with Olay serums.</li>
            <li>It may be OK to wear during the day under make-up, but to sleep with it would be a crime.  </li>
            <li>But would probably be okay for night time use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, I get compliments everywhere</li>
            <li>I have turned on so many friends to this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, impressed that it wasn&#x27;t a tiny bottle...</li>
            <li>I love Dr Denese....</li>
            <li>but this stuff is WAY better.</li>
            <li>The product just seems okay to me.</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the silky texture and lightweight feel.</li>
            <li>Was delighted to find this at a reasonable cost and will continue to use it as it&#x27;s a wonderful facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but it certainly makes my skin feel better!</li>
            <li>I reviewed this product after the first purchase, and as I am about to finish the second bottle, I can reconfirm that this is one of the best skin care products I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item before properly researching based on the great reviews here.  </li>
            <li>HydroShield does feel smooth and I don&#x27;t find it greasy, but</li>
            <li>When you wake in the morning, your face feels fabulous.</li>
            <li>but there are comparable products out there at a more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I had tried a sample of this before, but was reluctant to pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>Dr. Denise has hit the mark with this super moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Denese HydroShield Ultra Moisturizing Face Serum, Super Size 2 fl.</li>
            <li>while I don&#x27;t *dislike* HydroShield, I think Hourglass 28 wins for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dropper application keeps things clean but make sure the top is on tight cause if it is on its side, it may leak.</li>
            <li>It feels oily when you are putting it on - sparingly - but it soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I have used many products over the counter and prescription, and this has been terrific for me.</li>
            <li>This works so well all over the face and around the eyes that I could probably go without a moisturizer on top of it, but I do use just a tiny bit of moisturizer to seal it in.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this product.</li>
            <li>It feels like glycerine or an oil when you first put it on</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and have been using Hourglass N 28 Primer Serum (which I love).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s &amp;#34;dimethicone&amp;#34;, which is silicone!), and doesn&#x27;t really soak in.  </li>
            <li>I really like this serum and have used it morning and evening on my face, neck, and the backs of my hands for some time now.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I have found a new moisture surge by Clinique that works just as well maybe a little better.</li>
            <li>I will definitively be ordering more of this and will be trying other Dr. Denese products.</li>
            <li>Well, not super pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li>I first got this from supporting public television  and watching Dr. Denese and as I am older and wrinkled find</li>
            <li>Your face feels velvety smooth and soft the next morning.</li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly and that is a plus, however, did gain enough results to want to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>If you are going to buy just one high end skin care product, this should be it.</li>
            <li>I am on a Rx Retinal that makes my skin very sensitive to products.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily wicking into the skin leaving a matte finish, not oily or greasy, not drying, not making your face feel tight in any way.</li>
            <li>it is worth it, plus the whole range of other issues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which is truly doing the magic</li>
            <li>I gave it to my daughter to start using now at a young age to preserve her skin.</li>
            <li>and this helps keep it soft and makes it receptive to moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>, I am 48 yrs old.</li>
            <li>I like that it is safe and recommended around the delicate eye area, where I really need moisture but have to be careful not to irritate.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is actually quite large and it seems to be going a long way.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 60&#x27;s and my skin has become drier, especially in winter.</li>
            <li>I just hadn&#x27;t looked far enough before.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use it on my forehead, eye area, cheeks and under my chin, and I avoid getting it too near my nose and mouth area, where I had minor breakouts (the directions say just that, so please read them.)  </li>
            <li>I have mature, dry skin</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is everything that it says. It goes on easily wicking into the skin leaving a matte finish, not oily or greasy, not drying, not making your face feel tight in any way. After several months of using this product, I noticed my rosacea disappear. I have used many products over the counter and prescription, and this has been terrific for me. I gave it to my daughter to start using now at a young age to preserve her skin. Thank you Dr. Denese!</li>
            <li> If you are going to buy just one high end skin care product, this should be it. I have never been as impressed by anything I have bought for my skin as I was impressed by this product. The price is excellent, and I hope it will continue to be avabilable on Amazon. I am in my early 60&#x27;s and my skin has become drier, especially in winter. This works so well all over the face and around the eyes that I could probably go without a moisturizer on top of it, but I do use just a tiny bit of moisturizer to seal it in. I researched this product a great deal before buying it, and it gets many great reviews. The bottle is actually quite large and it seems to be going a long way.</li>
            <li> Dr. Denise has hit the mark with this super moisturizer.  Has changed my skin plus I&#x27;m 60+ so can you imagine what it wiil do for the younger generation.  Be serious about following directions this is my 3rd bottle and it last about 3 months.  A little goes along ways and don&#x27;t forget your neck[[ASIN:B000OIHHYK Dr. Denese HydroShield Ultra Moisturizing Face Serum, Super Size 2 fl. oz. (60 ml)]].</li>
            <li> The texture is gloopy, and does not sink in, which is critical for a serum.  I don&#x27;t think it made any difference.  I&#x27;ve moved on to something else and am using this up by putting it on the back of my hands. You are better off with Olay serums.</li>
            <li> I bought this item before properly researching based on the great reviews here.  When I applied it to my face it felt horrible, oily and not natural, so i looked up the ingredients and the first item listed is dimethicone, which is a  type of silicone.  It can cause allergies and clogged pores.  It may be OK to wear during the day under make-up, but to sleep with it would be a crime.  It may make your skin look smoother for a bit, but I doubt the horrible feel of it is worth it, plus the whole range of other issues. See [...]</li>
            <li> Well, not super pleased with this one.  Don&#x27;t know why people raved about it.  It goes on like coating your face with silicone (oh wait -- it&#x27;s &amp;#34;dimethicone&amp;#34;, which is silicone!), and doesn&#x27;t really soak in.  I&#x27;m just not sure how I feel about coating my face in that stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use under makeup, as it just makes it look smeary and oily, yuck.  But would probably be okay for night time use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely protects skin from drying out.  Unscented, yay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product after the first purchase, and as I am about to finish the second bottle, I can reconfirm that this is one of the best skin care products I have ever used.  It really soaks in after a few minutes, and enhances the effectiveness of other moisturizers.  I like that it is safe and recommended around the delicate eye area, where I really need moisture but have to be careful not to irritate.  I use it on my forehead, eye area, cheeks and under my chin, and I avoid getting it too near my nose and mouth area, where I had minor breakouts (the directions say just that, so please read them.)  Highly recommended for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum and have used it morning and evening on my face, neck, and the backs of my hands for some time now.  I have mature, dry skin and this helps keep it soft and makes it receptive to moisturizers.  Very good product!</li>
            <li> I first got this from supporting public television  and watching Dr. Denese and as I am older and wrinkled find this is one of the best products to make my skin feel smooth before you apply moisturizer.unfortunately it is quite expensive but it lasts fairly long.Amazon has it the cheapest I could find but I dont like paying shipping on such an expensive product and wish amazon could offer it free shipping.</li>
            <li> Ok, I get compliments everywhere I go on my skin.  I am a senior citizen but was &amp;#34;the bomb&amp;#34; in my day, so this is a go to product for me.  I have turned on so many friends to this product.  Our skin is healthy and glowing!</li>
            <li> This serum feels a bit greasy at first,but absorbs after a few minutes.Your face feels velvety smooth and soft the next morning.My one gripe is the applicator,when applying this,sometimes it spills out the applicator.Also, I&#x27;d like to know the percentage of retinol in this as Dr. Denese does not disclose this?</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this product. I have very dry skin and have been using Hourglass N 28 Primer Serum (which I love). I was tempted to try HydroShield to compare with my Hourglass standby. HydroShield does feel smooth and I don&#x27;t find it greasy, but while I don&#x27;t *dislike* HydroShield, I think Hourglass 28 wins for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews where some think Hourglass is too moisturizing, so if your skin isn&#x27;t as dry as mine, HydroShield may be for you.</li>
            <li> This serum makes my face feel great! It works great for me and I have seen a decrease in the severity of my wrinkles, I am 48 yrs old. I do use the resurface wash and the hydrating dream cream along with this, but I think even alone, this is a great product. Also, impressed that it wasn&#x27;t a tiny bottle... Seems like it will last me some time.</li>
            <li> I love Dr Denese....this product I have been using for years.... pricey tho....but works well on dry skin....keeps it hydrated well</li>
            <li> I am on a Rx Retinal that makes my skin very sensitive to products. I need a good moisturizer to keep the peeling to a minimum. I was using Clinique gel but this stuff is WAY better. The dropper application keeps things clean but make sure the top is on tight cause if it is on its side, it may leak. A little goes a long way too. It feels like glycerine or an oil when you first put it on but it drys in less than 5 mins. I will definitively be ordering more of this and will be trying other Dr. Denese products.</li>
            <li> The product just seems okay to me. I didn&#x27;t find any spectacular results from it. Could be that it is not formulated for African American skin types. It does absorb quickly and that is a plus, however, did gain enough results to want to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always felt this was the only product I could find that would handle my extreme dry skin. Now that the price is going up I have been forced to look for something else.  Luckily I have found a new moisture surge by Clinique that works just as well maybe a little better. Sorry Dr. Denese but there are comparable products out there at a more reasonable price.  I just hadn&#x27;t looked far enough before.</li>
            <li> I use several of her products. I&#x27;m not sure which is truly doing the magic but I love this stuff. It is my &#x27;elixir of life&#x27;. It feels oily when you are putting it on - sparingly - but it soaks right in. When you wake in the morning, your face feels fabulous. I wear it under the Dream Cream as well. I have very nice skin and people always complement me. I bought this bottle and have simply been putting it into my travel sized bottle with the pump, which is a little easier to use.</li>
            <li> This product went on well and appeared to moisturize and even plump skin. However when I wasn&#x27;t using it my skin as in I had only bare skin, my skin looked worse than before I started using it. Made me skeptical to use it long term.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s erasing any wrinkles but it certainly makes my skin feel better! Love the silky texture and lightweight feel. I had tried a sample of this before, but was reluctant to pay full price for it. Kept trying other, less expensive serums but none measured up to this one.  Was delighted to find this at a reasonable cost and will continue to use it as it&#x27;s a wonderful facial moisturizer.</li>
