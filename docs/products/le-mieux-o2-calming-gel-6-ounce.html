            <li> I use this one week and its really good</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with the NuFace Trinity in place of their gel.  Definitely not the right product for to be using.  I went back to their gel for now.  The Le Mieux is too lightweight to use with microcurrent, but it does feel lovely on the skin and does feel like it hydrates.</li>
            <li> I use this calming gel with my Tria 4 x and works great without putting out so much $.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break me out. The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It calms the redness and soothes the skin!! I am really satisfied.</li>
            <li> it really soothes the skin</li>

            <li> Love this product.  I use it for the Nuface trinity and is much better than the primer they provide with it.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works great with the Micro current machine!  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It has a thin consistency which glides smoothly on my face when I use my micro current machine</li>
            <li> Goooooooood I&#x27;ve nothing to say that.</li>
            <li> This product is great but this should be priced at $20.! Don&#x27;t buy from Amazon, its not suppose to be sold here.  You don&#x27;t know quality and expiration.  Buy from your esthetician!!</li>
            <li> So, this can be use for the face??</li>
            <li> so far ....  nothing bad</li>
