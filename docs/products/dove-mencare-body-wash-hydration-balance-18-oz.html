    <ol>
            <li>Happy sudsing!</li>
            <li>One of the great things about the body wash from Dove is that it&#x27;s also a face wash.</li>

            <li>This one smells great in the shower but doesn&#x27;t linger around after the shower.</li>

            <li>It does go on nice, lathers well and rinses off well.</li>
            <li>It has a scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and it lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all great stuff, and this new hydration balance body wash is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is good but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It works great as a body wash and gives me a good feeling of being fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Body Wash leave the skin very clean and nice</li>
            <li>He said: I found the body wash to be very refreshing, the fragrance to be quite nice,and the moisturizers leave your skin to be smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>This body wash might be a favorite.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic skin care line for men!</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I’m sure</li>
            <li>This is the favorite body wash of the men in my house.</li>
            <li>so there is no way to store the bottle so that the flip cap is on the top.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, clean scent.</li>
            <li>The quality of the body wash itself is excellent and since it does not have a strong scent, works for the entire family.</li>
            <li>It has a nice mild but manly scent that never is overpowering and soaps up well but doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>I have mildly irritable skin, and this Dove Men + Care Hydration body soap doesn&#x27;t set off any kind of reactions or blemishes for me.  </li>
            <li>Our family enjoyed the light scent, which didn&#x27;t stick around post-shower, but found that we preferred the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; type Dove body washes better.</li>
            <li>Other peoples&#x27; spouses may find the scent of this body wash delightful.</li>
            <li>Dove Men + Care Body Wash, Hydration Balance, 18 Ounce is a wonderful body wash with none of the grit often found in other washes.</li>
            <li>, however, the bottom of the bottle is a bit narrower which makes it easy to knock over.</li>
            <li>Like a very, very mild men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well in a poof or washcloth and spread easily on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I certainly feel clean, and feel good after using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a mild fragrance, but it’s very light and not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>have used various Dove products for years and have had great experience with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple of Dove Men body wash and while the soap was nice, I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is otherwise, as far as I can tell, a superior product.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, masculine scent that is mild and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>so it is quick and easy to dispense</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still nice to have that option if you&#x27;re in a pinch and the high sudsing factor of this product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use body wash, but I liked the moisturizing effect this has on my skin.</li>
            <li>Rich lather, crisp refreshing scent, dual wash functionality for face and body with added benefits of moisturization - this one has it all and comes packaged in a bottom dispensed 18 ounce rugged squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh, without that strong cologne smell</li>
            <li>Men want to smell clean but not &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; so that you can tell they are coming by the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love liquid soap and this one has a great scent that stays with you for a few hours.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and smell</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering and it rinses clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>Kind of a musky scent, not too strong - perhaps a fourth as strong as the  AXE body washes.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of got a tangy Old Spice vibe.</li>
            <li>Especially at this price point, Doves Men&#x27;s body wash is good stuff.</li>
            <li>, it’s a good value, and will last a good long while.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean fresh scent and he likes the way his skin feels after his shower.</li>
            <li>like the clean, fresh, unobstrusive  scent.  </li>
            <li>This does a good job of getting you clean and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li>body wash is good on my face and other areas where shampoo doesn&#x27;t quite fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff for a thorough cleanse from the neck on down to your toes.</li>
            <li>The nice thing though is if that regular face wash I use runs out, I can use this for my face.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s just my own personal preference.</li>
            <li>If you use a body wash - this one is worth a try.</li>
            <li>It cleans what it needs to clean and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry either, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as any other bodywash I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It rinses clean and is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>The product helps me get clean but also washes off enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave a strong detergent feel afterwards either.</li>
            <li>So far, after a week, I’m doing fine without the body lotion.  </li>
            <li>This one has a more &#x27;man&#x27; scent to it, although not overpowering and cheap like some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li>but the top of the bottle is not flat</li>
            <li>My husband and teen son love Dove&#x27;s men line.</li>
            <li>But I know better than to instigate domestic strife over an aroma.  </li>
            <li>The scent is okay - not exactly a totally manly scent, but no too flowery either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moisturizes just right: not to much and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin like a barren wasteland.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to pretty much using it for everything from deodorant to body wash to after shave.</li>
            <li>and thus I don&#x27;t waste as much as the Nivea, but especially because it doesn&#x27;t make the shower floor incredibly slippery like the Nivea body wash.  </li>
            <li>On the hydration part, he couldnt feel much difference, may be because of the weather and hot location.</li>
            <li>though I must say I don’t find it all that easy to open.  </li>
            <li>The key here is mild!  </li>
            <li>This body wash has a blue, gel-like consistency that goes on the body smoothly.</li>
            <li>: The ingredients contain a lot of unfamiliar chemical names, so stick to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s if you like to know what you&#x27;re absorbing through your pores.  </li>
            <li>body wash does not lather as much as some others</li>
            <li>My preference is to have the flip cap on top until the bottle gets closer to being empty.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my youngest son to try and he likes it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>In addition to my own personal preference, anytime there are several people sharing a shower - college dorms, guest bathrooms, etc</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a blue gel that smells clean, and yet manly.</li>
            <li>This Dove product has a pleasant smell very slightly reminiscent of my favorite body wash, Felce Azzura, which is prohibitively expensive in the U.S.</li>
            <li>not only feel comfortable in my skin (as long as I avoid mirrors), I also feel clean.  </li>
            <li>specific one is supposed to be Hydration Balance (I feel like most of the differentiations are a gimmick), but I really haven&#x27;t noticed anything different with it.  </li>
            <li>It is a blue gel that lathers up into a rich, moisturizing soap that leaves skin feeling soft without drying.</li>
            <li>I have used many body wash for men products in the past that have a much stronger scent that tends to linger around after the shower.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if Dove would redesign the cap a little better to make it open a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could order this instead - unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t appear to be available in the Amazon Subscribe and Save program yet, so I will just have to order more when I start to run out.  </li>
            <li>problem with most men&#x27;s shower gels is that they are perfumed and the scent -- which is advertised as masculine -- just is plain awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sit near people at work who are very sensitive to fragrances and they&#x27;ve never complained about the scent when I use this body wash.  </li>
            <li>powdery smelling like some of their other ones can be (some of the more basic ones smell this way to me).  </li>
            <li>As much as I liked smelling a little bit like coconuts after taking a shower, I prefer this product because it&#x27;s harder to squeeze from the bottle</li>
            <li>Definitely masculine.</li>
            <li>one changes that completely</li>
            <li>I prefer the Dove Men Bar Soap to this body wash, but I am still old school I guess.</li>
            <li>Body Wash leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no heavy moisture barrier on the surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no issues with it so far.  </li>
            <li>Good and sudsy, faint fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves that this doesn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling itchy or tight, just clean</li>
            <li>makes a little bit sure go a long way.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also easy to squeeze, and the flip-lid&#x27;s hinge is durable enough to last until you empty the bottle without snapping off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this to have only the slightest of scents - a light, slightly woodsy scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but for the quality, I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t observed a big difference in skin hydration post-shower, not sure how something you rinse off would really provide much in that regard.  </li>
            <li>An adult male and two teenage boys.  </li>
            <li>As far as providing &amp;#34;hydration balance,&amp;#34; ehh....it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin as well as lotion or something.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Moisturizes just right: not to much and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin like a barren wasteland.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to pretty much using it for everything from deodorant to body wash to after shave.</li>
            <li> and thus I don&#x27;t waste as much as the Nivea, but especially because it doesn&#x27;t make the shower floor incredibly slippery like the Nivea body wash.  </li>
            <li> On the hydration part, he couldnt feel much difference, may be because of the weather and hot location.</li>
            <li> though I must say I don’t find it all that easy to open.  </li>
            <li> The key here is mild!  </li>
            <li> This body wash has a blue, gel-like consistency that goes on the body smoothly.</li>
            <li> : The ingredients contain a lot of unfamiliar chemical names, so stick to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s if you like to know what you&#x27;re absorbing through your pores.  </li>
            <li> body wash does not lather as much as some others</li>
            <li> My preference is to have the flip cap on top until the bottle gets closer to being empty.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my youngest son to try and he likes it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> In addition to my own personal preference, anytime there are several people sharing a shower - college dorms, guest bathrooms, etc</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a blue gel that smells clean, and yet manly.</li>
            <li> This Dove product has a pleasant smell very slightly reminiscent of my favorite body wash, Felce Azzura, which is prohibitively expensive in the U.S.</li>
            <li> not only feel comfortable in my skin (as long as I avoid mirrors), I also feel clean.  </li>
            <li> specific one is supposed to be Hydration Balance (I feel like most of the differentiations are a gimmick), but I really haven&#x27;t noticed anything different with it.  </li>
            <li> It is a blue gel that lathers up into a rich, moisturizing soap that leaves skin feeling soft without drying.</li>
            <li> I have used many body wash for men products in the past that have a much stronger scent that tends to linger around after the shower.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if Dove would redesign the cap a little better to make it open a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could order this instead - unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t appear to be available in the Amazon Subscribe and Save program yet, so I will just have to order more when I start to run out.  </li>
            <li> problem with most men&#x27;s shower gels is that they are perfumed and the scent -- which is advertised as masculine -- just is plain awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sit near people at work who are very sensitive to fragrances and they&#x27;ve never complained about the scent when I use this body wash.  </li>
            <li> powdery smelling like some of their other ones can be (some of the more basic ones smell this way to me).  </li>
            <li> As much as I liked smelling a little bit like coconuts after taking a shower, I prefer this product because it&#x27;s harder to squeeze from the bottle</li>
            <li> Definitely masculine.</li>
            <li> one changes that completely</li>
            <li> I prefer the Dove Men Bar Soap to this body wash, but I am still old school I guess.</li>
            <li> Body Wash leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no heavy moisture barrier on the surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no issues with it so far.  </li>
            <li> Good and sudsy, faint fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves that this doesn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling itchy or tight, just clean</li>
            <li> makes a little bit sure go a long way.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also easy to squeeze, and the flip-lid&#x27;s hinge is durable enough to last until you empty the bottle without snapping off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this to have only the slightest of scents - a light, slightly woodsy scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but for the quality, I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t observed a big difference in skin hydration post-shower, not sure how something you rinse off would really provide much in that regard.  </li>
            <li> An adult male and two teenage boys.  </li>
            <li> As far as providing &amp;#34;hydration balance,&amp;#34; ehh....it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin as well as lotion or something.  </li>
            <li> I generally apply lotion to areas that get dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly Old Spice but has the same vibe to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> especially in the dry winter months. .</li>
            <li> Having been spoiled by the white/cream washes, which can even be used to shave with, this gel-based wash was not nearly as moisturizing or thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Soaps and some body washes leave me feeling stretched and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of new haircare products from Dove over the past year or so</li>
            <li> A man in my family has slightly dry skin, so I asked him to try this product.</li>
            <li> The scent definitely smells like what companies think a &amp;#34;man-soap scent&amp;#34; should be, but it&#x27;s not nearly as powerful as some of the Axe body wash fragrances.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance could have been a little stronger and last longer though.</li>
            <li> liquid soap is a dark blue color with typical viscosity.  </li>
            <li> some other men&#x27;s body washes have.</li>
            <li> 12 hours after use, the skin still smells faintly of this scent, a very manly yet not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> The only negative for me is in the packaging.</li>
            <li> It would have been better if it was a bit wider at the base.</li>
            <li> SMELL Skipping to the heart of it, my rating here comes down to one factor.</li>
            <li> so less clutter in the shower and gym bags.</li>
            <li> The Dove Men + Care Hydration body and face wash is a body wash with a typical, but not overbearing, &amp;#34;man&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> One negative is that it&#x27;s not very natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few Dove Men + Care body washes now, and this bottle works just as well as any of them.  </li>
            <li> Also, the opening is rather small, so you’re not going to squirt-out an overabundance and waste it.</li>
            <li> They advertise that if fights dry skin compared to any other body wash, but I am disappointed to say, it hasn&#x27;t worked for me, my skin is still itchy, so I have to keep looking now, meanwhile, i don&#x27;t want anyone to get ripped off, I guess I should never believe what it actually says on the package.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often use it that way, as I&#x27;m usually using a separate face wash.</li>
            <li> I usually use body lotion . . .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put my finger on the scent.</li>
            <li> It lathers well on a washcloth--doesn&#x27;t require a ridiculous amount to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> The elongated oval shape gives it a stable base, even on those types of shower shelves where the wires are spread out nearly an inch apart.  </li>
            <li> The bottle itself has an oval shape and base, which actually works well on shower racks that are composed of wires.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Dove products.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a big fan of the Dove Men + care line. I&#x27;ve switched to pretty much using it for everything from deodorant to body wash to after shave. It&#x27;s all great stuff, and this new hydration balance body wash is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a blue gel that smells clean, and yet manly. There are beads in it, and it lathers up well. I certainly feel clean, and feel good after using it. One of the great things about the body wash from Dove is that it&#x27;s also a face wash. I don&#x27;t often use it that way, as I&#x27;m usually using a separate face wash. The nice thing though is if that regular face wash I use runs out, I can use this for my face. Still feels great, and seems to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely happy with the Dove line, and plan to continue to be a customer.</li>
            <li> My husband and teen son love Dove&#x27;s men line. You will always find one of their body washes in their showers. This body wash might be a favorite. It has a nice, clean scent. Not overpowering. Definitely masculine. It rinses clean and is very hydrating. It is a body/face wash combo, so less clutter in the shower and gym bags. This is a fantastic skin care line for men!</li>
            <li> Probably the biggest endorsement I can give a product is to subscribe to it on Amazon.  I just cancelled my subscription to Nivea Coconut Body Wash so I could order this instead - unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t appear to be available in the Amazon Subscribe and Save program yet, so I will just have to order more when I start to run out.  As much as I liked smelling a little bit like coconuts after taking a shower, I prefer this product because it&#x27;s harder to squeeze from the bottle and thus I don&#x27;t waste as much as the Nivea, but especially because it doesn&#x27;t make the shower floor incredibly slippery like the Nivea body wash.  This Dove product has a pleasant smell very slightly reminiscent of my favorite body wash, Felce Azzura, which is prohibitively expensive in the U.S.</li>
            <li> This body wash has a blue, gel-like consistency that goes on the body smoothly. It lathers moderately, rinses and cleans well. It has a pleasant, masculine scent that is mild and unobtrusive. I have used many body wash for men products in the past that have a much stronger scent that tends to linger around after the shower. This one smells great in the shower but doesn&#x27;t linger around after the shower. It&#x27;s hard to put my finger on the scent. It&#x27;s not exactly Old Spice but has the same vibe to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used various Dove products for years and have had great experience with them. The Dove Men + Care body wash appears to be another great product from them. It works great as a body wash and gives me a good feeling of being fresh and clean. It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Dove Men hydration balance body wash smells great (hey what Dove body wash doesn&#x27;t? Lol) and hydrates/moisturizers the skin. Leaves your man smelling sooooooo good!&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars another great DOVE product</li>
            <li> My husband says this is great. It has a clean fresh scent and he likes the way his skin feels after his shower. It lathers well and cleans effectively. He will definitely purchase this when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing. 12 hours after use, the skin still smells faintly of this scent, a very manly yet not overpowering smell. It lathers well on a washcloth--doesn&#x27;t require a ridiculous amount to get the desired effect. Skin feels rejuvenated after use. A winner of a product. Also, no allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> Our family enjoyed the light scent, which didn&#x27;t stick around post-shower, but found that we preferred the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; type Dove body washes better. Having been spoiled by the white/cream washes, which can even be used to shave with, this gel-based wash was not nearly as moisturizing or thick.&lt;br /&gt;I did like that the dispenser is at the bottom of the bottle so it is quick and easy to dispense, however, the bottom of the bottle is a bit narrower which makes it easy to knock over. It would have been better if it was a bit wider at the base.</li>
            <li> SMELL Skipping to the heart of it, my rating here comes down to one factor. I like the smell of this soap okay, it&#x27;s kind of got a tangy Old Spice vibe. But there&#x27;s a floral topnote that is definitely not for me. As an Allergic American™, I avoid the smell of things like fresh-mown lawns, ostentatious bouquets of roses and patchouli patches.  The flower musk is just one component of this Dove Men Plus Care Body Wash, and I might abide it if it made the wife swoon. However, her review of the smell was a tepid shrug: &amp;#34;Plasticky.&amp;#34; Now, I personally don&#x27;t smell anything I associate with plastic in the scent. But I know better than to instigate domestic strife over an aroma.  FEEL Feels great, soaps up nicely.  CLEANING ABILITY Fine. Just as good as any other bodywash I&#x27;ve tried.  OVERALL I&#x27;m just one data point. Other peoples&#x27; spouses may find the scent of this body wash delightful. It is otherwise, as far as I can tell, a superior product. Side note: The ingredients contain a lot of unfamiliar chemical names, so stick to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s if you like to know what you&#x27;re absorbing through your pores.  Happy sudsing!</li>
            <li> Good and sudsy, faint fragrance.  Kind of a musky scent, not too strong - perhaps a fourth as strong as the  AXE body washes.  I use about a tablespoon on a cotton washcloth and it&#x27;s plenty.  Haven&#x27;t observed a big difference in skin hydration post-shower, not sure how something you rinse off would really provide much in that regard.  I generally apply lotion to areas that get dry.</li>
            <li> I usually use body lotion . . . especially in the dry winter months. . . I thought I would try this to see if I still need to use it in the Summer.  So far, after a week, I’m doing fine without the body lotion.  I’m sure in the winter, I’ll need to go back to using lotion, but for now I’m fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash does not lather as much as some others I’ve used.  But it still does the job.  I like the opening being on the bottom. . . though I must say I don’t find it all that easy to open.  It would be nice if Dove would redesign the cap a little better to make it open a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a mild fragrance, but it’s very light and not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 18oz, it’s a good value, and will last a good long while.  Also, the opening is rather small, so you’re not going to squirt-out an overabundance and waste it.</li>
            <li> This is the favorite body wash of the men in my house. An adult male and two teenage boys.  It has a nice mild but manly scent that never is overpowering and soaps up well but doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue.  Especially at this price point, Doves Men&#x27;s body wash is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of Dove Men body wash and while the soap was nice, I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one changes that completely, the smell is great. Not baby powdery smelling like some of their other ones can be (some of the more basic ones smell this way to me).  This one has a more &#x27;man&#x27; scent to it, although not overpowering and cheap like some of the other brands.  Just enough to make it smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific one is supposed to be Hydration Balance (I feel like most of the differentiations are a gimmick), but I really haven&#x27;t noticed anything different with it.  It does go on nice, lathers well and rinses off well.</li>
            <li> Like Dove body wash. They give you a lot of product for the price. This has a good smell. The fragrance could have been a little stronger and last longer though. This does a good job of getting you clean and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> In addition to my own personal preference, anytime there are several people sharing a shower - college dorms, guest bathrooms, etc.... - I prefer to use a body wash rather than bar soap. The Dove Men+Care hydration body wash is now one of my favorites. It is a blue gel that lathers up into a rich, moisturizing soap that leaves skin feeling soft without drying. I found this to have only the slightest of scents - a light, slightly woodsy scent that is not overpowering. The only negative for me is in the packaging. The bottle is designed with the flip cap to be on the bottom. I don&#x27;t mind that but the top of the bottle is not flat so there is no way to store the bottle so that the flip cap is on the top. My preference is to have the flip cap on top until the bottle gets closer to being empty. This way I can grab the bottle, flip the cap with my thumb and dispense the gel with one hand. But that&#x27;s just my own personal preference. The quality of the body wash itself is excellent and since it does not have a strong scent, works for the entire family.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that my man enjoys using. It has a nice scent and does a great job on his grimy oilfield hands.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and fresh, without that strong cologne smell some other men&#x27;s body washes have. My husband loves that this doesn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling itchy or tight, just clean</li>
            <li> I bought this for my youngest son to try and he likes it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with most men&#x27;s shower gels is that they are perfumed and the scent -- which is advertised as masculine -- just is plain awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dove Body Wash has just a very nice and unobtrusive smell.  Like a very, very mild men&#x27;s cologne.  The key here is mild!  Men want to smell clean but not &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; so that you can tell they are coming by the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body Wash leave the skin very clean and nice so when you have oily skin it does a great job without drying you out.</li>
            <li> My husband tried the Dove Men + Care Body Wash and said that it smells good and cleans well. On the hydration part, he couldnt feel much difference, may be because of the weather and hot location.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of new haircare products from Dove over the past year or so and I&#x27;ve been consistently impressed and satisfied with their quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash is good on my face and other areas where shampoo doesn&#x27;t quite fit the bill.  The fragrance is good but not too strong.  I sit near people at work who are very sensitive to fragrances and they&#x27;ve never complained about the scent when I use this body wash.  The product helps me get clean but also washes off enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave a strong detergent feel afterwards either.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Dove products.  I love liquid soap and this one has a great scent that stays with you for a few hours.I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> A man in my family has slightly dry skin, so I asked him to try this product. He said: I found the body wash to be very refreshing, the fragrance to be quite nice,and the moisturizers leave your skin to be smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The Dove Men + Care Hydration body and face wash is a body wash with a typical, but not overbearing, &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; soap scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few Dove Men + Care body washes now, and this bottle works just as well as any of them.  If you already like Dove&#x27;s Men + Care product line and how your skin responds to it, you&#x27;ll have no problems with this body wash flavor. The bottle itself has an oval shape and base, which actually works well on shower racks that are composed of wires.  The elongated oval shape gives it a stable base, even on those types of shower shelves where the wires are spread out nearly an inch apart.  The bottle is also easy to squeeze, and the flip-lid&#x27;s hinge is durable enough to last until you empty the bottle without snapping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid soap is a dark blue color with typical viscosity.  It lathers well in a poof or washcloth and spread easily on your skin.  I have mildly irritable skin, and this Dove Men + Care Hydration body soap doesn&#x27;t set off any kind of reactions or blemishes for me.  The scent definitely smells like what companies think a &amp;#34;man-soap scent&amp;#34; should be, but it&#x27;s not nearly as powerful as some of the Axe body wash fragrances.  As far as providing &amp;#34;hydration balance,&amp;#34; ehh....it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin as well as lotion or something.  You can obviously also use it to wash your face in a pinch, but I still opt to use a gentler, dedicated face wash on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this Dove Men + Care Hydration Balance body wash is a quality liquid shower soap for your daily needs.  It has a scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and it lathers nicely.  If you already like Men + Care body wash products, you&#x27;ll probably like this one as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use body wash, but I liked the moisturizing effect this has on my skin. The scent is okay - not exactly a totally manly scent, but no too flowery either. If you use a body wash - this one is worth a try. I prefer the Dove Men Bar Soap to this body wash, but I am still old school I guess.</li>
            <li> While I know zilch about &#x27;micro technology,&#x27; I do know that Dove Men+ Care Body Wash leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.  Soaps and some body washes leave me feeling stretched and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only feel comfortable in my skin (as long as I avoid mirrors), I also feel clean.  There&#x27;s no heavy moisture barrier on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the clean, fresh, unobstrusive  scent.  I feel clean and smell good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about that mirror....</li>
            <li> Good bodywash.  I like the smell and it works well.  It cleans what it needs to clean and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry either, which is nice.  It&#x27;s very hydrating.  I also use it for shampoo and it does a god job.  One negative is that it&#x27;s not very natural.  It might be of some concern to some people.  I had no issues with it so far.  It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes just right: not to much and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin like a barren wasteland.</li>
            <li> Dove Men + Care Body Wash, Hydration Balance, 18 Ounce is a wonderful body wash with none of the grit often found in other washes. The scent is not overpowering and it rinses clean with no residue. It&#x27;s a little pricey but for the quality, I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more.</li>
            <li> Rich lather, crisp refreshing scent, dual wash functionality for face and body with added benefits of moisturization - this one has it all and comes packaged in a bottom dispensed 18 ounce rugged squeeze bottle. While I avoid using this type of product on my face it&#x27;s still nice to have that option if you&#x27;re in a pinch and the high sudsing factor of this product makes a little bit sure go a long way. Great stuff for a thorough cleanse from the neck on down to your toes.</li>
            <li> They advertise that if fights dry skin compared to any other body wash, but I am disappointed to say, it hasn&#x27;t worked for me, my skin is still itchy, so I have to keep looking now, meanwhile, i don&#x27;t want anyone to get ripped off, I guess I should never believe what it actually says on the package.</li>
