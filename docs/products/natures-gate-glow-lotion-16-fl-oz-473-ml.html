            <li>Ok, I am a redhead with VERY fair skin, and I have found that this product provides a perfect color.</li>
            <li>None of them were anything I ever raved about or felt happy using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Looked great but couldn&#x27;t take the smell.</li>
            <li>I have had great results.</li>
            <li>Besides the funky smell it&#x27;s really a great product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great lotion.</li>
            <li>This is a great selfless tanner...</li>
            <li>It works great...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>I use this 2-3 times a week to maintain a very nice glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion feels very nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li>I also like that this lotion is not just good at tanning, but great on the skin.</li>
            <li>Nice sized bottle for the price too!</li>
            <li>and it provides a nice color and NO SMELL !</li>
            <li>and I have used many self tanning products, this stuff is the best.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not offensive like most tanning lotions, and it works perfectly for her.</li>
            <li>After three nights of use, I have already achieved a pleasant, even glow.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent</li>
            <li>lesson is that you won&#x27;t need to use this for many days to get the max it will give to a very fair skinned person.</li>
            <li>lesson is that you won&#x27;t need to use this for many days to get the max it will give to a very fair skinned person.</li>
            <li>For me, the fact each application is gradual is both a blessing and a curse - but it&#x27;s ultimately a good thing in terms of results.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair with ruddy undertones.</li>
            <li>I am fair and</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin and burn if I even try to tan.</li>
            <li>I put it on after a good exfoliation in the shower and reapplied after about three days...</li>
            <li>Perfect for light skin tones.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re fair and you buy the darkest shade, it won&#x27;t make you tanner; it will just make you orange and streaky.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s about as good</li>
            <li>and light was perfect.</li>
            <li>good for legs &amp; arms (probably not face).</li>
            <li>This light version is perfect for a not-too-noticable color change.</li>
            <li>I re-apply after two days and that seems to keep the tan at a good color.</li>
            <li>The glow lotion still looks good for two days before re-applying.</li>
            <li>A good tip</li>
            <li>have fair...</li>
            <li>Excellent product, no bad ingredients, &amp;</li>
            <li>Nature Gate&#x27;s lotion gives my skin a super perfect tan.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for more than that, then you&#x27;ll be best served with one of the more aggressive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light weight lotion and gives great color.</li>
            <li>Another tip I have, is that if you are very fair, you need to buy the Light shade.</li>
            <li>Smells ok, not that great.</li>
            <li>Works well, color is nice, fairly non-smeary</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>i LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I have been using it almost a month and love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS SKINCARE LINE!</li>
            <li>Love this on my legs!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Great product for light skinned people.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cruelty free product.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and also doesn&#x27;t make my chest break out in a rash like Jergens Glow lotion used to do to me.</li>
            <li>Turned out to be the best idea I&#x27;ve had in a while thanks to nature&#x27;s gate.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m THRILLED that i did.  </li>
            <li>nice scent - NO &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I use it about 2-4 times weekly to maintain a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a tanning lotion without &amp;#34;additives&amp;#34; and this works nicely.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice warm glow.</li>
            <li>However, it does give a nice tan glow and never made me look orange.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too...</li>
            <li>effective, paraben-free.  </li>
            <li>but I liked the Nature&#x27;s Gate</li>
            <li>so I can just wear my loungewear and not risk nice clothing, though I have seen no proof that it comes off on clothes at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion truly gives me a nice glow and gives me this confidence to wear shorts and dresses.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in color and darkens within hours leaving a beautiful shimmer which is great for my fair skin; smells better than most, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The smell is also nice and not too strong, it kind of reminds me of the beach!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and didn&#x27;t streak or have a blotchy appearance on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The light will be good for winter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with how natural the color is.</li>
            <li>this is excellent for fair skinned people after a long winter.</li>
            <li>so so easy!  </li>
            <li>only is this a great tanner it is also a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many tanning lotions and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to apply--I have been using it for a week and have yet to have any problems with streaking (I have made sure to rub the lotion in so that my skin is no longer slippery).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just an all around great product and hope they continue making it because it&#x27;s really going to be my go to for the summer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product for getting a nice glow that doesn&#x27;t take careful application to look great.</li>
            <li>but now I am fine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very very light tint.</li>
            <li>The color is very light</li>
            <li>Smells nice, doesn&#x27;t turn you orange, and is easy to put on without streaking.</li>
            <li>Color is natural and not orange on my very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>i find most self tanners do this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>but as I am in sun more color will not work</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s paraben free!</li>
            <li>If I had been more skilled at applying it</li>
            <li>Also make sure to wash them well after application.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>This gave me a healthy glow when applied 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li>I used it two nights in a row, and will probably do just one more to get the shade I want.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t noticed my legs being any more tan.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering again! :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d recommend getting the St. Tropez tanning applicator to make sure you apply it evenly.  </li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I read a review that said not to use it too many days in a row</li>
            <li>I takes 12-24 hours for color to start to show, so put it on the night before you need to look better than &amp;#34;fish belly white&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I get a really nice light glow after applying it, which I do after exfoliating with either my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Next best is 3500K color.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you a tan look but more a darker skin tone.</li>
            <li>your skin to make sure that the application is smoother and so that the product can sink in better.</li>
            <li>You should also moisturize to keep the tan and this also allows the product to sink in better.</li>
            <li>The smell was okay</li>
            <li>cause it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>I wanted a more even tone to my skin and this delivers without looking orange.</li>
            <li>I could not be anymore pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I got many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Most times, the scent doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>I may switch to the medium if I decide I want more of a tan than just \\&quot;glow,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to be able to apply the light version often because of its moisturizing properties alone.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I did that again for 2 more days and on the 5th day I woke to the dreaded color ORANGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More after that point is not better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More after that point is not better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most sun-less tanning products leave me orange and streaky.</li>
            <li>I have fair cool toned skin and bought this in the light version.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I am fair and it gives a nice natural color to my skin</li>
            <li>and was happy about the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Smell is fine, and tans just as well as brands that contain more toxins.</li>
            <li>best part about this lotion is that the smell is better than other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with blue vein undertones on my legs</li>
            <li>It actually has been very good as a moisturizer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure if it works if you have no base tan ...</li>
            <li>In my 20&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been going for a more \\&quot;alive\\&quot; look and thus begins my search for a light tanner.</li>
            <li>good color works fast</li>
            <li>have also used the medium color on my fair skin and it works really well</li>
            <li>I went from the lightest shade makeup I could find to a nice all over golden tan.</li>
            <li>My daughter is a fair skin tone, and she uses this tanning lotion because she wants a darker tone for cheerleading.</li>
            <li>Other than that-it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t experience any streaking at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not feel too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried many products but this does good job over time and does look real wash hands quickly</li>
            <li>Amazon generally has great price too.</li>
            <li>It just provides a nice golden \\&quot;glow\\&quot; (true to the name) to limbs.  </li>
            <li>that you adequately understand my love of this product, I have to impress upon you that the packaging is also something to be admired.</li>
            <li>a quick  scan of the ingredients in most tanning products made me cringe - I may not be goth anymore</li>
            <li>perfect for a little color during the winter.  </li>
            <li>but I find that even though it is the light formula it is perfect and keeps my hands just as dark as the rest of me!</li>
            <li>the price is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>i did give it 4 stars because it does have that self tanner smell during the day and it does seem to leave a light film on the skin even after it dries.  </li>
            <li>I have the light and medium in this brand.  </li>
            <li>and I use it in the light formula</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a fantastic moisturizer, leaving my skin hydrated for 24+ hours.</li>
            <li>- the tint is that light.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s paraben free</li>
            <li>It contains hyaluronic acid, shea butter, almond oil, apricot oil, and algae, all of which are fabulous high-quality moisturizing ingredients.  </li>
            <li>you want to know what your skin tone looks like in the daylight get daylight light bulbs for your bathroom.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really make me brown or tan, I just have a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s cruelty free</li>
            <li>I would say that overall it was an alright product; I was happy with the color and tan.</li>
            <li>Then sit around for about 20 minutes just to be sure you&#x27;re all absorbed and dress.</li>
            <li>It works well for my yellow/olive hue and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is streak free if you take the time to rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li>I have light skin, and don&#x27;t want to look like I spend all day at the pool</li>
            <li>Not orange, definitely not yellow, just a nice warm color.</li>
            <li>B001AXIWGA Fake Bake Fair Lotion, 6-Ounce]], intending to try both and see which one worked best</li>
            <li>I would rather spend more and get more realistic results.</li>
            <li>originally tried this because it is paraben and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It is very important to do the body oil step FIRST.</li>
            <li>rich carrier lotion.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li>I do love the rich formulation, really seals in moisture!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it is the perfect solution for me, but will continue to use it until I can come up with another option.</li>
            <li>B000GCQ04C Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Pore</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to wear skirts and shorts this year.</li>
            <li>In the winter I am very fair skinned and only really tan in a tanning bed (which I&#x27;ve since sworn off,</li>
            <li>You can reapply for a deeper color, but once every other day is enough for me to maintain a nice &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; Very happy with this product.. will be ordering again!</li>
            <li>The thing is it&#x27;s so light that it sheds quick</li>
            <li>natural ingredients in a big bottle for a great price!</li>
            <li>It does not seem to clog pores, but I do clean my face twice a day with witch hazel.</li>
            <li>if you can get over it then you will have a natural glowing tint/tan that will NOT have the famous orange smears at the knees, elbows and ankles!  </li>
            <li>It is not a horrible smell, but I certainly can&#x27;t walk around smelling like this all day.  </li>
            <li>It is a light creme color and very smooth just like normal lotion.  </li>
            <li>The color is very good &amp; haven&#x27;t had any trouble with blotchy coloring or orange.</li>
            <li>I am very fair (blue eyes, moderate freckles) and do not like an \\&quot;orangey\\&quot; tan, like many sunless tanners give you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Nature&#x27;s Gate products in general and this lotion is a wonderful addition to my skincare!</li>
            <li>Oh, sweet pump</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s gotten such good reviews...</li>
            <li>However, it looked good overall.</li>
            <li>Then, a nice, natural glow started to appear.</li>
            <li>you apply, make sure you don&#x27;t use to much on your elbows and knees...</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no bad smell.</li>
            <li>I have tried both the light and medium and as a fair skinned person, I really should only be ordering the light version.</li>
            <li>It was very good, but with my light skin the tan was too dark, too fast.</li>
            <li>(3 due to non-natural ingredients) is because the color it produces is great.</li>
            <li>It gives me just a touch of color, enough to where I feel more confident showing my legs off.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s pregnant though so her sense of smell may be heightened.</li>
            <li>while I wouldn&#x27;t say I end up super tan, I also don&#x27;t end up orange or splotchy.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky or slimy, and there is zero streaking or blotching.</li>
            <li>The smell is unoffensive and it glides on well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>For reference, my natural skin tone is fair, but I tan very well without burning.</li>
            <li>when I do that I make sure to do an extra thorough exfoliation with shower gloves and FakeBake shower gel to make sure I get it</li>
            <li>since those are dryer spots they turn super orange.</li>
            <li>As one reviewer mentioned I made sure and coated my hands in a normal lotion before putting Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion on them and then applying to the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast!</li>
            <li>Move to the medium after your first bottle of light.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell, which is something most other bronzers do not have.  </li>
            <li>It is important to make sure skin is clean and has been exfoliated, do not put on in bathroom directly after a hot shower or it will streak.  </li>
            <li>I find this stuff works pretty well, but it clings to certain parts of me more than others.  </li>
            <li>I really want to like this lotion, but the smell is so strong that when I apply the lotion at night, I can still smell it on me in the morning.</li>
            <li>after the first day i saw &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;!  no streaks (after zero prep like exfoliating knees, ankles, etc</li>
            <li>Well this was the first product that i found that doesn&#x27;t make you orange!</li>
            <li>from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the reviews that helped me decide to try this one first!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am completely comfortable giving this lotion an A+!!</li>
            <li>no fake tan smell!</li>
            <li>Overall I love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works wonders!!</li>
            <li>Great lotion to give little bit of color.</li>
            <li>I got it to use primarily on my legs, which don&#x27;t get much sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not totally crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>i use self tan to achieve a nice deep tan, I use this lotion every night on my hands since my hands are ALWAYS lighter then the rest of me</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>I apply it after i shower and by the time i go out i already have a golden tone to me</li>
            <li>I had fun using this</li>
            <li>I love the soft glow</li>
            <li>This product was well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>By morning, my legs have a healthy, natural looking color.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>just sun kissed) or orange, but Nature&#x27;s Gate Light has been fabulous and is quite natural looking.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the smell, but I just put it on at night and wash off in the morning which is nice for washing off any excess.</li>
            <li>I find that the next day, after applying at night, I already have a nice color.  </li>
            <li>hands right away when you&#x27;re done</li>
            <li>you can understand why I spent the good part of my grade school years rocking the Hot Topic look.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to lotion your joints like elbows and knees with regular lotion before using this stuff because it will darken those places much more than the rest of your skin and it wont look like a natural tan.</li>
            <li>It is not dark at all, but helps me not look pasty (since I am pretty light!).</li>
            <li>Although most people wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;, when you have super white skin,  it looks like tan ;-)  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and most lotions make me look either orange or dirty.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my arms and legs first and with two applications, it was just right.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it smells strong but one of my co-workers commented that she could smell it when I was near her.</li>
            <li>but I can use it every night on my arms &amp; legs and not worry too much about making sure all my skin is completely evenly covered (like you would with a self tanning lotion)</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to have pretty okay ingredients though it does break my general rule of \\&quot;if</li>
            <li>I have mild eczema and this product is so gentle that I can even use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are a few things in which you must make sure you do before you use these self-tanners: make sure you exfoliate (and shave if you must)</li>
            <li>Then when you put on the Glow lotion, be more careful than you otherwise would to get a pretty even coat but go lightly over the knees and ankles, since those areas tend to soak up more lotion in general and therefore, will get darker.</li>
            <li>This lotion makes my skin very soft and smooth, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I am happy I have finally found a self tanning product that actually takes to my skin so that I don&#x27;t have to go in a tanning bed and really damage my skin!</li>
            <li>All-Over Face Color - Glee]], a little eye make up, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>A subtle even change, creating a realistic rich &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; skin tone, not an offensive smell, great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Turned my skin orange the first time I applied it.</li>
            <li>First time using a self-tanner.</li>
            <li>all self tanning lotions have an odor, and this one isn&#x27;t any different, but it&#x27;s not terrible.  </li>
            <li>It took 4 showers and a soak in the hot tub to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li>I think it could&#x27;ve came out pretty even.</li>
            <li>This self body tanner not only gives you a healthy glow</li>
            <li>My neighbor is on her first bottle and so is my daughter.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This greatly reduced the orange look on my hands, and made it non existent between my finger nails which is common with self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;-Use</li>
            <li>Love it, would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every morning after my shower, I first rub body oil on my elbows, knees, ankles and hands.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the amount of product that you get is phe-nom-en-al.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend hasn&#x27;t said A THING about the smell and believe me, he&#x27;s the first one to say something.  </li>
            <li>The second day even better.  </li>
            <li>I plan to build up the color just a bit more over the next two nights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the reviews here first and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that I am no longer fish belly white.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that this is the first tanning lotion I have ever used</li>
            <li>After only 2 days (2 applications), I am satisfied with the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After this bottle, I think I&#x27;m going back to Ever Glow, which smells much better and color is stronger.</li>
            <li>I should preface this by admitting this is the first self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mostly put it on my legs and occasionally on my arms</li>
            <li>Also, definitely start with light!</li>
            <li>Yes, the witch hazel takes off a tiny layer of the tan, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>and error has shown me that I need to apply it every third day after I reach peak in order to mostly maintain the color.</li>
            <li>and error has shown me that I need to apply it every third day after I reach peak in order to mostly maintain the color.</li>
            <li>It takes time to dry and it can rub on your clothes, but washes out very easily.  </li>
            <li>I have a pale, splotchy skin color, and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that evens out my skin tone and makes me feel good about showing some skin (e.g., my legs) in the warmer months.  </li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s good for pale skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tired many different bronzing lotions and this has been the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Especially great for red/strawberry blonde girls, looks natural, not too orange or too dark.  </li>
            <li>May want to bump up to the medium skin toned version for the summer as this will only give you a hint of a glow and won&#x27;t really show up on more tan skin.</li>
            <li>It only takes one exfoliation in the shower to blend and diminish this, which is good news if you streak, which isn&#x27;t likely if you do it</li>
            <li>Love this daily lotion, gives just a hint of natural color with no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to exfoliate first and let it dry before putting on clothes to avoid streaking.</li>
            <li>While our society is currently in love with bronzed and golden skin, no matter the consequences, I sit here looking all pasty because I&#x27;m also a green-beauty lover and well, finding a product that is natural and that will adequately bronze my skin has, until now, proven to be harder than finding a unicorn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I almost wish it was just a touch darker, but the lightness makes it pretty much mistake proof.</li>
            <li>The first day after using it I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, spreads easily, and is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that not only does it work very well for subtle color and moisturization,  </li>
            <li>to results, I noticed a light tan by the next morning after first usage.</li>
            <li>so one bottle should last a long time giving it good value.</li>
            <li>i have light skin with freckles and this gave me a nice glow, not a deep dark tropical tan.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also so much more faint than most self tanners!</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty okay compared to other tanners though there is room for improvement.</li>
            <li>This product is just the right amount of sunless tanner for someone who is really pale and hasn&#x27;t found anything that works or that they happy with long term.</li>
            <li>Very natural !!  </li>
            <li>For most of my life I was embarrassed of my pale skin and wasn&#x27;t very comfortable wearing short sleeves or shorts.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this lotion in comparison to other self tanners is that if fades very naturally and not blotchy as I have found with the most expensive self tanners.  </li>
            <li>it is for light skin only.  </li>
            <li>This product worked very well.</li>
            <li>Whole Foods Market</li>
            <li>Works very well and convenient pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>You can really choose how much color you add.</li>
            <li>but it was too much work.</li>
            <li>By the next morning the results were a light, even tan.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell it was working until after day seven or eight.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this product for 2 years now and really like it</li>
            <li>(Using too much won&#x27;t make you tanner faster, but it may cause streaks).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle product that you really have to be committed to using if you want a result.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give an orange color to skin but it doesn&#x27;t look very sun kissed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no la-dee-dah fragrance to this, and it&#x27;s been very non-irritating for me, but the smell is rather plastic-y despite being a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I want to start getting a real tan</li>
            <li>It was very splotchy when I was in the process of not using it anymore.</li>
            <li>I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion (Light) deeply discounted in a store and thought I&#x27;d try it out.</li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
            <li>do really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I do not have to reapply very often</li>
            <li>you have very white skin, get the lotion for light skin tones.</li>
            <li>This big bottle with a handy pump is now a must-have, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>Usually self tanners are way too orange and dark for me, but this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I have the naturally fair undertones of pink and blue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exfoliate first for better results, again, like other tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this one in particular because it&#x27;s very forgiving if you miss a spot.</li>
            <li>I, however, am pregnant and can no longer tan indoors (I&#x27;m going to avoid going back as well thanks to this stuff!)</li>
            <li>so my arms always seem to get a golden glow naturally) without all the chemical yuckiness (parabens, etc) that&#x27;s in most of the other tanning</li>
            <li>but this is great for anyone wanting to add a subtle color!</li>
            <li>and it does not streak or get &#x27;spotty&#x27; like so many other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you apply other lotion to your hands before using this or your hands won&#x27;t absorb the Glow lotion.</li>
            <li>It also smelled just like many other &amp;#34;self</li>
            <li>Normal hand washing has prevented any coloring of my hands, and I have also had no streaking on my legs!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too dark - just a very light shade.  </li>
            <li>I am very pale with a little pinkish color on most of my skin and even with just one application it darkens my skin a good bit.  </li>
            <li>Good, subtle color enhancement.</li>
            <li>With the medium, it is more like a regular self-tanner but much more natural and a little lighter</li>
            <li>You need very little because it spreads nicely.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was worried it wasn&#x27;t that noticeable, but after about 4 uses I have a natural looking bronze.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a lightly hydrating lotion which provides a nice glow after a few applications.</li>
            <li>but I was able to exfoliate enough to make it more subtle.</li>
            <li>I particularly like</li>
            <li>so I use three days in a row and get the same effect only safer, more realistic color that does not smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to purchase it at my local health food store, but quickly found that it&#x27;s always cheaper</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion will give you a very gradual tan that will look very natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would feel comfortable using this product under normal circumstances, but being that I am a nursing mother, I will likely stick to something without all-naturally derived DHA in addition to natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(both highly recommended).</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t very apparent at first</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t make you super tan, but it mad a huge difference in being able to wear skirts</li>
            <li>This stuff gives you a very gradual and natural color -- not orange</li>
            <li>but that comes out with normal hand-washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you have normal skin tones I would go ahead and up yourself to the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>Dress like normal and within 24 hours you&#x27;ll see a hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half way through the bottle &amp; I am pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I have dry skin on my hands, and was very nervous about this lotion darkening the skin on my hands.</li>
            <li>This lotion doesn&#x27;t smell weird, goes on nicely, and tans quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a better product that the traditional self-tanners but is not completely natural, as there are some chemicals still listed on the ingredients, despite the clever marketing of &#x27;natural moisturizers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Another great thing about getting a little tan is that it covers up all the irregular skin tone issues and you need far less make up if any at all.</li>
            <li>As a New Yorker, I get the majority of my sun through my office window.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try something new after using the Ocean Potion</li>
            <li>Hard to believe that something can actually be safe, responsible and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to put it on evenly, and it&#x27;s more noticeable because of how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li>I put it on all over at night, waited for a few minutes, went to bed, and the next morning I had an amazing tan.</li>
            <li>It takes about 5 days to get a decent color going but looks natural.</li>
            <li>This has a very natural effect, doesn&#x27;t streak orange, and doubles as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I usually gently dab my knees and ankles a little afterward with a towel to make sure I have no extra lotion clinging there.</li>
            <li>First off, I am very sensitive to all fragrances--nearly everything I purchase is fragrance-free, from personal to household products (even masking fragrances, contained in products labeled \\&quot;unscented,\\</li>
            <li>I had to walk around for 2 days smelling like old food!</li>
            <li>It smells different at first</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it will give me a light tan yet, however, after about an hour it started smelling like sour clothes.  </li>
            <li>far as results, I did achieve a light, natural-looking glow/tan (which does last for several days if you stop applying it).  </li>
            <li>At first I used it several days in a row and it ended up being a bit too tan for winter</li>
            <li>This, so far, seems like it is agreeing with my skin!</li>
            <li>the first and second use.. that may have been my paranoia</li>
            <li>One bottle is going to last the summer, and I like this better than some of the more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In reality, you&#x27;ll want to put regular lotion on your hands first so the skin on your hands won&#x27;t soak up this lotion.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that the ingredients are much more natural than other lotions out there, and I was pleasantly surprised to barely notice that strange smell that other sunless tanners have!</li>
            <li>I noticed after the first use a subtle glow that gave my pale pallor a nice hint of color!</li>
            <li>If you miss a few spots on the first application, it&#x27;s not too terribly obvious (since each application is light).</li>
            <li>Not to mention my skin is really soft!- by a natural redhead</li>
            <li>it gives just enough color to take away that pasty New England winter skin, but not so much that you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;ve been tanning.</li>
            <li>The color was splotchy on certain parts of my body, such as the wrists, ankles, and elbows.</li>
            <li>the color is a soft tan, not orange.  </li>
            <li>You should wait a while for it to completely absorb before dressing, because it will rub off in some areas and look streaky.</li>

            <li>I was looking for a natural tinted moisturizer that maintains color over time.</li>
            <li>It keeps my legs moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I developed a severe allergy to this product after combining it with a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>and I was looking for a lotion to add a bit of color, even out my legs&#x27; pasty skin tone and hopefully duplicate the natural color on my arms</li>
            <li>I recommend it to all the natural vampires out there.</li>
            <li>Used to use Jergens Natural Glow, but stopped for the smell, the chemicals, and the animal testing.</li>
            <li>My face is normally sensitive to almost all creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>A have a neutral, light complexion and I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years.</li>
            <li>directly afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would also recommend to either put a regular lotion on your hands before applying this and/or wash your hands really well after application.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It also has a natural color, I have been asked if I was out in the sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much color for me to use this on my upper body, but it works well for my legs.  </li>
            <li>* tan, but after spending the 80s as brown as a walnut, I do try to avoid naturally tanning now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product is awesome - it gives a boost to a base tan or maintains it with a natural looking color, evens out tan lines, and even leaves skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>The consistency is similar, too--a rich, thick lotion/creme, which I love because I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Another tip is to first apply a regular lotion to darker/dryer areas, such as kneecaps, rough spots, toes, etc., so the glow lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly into those areas.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for people who are super fair but want to get a fake dark tan./&gt;That wore off after a couple of days</li>
            <li>Not recommended for people who are super fair but want to get a fake dark tan.</li>
            <li>Ok let&#x27;s start by saying that I&#x27;m a very pale redhead (deathly pale, I was sheltered most my life) and I have really struggled finding the right product that didn&#x27;t make me look odd, orange, streaky or unnatural, especially in the drug stores such as CVS and Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Full strength tanners are much less forgiving.</li>
            <li>This is so much better, my skin is soft and the color is subtle and buildable.</li>

            <li>like they usually say to do), believable color on this chalky white body.  </li>
            <li>I go back and forth with the light and dark.</li>
            <li>looks just like regular lotion in the bottle and smells like a pretty standard lotion too.</li>
            <li>It smells nice with a very subtle scent, glides on well and leaves your skin with a hint of color.</li>
            <li>have only used it on my legs so far, as my upper body always has a little more color.  </li>
            <li>I use for about two days in a row the  switch to my other lotion for a day and it seems to provide just the right amount of glow.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I searched high and low but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>in my annual quest to discover some new bronzing product that will give me that &amp;#34;Victoria&#x27;s Secret, I&#x27;m pouty and sexy and tan look&amp;#34; I stumbled across this product.</li>
            <li>but I have done a full body application a few times and</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re pale and looking to simply appear a little more even and creamy, this is worth trying several times.</li>
            <li>As a self tanner, it is subtle, natural even and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It would have been fine for mid summer \\&quot;just back from the beach\\&quot; look, but for winter, it was too dark.</li>
            <li>At first I put it on every night for about 5 days, then I started doing every other day.</li>
            <li>The second day after using it my legs were less white, but it wasn&#x27;t a huge change.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted something more subtle and gradually built, instead of instant.  </li>
            <li>The scent in this lotion is very slight and very natural; it smells exactly like shea butter.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to tell because it&#x27;s so light and micro</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to be orange or dark, but I do like a little help giving my skin a healthy glow...</li>
            <li>Purchased this based on the positive reviews posted by other Amazon customers.  </li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given how fast it works, this bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given how fast it works, this bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it WILL stain your hands if you apply it directly.</li>
            <li>Using this on my legs doesn&#x27;t really make me look tan, but it does make my usually scary ghost white legs look better.  </li>
            <li>lotion isn&#x27;t meant to make you brown, only to add some natural looking sun inspired color.</li>
            <li>;, so it really wasn&#x27;t an improvement, especially since it is more expensive.</li>
            <li>Many of the other reviews said it takes a few days for them to see a difference, but the color was noticeable the very next morning after putting it on before bed.</li>
            <li>use it on my face only and I am getting a natural light tan using it every other day at night before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs into my skin in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>I like the lemon, but there&#x27;s a faint hint of something less pleasant in there, and it does get old.</li>
            <li>; smell that I personally didn&#x27;t want to be walking around with all day and having other people besides my husband sniffing ;)</li>
            <li>after all these years on this earth, this originally strawberry blonde woman with pale skin that blistered then peeled may FINALLY tan like everyone else!</li>
            <li>At first I applied it like my Alba sunless tanner being very careful and applying some lotion along my inner arms, elbows, knees and ankles...</li>
            <li>Used as a daily moisturizer it slowly gives you a lightly tanned look.  </li>
            <li>At first the smell is a little...</li>
            <li>I did this one time and had a pretty bad break-out shortly after (can&#x27;t be sure this was the only culprit - I was also trying out a new cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The third morning I really slathered it on and later in the day noticed that my legs had developed a slightly orange tone.  </li>
            <li>I use just a tiny touch of bare minerals make up [</li>
            <li>/shorts the first few times.</li>
            <li>This adds a nice subtle glow over a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale</li>
            <li>I wanted a very gradual color because my plan was to apply this every night to mainly moisturize while adding subtle color to my translucent skin tone.</li>
            <li>it definitely lasts longer than any other tanner I&#x27;ve tried and it has a very natural color.</li>

            <li> Ok, I am a redhead with VERY fair skin, and I have found that this product provides a perfect color.</li>
            <li> None of them were anything I ever raved about or felt happy using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great deal.  </li>
            <li> Looked great but couldn&#x27;t take the smell.</li>
            <li> I have had great results.</li>
            <li> Besides the funky smell it&#x27;s really a great product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a great selfless tanner...</li>
            <li> It works great...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I use this 2-3 times a week to maintain a very nice glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion feels very nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li> I also like that this lotion is not just good at tanning, but great on the skin.</li>
            <li> Nice sized bottle for the price too!</li>
            <li> and it provides a nice color and NO SMELL !</li>
            <li> and I have used many self tanning products, this stuff is the best.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not offensive like most tanning lotions, and it works perfectly for her.</li>
            <li> After three nights of use, I have already achieved a pleasant, even glow.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent</li>
            <li> lesson is that you won&#x27;t need to use this for many days to get the max it will give to a very fair skinned person.</li>
            <li> lesson is that you won&#x27;t need to use this for many days to get the max it will give to a very fair skinned person.</li>
            <li> For me, the fact each application is gradual is both a blessing and a curse - but it&#x27;s ultimately a good thing in terms of results.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair with ruddy undertones.</li>
            <li> I am fair and</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin and burn if I even try to tan.</li>
            <li> I put it on after a good exfoliation in the shower and reapplied after about three days...</li>
            <li> Perfect for light skin tones.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re fair and you buy the darkest shade, it won&#x27;t make you tanner; it will just make you orange and streaky.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s about as good</li>
            <li> and light was perfect.</li>
            <li> good for legs &amp; arms (probably not face).</li>
            <li> This light version is perfect for a not-too-noticable color change.</li>
            <li> I re-apply after two days and that seems to keep the tan at a good color.</li>
            <li> The glow lotion still looks good for two days before re-applying.</li>
            <li> A good tip</li>
            <li> have fair...</li>
            <li> Excellent product, no bad ingredients, &amp;</li>
            <li> Nature Gate&#x27;s lotion gives my skin a super perfect tan.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for more than that, then you&#x27;ll be best served with one of the more aggressive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light weight lotion and gives great color.</li>
            <li> Another tip I have, is that if you are very fair, you need to buy the Light shade.</li>
            <li> Smells ok, not that great.</li>
            <li> Works well, color is nice, fairly non-smeary</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> i LOVE this!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I have been using it almost a month and love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SKINCARE LINE!</li>
            <li> Love this on my legs!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product for light skinned people.  </li>
            <li> This is a great cruelty free product.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and also doesn&#x27;t make my chest break out in a rash like Jergens Glow lotion used to do to me.</li>
            <li> Turned out to be the best idea I&#x27;ve had in a while thanks to nature&#x27;s gate.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m THRILLED that i did.  </li>
            <li> nice scent - NO &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I use it about 2-4 times weekly to maintain a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a tanning lotion without &amp;#34;additives&amp;#34; and this works nicely.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice warm glow.</li>
            <li> However, it does give a nice tan glow and never made me look orange.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too...</li>
            <li> effective, paraben-free.  </li>
            <li> but I liked the Nature&#x27;s Gate</li>
            <li> so I can just wear my loungewear and not risk nice clothing, though I have seen no proof that it comes off on clothes at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion truly gives me a nice glow and gives me this confidence to wear shorts and dresses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light in color and darkens within hours leaving a beautiful shimmer which is great for my fair skin; smells better than most, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The smell is also nice and not too strong, it kind of reminds me of the beach!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply and didn&#x27;t streak or have a blotchy appearance on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The light will be good for winter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with how natural the color is.</li>
            <li> this is excellent for fair skinned people after a long winter.</li>
            <li> so so easy!  </li>
            <li> only is this a great tanner it is also a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many tanning lotions and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to apply--I have been using it for a week and have yet to have any problems with streaking (I have made sure to rub the lotion in so that my skin is no longer slippery).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an all around great product and hope they continue making it because it&#x27;s really going to be my go to for the summer!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product for getting a nice glow that doesn&#x27;t take careful application to look great.</li>
            <li> but now I am fine!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very very light tint.</li>
            <li> The color is very light</li>
            <li> Smells nice, doesn&#x27;t turn you orange, and is easy to put on without streaking.</li>
            <li> Color is natural and not orange on my very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> i find most self tanners do this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> but as I am in sun more color will not work</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s paraben free!</li>
            <li> If I had been more skilled at applying it</li>
            <li> Also make sure to wash them well after application.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> This gave me a healthy glow when applied 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I used it two nights in a row, and will probably do just one more to get the shade I want.</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t noticed my legs being any more tan.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering again! :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d recommend getting the St. Tropez tanning applicator to make sure you apply it evenly.  </li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> I read a review that said not to use it too many days in a row</li>
            <li> I takes 12-24 hours for color to start to show, so put it on the night before you need to look better than &amp;#34;fish belly white&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I get a really nice light glow after applying it, which I do after exfoliating with either my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Next best is 3500K color.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you a tan look but more a darker skin tone.</li>
            <li> your skin to make sure that the application is smoother and so that the product can sink in better.</li>
            <li> You should also moisturize to keep the tan and this also allows the product to sink in better.</li>
            <li> The smell was okay</li>
            <li> cause it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> I wanted a more even tone to my skin and this delivers without looking orange.</li>
            <li> I could not be anymore pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I got many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Most times, the scent doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I may switch to the medium if I decide I want more of a tan than just \\&quot;glow,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to be able to apply the light version often because of its moisturizing properties alone.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I did that again for 2 more days and on the 5th day I woke to the dreaded color ORANGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More after that point is not better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> More after that point is not better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most sun-less tanning products leave me orange and streaky.</li>
            <li> I have fair cool toned skin and bought this in the light version.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I am fair and it gives a nice natural color to my skin</li>
            <li> and was happy about the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Smell is fine, and tans just as well as brands that contain more toxins.</li>
            <li> best part about this lotion is that the smell is better than other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with blue vein undertones on my legs</li>
            <li> It actually has been very good as a moisturizer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure if it works if you have no base tan ...</li>
            <li> In my 20&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been going for a more \\&quot;alive\\&quot; look and thus begins my search for a light tanner.</li>
            <li> good color works fast</li>
            <li> have also used the medium color on my fair skin and it works really well</li>
            <li> I went from the lightest shade makeup I could find to a nice all over golden tan.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a fair skin tone, and she uses this tanning lotion because she wants a darker tone for cheerleading.</li>
            <li> Other than that-it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t experience any streaking at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not feel too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried many products but this does good job over time and does look real wash hands quickly</li>
            <li> Amazon generally has great price too.</li>
            <li> It just provides a nice golden \\&quot;glow\\&quot; (true to the name) to limbs.  </li>
            <li> that you adequately understand my love of this product, I have to impress upon you that the packaging is also something to be admired.</li>
            <li> a quick  scan of the ingredients in most tanning products made me cringe - I may not be goth anymore</li>
            <li> perfect for a little color during the winter.  </li>
            <li> but I find that even though it is the light formula it is perfect and keeps my hands just as dark as the rest of me!</li>
            <li> the price is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> i did give it 4 stars because it does have that self tanner smell during the day and it does seem to leave a light film on the skin even after it dries.  </li>
            <li> I have the light and medium in this brand.  </li>
            <li> and I use it in the light formula</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a fantastic moisturizer, leaving my skin hydrated for 24+ hours.</li>
            <li> - the tint is that light.</li>
            <li> It has a light smell that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s paraben free</li>
            <li> It contains hyaluronic acid, shea butter, almond oil, apricot oil, and algae, all of which are fabulous high-quality moisturizing ingredients.  </li>
            <li> you want to know what your skin tone looks like in the daylight get daylight light bulbs for your bathroom.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really make me brown or tan, I just have a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s cruelty free</li>
            <li> I would say that overall it was an alright product; I was happy with the color and tan.</li>
            <li> Then sit around for about 20 minutes just to be sure you&#x27;re all absorbed and dress.</li>
            <li> It works well for my yellow/olive hue and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is streak free if you take the time to rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> I have light skin, and don&#x27;t want to look like I spend all day at the pool</li>
            <li> Not orange, definitely not yellow, just a nice warm color.</li>
            <li> B001AXIWGA Fake Bake Fair Lotion, 6-Ounce]], intending to try both and see which one worked best</li>
            <li> I would rather spend more and get more realistic results.</li>
            <li> originally tried this because it is paraben and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> It is very important to do the body oil step FIRST.</li>
            <li> rich carrier lotion.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li> I do love the rich formulation, really seals in moisture!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it is the perfect solution for me, but will continue to use it until I can come up with another option.</li>
            <li> B000GCQ04C Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Pore</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to wear skirts and shorts this year.</li>
            <li> In the winter I am very fair skinned and only really tan in a tanning bed (which I&#x27;ve since sworn off,</li>
            <li> You can reapply for a deeper color, but once every other day is enough for me to maintain a nice &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; Very happy with this product.. will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> The thing is it&#x27;s so light that it sheds quick</li>
            <li> natural ingredients in a big bottle for a great price!</li>
            <li> It does not seem to clog pores, but I do clean my face twice a day with witch hazel.</li>
            <li> if you can get over it then you will have a natural glowing tint/tan that will NOT have the famous orange smears at the knees, elbows and ankles!  </li>
            <li> It is not a horrible smell, but I certainly can&#x27;t walk around smelling like this all day.  </li>
            <li> It is a light creme color and very smooth just like normal lotion.  </li>
            <li> The color is very good &amp; haven&#x27;t had any trouble with blotchy coloring or orange.</li>
            <li> I am very fair (blue eyes, moderate freckles) and do not like an \\&quot;orangey\\&quot; tan, like many sunless tanners give you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Nature&#x27;s Gate products in general and this lotion is a wonderful addition to my skincare!</li>
            <li> Oh, sweet pump</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s gotten such good reviews...</li>
            <li> However, it looked good overall.</li>
            <li> Then, a nice, natural glow started to appear.</li>
            <li> you apply, make sure you don&#x27;t use to much on your elbows and knees...</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the light and medium and as a fair skinned person, I really should only be ordering the light version.</li>
            <li> It was very good, but with my light skin the tan was too dark, too fast.</li>
            <li> (3 due to non-natural ingredients) is because the color it produces is great.</li>
            <li> It gives me just a touch of color, enough to where I feel more confident showing my legs off.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s pregnant though so her sense of smell may be heightened.</li>
            <li> while I wouldn&#x27;t say I end up super tan, I also don&#x27;t end up orange or splotchy.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky or slimy, and there is zero streaking or blotching.</li>
            <li> The smell is unoffensive and it glides on well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> For reference, my natural skin tone is fair, but I tan very well without burning.</li>
            <li> when I do that I make sure to do an extra thorough exfoliation with shower gloves and FakeBake shower gel to make sure I get it</li>
            <li> since those are dryer spots they turn super orange.</li>
            <li> As one reviewer mentioned I made sure and coated my hands in a normal lotion before putting Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion on them and then applying to the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast!</li>
            <li> Move to the medium after your first bottle of light.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell, which is something most other bronzers do not have.  </li>
            <li> It is important to make sure skin is clean and has been exfoliated, do not put on in bathroom directly after a hot shower or it will streak.  </li>
            <li> I find this stuff works pretty well, but it clings to certain parts of me more than others.  </li>
            <li> I really want to like this lotion, but the smell is so strong that when I apply the lotion at night, I can still smell it on me in the morning.</li>
            <li> after the first day i saw &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;!  no streaks (after zero prep like exfoliating knees, ankles, etc</li>
            <li> Well this was the first product that i found that doesn&#x27;t make you orange!</li>
            <li> from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the reviews that helped me decide to try this one first!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am completely comfortable giving this lotion an A+!!</li>
            <li> no fake tan smell!</li>
            <li> Overall I love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works wonders!!</li>
            <li> Great lotion to give little bit of color.</li>
            <li> I got it to use primarily on my legs, which don&#x27;t get much sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> i use self tan to achieve a nice deep tan, I use this lotion every night on my hands since my hands are ALWAYS lighter then the rest of me</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> I apply it after i shower and by the time i go out i already have a golden tone to me</li>
            <li> I had fun using this</li>
            <li> I love the soft glow</li>
            <li> This product was well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> By morning, my legs have a healthy, natural looking color.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> just sun kissed) or orange, but Nature&#x27;s Gate Light has been fabulous and is quite natural looking.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the smell, but I just put it on at night and wash off in the morning which is nice for washing off any excess.</li>
            <li> I find that the next day, after applying at night, I already have a nice color.  </li>
            <li> hands right away when you&#x27;re done</li>
            <li> you can understand why I spent the good part of my grade school years rocking the Hot Topic look.</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to lotion your joints like elbows and knees with regular lotion before using this stuff because it will darken those places much more than the rest of your skin and it wont look like a natural tan.</li>
            <li> It is not dark at all, but helps me not look pasty (since I am pretty light!).</li>
            <li> Although most people wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;, when you have super white skin,  it looks like tan ;-)  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and most lotions make me look either orange or dirty.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my arms and legs first and with two applications, it was just right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells strong but one of my co-workers commented that she could smell it when I was near her.</li>
            <li> but I can use it every night on my arms &amp; legs and not worry too much about making sure all my skin is completely evenly covered (like you would with a self tanning lotion)</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to have pretty okay ingredients though it does break my general rule of \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema and this product is so gentle that I can even use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are a few things in which you must make sure you do before you use these self-tanners: make sure you exfoliate (and shave if you must)</li>
            <li> Then when you put on the Glow lotion, be more careful than you otherwise would to get a pretty even coat but go lightly over the knees and ankles, since those areas tend to soak up more lotion in general and therefore, will get darker.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin very soft and smooth, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I am happy I have finally found a self tanning product that actually takes to my skin so that I don&#x27;t have to go in a tanning bed and really damage my skin!</li>
            <li> All-Over Face Color - Glee]], a little eye make up, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> A subtle even change, creating a realistic rich &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; skin tone, not an offensive smell, great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Turned my skin orange the first time I applied it.</li>
            <li> First time using a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> all self tanning lotions have an odor, and this one isn&#x27;t any different, but it&#x27;s not terrible.  </li>
            <li> It took 4 showers and a soak in the hot tub to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> I think it could&#x27;ve came out pretty even.</li>
            <li> This self body tanner not only gives you a healthy glow</li>
            <li> My neighbor is on her first bottle and so is my daughter.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This greatly reduced the orange look on my hands, and made it non existent between my finger nails which is common with self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;-Use</li>
            <li> Love it, would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every morning after my shower, I first rub body oil on my elbows, knees, ankles and hands.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the amount of product that you get is phe-nom-en-al.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend hasn&#x27;t said A THING about the smell and believe me, he&#x27;s the first one to say something.  </li>
            <li> The second day even better.  </li>
            <li> I plan to build up the color just a bit more over the next two nights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here first and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that I am no longer fish belly white.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that this is the first tanning lotion I have ever used</li>
            <li> After only 2 days (2 applications), I am satisfied with the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After this bottle, I think I&#x27;m going back to Ever Glow, which smells much better and color is stronger.</li>
            <li> I should preface this by admitting this is the first self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mostly put it on my legs and occasionally on my arms</li>
            <li> Also, definitely start with light!</li>
            <li> Yes, the witch hazel takes off a tiny layer of the tan, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> and error has shown me that I need to apply it every third day after I reach peak in order to mostly maintain the color.</li>
            <li> and error has shown me that I need to apply it every third day after I reach peak in order to mostly maintain the color.</li>
            <li> It takes time to dry and it can rub on your clothes, but washes out very easily.  </li>
            <li> I have a pale, splotchy skin color, and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that evens out my skin tone and makes me feel good about showing some skin (e.g., my legs) in the warmer months.  </li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s good for pale skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired many different bronzing lotions and this has been the best so far.  </li>
            <li> Especially great for red/strawberry blonde girls, looks natural, not too orange or too dark.  </li>
            <li> May want to bump up to the medium skin toned version for the summer as this will only give you a hint of a glow and won&#x27;t really show up on more tan skin.</li>
            <li> It only takes one exfoliation in the shower to blend and diminish this, which is good news if you streak, which isn&#x27;t likely if you do it</li>
            <li> Love this daily lotion, gives just a hint of natural color with no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to exfoliate first and let it dry before putting on clothes to avoid streaking.</li>
            <li> While our society is currently in love with bronzed and golden skin, no matter the consequences, I sit here looking all pasty because I&#x27;m also a green-beauty lover and well, finding a product that is natural and that will adequately bronze my skin has, until now, proven to be harder than finding a unicorn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I almost wish it was just a touch darker, but the lightness makes it pretty much mistake proof.</li>
            <li> The first day after using it I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, spreads easily, and is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that not only does it work very well for subtle color and moisturization,  </li>
            <li> to results, I noticed a light tan by the next morning after first usage.</li>
            <li> so one bottle should last a long time giving it good value.</li>
            <li> i have light skin with freckles and this gave me a nice glow, not a deep dark tropical tan.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also so much more faint than most self tanners!</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty okay compared to other tanners though there is room for improvement.</li>
            <li> This product is just the right amount of sunless tanner for someone who is really pale and hasn&#x27;t found anything that works or that they happy with long term.</li>
            <li> Very natural !!  </li>
            <li> For most of my life I was embarrassed of my pale skin and wasn&#x27;t very comfortable wearing short sleeves or shorts.  </li>
            <li> The best thing about this lotion in comparison to other self tanners is that if fades very naturally and not blotchy as I have found with the most expensive self tanners.  </li>
            <li> it is for light skin only.  </li>
            <li> This product worked very well.</li>
            <li> Whole Foods Market</li>
            <li> Works very well and convenient pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> You can really choose how much color you add.</li>
            <li> but it was too much work.</li>
            <li> By the next morning the results were a light, even tan.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell it was working until after day seven or eight.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 2 years now and really like it</li>
            <li> (Using too much won&#x27;t make you tanner faster, but it may cause streaks).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle product that you really have to be committed to using if you want a result.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give an orange color to skin but it doesn&#x27;t look very sun kissed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no la-dee-dah fragrance to this, and it&#x27;s been very non-irritating for me, but the smell is rather plastic-y despite being a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I want to start getting a real tan</li>
            <li> It was very splotchy when I was in the process of not using it anymore.</li>
            <li> I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion (Light) deeply discounted in a store and thought I&#x27;d try it out.</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
            <li> do really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I do not have to reapply very often</li>
            <li> you have very white skin, get the lotion for light skin tones.</li>
            <li> This big bottle with a handy pump is now a must-have, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> Usually self tanners are way too orange and dark for me, but this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have the naturally fair undertones of pink and blue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfoliate first for better results, again, like other tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this one in particular because it&#x27;s very forgiving if you miss a spot.</li>
            <li> I, however, am pregnant and can no longer tan indoors (I&#x27;m going to avoid going back as well thanks to this stuff!)</li>
            <li> so my arms always seem to get a golden glow naturally) without all the chemical yuckiness (parabens, etc) that&#x27;s in most of the other tanning</li>
            <li> but this is great for anyone wanting to add a subtle color!</li>
            <li> and it does not streak or get &#x27;spotty&#x27; like so many other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you apply other lotion to your hands before using this or your hands won&#x27;t absorb the Glow lotion.</li>
            <li> It also smelled just like many other &amp;#34;self</li>
            <li> Normal hand washing has prevented any coloring of my hands, and I have also had no streaking on my legs!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too dark - just a very light shade.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale with a little pinkish color on most of my skin and even with just one application it darkens my skin a good bit.  </li>
            <li> Good, subtle color enhancement.</li>
            <li> With the medium, it is more like a regular self-tanner but much more natural and a little lighter</li>
            <li> You need very little because it spreads nicely.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was worried it wasn&#x27;t that noticeable, but after about 4 uses I have a natural looking bronze.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a lightly hydrating lotion which provides a nice glow after a few applications.</li>
            <li> but I was able to exfoliate enough to make it more subtle.</li>
            <li> I particularly like</li>
            <li> so I use three days in a row and get the same effect only safer, more realistic color that does not smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to purchase it at my local health food store, but quickly found that it&#x27;s always cheaper</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion will give you a very gradual tan that will look very natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would feel comfortable using this product under normal circumstances, but being that I am a nursing mother, I will likely stick to something without all-naturally derived DHA in addition to natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (both highly recommended).</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t very apparent at first</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t make you super tan, but it mad a huge difference in being able to wear skirts</li>
            <li> This stuff gives you a very gradual and natural color -- not orange</li>
            <li> but that comes out with normal hand-washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you have normal skin tones I would go ahead and up yourself to the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Dress like normal and within 24 hours you&#x27;ll see a hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way through the bottle &amp; I am pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I have dry skin on my hands, and was very nervous about this lotion darkening the skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t smell weird, goes on nicely, and tans quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a better product that the traditional self-tanners but is not completely natural, as there are some chemicals still listed on the ingredients, despite the clever marketing of &#x27;natural moisturizers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Another great thing about getting a little tan is that it covers up all the irregular skin tone issues and you need far less make up if any at all.</li>
            <li> As a New Yorker, I get the majority of my sun through my office window.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something new after using the Ocean Potion</li>
            <li> Hard to believe that something can actually be safe, responsible and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put it on evenly, and it&#x27;s more noticeable because of how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I put it on all over at night, waited for a few minutes, went to bed, and the next morning I had an amazing tan.</li>
            <li> It takes about 5 days to get a decent color going but looks natural.</li>
            <li> This has a very natural effect, doesn&#x27;t streak orange, and doubles as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I usually gently dab my knees and ankles a little afterward with a towel to make sure I have no extra lotion clinging there.</li>
            <li> First off, I am very sensitive to all fragrances--nearly everything I purchase is fragrance-free, from personal to household products (even masking fragrances, contained in products labeled \\&quot;unscented,\\</li>
            <li> I had to walk around for 2 days smelling like old food!</li>
            <li> It smells different at first</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it will give me a light tan yet, however, after about an hour it started smelling like sour clothes.  </li>
            <li> far as results, I did achieve a light, natural-looking glow/tan (which does last for several days if you stop applying it).  </li>
            <li> At first I used it several days in a row and it ended up being a bit too tan for winter</li>
            <li> This, so far, seems like it is agreeing with my skin!</li>
            <li> the first and second use.. that may have been my paranoia</li>
            <li> One bottle is going to last the summer, and I like this better than some of the more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In reality, you&#x27;ll want to put regular lotion on your hands first so the skin on your hands won&#x27;t soak up this lotion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that the ingredients are much more natural than other lotions out there, and I was pleasantly surprised to barely notice that strange smell that other sunless tanners have!</li>
            <li> I noticed after the first use a subtle glow that gave my pale pallor a nice hint of color!</li>
            <li> If you miss a few spots on the first application, it&#x27;s not too terribly obvious (since each application is light).</li>
            <li> Not to mention my skin is really soft!- by a natural redhead</li>
            <li> it gives just enough color to take away that pasty New England winter skin, but not so much that you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;ve been tanning.</li>
            <li> The color was splotchy on certain parts of my body, such as the wrists, ankles, and elbows.</li>
            <li> the color is a soft tan, not orange.  </li>
            <li> You should wait a while for it to completely absorb before dressing, because it will rub off in some areas and look streaky.</li>
            <li> one - sprayed at a professional&#x27;s before a trip to st tropez</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural tinted moisturizer that maintains color over time.</li>
            <li> It keeps my legs moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I developed a severe allergy to this product after combining it with a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking for a lotion to add a bit of color, even out my legs&#x27; pasty skin tone and hopefully duplicate the natural color on my arms</li>
            <li> I recommend it to all the natural vampires out there.</li>
            <li> Used to use Jergens Natural Glow, but stopped for the smell, the chemicals, and the animal testing.</li>
            <li> My face is normally sensitive to almost all creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> A have a neutral, light complexion and I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years.</li>
            <li> directly afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would also recommend to either put a regular lotion on your hands before applying this and/or wash your hands really well after application.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It also has a natural color, I have been asked if I was out in the sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much color for me to use this on my upper body, but it works well for my legs.  </li>
            <li> * tan, but after spending the 80s as brown as a walnut, I do try to avoid naturally tanning now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product is awesome - it gives a boost to a base tan or maintains it with a natural looking color, evens out tan lines, and even leaves skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> The consistency is similar, too--a rich, thick lotion/creme, which I love because I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Another tip is to first apply a regular lotion to darker/dryer areas, such as kneecaps, rough spots, toes, etc., so the glow lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly into those areas.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for people who are super fair but want to get a fake dark tan./&gt;That wore off after a couple of days</li>

            <li> Ok let&#x27;s start by saying that I&#x27;m a very pale redhead (deathly pale, I was sheltered most my life) and I have really struggled finding the right product that didn&#x27;t make me look odd, orange, streaky or unnatural, especially in the drug stores such as CVS and Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Full strength tanners are much less forgiving.</li>
            <li> This is so much better, my skin is soft and the color is subtle and buildable.</li>

            <li> like they usually say to do), believable color on this chalky white body.  </li>
            <li> I go back and forth with the light and dark.</li>
            <li> looks just like regular lotion in the bottle and smells like a pretty standard lotion too.</li>
            <li> It smells nice with a very subtle scent, glides on well and leaves your skin with a hint of color.</li>
            <li> have only used it on my legs so far, as my upper body always has a little more color.  </li>
            <li> I use for about two days in a row the  switch to my other lotion for a day and it seems to provide just the right amount of glow.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I searched high and low but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> in my annual quest to discover some new bronzing product that will give me that &amp;#34;Victoria&#x27;s Secret, I&#x27;m pouty and sexy and tan look&amp;#34; I stumbled across this product.</li>
            <li> but I have done a full body application a few times and</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pale and looking to simply appear a little more even and creamy, this is worth trying several times.</li>
            <li> As a self tanner, it is subtle, natural even and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It would have been fine for mid summer \\&quot;just back from the beach\\&quot; look, but for winter, it was too dark.</li>
            <li> At first I put it on every night for about 5 days, then I started doing every other day.</li>
            <li> The second day after using it my legs were less white, but it wasn&#x27;t a huge change.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted something more subtle and gradually built, instead of instant.  </li>
            <li> The scent in this lotion is very slight and very natural; it smells exactly like shea butter.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell because it&#x27;s so light and micro</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be orange or dark, but I do like a little help giving my skin a healthy glow...</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on the positive reviews posted by other Amazon customers.  </li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t last long</li>

            <li> The only downside is that it WILL stain your hands if you apply it directly.</li>
            <li> Using this on my legs doesn&#x27;t really make me look tan, but it does make my usually scary ghost white legs look better.  </li>
            <li> lotion isn&#x27;t meant to make you brown, only to add some natural looking sun inspired color.</li>
            <li> ;, so it really wasn&#x27;t an improvement, especially since it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> Many of the other reviews said it takes a few days for them to see a difference, but the color was noticeable the very next morning after putting it on before bed.</li>
            <li> use it on my face only and I am getting a natural light tan using it every other day at night before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs into my skin in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>

            <li> after all these years on this earth, this originally strawberry blonde woman with pale skin that blistered then peeled may FINALLY tan like everyone else!</li>
            <li> At first I applied it like my Alba sunless tanner being very careful and applying some lotion along my inner arms, elbows, knees and ankles...</li>
            <li> Used as a daily moisturizer it slowly gives you a lightly tanned look.  </li>
            <li> At first the smell is a little...</li>
            <li> I did this one time and had a pretty bad break-out shortly after (can&#x27;t be sure this was the only culprit - I was also trying out a new cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The third morning I really slathered it on and later in the day noticed that my legs had developed a slightly orange tone.  </li>
            <li> I use just a tiny touch of bare minerals make up [</li>
            <li> /shorts the first few times.</li>
            <li> This adds a nice subtle glow over a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale</li>
            <li> I wanted a very gradual color because my plan was to apply this every night to mainly moisturize while adding subtle color to my translucent skin tone.</li>
            <li> it definitely lasts longer than any other tanner I&#x27;ve tried and it has a very natural color.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin, and used the light to medium, which was DEFINITELY dark enough.</li>
            <li> I would still like for the color to be a little more subtle.</li>
            <li> You can control how much of a tan you want, and if you use it daily, at least for me, you can get darker than expected (like a normal tan).  </li>
            <li> Its reasonably priced and will go a long way since you use so little with each application.</li>
            <li> I apply it every other night and it leaves your legs soft, not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other self tanners and Jergen&#x27;s natural glow</li>
            <li> Not a natural lotion and it only &#x27;yellows&#x27; you for about 30 minutes while you&#x27;re actually looking at yourself in the mirror</li>
            <li> evening after showering, shaving and drying off, I place a little bit of my normal moisturizer on my knees and ankles</li>
            <li> I usually apply this lotion as I&#x27;m getting ready for bed, so I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;will</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended for people who will not naturally tan, either because they want to preserve their skin or because they burn and who embrace their fairness but want enough color to blend in with the world.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended for people who will not naturally tan, either because they want to preserve their skin or because they burn and who embrace their fairness but want enough color to blend in with the world.</li>
            <li> The only problem I faced was a small area of slight orange-ness on my knees, right below my kneecap.</li>
            <li> So, as many reviewers, I have spent 100&#x27;s of dollars on both expensive and inexpensive tanning lotions just to give my skin the slightest bit of color.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale, and I get very pasty and sallow during the winter months.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t break my back and chest out at all, which was a problem only when I was using other lotions.</li>
            <li> This lotion certainly has the least amount of smell EVER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and tough to mess up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as applying this to the face, probably not a good idea for sensitive and/or acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it after showering and it never looks streaky as long as it is evenly applied.</li>
            <li> This gives the natural glow of weeks of tanning with just a  few uses.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t nearly as long as I thought it would to get results.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I don&#x27;t have time to apply everyday, so I want something that is gradual and natural.  </li>
            <li> I use this every few days, &amp; if I feel the need to use it every day, I dilute it a bit first, &amp; go over my elbows &amp; knees beforehand with plain lotion.</li>
            <li> The one place where I did end up with weird color build up was way up on my inner thighs (luckily it wasn&#x27;t bikini season).  </li>
            <li> I am very pale and this give me enough color to look like natural.</li>
            <li> This has safe ingredients that aren&#x27;t toxic to the skin, the smell is not strong or unpleasant, and the tint of tan it gives me is very natural..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other day in order to avoid being pasty white.</li>
            <li> But this is no different than other self tanners.</li>
            <li> a got from other reviews was to exfoliate prior to application.</li>
            <li> As long as they don&#x27;t make any changes to this product (like fiddling with the fragrance--please, Nature&#x27;s Gate, just leave it as is!)</li>
            <li> I can seemyself using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> : do not put on cracked-dry skin, like feet, because it will turn really dry cracks</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t bother me because it goes away when you&#x27;re totally dry.</li>
            <li> After I would take a shower and dry off, brown flakes would just peel away.</li>
            <li> Also leaves a sticky feeling that takes awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> I apply it once I dry off from the shower.</li>
            <li> Being that I have dry skin, it absorbs immediately.</li>
            <li> I rinse my hands thoroughly after application (just water, no soap) and dry them well; I haven&#x27;t had any yellowing of my palms.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind if this company made a few different scents you could alternate between.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little general store up in North Conway, NH called Zeb&#x27;s that I go to every time I&#x27;m in the area.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t take any special care in application either, I just smear it carelessly all over.  </li>
            <li> This sort of masks the pink undertones in my skin but not completely.</li>
            <li> The pump arrived broken and it smells funny.  </li>
            <li> Combine that with my Irish skin and penchant for black clothing and well..</li>
            <li> it is very forgiving of mistake like missing a small area.</li>
            <li> On me, perhaps because my skin runs on the very dry side, this lotion mainly added color while subtly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Well for one, the smell may be unpleasant, but it&#x27;s still better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I also love how there aren&#x27;t a bunch of bad ingredients like a lot of self tanners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive and lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> This is the least streaky self tanner that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I ended up with brown elbows and knees only a few days into the bottle.</li>
            <li> so you know your skin is not absorbing chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to be careful about washing hands after use.</li>
            <li> Surviving a Cleveland winter can be rough.</li>
            <li> Also please be careful on your feet, ankles, and elbows.</li>
            <li> Will repurchase when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I am porcelain skinned with a pink undertone, so getting a tan in a bed or by the sun has never been a possibility.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I see me and my skin tone everyday, so it was working very gradually.  </li>
            <li> , some call it white, but whatever you want to call it, at the end of the day, I am pale.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin (even though it tans well) and was a big user of tanning beds.</li>
            <li> The next time, you can go heavier in that spot to correct it, and over a few days, your mistakes balance each other out.</li>
            <li> They were all pretty bad, even more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> If you go a little darker than you typically should, it will last a lot longer but it will also be a lot harder to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> hue, leaving a natural, subtle tan.</li>
            <li> This lotion instantly gave me a little color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural looking and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling weird the next day.</li>
            <li> my sister, mom and i use it on our faces and bodies about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li> I like, I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day to avoid a color overload.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it at the health food store where they sell other Nature&#x27;s Gate products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use any other lotion, at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also healthier for your skin than other brands.  </li>
            <li> This product completely fails for the first two.</li>
            <li> so well I&#x27;ve put off trying the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the smell of the active ingredient (dihydroxyacetone or DHA) having a chemical reaction with amino acids on the surface of your skin to produce a darkened appearance.</li>
            <li> would guess that the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; product would only work if you are very pale -</li>
            <li> The only thing I would caution about, which is due to user error, is that on a small portion of my knees and a couple rough spots on my feet the color is a little concentrated (I should&#x27;ve exfoliated, or just applied less in that area).  </li>
            <li> After a week, I&#x27;ve gone down to one application every other day to maintain the glow.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do anything for hours, and you never know if they&#x27;re going to make you too dark.</li>
            <li> so if your looking to go dark</li>
            <li> applied this product on my face down to my ankles.  </li>
            <li> I do like that it is less heavy on chemicals than other brands.  </li>
            <li> After a week, a subtle glow had taken the place of my previously white and pasty legs.</li>
            <li> The color change is less noticeable than the Ever Glow.</li>
            <li> A subtle tan showed up after only a few days and stayed with me a few days even after I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little funky in that regard.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the medium version as I would like to be a little darker</li>
            <li> if I want a little deeper color and faster results.</li>
            <li> I just put a little on my chest to test it out.  </li>
            <li> but I have noticed a little rub off on my intimates.</li>
            <li> like to put it on a night because it is a little heavy</li>
            <li> It can also suck remembering to apply it a few days in a row to get the desired level of</li>
            <li> Trick is to lotion knees, elbows and ankles heavy before applying Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow lotion.  </li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> and if you have uneven spots from uneven exfoliation</li>
            <li> Then it faded after a few days.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get dark spots (these usually happen between my fingers).</li>
            <li> I will try it out for a few days and hopefully my experience improves.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put it on in the bathroom while it&#x27;s all steamy; it will make the color uneven.</li>
            <li> it is like a dead fish belly...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale, but maybe I need the medium version.</li>
            <li> The next day, I could see dark streaks and the color seemed really fake because it was orangey -</li>
            <li> now so I stopped using it, which looked very odd for a couple days.</li>
            <li> you are pale, if you are pasty, if you are annoyed with constantly being bombarded with negative comments about being &amp;#34;porcelain,&amp;#34; please try this.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and wanted to add a little color for the summer time without getting the leather-orange tan look-plus the skin damage.</li>
            <li> Despite using Xen tan and waiting many minutes before going to bed after application, uneven color on my hands was very ugly!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like a fake tan at all, and should not be used to achieve the look of an obvious tan.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with my elbows or knees looking weird, and I only lotion them up before-hand maybe 1 in 10 times.  </li>
            <li> Only downfall, it does have that icky tanning lotion smell-not HORRIBLE though, and it doesn&#x27;t get your skin very much darker.</li>
            <li> The color is subtle, and lasts for a few days.</li>
            <li> I am very very pale</li>
            <li> My usual complaint with self tanners (sprays or lotions) is that they leave streaking tan marks or the tan</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every other time I have used sunless tanning lotions, I have given up after one application because of that nasty burnt chemical smell that ends up on my skin several hours later.</li>
            <li> This is a lot less expensive, but was a little orange and streaked.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with the pump working.</li>
            <li> There is hardly an &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And I hardly ever exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> This is the only sunless tanning lotion I&#x27;ve found that looks absolutely natural and does not smell awful.</li>
            <li> No one has ever complained about it, and I have to work over patients&#x27; faces all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really never found a self tanner before this one that didn&#x27;t smell weird and create an unnatural effect.  </li>
            <li> I mean goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The things that I am using to grade self tanners are: (1) how natural the color is, (2)</li>
            <li> It gives a subtle tint after application.  </li>
            <li> i like the lotion and the subtle color i am building.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wash my hands or get some on a weird spot, I will notice a little staining, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to enhance the color of my legs.</li>
            <li> I was always told that it was a bad idea as I am Irish and fair-skinned</li>
            <li> The first thing to note is it smells awful, like burning crayons.</li>
            <li> Not very good looks orange in color and has weird smell too it</li>
            <li> Color looks fake on my very pale skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion left an orange color on me, which was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I mean none of them!  </li>
            <li> not a great color either.  </li>
            <li> and I have not experienced streaks like I have with self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> You might confuse me for a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not happy</li>
            <li> Looks unhealthy until I started using this product a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it does NOT have any of the undesirable ingredients that may be harmful and/or irritating.</li>
            <li> is very weak...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave weird steaks or patches of orange either.  </li>
            <li> — it smells lemony but fake tannery.</li>
            <li> smelled that horrible &amp;#34;tanning scent&amp;#34; on my body the entire trip across the pond on the plane.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to airbrush tanning salons and even at their LIGHTEST setting people still say I look &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; aka weird.</li>
            <li> Where it&#x27;s not streaking it looks orange and clearly fake, then it takes a while to wash off.</li>
            <li> looks so fake.  </li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t have the weird tanner smell.</li>
            <li> so how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> could never use the medium shade or it would look fake.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> I chose the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade, since I have light-to-med skin, and I thought the medium might make me look too tan or be difficult to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> so I can wear skirts and shorts without being scary.</li>
            <li> Smelled HORRIBLE just like every other fake tannin h lotion.</li>
            <li> but yanno... fight the power, all that, not putting that crap on my body&#x27;s largest organ, duh.</li>
            <li> Before this, I hadn&#x27;t bought any similar product in a couple years, because I was afraid of having that awful, artificial color</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s fake tanner because it doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell but it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell either.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine it making anyone&#x27;s skin look bad.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I used this once and will be throwing it away :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> All in all, I was really disappointed about this product and won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Smells like crap, but....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at applying self-tanners, but I also hate getting airbrush tans.</li>
            <li> awful.  </li>
            <li> again, awful color.  </li>
            <li> After reviewing it on the EWG website, and finding that it was rated 4/10 in terms of nasty chemicals, I decided a 40% wasn&#x27;t going to kill me and that I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at applying self-tanners, but I also hate getting airbrush tans. You can&#x27;t do anything for hours, and you never know if they&#x27;re going to make you too dark. This lotion is probably the best self tanner I&#x27;ve come across in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the downsides. I&#x27;m not totally crazy about the scent. I like the lemon, but there&#x27;s a faint hint of something less pleasant in there, and it does get old. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if this company made a few different scents you could alternate between. It can also suck remembering to apply it a few days in a row to get the desired level of darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upsides? Well for one, the smell may be unpleasant, but it&#x27;s still better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. I also like that this lotion is not just good at tanning, but great on the skin. For me, the fact each application is gradual is both a blessing and a curse - but it&#x27;s ultimately a good thing in terms of results. If you miss a few spots on the first application, it&#x27;s not too terribly obvious (since each application is light). The next time, you can go heavier in that spot to correct it, and over a few days, your mistakes balance each other out. Full strength tanners are much less forgiving.</li>
            <li> Turned my skin orange the first time I applied it. It smells and leaves a sticky feeling on your skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> This stuff gives you a very gradual and natural color -- not orange and it does not streak or get &#x27;spotty&#x27; like so many other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I have a pale, splotchy skin color, and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that evens out my skin tone and makes me feel good about showing some skin (e.g., my legs) in the warmer months.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is I notice a &#x27;salty&#x27; smell the day I use it, but that goes away after I shower.  I use this 2-3 times a week to maintain a very nice glow to my skin.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> the price is fabulous.  the color is a soft tan, not orange.  it is for light skin only.  i have light skin with freckles and this gave me a nice glow, not a deep dark tropical tan.  it did deepen some of my freckles.  perfect for a little color during the winter.  i did give it 4 stars because it does have that self tanner smell during the day and it does seem to leave a light film on the skin even after it dries.  i find most self tanners do this.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome - it gives a boost to a base tan or maintains it with a natural looking color, evens out tan lines, and even leaves skin feeling moisturized. my sister, mom and i use it on our faces and bodies about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: do not put on cracked-dry skin, like feet, because it will turn really dry cracks orange.&lt;br /&gt;will also make cuticles orange but that comes out with normal hand-washing.&lt;br /&gt;not sure if it works if you have no base tan ...</li>
            <li> This product worked very well. A subtle tan showed up after only a few days and stayed with me a few days even after I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels very nice on the skin.  It gives a subtle tint after application.  The lotion also has wonderful moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> The perfect tanning lotion! Smells nice, doesn&#x27;t turn you orange, and is easy to put on without streaking. Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t repurchase. Color looks fake on my very pale skin.</li>
            <li> No doubt this stuff is the best.  Smells like crap, but....if you can get over it then you will have a natural glowing tint/tan that will NOT have the famous orange smears at the knees, elbows and ankles!  Trick is to lotion knees, elbows and ankles heavy before applying Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow lotion.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect for fair skin.  I have to use it daily for about two weeks, before I see a noticeable difference, but it does work.  It doesn&#x27;t leave weird steaks or patches of orange either.  Perfect self-tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I have tried a vast array of self tanners in my years. None of them were anything I ever raved about or felt happy using. I got this @ Whole Foods Market and was happy about the more natural ingredients. I use it after showering and it never looks streaky as long as it is evenly applied. It gives me just a touch of color, enough to where I feel more confident showing my legs off. It smells nice and also doesn&#x27;t make my chest break out in a rash like Jergens Glow lotion used to do to me. Nice sized bottle for the price too! Great deal!</li>
            <li> First time using a self-tanner. I was always told that it was a bad idea as I am Irish and fair-skinned (thought it might look orangey and unnatural). Turned out to be the best idea I&#x27;ve had in a while thanks to nature&#x27;s gate. I went from being an &amp;#34;8&amp;#34; to a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; in 15 minutes. Hallelujah!</li>
            <li> I have the light and medium in this brand.  The light will be good for winter.  It goes on well and did not have to cut with lotion but as I am in sun more color will not work and I will use the medium.  Good product.  It is important to make sure skin is clean and has been exfoliated, do not put on in bathroom directly after a hot shower or it will streak.  I use lotion on my hands and nails before I use this product and does help to keep from discoloring my hands and nail area.  Wash hands well after use!  Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this lotion, but the smell is so strong that when I apply the lotion at night, I can still smell it on me in the morning. And it&#x27;s not a smell I particularly like — it smells lemony but fake tannery. I could overcome the smell if the color where lighter. I wanted a very gradual color because my plan was to apply this every night to mainly moisturize while adding subtle color to my translucent skin tone. On me, perhaps because my skin runs on the very dry side, this lotion mainly added color while subtly moisturizing. I ended up with brown elbows and knees only a few days into the bottle. I don&#x27;t want to have to moisturize before I apply this lotion, but I will have to do so in order to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunless tanning lotion I&#x27;ve found that looks absolutely natural and does not smell awful. Plus, it&#x27;s paraben free!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with the pump working. Other than that, this is a lightly hydrating lotion which provides a nice glow after a few applications. I&#x27;m fair with ruddy undertones. This sort of masks the pink undertones in my skin but not completely. You should wait a while for it to completely absorb before dressing, because it will rub off in some areas and look streaky. I don&#x27;t think it smells strong but one of my co-workers commented that she could smell it when I was near her. She&#x27;s pregnant though so her sense of smell may be heightened. No one has ever complained about it, and I have to work over patients&#x27; faces all day.</li>
            <li> great cruelty free/vegan self tanning lotion!  all self tanning lotions have an odor, and this one isn&#x27;t any different, but it&#x27;s not terrible.  i like the lotion and the subtle color i am building.  definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This lotion smelled horrid! I had to walk around for 2 days smelling like old food! It took 4 showers and a soak in the hot tub to get rid of the smell. As for the tanning part. If I had been more skilled at applying it I think it could&#x27;ve came out pretty even. However it did have an orange tint. This is the only self tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried so I can&#x27;t comment on any comparison. But I used this once and will be throwing it away :( waste of money.</li>
            <li> it is moisturizing and it smells great! i am all about being tan and I actually do use a tanning bed for health benefits so  i use self tan to achieve a nice deep tan, I use this lotion every night on my hands since my hands are ALWAYS lighter then the rest of me and I use it in the light formula ( I bought it before I started tanning but didnt wanna return it since its not amazons fault ) but I find that even though it is the light formula it is perfect and keeps my hands just as dark as the rest of me! I also use st tropez once a week and use this to keep the tan lasting. when I run out I will purchase the medium formula forsure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really never found a self tanner before this one that didn&#x27;t smell weird and create an unnatural effect.  They were all pretty bad, even more expensive brands.  This truly doesn&#x27;t smell either when you apply or later in the day.  I am fair and while I wouldn&#x27;t say I end up super tan, I also don&#x27;t end up orange or splotchy.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and tough to mess up.  It just provides a nice golden \\&quot;glow\\&quot; (true to the name) to limbs.  It&#x27;s also a great deal.  I use it as a daily lotion and it lasts all summer.  Plus, no parabens.</li>
            <li> Smelled HORRIBLE just like every other fake tannin h lotion. Looked great but couldn&#x27;t take the smell.</li>
            <li> Tried many products but this does good job over time and does look real wash hands quickly or they stain</li>
            <li> This self tanner is gradual and doesn&#x27;t give funky orange/streaky color. It&#x27;s very natural looking and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling weird the next day. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> ms pasty here.  i&#x27;d had two experiences with tanners before.  one - sprayed at a professional&#x27;s before a trip to st tropez - couldn&#x27;t go looking like a ghost could i?  smelled that horrible &amp;#34;tanning scent&amp;#34; on my body the entire trip across the pond on the plane.  awful.  not a great color either.  2 - streaky lotion with &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; in it (well, a stretch, but probably mica?)  again, awful color.  don&#x27;t know what made me try this but i&#x27;m THRILLED that i did.  after the first day i saw &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;!  no streaks (after zero prep like exfoliating knees, ankles, etc like they usually say to do), believable color on this chalky white body.  no flecks of sparkle either.  nice scent - NO &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34; smell.  rich carrier lotion.  so so easy!  i LOVE this!  after all these years on this earth, this originally strawberry blonde woman with pale skin that blistered then peeled may FINALLY tan like everyone else!</li>
            <li> This self body tanner not only gives you a healthy glow but it&#x27;s actually good for your skin.  I am on my second bottle. My neighbor is on her first bottle and so is my daughter.It does not turn orange-ish or streaked. It tones and moisturizes. Once I reached the tan I like, I use it every other day. This big bottle with a handy pump is now a must-have, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous. I have had great results. I have extremely fair skin and burn if I even try to tan. This gives the natural glow of weeks of tanning with just a  few uses. I use it every other day to avoid a color overload. Make sure you apply other lotion to your hands before using this or your hands won&#x27;t absorb the Glow lotion. Also make sure to wash them well after application.</li>
            <li> Well this was the first product that i found that doesn&#x27;t make you orange! It takes about 5 days to get a decent color going but looks natural. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell but it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell either. It&#x27;s just a little funky in that regard. If your doing your entire body then the bottle will last about a month. This one&#x27;s good for pale skin so if your looking to go dark this isn&#x27;t the product for you. I would suggest this for irish type skin.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was hoping for. I was looking for a natural tinted moisturizer that maintains color over time. This has safe ingredients that aren&#x27;t toxic to the skin, the smell is not strong or unpleasant, and the tint of tan it gives me is very natural.. it does not have an &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; look. You can reapply for a deeper color, but once every other day is enough for me to maintain a nice &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; Very happy with this product.. will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> This lotion left an orange color on me, which was very disappointing. It also smelled just like many other &amp;#34;self tanning lotions&amp;#34;, so it really wasn&#x27;t an improvement, especially since it is more expensive. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product! In the winter I am very fair skinned and only really tan in a tanning bed (which I&#x27;ve since sworn off, hence the need for self tanner) otherwise I burn like a lobster. This gave me a healthy glow when applied 3-4 times a week. May want to bump up to the medium skin toned version for the summer as this will only give you a hint of a glow and won&#x27;t really show up on more tan skin. I noticed after the first use a subtle glow that gave my pale pallor a nice hint of color! It&#x27;s also a fantastic moisturizer, leaving my skin hydrated for 24+ hours. Besides the funky smell it&#x27;s really a great product.  Helpful tips:&lt;br /&gt;- As one reviewer mentioned I made sure and coated my hands in a normal lotion before putting Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion on them and then applying to the rest of my body. This greatly reduced the orange look on my hands, and made it non existent between my finger nails which is common with self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;-Use it before bed. I never noticed any &amp;#34;rub off&amp;#34; on clothes but it does have a rather &amp;#34;stale Christmasy&amp;#34; smell that I personally didn&#x27;t want to be walking around with all day and having other people besides my husband sniffing ;)</li>
            <li> Only self tanner I have to compare this to is Estée Lauders bronzing lotion. This is a lot less expensive, but was a little orange and streaked. I tossed it. I would rather spend more and get more realistic results.</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it everyday! Gives me a great summer glow!</li>
            <li> Ok, I am a redhead with VERY fair skin, and I have found that this product provides a perfect color. Not orange, definitely not yellow, just a nice warm color. I used it two nights in a row, and will probably do just one more to get the shade I want. It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky or slimy, and there is zero streaking or blotching. The smell is also so much more faint than most self tanners! Love it, would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great lotion. It keeps my legs moist and soft. However, I haven&#x27;t noticed my legs being any more tan. If I don&#x27;t wash my hands or get some on a weird spot, I will notice a little staining, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to enhance the color of my legs. I&#x27;m extremely pale, but maybe I need the medium version.</li>
            <li> This stuff kicks A$$.  I never feel like I have self-tanner smell and I have not experienced streaks like I have with self-tanners.  You can control how much of a tan you want, and if you use it daily, at least for me, you can get darker than expected (like a normal tan).  I use it about 2-4 times weekly to maintain a nice glow.  I LOVE this stuff! I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it at the health food store where they sell other Nature&#x27;s Gate products.  Oh well!  I will be ordering again! :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tanning lotion without &amp;#34;additives&amp;#34; and this works nicely.  It&#x27;s not too dark - just a very light shade.  If you want something darker, I&#x27;d go with the next shade.  It does not give the orange that some do and there&#x27;s no bad smell.</li>
            <li> I am pasty-pale. Some call it porcelain, some call it white, but whatever you want to call it, at the end of the day, I am pale. While our society is currently in love with bronzed and golden skin, no matter the consequences, I sit here looking all pasty because I&#x27;m also a green-beauty lover and well, finding a product that is natural and that will adequately bronze my skin has, until now, proven to be harder than finding a unicorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in my annual quest to discover some new bronzing product that will give me that &amp;#34;Victoria&#x27;s Secret, I&#x27;m pouty and sexy and tan look&amp;#34; I stumbled across this product. After reviewing it on the EWG website, and finding that it was rated 4/10 in terms of nasty chemicals, I decided a 40% wasn&#x27;t going to kill me and that I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning after my shower, I first rub body oil on my elbows, knees, ankles and hands. Then I proceed to apply this moisturizer to my entire body, started from the legs and working up. After a week, a subtle glow had taken the place of my previously white and pasty legs. After two weeks, LOOK OUT! You might confuse me for a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that you adequately understand my love of this product, I have to impress upon you that the packaging is also something to be admired. Firstly, the amount of product that you get is phe-nom-en-al. You can&#x27;t beat the price to amount ratio. Then there&#x27;s the pump. Oh, sweet pump…whoever thought to put a pump on body lotion, you go Glen Coco! I mean goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are pale, if you are pasty, if you are annoyed with constantly being bombarded with negative comments about being &amp;#34;porcelain,&amp;#34; please try this. Just do yourself a favor and re-read my application instructions. It is very important to do the body oil step FIRST. Otherwise, you&#x27;re golden. Literally.</li>
            <li> A subtle even change, creating a realistic rich &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; skin tone, not an offensive smell, great moisturizer. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> Works very well and convenient pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very very light tint. I&#x27;m pretty pale but I can use it every night on my arms &amp; legs and not worry too much about making sure all my skin is completely evenly covered (like you would with a self tanning lotion) - the tint is that light. I almost wish it was just a touch darker, but the lightness makes it pretty much mistake proof.</li>
            <li> I developed a severe allergy to this product after combining it with a sunscreen.  I appear to be allergic to both products.</li>
            <li> Not very good looks orange in color and has weird smell too it I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product not happy</li>
            <li> I am very pale and wanted to add a little color for the summer time without getting the leather-orange tan look-plus the skin damage. It was easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t experience any streaking at all. You can really choose how much color you add. The only flaw is remembering to do it a couple days a week.</li>
            <li> Love this! I was worried about using a gradual tanning lotion for fear of turning orange/getting streaks. I have been using it almost a month and love it! Never once have I been orange, my hands haven&#x27;t turned colors and I have no streaks. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day in order to avoid being pasty white. I have pale skin (even though it tans well) and was a big user of tanning beds. I, however, am pregnant and can no longer tan indoors (I&#x27;m going to avoid going back as well thanks to this stuff!) I just ordered the medium version as I would like to be a little darker but this is great for anyone wanting to add a subtle color! Only downfall, it does have that icky tanning lotion smell-not HORRIBLE though, and it doesn&#x27;t get your skin very much darker. Other than that-it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Smell is fine, and tans just as well as brands that contain more toxins. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I hope this lotion never goes away! I have been tanning and searching for sunless tanning lotions for over 20 years and I finally found THE ONE! It has a light smell that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. This lotion makes my skin very soft and smooth, not sticky at all. I don&#x27;t need to use any other lotion, at all. It dries very fast! I don&#x27;t have to tan anymore because it makes a beautiful color, no streaks. I go back and forth with the light and dark. please keep it coming! I don&#x27;t know what I would do with out it!</li>
            <li> product has no  tanner smell, during application or after. Stays on me, and does not transfer to my clothing. Color is natural and not orange on my very fair skin. I plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way through the bottle &amp; I am pleased so far.  The color is very good &amp; haven&#x27;t had any trouble with blotchy coloring or orange. Very natural !!  Not as moisturizing as I would have hoped but I put on another moisterizer after I apply this one.</li>
            <li> Ok let&#x27;s start by saying that I&#x27;m a very pale redhead (deathly pale, I was sheltered most my life) and I have really struggled finding the right product that didn&#x27;t make me look odd, orange, streaky or unnatural, especially in the drug stores such as CVS and Walgreens. I&#x27;ve been to airbrush tanning salons and even at their LIGHTEST setting people still say I look &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; aka weird. This product is just the right amount of sunless tanner for someone who is really pale and hasn&#x27;t found anything that works or that they happy with long term. My concern was smell and how did it wear off over time. At first the smell is a little... Earthy? I don&#x27;t know specifically what the scent is and maybe some people think it&#x27;s pleasent but it really doesn&#x27;t last long so I put up with it because I see how well it works! Maybe two hours and you can&#x27;t smell it anymore so I was relieved in that aspect and my boyfriend hasn&#x27;t said A THING about the smell and believe me, he&#x27;s the first one to say something.  Now the wear... I put it on after a good exfoliation in the shower and reapplied after about three days... The thing is it&#x27;s so light that it sheds quick and if you have uneven spots from uneven exfoliation it&#x27;s hard to tell because it&#x27;s so light and micro integrated I can&#x27;t imagine it making anyone&#x27;s skin look bad. And that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s gotten such good reviews... It&#x27;s just an all around great product and hope they continue making it because it&#x27;s really going to be my go to for the summer! Not to mention my skin is really soft!- by a natural redhead</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used $50 creams and I&#x27;ve used creams from the corner drug store. And, I believe this one to be as good as the best.</li>
            <li> Great lotion to give little bit of color. I am very pale and this give me enough color to look like natural. Usually self tanners are way too orange and dark for me, but this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be repurchasing. I apply it after i shower and by the time i go out i already have a golden tone to me I love it.</li>
            <li> I had fun using this but it was too much work. Despite using Xen tan and waiting many minutes before going to bed after application, uneven color on my hands was very ugly! I&#x27;ll stick to my palid skin in the summer, throw a bronzer on my face and call it a day.</li>
            <li> This is a great selfless tanner... it definitely lasts longer than any other tanner I&#x27;ve tried and it has a very natural color. It&#x27;s not too expensive and lasts a pretty long time. The only downside is that it WILL stain your hands if you apply it directly. So I&#x27;d recommend getting the St. Tropez tanning applicator to make sure you apply it evenly.  If you go a little darker than you typically should, it will last a lot longer but it will also be a lot harder to apply evenly. I have tried both the light and medium and as a fair skinned person, I really should only be ordering the light version. It does run out a lot quicker though... I wish they had a middle ground between the two levels. Anyways, definitely worth the try! Amazon generally has great price too.</li>
            <li> Great product for light skinned people.  Used as a daily moisturizer it slowly gives you a lightly tanned look.  Although most people wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;, when you have super white skin,  it looks like tan ;-)  Especially great for red/strawberry blonde girls, looks natural, not too orange or too dark.  I love it...natural ingredients in a big bottle for a great price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, no bad ingredients, &amp; I love the soft glow it emparts. I use this every few days, &amp; if I feel the need to use it every day, I dilute it a bit first, &amp; go over my elbows &amp; knees beforehand with plain lotion. I do love the rich formulation, really seals in moisture!</li>
            <li> This product was well worth the money.  I need it to tan my legs for an upcoming wedding.  I followed the directions and the advice of the reviewers on Amazon and tested it out.  I put it on in the evening, using latex gloves.  You need very little because it spreads nicely.  By the next morning the results were a light, even tan.  The second day even better.  I read a review that said not to use it too many days in a row or it would begin to get that orange look.  But for me, who has the whitest legs ever, two nights were perfect.  Then it faded after a few days.  Its reasonably priced and will go a long way since you use so little with each application.</li>
            <li> streaky streaky streaky. Where it&#x27;s not streaking it looks orange and clearly fake, then it takes a while to wash off. Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Nature&#x27;s Gate products in general and this lotion is a wonderful addition to my skincare! I have very fair skin with blue vein undertones on my legs and I was looking for a lotion to add a bit of color, even out my legs&#x27; pasty skin tone and hopefully duplicate the natural color on my arms (I&#x27;m a gardener so my arms always seem to get a golden glow naturally) without all the chemical yuckiness (parabens, etc) that&#x27;s in most of the other tanning lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every other time I have used sunless tanning lotions, I have given up after one application because of that nasty burnt chemical smell that ends up on my skin several hours later. I did not have ANY yucky smell with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each evening after showering, shaving and drying off, I place a little bit of my normal moisturizer on my knees and ankles and then I evenly apply this Glow Lotion on my legs. I usually gently dab my knees and ankles a little afterward with a towel to make sure I have no extra lotion clinging there. By morning, my legs have a healthy, natural looking color. After three nights of use, I have already achieved a pleasant, even glow. I plan to build up the color just a bit more over the next two nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I have dry skin on my hands, and was very nervous about this lotion darkening the skin on my hands. Normal hand washing has prevented any coloring of my hands, and I have also had no streaking on my legs! Hooray!</li>
            <li> Pump&#x27;s handle was damaged. Smells ok, not that great. I support that fact that the product is not tested on animal.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I am fair and it gives a nice natural color to my skin</li>
            <li> Works well, color is nice, fairly non-smeary</li>
            <li> This was for my wife. She loves it. I takes 12-24 hours for color to start to show, so put it on the night before you need to look better than &amp;#34;fish belly white&amp;#34;. The color is very light so she uses it on her face too.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I&#x27;m fairly white, not pasty white, German/Irish.  Perfect for light skin tones.  I applied this product daily for about a week.  I couldn&#x27;t really tell it was working until after day seven or eight.  I mean, I see me and my skin tone everyday, so it was working very gradually.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to get me as tan as I was in my mid twenties, sun bathing regularly, but now I can wear my swim suit without embarrassment of my white/fair skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product on my face down to my ankles.  The only problem I faced was a small area of slight orange-ness on my knees, right below my kneecap.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 2 years now and really like it - I mix it with my regular lotion and it provides a nice color and NO SMELL !</li>
            <li> I am very very pale and I have used many self tanning products, this stuff is the best.  It&#x27;s paraben free and it&#x27;s from Nature&#x27;s Gate so you know your skin is not absorbing chemicals.  My usual complaint with self tanners (sprays or lotions) is that they leave streaking tan marks or the tan looks so fake.  Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion will give you a very gradual tan that will look very natural.  I have never had problems with streaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this a great tanner it is also a great moisturizer.  I use it daily on my face and it has never caused me to breakout.  I plan to continue to use this throughout the winter to keep my skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would guess that the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; product would only work if you are very pale - if you have normal skin tones I would go ahead and up yourself to the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> This is a better product that the traditional self-tanners but is not completely natural, as there are some chemicals still listed on the ingredients, despite the clever marketing of &#x27;natural moisturizers&amp;#34;.  The reason I would give this 4 starts rather than 3 (3 due to non-natural ingredients) is because the color it produces is great. There is hardly an &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; hue, leaving a natural, subtle tan. The tan lasts around 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would feel comfortable using this product under normal circumstances, but being that I am a nursing mother, I will likely stick to something without all-naturally derived DHA in addition to natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As a New Yorker, I get the majority of my sun through my office window. Combine that with my Irish skin and penchant for black clothing and well.. you can understand why I spent the good part of my grade school years rocking the Hot Topic look. I was basically born in a ghost body. In my 20&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been going for a more \\&quot;alive\\&quot; look and thus begins my search for a light tanner. I can&#x27;t say I searched high and low but a quick  scan of the ingredients in most tanning products made me cringe - I may not be goth anymore but yanno... fight the power, all that, not putting that crap on my body&#x27;s largest organ, duh. This stuff seems to have pretty okay ingredients though it does break my general rule of \\&quot;if you can&#x27;t pronounce it, maybe don&#x27;t rub it all over yourself,\\&quot; but hey, a blend of coffee and cocoa butter probably wasn&#x27;t gonna do the job so time to get over it. The smell is pretty okay compared to other tanners though there is room for improvement. I get a really nice light glow after applying it, which I do after exfoliating with either my [[ASIN:B00AX9Y1FS Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/towel (3) Blue]] or the [[ASIN:B00EPNPYM2 Exfoliating Bath Scrub Massage Mitt 100% Viscos Body Washcloth, 3 Count, Green, Original Korean Italy Towel]] (both highly recommended). I always do this in my bedroom so the steam doesn&#x27;t cause streaks and wash my hands so I don&#x27;t get dark spots (these usually happen between my fingers). It&#x27;s never stained my clothes either, which is definitely preferable.  And there you go, 12 or 13 bucks gives me a break from all the cat calls featuring Twilight references that I was receiving before. I recommend it to all the natural vampires out there.</li>
            <li> Name a self tanner, and I have probably tried it. I am very pale, and I get very pasty and sallow during the winter months. I don&#x27;t want to be orange or dark, but I do like a little help giving my skin a healthy glow... This product is basically perfect. As a self tanner, it is subtle, natural even and easy to apply. But as a moisturizer, it is absolutely incredible. It contains hyaluronic acid, shea butter, almond oil, apricot oil, and algae, all of which are fabulous high-quality moisturizing ingredients.  I have mild eczema and this product is so gentle that I can even use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use gloves with this. To apply it, I just put it on like regular lotion, as even and seamlessly as possible.  (Using too much won&#x27;t make you tanner faster, but it may cause streaks). When I&#x27;m done, I wash the palms of my hands with soap 2x.  Another tip I have, is that if you are very fair, you need to buy the Light shade. If you&#x27;re fair and you buy the darkest shade, it won&#x27;t make you tanner; it will just make you orange and streaky. As for the smell, ALL self-tanning products have that smell. It is the smell of the active ingredient (dihydroxyacetone or DHA) having a chemical reaction with amino acids on the surface of your skin to produce a darkened appearance. That is how all self tanners work, and therefore they will all have that stinky smell to some degree. To avoid it, I just use it before bed and shower it off in the morning.</li>
            <li> I find this stuff works pretty well, but it clings to certain parts of me more than others.  For some reason, my calves will not take to this stuff, but the rest of me does.</li>
            <li> This adds a nice subtle glow over a few days. Used to use Jergens Natural Glow, but stopped for the smell, the chemicals, and the animal testing. This is a great cruelty free product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter now and my skin tone is pinkish white. Looks unhealthy until I started using this product a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face only and I am getting a natural light tan using it every other day at night before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs into my skin in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Because it is a gradual change it is very forgiving of mistake like missing a small area. Don&#x27;t have to be careful about washing hands after use. I just rinse with water.&lt;br /&gt;I have had no skin problems using this product. My face is normally sensitive to almost all creams and lotions. But no problems with this one.. It actually has been very good as a moisturizer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering medium in the spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and am very happy with it. Should any adverse reactions happen after using it longer term, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know what your skin tone looks like in the daylight get daylight light bulbs for your bathroom. The bulbs should be 5000k color which is the closest to daylight there is. Next best is 3500K color. I bought [[ASIN:B0042UN1U0 Ecosmart 14 Watt Daylight 4 - Pack (60 Watt Equivalent)]] from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the reviews that helped me decide to try this one first!</li>
            <li> good color works fast</li>
            <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t smell weird, goes on nicely, and tans quickly.  I use it again and again.  It&#x27;s also healthier for your skin than other brands.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of self-tanning lotion. This lotion certainly has the least amount of smell EVER. I don&#x27;t even notice that I&#x27;ve put on self-tanning. It has a nice warm glow. It is not dark at all, but helps me not look pasty (since I am pretty light!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle product that you really have to be committed to using if you want a result. It smells different at first but you get used to the scent and after a while begin to like it. A change in tint can be noticed after about three days but it&#x27;s not drastic. It doesn&#x27;t give an orange color to skin but it doesn&#x27;t look very sun kissed. It doesn&#x27;t give you a tan look but more a darker skin tone.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here first and decided to try it. Everything about it that I read is true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such as:&lt;br /&gt;Funky smell but if you mix with lotion you&#x27;ll get over that.&lt;br /&gt;Wash your hands thoroughly after to prevent orange palms..as with any tanner you touch.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate first for better results, again, like other tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this one in particular because it&#x27;s very forgiving if you miss a spot. It&#x27;s not streaky or orange in the slightest. It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not feel too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I have everyone wondering why I look so sun kissed in December. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recently have been trying to get into gradual self-tanners so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the dangers of tanning in the sun and I thought I would try this out. There are a few things in which you must make sure you do before you use these self-tanners: make sure you exfoliate (and shave if you must) your skin to make sure that the application is smoother and so that the product can sink in better. You should also moisturize to keep the tan and this also allows the product to sink in better. The things that I am using to grade self tanners are: (1) how natural the color is, (2) how evenly it applies, and (3) the smell. This product completely fails for the first two. The next day, I could see dark streaks and the color seemed really fake because it was orangey - which is a no no. The smell was okay, it didn&#x27;t have the weird tanner smell. All in all, I was really disappointed about this product and won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Love this daily lotion, gives just a hint of natural color with no unpleasant odor. The best part is that not only does it work very well for subtle color and moisturization,  it does NOT have any of the undesirable ingredients that may be harmful and/or irritating. I mean none of them!  All ingredients are excellent! Hard to believe that something can actually be safe, responsible and effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used the medium color on my fair skin and it works really well if I want a little deeper color and faster results. With the medium, it is more like a regular self-tanner but much more natural and a little lighter so I use three days in a row and get the same effect only safer, more realistic color that does not smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS SKINCARE LINE! We also use their pomegranate sunflower hand wash, body wash and herbal shampoo.  All of these products use awesome ingredients and are exceptional in every way. Check them out if you care about what your are putting on your skin cause it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> The pump arrived broken and it smells funny.  I had to find a pump from a shampoo bottle to replace it.  It is a light creme color and very smooth just like normal lotion.  I just put a little on my chest to test it out.  It still smells after an hour.  It is not a horrible smell, but I certainly can&#x27;t walk around smelling like this all day.  I will try it out for a few days and hopefully my experience improves.</li>
            <li> Glow is the perfect name for this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t really make me brown or tan, I just have a nice glow.  I use for about two days in a row the  switch to my other lotion for a day and it seems to provide just the right amount of glow. Definitely worth a try. Also, it&#x27;s cruelty free so how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put it on evenly, and it&#x27;s more noticeable because of how fast this stuff works. However, it does give a nice tan glow and never made me look orange.</li>
            <li> A have a neutral, light complexion and I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years. I used to purchase it at my local health food store, but quickly found that it&#x27;s always cheaper online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally tried this because it is paraben and cruelty free. I wanted a more even tone to my skin and this delivers without looking orange. It also doesn&#x27;t break my back and chest out at all, which was a problem only when I was using other lotions. It doesn&#x27;t look like a fake tan at all, and should not be used to achieve the look of an obvious tan. I know some people use this on their face, but don&#x27;t, especially if shea butter breaks you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it three times  a week, it builds up and you begin to noticeably darken. It only takes one exfoliation in the shower to blend and diminish this, which is good news if you streak, which isn&#x27;t likely if you do it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOING IT RIGHT:&lt;br /&gt;-Do not apply to elbows or knees&lt;br /&gt;-Blend it out with an oil or lotion (I use coconut) at joints and creases and such to buff it out&lt;br /&gt;-Wash hands right away when you&#x27;re done&lt;br /&gt;-Stand around naked about 10 minutes after applying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color develops over a period of 24 hours, but I haven&#x27;t ever noticed it discoloring my sheets or clothes, though I wouldn&#x27;t put on a white shirt directly afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no la-dee-dah fragrance to this, and it&#x27;s been very non-irritating for me, but the smell is rather plastic-y despite being a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product. This doesn&#x27;t bother me because it goes away when you&#x27;re totally dry. If you&#x27;re pale and looking to simply appear a little more even and creamy, this is worth trying several times.</li>
            <li> It smells nice with a very subtle scent, glides on well and leaves your skin with a hint of color. If you are looking for a deep tan this is not for you, but if you want just a hint of sun-kissed skin you&#x27;ll like this lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light in color and darkens within hours leaving a beautiful shimmer which is great for my fair skin; smells better than most, easy to apply. Have to take care when applying to feet, hands, knees or drier skin. But this is no different than other self tanners. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> I could not be anymore pleased with this product. I put it on all over at night, waited for a few minutes, went to bed, and the next morning I had an amazing tan. It doesn&#x27;t nearly as long as I thought it would to get results. I also love how there aren&#x27;t a bunch of bad ingredients like a lot of self tanners. I will be buying this over and over again!</li>
            <li> At first I applied it like my Alba sunless tanner being very careful and applying some lotion along my inner arms, elbows, knees and ankles...but soon realized its not necessary.  No streaks no orange palms and I dont even wash them after any longer.  Used it abt a week applying it daily after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is very weak...could never use the medium shade or it would look fake.  I am pleased that I am no longer fish belly white.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that this is the first tanning lotion I have ever used so I don&#x27;t really have much to compare it to. The first thing to note is it smells awful, like burning crayons. Many of the other reviews said it takes a few days for them to see a difference, but the color was noticeable the very next morning after putting it on before bed. I have very pale skin, and used the light to medium, which was DEFINITELY dark enough. The color was splotchy on certain parts of my body, such as the wrists, ankles, and elbows. However, it looked good overall. I got many compliments. At first I put it on every night for about 5 days, then I started doing every other day. I want to start getting a real tan now so I stopped using it, which looked very odd for a couple days. After I would take a shower and dry off, brown flakes would just peel away. It was very splotchy when I was in the process of not using it anymore. I would say that overall it was an alright product; I was happy with the color and tan. However, it has a lot of room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it on for 24 hours yet so I don&#x27;t know if it will give me a light tan yet, however, after about an hour it started smelling like sour clothes.  Definitely a night time only lotion as I&#x27;d like to shower before heading off to work smelling like that.</li>
            <li> this is excellent for fair skinned people after a long winter. it gives just enough color to take away that pasty New England winter skin, but not so much that you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;ve been tanning. it won&#x27;t make you super tan, but it mad a huge difference in being able to wear skirts/shorts the first few times.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on the positive reviews posted by other Amazon customers.  The first day after using it I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  The second day after using it my legs were less white, but it wasn&#x27;t a huge change.  The third morning I really slathered it on and later in the day noticed that my legs had developed a slightly orange tone.  The trick I guess is to apply for a couple of days, then avoid it for a couple of days, rinse, repeat.  Using this on my legs doesn&#x27;t really make me look tan, but it does make my usually scary ghost white legs look better.  I do like that it is less heavy on chemicals than other brands.  I&#x27;m not sure that it is the perfect solution for me, but will continue to use it until I can come up with another option.</li>
            <li> Surviving a Cleveland winter can be rough. My skin  dries up and my summer tan fades away. I wanted a product that would give me just a tad of color and the added moisture would definitely help! This lotion instantly gave me a little color! The smell is unoffensive and it glides on well and absorbs quickly. I love it. For reference, my natural skin tone is fair, but I tan very well without burning.</li>
            <li> I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion (Light) deeply discounted in a store and thought I&#x27;d try it out. I am very fair (blue eyes, moderate freckles) and do not like an \\&quot;orangey\\&quot; tan, like many sunless tanners give you.  Before this, I hadn&#x27;t bought any similar product in a couple years, because I was afraid of having that awful, artificial color and I wanted something more subtle and gradually built, instead of instant.  This stuff is PERFECT!  I LOVE that the ingredients are much more natural than other lotions out there, and I was pleasantly surprised to barely notice that strange smell that other sunless tanners have! After only 2 days (2 applications), I am satisfied with the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it on my legs so far, as my upper body always has a little more color.  The only thing I would caution about, which is due to user error, is that on a small portion of my knees and a couple rough spots on my feet the color is a little concentrated (I should&#x27;ve exfoliated, or just applied less in that area).  I would also recommend to either put a regular lotion on your hands before applying this and/or wash your hands really well after application.  Overall, I am completely comfortable giving this lotion an A+!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change in complexion. Smelly and oily, this does nothing but cause breakouts on your face, shoulders, and even upper thigh. Traps oil in your hair follicles and causes pimples. Not a natural lotion and it only &#x27;yellows&#x27; you for about 30 minutes while you&#x27;re actually looking at yourself in the mirror then it just fades out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after doing some research on Amazon and finding the favorable reviews about it.  The ONLY draw back, which isn&#x27;t enough to reduce the five-star review, is the smell.  There&#x27;s a little general store up in North Conway, NH called Zeb&#x27;s that I go to every time I&#x27;m in the area.  Whenever I put this stuff on, I&#x27;m reminded of the smell of the store.  It&#x27;s a very pine-like smell, but it does go away within a few minutes of application.  Would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something new after using the Ocean Potion Ever Glow but I just don&#x27;t like this one as much. The smell isn&#x27;t very apparent at first but when it starts to settle onto your skin, it&#x27;s got this funky smell. Tolerable but undesirable. Also leaves a sticky feeling that takes awhile to dry. The color change is less noticeable than the Ever Glow. After this bottle, I think I&#x27;m going back to Ever Glow, which smells much better and color is stronger.</li>
            <li> Love this on my legs! I apply it every other night and it leaves your legs soft, not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> This is the least streaky self tanner that I&#x27;ve tried so far. I&#x27;ve tried the bath and body works variety as well as the regular drugstore jergens brand, but this one takes the cake. Pleasant scent AND it&#x27;s not tested on animals. I definitely recommend this, you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s fake tanner because it doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks!</li>
            <li> I should preface this by admitting this is the first self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like this lotion.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, spreads easily, and is not too heavy.  Most times, the scent doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It smells kinda like burnt cinnamon.  I usually apply this lotion as I&#x27;m getting ready for bed, so I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;will anyone smell this on me?\\&quot; worry.  If I feel overwhelmed by the scent, I just spritz on some perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results, I did achieve a light, natural-looking glow/tan (which does last for several days if you stop applying it).  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with my elbows or knees looking weird, and I only lotion them up before-hand maybe 1 in 10 times.  I don&#x27;t take any special care in application either, I just smear it carelessly all over.  And I hardly ever exfoliate.  The one place where I did end up with weird color build up was way up on my inner thighs (luckily it wasn&#x27;t bikini season).  I also haven&#x27;t figured out how to get the backs of my hands to match my arms, since I wash my hands immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as applying this to the face, probably not a good idea for sensitive and/or acne-prone skin.  I did this one time and had a pretty bad break-out shortly after (can&#x27;t be sure this was the only culprit - I was also trying out a new cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product for getting a nice glow that doesn&#x27;t take careful application to look great.</li>
            <li> Works great - as good as the reviews!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews unless I&#x27;m really impressed and I am quite impressed with this product. I went from the lightest shade makeup I could find to a nice all over golden tan. I&#x27;m very impressed with how natural the color is. Every self tanner ive used, even pricier ones, have made me copper (I don&#x27;t want to be orangey copper-just sun kissed) or orange, but Nature&#x27;s Gate Light has been fabulous and is quite natural looking. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the smell, but I just put it on at night and wash off in the morning which is nice for washing off any excess.</li>
            <li> I have tried many tanning lotions and this is the best by far. I have very fair skin and most lotions make me look either orange or dirty. Nature Gate&#x27;s lotion gives my skin a super perfect tan. At first I used it several days in a row and it ended up being a bit too tan for winter but I was able to exfoliate enough to make it more subtle. I put some on twice a week now after exfoliating in the shower. Don&#x27;t put it on in the bathroom while it&#x27;s all steamy; it will make the color uneven. I mostly put it on my legs and occasionally on my arms but I have done a full body application a few times and when I do that I make sure to do an extra thorough exfoliation with shower gloves and FakeBake shower gel to make sure I get it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this lotion is that the smell is better than other tanning lotions. It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s about as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to put it on a night because it is a little heavy and I don&#x27;t like feeling it on my skin during the day. Also please be careful on your feet, ankles, and elbows.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this works for me! I&#x27;ve tried other self tanners and Jergen&#x27;s natural glow and I break out in rashes. This, so far, seems like it is agreeing with my skin! I was a bit itchy the first and second use.. that may have been my paranoia but now I am fine! I apply regular moisturizing lotion in between uses. The smell is also nice and not too strong, it kind of reminds me of the beach! I am happy I have finally found a self tanning product that actually takes to my skin so that I don&#x27;t have to go in a tanning bed and really damage my skin! It also has a natural color, I have been asked if I was out in the sun. Also, definitely start with light! I was tempted to start with medium and I didn&#x27;t and light was perfect. At first, I was worried it wasn&#x27;t that noticeable, but after about 4 uses I have a natural looking bronze. Move to the medium after your first bottle of light.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a fair skin tone, and she uses this tanning lotion because she wants a darker tone for cheerleading. It works great... The smell is not offensive like most tanning lotions, and it works perfectly for her. Just be sure to exfoliate first and let it dry before putting on clothes to avoid streaking. We recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Very light weight lotion and gives great color. It smells nice too...no fake tan smell! Overall I love it!</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tired many different bronzing lotions and this has been the best so far.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and didn&#x27;t streak or have a blotchy appearance on my skin.  I am prone to allergic reactions but this product did not irritate my skin at all.  It also has a nice smell, which is something most other bronzers do not have.  I would still like for the color to be a little more subtle. I am very pale with a little pinkish color on most of my skin and even with just one application it darkens my skin a good bit.  It&#x27;s too much color for me to use this on my upper body, but it works well for my legs.  I do not have to reapply very often so one bottle should last a long time giving it good value.</li>
            <li> This has a very natural effect, doesn&#x27;t streak orange, and doubles as a moisturizer.  One bottle is going to last the summer, and I like this better than some of the more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> Good, subtle color enhancement.</li>
            <li> effective, paraben-free.  does what it says.  good for legs &amp; arms (probably not face).</li>
            <li> I bought the medium glow lotion before this. It was very good, but with my light skin the tan was too dark, too fast. It would have been fine for mid summer \\&quot;just back from the beach\\&quot; look, but for winter, it was too dark. This light version is perfect for a not-too-noticable color change. I tried it on my arms and legs first and with two applications, it was just right. I re-apply after two days and that seems to keep the tan at a good color. It does not seem to clog pores, but I do clean my face twice a day with witch hazel. [[ASIN:B000GCQ04C Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner 16 oz.]]. Yes, the witch hazel takes off a tiny layer of the tan, but that&#x27;s OK. The glow lotion still looks good for two days before re-applying. Another great thing about getting a little tan is that it covers up all the irregular skin tone issues and you need far less make up if any at all. I use just a tiny touch of bare minerals make up [[ASIN:B0036E43YG Bare Escentuals BareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation Medium Beige 8 g]] and a little blush [[ASIN:B001UG6JYO bareMinerals All-Over Face Color - Glee]], a little eye make up, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> First off, I am very sensitive to all fragrances--nearly everything I purchase is fragrance-free, from personal to household products (even masking fragrances, contained in products labeled \\&quot;unscented,\\&quot; bother me). The scent in this lotion is very slight and very natural; it smells exactly like shea butter. Very pleasant. The consistency is similar, too--a rich, thick lotion/creme, which I love because I have very dry skin. I chose the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade, since I have light-to-med skin, and I thought the medium might make me look too tan or be difficult to spread evenly. I got it to use primarily on my legs, which don&#x27;t get much sun. I wanted to even them out with the rest of my body. Well, for me (maybe I&#x27;m not as fair as I think I am!), it took A WHILE to see any results. I applied it twice a day for four days before I noticed any difference. Then, a nice, natural glow started to appear. After a week, I&#x27;ve gone down to one application every other day to maintain the glow. Now my legs match and I&#x27;m excited to wear skirts and shorts this year. I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with unevenness. I apply it once I dry off from the shower. Being that I have dry skin, it absorbs immediately. My skin loves it. I rinse my hands thoroughly after application (just water, no soap) and dry them well; I haven&#x27;t had any yellowing of my palms. A good tip a got from other reviews was to exfoliate prior to application. I exfoliate about once a week. This helps the product cover/absorb evenly. Another tip is to first apply a regular lotion to darker/dryer areas, such as kneecaps, rough spots, toes, etc., so the glow lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly into those areas. I may switch to the medium if I decide I want more of a tan than just \\&quot;glow,\\&quot; but it&#x27;s nice to be able to apply the light version often because of its moisturizing properties alone. As long as they don&#x27;t make any changes to this product (like fiddling with the fragrance--please, Nature&#x27;s Gate, just leave it as is!) I can seemyself using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> This stuff works ok but I have noticed a little rub off on my intimates. Also, be sure to lotion your joints like elbows and knees with regular lotion before using this stuff because it will darken those places much more than the rest of your skin and it wont look like a natural tan.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and another product, [[ASIN:B001AXIWGA Fake Bake Fair Lotion, 6-Ounce]], intending to try both and see which one worked best but I liked the Nature&#x27;s Gate so well I&#x27;ve put off trying the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair...as in so white it is like a dead fish belly...skin. I only need this for my legs so I can wear skirts and shorts without being scary. I have the naturally fair undertones of pink and blue. I *can* tan, but after spending the 80s as brown as a walnut, I do try to avoid naturally tanning now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion isn&#x27;t meant to make you brown, only to add some natural looking sun inspired color. If you are looking for more than that, then you&#x27;ll be best served with one of the more aggressive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks just like regular lotion in the bottle and smells like a pretty standard lotion too. You simply rub it in like regular lotion and then wait until it is fully soaked in. Dress like normal and within 24 hours you&#x27;ll see a hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, you&#x27;ll want to put regular lotion on your hands first so the skin on your hands won&#x27;t soak up this lotion. Then when you put on the Glow lotion, be more careful than you otherwise would to get a pretty even coat but go lightly over the knees and ankles, since those areas tend to soak up more lotion in general and therefore, will get darker. Then sit around for about 20 minutes just to be sure you&#x27;re all absorbed and dress. I like to do this after work so I can just wear my loungewear and not risk nice clothing, though I have seen no proof that it comes off on clothes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after application, wash your hands vigorously and thoroughly and use a washcloth or something rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to results, I noticed a light tan by the next morning after first usage. That&#x27;s about 16 hours of time. I used it again that night and it was darker the next day. I did that again for 2 more days and on the 5th day I woke to the dreaded color ORANGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That wore off after a couple of days and I was back to glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson is that you won&#x27;t need to use this for many days to get the max it will give to a very fair skinned person. More after that point is not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trial and error has shown me that I need to apply it every third day after I reach peak in order to mostly maintain the color. After a couple of weeks I&#x27;ll go two days in a row to get the color back up to peak, and then back to every third day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given how fast it works, this bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for people who will not naturally tan, either because they want to preserve their skin or because they burn and who embrace their fairness but want enough color to blend in with the world. Not recommended for people with very yellow undertones in their skin because they will likely turn orange faster. Not recommended for people who are super fair but want to get a fake dark tan./&gt;That wore off after a couple of days and I was back to glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson is that you won&#x27;t need to use this for many days to get the max it will give to a very fair skinned person.

            <li> I have fair cool toned skin and bought this in the light version. Most sun-less tanning products leave me orange and streaky. The only exception is Jergen&#x27;s Glow lotion. This is so much better, my skin is soft and the color is subtle and buildable. It works well for my yellow/olive hue and goes on smoothly. This is streak free if you take the time to rub it into your skin. Will repurchase when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! I have very white skin and I used to tan in a bed, but stopped because of the health risks. I decided I would give self tanning lotion another try (i used jergens before ans it turned me orange) and I&#x27;m happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very white skin, get the lotion for light skin tones. I know some people want to get tanner faster so they get the darker lotion but DON&#x27;T. I apply this lotion after I shower at night and when I wake up the next day, I&#x27;m way tanner. It doesn&#x27;t have an un-natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply, make sure you don&#x27;t use to much on your elbows and knees...since those are dryer spots they turn super orange. I recommend putting coconut oil or body oil on them before. This stuff really works wonders!!</li>
            <li> I am porcelain skinned with a pink undertone, so getting a tan in a bed or by the sun has never been a possibility.  For most of my life I was embarrassed of my pale skin and wasn&#x27;t very comfortable wearing short sleeves or shorts.  So, as many reviewers, I have spent 100&#x27;s of dollars on both expensive and inexpensive tanning lotions just to give my skin the slightest bit of color.  I have found that self tanners turn different people orange. I have never turned orange with this self tanner.  I found this self tanner through a recommendation in a magazine and I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t make me bronzed after one application, but that&#x27;s not what I am looking for in a tanner. This lotion truly gives me a nice glow and gives me this confidence to wear shorts and dresses.  It takes time to dry and it can rub on your clothes, but washes out very easily.  I find that the next day, after applying at night, I already have a nice color.  I do apply it everywhere, including my face.  The best thing about this lotion in comparison to other self tanners is that if fades very naturally and not blotchy as I have found with the most expensive self tanners.  Sometimes, I don&#x27;t have time to apply everyday, so I want something that is gradual and natural.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have light skin, and don&#x27;t want to look like I spend all day at the pool--I just need a tad bit of color.  This is very easy to apply--I have been using it for a week and have yet to have any problems with streaking (I have made sure to rub the lotion in so that my skin is no longer slippery).  The color is subtle, and lasts for a few days.</li>
