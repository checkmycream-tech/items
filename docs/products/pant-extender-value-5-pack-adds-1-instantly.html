            <li>These are an awesome solution.</li>
            <li>He is very happy with them, as well.</li>
            <li>These extenders work great.</li>
            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>Presto MAGIC!</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to get rid of some favorite pants!</li>
            <li>This solves the problem nicely.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the early &amp;#34;not showing, but pants not quite fitting&amp;#34; days of pregnancy.</li>
            <li>We were also very pleased with how quickly we received them after ordering!</li>
            <li>Can be a bit tricky to work over some pant buttons, but very secure and discreet.</li>
            <li>I used this product and it works ok.</li>
            <li>I love these extenders.  </li>
            <li>They are so much better than the 2 piece extender.  </li>
            <li>But there is magic in them, they allow you to get into your jeans or pants and still breath.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind also that your zipper won&#x27;t be able to go all the way up since the pants are now wider.</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use them that often.  :-)</li>
            <li>easy to use and invisible once installed on pants.</li>
            <li>So, slightly less than perfect.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous item</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit on all buttons.  </li>
            <li>I move the original button on my pants in closer and use the extender.  </li>
            <li>Other than this it works great.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and on most jeans they are just right to stay on even in the wash.</li>
            <li>That tiny bit of space makes the difference in moving up a size, or staying in your favorite jeans.</li>
            <li>no give, person with limited hand mobility wouldn&#x27;t even be able to get it on pants.</li>
            <li>During those time when I am up a few pounds it is amazing how just an inch is a relief.</li>
            <li>These really do add an inch to the pants.</li>
            <li>I gained some weight recently and bought these so that my pants would still fit.  </li>
            <li>Did not fit around most buttons</li>
            <li>Hubby has a few pair of jeans that fit fine but are a little snug around the waist.  </li>
            <li>The only fault I have is you must have the large buttons on the pants or this extender slips off the button.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers...I agree that these should have a little bit more flexibility.  </li>
            <li>Pops on quickly and gives your waist a little extra room.</li>
            <li>Too large for one but not large enough for the next size.  </li>

            <li> In order to use these, I will have to put smaller buttons on my jeans.....the loop is NOT flexible at all and I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money totally worthless haven&#x27;t found anything it works with. Hard plastic, no give, person with limited hand mobility wouldn&#x27;t even be able to get it on pants.</li>

            <li> I love these extenders.  They are so much better than the 2 piece extender.  I move the original button on my pants in closer and use the extender.  I can finally zipper my pants.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the early &amp;#34;not showing, but pants not quite fitting&amp;#34; days of pregnancy. Can be a bit tricky to work over some pant buttons, but very secure and discreet.</li>

            <li> Woo hoo!!  Presto MAGIC! Now I don&#x27;t have to get rid of some favorite pants! Fabulous item :o)</li>
            <li> I bought  pair of levi&#x27;s that were just a little too tight but I couldn&#x27;t return or exchange them as I had left them in my closet for awhile. So I bought these hoping to not have wasted my money. These are an awesome solution. Pops on quickly and gives your waist a little extra room. The only down side is that as stated they are hard plastic which means they don&#x27;t stretch at all. Keep in mind also that your zipper won&#x27;t be able to go all the way up since the pants are now wider.</li>
            <li> I gained some weight recently and bought these so that my pants would still fit.  They work Well, I have bought this twice!</li>
            <li> Did not fit around most buttons</li>
            <li> I love these things. Bought two packages, one for me, one for my husband. He is very happy with them, as well.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers...I agree that these should have a little bit more flexibility.  They don&#x27;t fit on all buttons.  So, slightly less than perfect.  But they get the job done.  Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use them that often.  :-)</li>
            <li> My husband was between sizes in pants.  Too large for one but not large enough for the next size.  These extenders work great.</li>
            <li> Hubby has a few pair of jeans that fit fine but are a little snug around the waist.  These extenders are just what he needs.  I got the 5 pack as he has a tendency to misplace things and this way he has extras until the &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; ones are found! We were also very pleased with how quickly we received them after ordering!</li>
