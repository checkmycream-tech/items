            <li>they all LOVED it too .</li>
            <li>The packaging is so brilliant, that once you screw off the lid, there&#x27;s a plastic knob you turn, and then you can shake out the powder that you need without it going everywhere in a huge dust cloud whenever you take off the lid.</li>

            <li>and I love it.!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s ok, not UD quality though, by any means!</li>
            <li>It leaves your face matte, sure, but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it does anything for my face honestly .</li>
            <li>This really is the best finishing powder.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li>but it does give a nice matte appearance to skin.</li>
            <li>Great and quick way to get rid of that oily skin...</li>
            <li>My skin looks perfect (and it is far from it)</li>
            <li>Best thing to control oily skin I have found so far</li>
            <li>Very good product for a finish powder, highly reccommend</li>
            <li>but this really makes my skin look smooth and flawless and helps control oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Why pay more?</li>
            <li>This covers great, covers big pores, and is really the best powder I think I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>more so I bought this</li>
            <li>and i COMPLETELY LOVE this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smashbox and MUFE are both lovely finishing powders, and Smashbox&#x27;s has SPF.</li>
            <li>Love this powder.</li>
            <li>but that is okay....</li>
            <li>Gives a nice matte finish just doesn&#x27;t blurr or smooth my skin</li>
            <li>so you end up with more than you needed in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works better for a lighter complexion.</li>
            <li>but this one absorbs excess oil from face unbelievabl better than BM.</li>
            <li>I would advise against getting this product, better to pay more and get a product in a usable container</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The powder is nice, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true win/win!</li>
            <li>Did not work as seller states &amp;#34;Less visible pores and fine lines&amp;#34</li>
            <li>For the price it is a worthy investment, but I think the MAKE UP FOR EVER product works a bit better.</li>
            <li>Makes my face look chalky ....not a huge fan</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic, smooth, truly translucent matte finishing powder that doesn&#x27;t turn my olive skin to an ashy looking hue.</li>
            <li>If you want something light on the face but keeps your makeup on all day, get this product.</li>
            <li>have an only forehead and with putting this powder on in the beginning of my day my face lasts non oily all day and its great.</li>
            <li>This covers shine and is fantastic at oil control without getting clumpy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all types of powder and such, and I am experienced with makeup.</li>
            <li>The finish on my face is silky smooth but gives me almost a ghostly powder coating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for oily, larger pore skin.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, it does start turning you white, but with the perfect amount it goes on like</li>
            <li>Has a sort of gritty feel to it that isn&#x27;t very nice</li>
            <li>i love it at first</li>
            <li>I suppose since this type of detailed make up becomes very expesive this is an okay price for the amount that is in the jar.</li>
            <li>My pores did not look greatly improved like I expected.  </li>
            <li>Many Thanks</li>
            <li>I gave this product two stars instead of one, because if it actually does work for you, its a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I HAVE SUPER OILY SKIN.</li>
            <li>I had the makeup forever high definition powder and this powder is just as amazing but much</li>
            <li>My skin has become rough with larger pores as I have aged, but this makes my skin look nearly flawless and feels great.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first, because I&#x27;m used to applying more powder halfway through the day to avoid too much</li>
            <li>Anyone with large pores or fine lines would do well to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>B001SZ1NUW CoverGirl Trublend Minerals Loose Powder,  Translucent Fair 405,  0.63-Ounce]]</li>
            <li>SUPER MESSY LOL</li>
            <li>I use the Make up Forever Face and Body Liquid Make-up as I am lucky enough to need only light coverage and a bit of the finishing powder finishes off the look very nicely.</li>
            <li>Those are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>But fun to have .</li>
            <li>This product gives me, no breakouts, no mess, a reasonable price, fast shipping, professional service, and the most gorgeous finish to my Nars foundation ever.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it came super fast!</li>
            <li>I normally have to feel where I just applied it to see what feels powdery smooth and what still feels sticky from foundation.</li>
            <li>This is good for half the price though.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one after reading great reviews and how it&#x27;s just like a much more expensive veriosn of HD powder.</li>
            <li>Very light and sheer.</li>
            <li>It does not do very much for my skin; although my skin does feel softer, I don&#x27;t think it does anything for the appearance.</li>
            <li>Other powders seem to clump and look oily after a few hours, but this is truly remarkable for those of us with less than perfect skin.</li>
            <li>This second safety lid sealing in the powder, and its cute size,</li>
            <li>this is actually my first time trying a mineral finishing powder</li>
            <li>Love this product I will definitely recommended this to anyone that has oily t-zones as myself.  </li>
            <li>Do not use too much!</li>
            <li>skin can get pretty oily, but I&#x27;m able to wear this all day long without looking shiny.</li>
            <li>Comes Ina cute little clear container brush not included which was not a problem :)</li>
            <li>dry fully first, this goes on a lot better.</li>
            <li>can say it looks very sparkly and pretty in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, they have the little turnkey style top so that you can close it up and open it only when in use, which is a great thing to have for a powder.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use a tiny amount at a time and blend it in over as much area as possible before putting more on the brush.</li>
            <li>This might work great for someone that only wears this and no foundation to mat down shiny skin.</li>
            <li>It made my skin look flawless and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>My products arrived in only a few days from US to Ireland at standard post charges exactly as described and ordered and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and large pores</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, but I love makeup forever&#x27;s version of this product.</li>
            <li>just fine, not too much  nor little.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it works for a very very very short period (say picture taking).</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and it seems to really keep that in check.  </li>
            <li>It looks fantastic in person, but photographs white.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really wear make up</li>
            <li>I liked this so much, I went back to the Sheer Miracle vendor and bought the 4 piece sampler.</li>
            <li>in brackets it said like makeup forever powder, didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>Not a fan, have not seen any benefit and very drying.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using to much?</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use too much of it when I finish applying makeup.</li>
            <li>Because this product was so much cheaper</li>
            <li>It does spread really well, but the problem is that you can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s spreading to.</li>
            <li>Very silky.</li>
            <li>I recommend HD high definition mineral finishing powder makeap  !</li>
            <li>but after using it a couple time i love it, it leaves my face super super soft and matte and i came to find out a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more careful when I use it and make sure the lid is on tight so it doesn&#x27;t spill!  </li>
            <li>On this product less is more.</li>
            <li>it smells kind of funny and is a little bit different consistency</li>
            <li>Your makeup stays on longer and my favorite thing is it keeps my face less oily!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely drying, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a try at a different product since I am new to finishing powders, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this one again as I don&#x27;t think beauty should smell funny</li>
            <li>I only gave this three stars because the more expensive one at Sephora seems to work a bit better.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>However, I did find that Tart from Sephora also has a version of finishing powder that doesn&#x27;t smell like this one&#x27;s odd burnt talcm powder, and has about the same consistancy if that helps anyone :)</li>
            <li>It is hard to control the amount however with the jar letting much more than nessecary overflow into the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft &amp; finished.</li>
            <li>The powder is so soft and even gives your face a &#x27;softened&#x27; look when u wear it over your foundation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves the skin feeling really soft, but doesn&#x27;t cover up the benefits of your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>Fast shipper and the container looks the same!</li>
            <li>I rarely wear compact powders because they frequently have oils and other binders which break my skin out.</li>
            <li>Your face has to be well hydrated first, and you have to use a fluffy brush to apply the powder, but if you do, this powder does the job very well.</li>
            <li>It is sort of hard to keep it from getting in the air around you when applying as it&#x27;s so fine and</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit to really do your whole face.  </li>
            <li>Had been using BAre Minerals Finishing Powder</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because I really didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference!!!</li>
            <li>It looks and performs exactly the same way as the other brand that I used to splurge on.</li>
            <li>only does the product keep my make up on pretty much the entire day, give or take the last few hours of the day, it smells HEAVENLY.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like the other products but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Its made with silica which absorbs oil so different usage unlike BM which is just a finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be deceived by the color, the white, disappears upon putting it on as it absorbs the natural oils from face.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Extreme Closeup HD High Definition MIneral Finishing Powder Makeup 8g/.28oz, which like it says, compares to the Make up for Ever HD microfinish Powder.)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply too much it is tough to remove and looks obvious without blending well into the skin tone.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I gave this product two stars instead of one, because if it actually does work for you, its a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SUPER OILY SKIN.</li>
            <li> I had the makeup forever high definition powder and this powder is just as amazing but much</li>
            <li> My skin has become rough with larger pores as I have aged, but this makes my skin look nearly flawless and feels great.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a first, because I&#x27;m used to applying more powder halfway through the day to avoid too much</li>
            <li> Anyone with large pores or fine lines would do well to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> B001SZ1NUW CoverGirl Trublend Minerals Loose Powder,  Translucent Fair 405,  0.63-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> SUPER MESSY LOL</li>
            <li> I use the Make up Forever Face and Body Liquid Make-up as I am lucky enough to need only light coverage and a bit of the finishing powder finishes off the look very nicely.</li>
            <li> Those are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> But fun to have .</li>
            <li> This product gives me, no breakouts, no mess, a reasonable price, fast shipping, professional service, and the most gorgeous finish to my Nars foundation ever.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it came super fast!</li>
            <li> I normally have to feel where I just applied it to see what feels powdery smooth and what still feels sticky from foundation.</li>
            <li> This is good for half the price though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one after reading great reviews and how it&#x27;s just like a much more expensive veriosn of HD powder.</li>
            <li> Very light and sheer.</li>
            <li> It does not do very much for my skin; although my skin does feel softer, I don&#x27;t think it does anything for the appearance.</li>
            <li> Other powders seem to clump and look oily after a few hours, but this is truly remarkable for those of us with less than perfect skin.</li>
            <li> This second safety lid sealing in the powder, and its cute size,</li>
            <li> this is actually my first time trying a mineral finishing powder</li>
            <li> Love this product I will definitely recommended this to anyone that has oily t-zones as myself.  </li>
            <li> Do not use too much!</li>
            <li> skin can get pretty oily, but I&#x27;m able to wear this all day long without looking shiny.</li>
            <li> Comes Ina cute little clear container brush not included which was not a problem :)</li>
            <li> dry fully first, this goes on a lot better.</li>
            <li> can say it looks very sparkly and pretty in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, they have the little turnkey style top so that you can close it up and open it only when in use, which is a great thing to have for a powder.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use a tiny amount at a time and blend it in over as much area as possible before putting more on the brush.</li>
            <li> This might work great for someone that only wears this and no foundation to mat down shiny skin.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look flawless and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> My products arrived in only a few days from US to Ireland at standard post charges exactly as described and ordered and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and large pores</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, but I love makeup forever&#x27;s version of this product.</li>
            <li> just fine, not too much  nor little.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it works for a very very very short period (say picture taking).</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and it seems to really keep that in check.  </li>
            <li> It looks fantastic in person, but photographs white.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really wear make up</li>
            <li> I liked this so much, I went back to the Sheer Miracle vendor and bought the 4 piece sampler.</li>
            <li> in brackets it said like makeup forever powder, didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> Not a fan, have not seen any benefit and very drying.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using to much?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use too much of it when I finish applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Because this product was so much cheaper</li>
            <li> It does spread really well, but the problem is that you can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s spreading to.</li>
            <li> Very silky.</li>
            <li> I recommend HD high definition mineral finishing powder makeap  !</li>
            <li> but after using it a couple time i love it, it leaves my face super super soft and matte and i came to find out a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more careful when I use it and make sure the lid is on tight so it doesn&#x27;t spill!  </li>
            <li> On this product less is more.</li>
            <li> it smells kind of funny and is a little bit different consistency</li>
            <li> Your makeup stays on longer and my favorite thing is it keeps my face less oily!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely drying, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a try at a different product since I am new to finishing powders, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this one again as I don&#x27;t think beauty should smell funny</li>
            <li> I only gave this three stars because the more expensive one at Sephora seems to work a bit better.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> However, I did find that Tart from Sephora also has a version of finishing powder that doesn&#x27;t smell like this one&#x27;s odd burnt talcm powder, and has about the same consistancy if that helps anyone :)</li>
            <li> It is hard to control the amount however with the jar letting much more than nessecary overflow into the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft &amp; finished.</li>
            <li> The powder is so soft and even gives your face a &#x27;softened&#x27; look when u wear it over your foundation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves the skin feeling really soft, but doesn&#x27;t cover up the benefits of your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li> Fast shipper and the container looks the same!</li>
            <li> I rarely wear compact powders because they frequently have oils and other binders which break my skin out.</li>
            <li> Your face has to be well hydrated first, and you have to use a fluffy brush to apply the powder, but if you do, this powder does the job very well.</li>
            <li> It is sort of hard to keep it from getting in the air around you when applying as it&#x27;s so fine and</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit to really do your whole face.  </li>
            <li> Had been using BAre Minerals Finishing Powder</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I really didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference!!!</li>
            <li> It looks and performs exactly the same way as the other brand that I used to splurge on.</li>
            <li> only does the product keep my make up on pretty much the entire day, give or take the last few hours of the day, it smells HEAVENLY.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like the other products but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Its made with silica which absorbs oil so different usage unlike BM which is just a finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be deceived by the color, the white, disappears upon putting it on as it absorbs the natural oils from face.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Extreme Closeup HD High Definition MIneral Finishing Powder Makeup 8g/.28oz, which like it says, compares to the Make up for Ever HD microfinish Powder.)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply too much it is tough to remove and looks obvious without blending well into the skin tone.</li>
            <li> applying this product, I discovered you only need a small amount to cover your WHOLE face, EX:</li>
            <li> This stuff is very subtle providing a light sheen wherever applied.</li>
            <li> MF&#x27;s version is no better than this version, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> This powder makes your pores less visible, sets your makeup and makes your skin feel velvety soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty devoted Make Up Forever fan, but this product is so much less expensive and works exactly the same that I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy the Make Up</li>
            <li> but, you are going to use it up long before 90 days have passed.</li>
            <li> No matter what I did as long as this product was on my face</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of the name brand cosmetics for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff, just a generic brand and about half the price.</li>
            <li> I actually mixed it with my other face powder-[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This mineral finishing powder goes a very very long way.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have dry skin.   </li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a dry.</li>
            <li> Every time I put it on my skin would get all dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to folks with dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only powder that helps tone down my oily skin is Makeup HD forever.</li>
            <li> This powder is drying, and not very finely milled - so it actually feels and looks grainy on your face even after buffing.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of it, I will agree</li>
            <li> I had expected from the picture that the product would come with a puff or some method of application.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complaints are it is very messy if you spill it, and the little tray thing under the lid has come off twice and resulted in a big mess.  </li>
            <li> Usually, I just carry blotting papers, but depending on where I am, I now have a choice about how I&#x27;ll deal with any mid day shine.</li>
            <li> After 4 hours may face seemed to compensate by going extremely oily.</li>
            <li> Recommended, but be careful with the lid!</li>
            <li> and my skin is extremely oily.</li>
            <li> And it also extends the life of the Mineral Powder Extreme.</li>
            <li> It has turned out to be a waste of money because it is so bad I will not even be able to continue using it.   </li>
            <li> Not worth it for the the money.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Elf version and find that it works just as well - and costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> like, half a penny</li>
            <li> and I was hopeful that somehow this was going to be comparable for less money.</li>
            <li> But, I knew spending less would get me less quality.</li>
            <li> I typically use this as a finish over my mineral makeup but it can be worn alone as well to minimize pores and control shine.</li>
            <li> In a dull dry skin way.</li>
            <li> but little did I know</li>
            <li> Do not use too little either.</li>
            <li> i decided not to keep it because product was wasted and so was my money.</li>
            <li> i thought it was a little bit small</li>
            <li> and I applied very little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive than some other name brand HD powders.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time lining it up to screw</li>
            <li> I am hardly the expert at applying it.</li>
            <li> Worst part is my face has some spots oily and others normal, dry, and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> ; this made them worse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong purchasing this.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a bit difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> This was useless.</li>
            <li> I came in a really bad packagaing and I couldn&#x27;t turn the plastic thing to get the powder out, I had to take cut it opend with a knife.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and this stuff made even my expensive makeup look terrible.</li>
            <li> In my below I was disappointed because there was no product information or method of application like the puff shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> BAD IDEA!</li>
            <li> The container, however, is really bad!  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, it looks just horrible over foundation.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It arrived today. I have used it in place of the more expensive brand from Sephora. It looks and performs exactly the same way as the other brand that I used to splurge on. Why pay more?</li>
            <li> My products arrived in only a few days from US to Ireland at standard post charges exactly as described and ordered and in perfect condition. Im delighted-will use you again.Powder is really good too. Not obviously on skin but mattefying.Many Thanks</li>
            <li> Anyone with large pores or fine lines would do well to purchase this product.  MF&#x27;s version is no better than this version, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper.  I have pores that could house a family of 4, soooo....I know what I&#x27;m talking about here.  You only need a little bit to really do your whole face.  Also, they have the little turnkey style top so that you can close it up and open it only when in use, which is a great thing to have for a powder.  That way, when you carry it in your purse, it doesn&#x27;t spill out when opened.  This covers great, covers big pores, and is really the best powder I think I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very oily skin, and it seems to really keep that in check.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong purchasing this.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic, smooth, truly translucent matte finishing powder that doesn&#x27;t turn my olive skin to an ashy looking hue. The packaging is so brilliant, that once you screw off the lid, there&#x27;s a plastic knob you turn, and then you can shake out the powder that you need without it going everywhere in a huge dust cloud whenever you take off the lid. This second safety lid sealing in the powder, and its cute size, meant I immediately ordered a second one for my purse with no worries of it spilling. I rarely wear compact powders because they frequently have oils and other binders which break my skin out. Usually, I just carry blotting papers, but depending on where I am, I now have a choice about how I&#x27;ll deal with any mid day shine. This product gives me, no breakouts, no mess, a reasonable price, fast shipping, professional service, and the most gorgeous finish to my Nars foundation ever. It&#x27;s a true win/win!</li>
            <li> It looks fantastic in person, but photographs white.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I also purchased the Elf version and find that it works just as well - and costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> Its perfect!  The only thing is --- don&#x27;t believe that it has enough product in it to last for 90 days.  You only need a little bit of it, I will agree but, you are going to use it up long before 90 days have passed.</li>
            <li> Had purchased the trail of Make Up For Ever HD Microfinish Powder after a recommendation and it worked great, but needed more so I bought this and it works just as well, at a fraction of the price. Great and quick way to get rid of that oily skin... it&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Extreme Closeup HD High Definition MIneral Finishing Powder Makeup 8g/.28oz, which like it says, compares to the Make up for Ever HD microfinish Powder.)&lt;br /&gt;This product took about 4-6 days to ship to me. I have been using the product for about a month now and i COMPLETELY LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;Not only does the product keep my make up on pretty much the entire day, give or take the last few hours of the day, it smells HEAVENLY.&lt;br /&gt;When applying this product, I discovered you only need a small amount to cover your WHOLE face, EX: like, half a penny amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommened buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this Review helped some one out there in syber space (:&lt;br /&gt;Have a great day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEWJUNKIE &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at this product, you may be comparing it with Make Up Forever&#x27;s version. I personally have not owned Make Up Foerver&#x27;s (MUFE) version but I have tried it at the mall and seemed to work, but then again I didn&#x27;t purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really wear make up but I heard this helps a lot with oil control. With the guidance of my sister, I have put it on just fine, not too much  nor little.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it works for a very very very short period (say picture taking). After 4 hours may face seemed to compensate by going extremely oily. Worst part is my face has some spots oily and others normal, dry, and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;And of course, it is possible that it only does that to me and not you.</li>
            <li> This powder makes your pores less visible, sets your makeup and makes your skin feel velvety soft. I only gave this three stars because the more expensive one at Sephora seems to work a bit better. This is good for half the price though.</li>
            <li> I have used Smashbox Photo Finish and MUFE and I was hopeful that somehow this was going to be comparable for less money. No. It has turned out to be a waste of money because it is so bad I will not even be able to continue using it.   Imagine dusting corn starch on your face. This powder is drying, and not very finely milled - so it actually feels and looks grainy on your face even after buffing. It leaves your face matte, sure, but not in a good way. In a dull dry skin way. And I don&#x27;t have dry skin.   Can&#x27;t recommend. Smashbox and MUFE are both lovely finishing powders, and Smashbox&#x27;s has SPF. Those are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this is actually my first time trying a mineral finishing powder i love it at first i thought it was a little bit small but after using it a couple time i love it, it leaves my face super super soft and matte and i came to find out a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I made an error when purchasing this powder, I thought it was another brand. I gave this to a friend who states she loves it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft &amp; finished.</li>
            <li> I have never used any type of powder over my foundation until I bought this.  I love it!  Your makeup stays on longer and my favorite thing is it keeps my face less oily!  The powder is so soft and even gives your face a &#x27;softened&#x27; look when u wear it over your foundation.  I forgot to wear it one day and wondered why my face felt so oily.  Then I realized I forgot to put my powder on.  My only complaints are it is very messy if you spill it, and the little tray thing under the lid has come off twice and resulted in a big mess.  I&#x27;m more careful when I use it and make sure the lid is on tight so it doesn&#x27;t spill!  I&#x27;ve used this powder for 5 months almost every day.  Even after spilling it twice I have a lot left!  Great value!</li>
            <li> Love this powder. If you want something light on the face but keeps your makeup on all day, get this product. It&#x27;s just like the other products but much cheaper. I had the makeup forever high definition powder and this powder is just as amazing but much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;I have an only forehead and with putting this powder on in the beginning of my day my face lasts non oily all day and its great. My skin looks perfect (and it is far from it)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get the substitute. This is it</li>
            <li> My skin has become rough with larger pores as I have aged, but this makes my skin look nearly flawless and feels great.  Other powders seem to clump and look oily after a few hours, but this is truly remarkable for those of us with less than perfect skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product I will definitely recommended this to anyone that has oily t-zones as myself.  When I am done putting my foundation on I dab some HD def mineral finishing powder on my face and I am good to go for the day great product!</li>
            <li> I use the Make up Forever Face and Body Liquid Make-up as I am lucky enough to need only light coverage and a bit of the finishing powder finishes off the look very nicely.</li>
            <li> Currently in a desert, so I pile on the moisturizer day and night. This covers shine and is fantastic at oil control without getting clumpy. Very light and sheer. I liked this so much, I went back to the Sheer Miracle vendor and bought the 4 piece sampler.</li>
            <li> Good to save money over pricey brands. I will buy again. Great for pores</li>
            <li> Not worth it for the the money.</li>
            <li> SUPER MESSY LOL but that is okay....it is not like the makeup forever one...it smells kind of funny and is a little bit different consistency but i have to say since the micro hd from makeup forever seems to be discontinued this is a great thing.</li>
            <li> Bought this powder thinking it was makeup forever powder but little did I know in brackets it said like makeup forever powder, didn&#x27;t really like it. I came in a really bad packagaing and I couldn&#x27;t turn the plastic thing to get the powder out, I had to take cut it opend with a knife. The product gets everywhere is was not hd at all, it did help with creasing underneath the eye tho</li>
            <li> Made my face look like I had just eaten a powdered donut with my forehead. Makes your skin feel soft, but doesn&#x27;t work for people with pink skin undertones.</li>
            <li> Use this sparingly and it is a wonderful matte powder to keep the shine at bay. Your face has to be well hydrated first, and you have to use a fluffy brush to apply the powder, but if you do, this powder does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t care for this stuff. I&#x27;ve used all types of powder and such, and I am experienced with makeup. I have oily skin, and this stuff made even my expensive makeup look terrible. It&#x27;s extremely drying, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish. This might work great for someone that only wears this and no foundation to mat down shiny skin. In my opinion, it looks just horrible over foundation.</li>
            <li> Makes my face look chalky ....not a huge fan but it isn&#x27;t terrible. Gives a nice matte finish just doesn&#x27;t blurr or smooth my skin like I hoped</li>
            <li> Not a fan, have not seen any benefit and very drying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this powder. Perfect finish, even application, lasts for hours. Every bit as good as I found Makeup Forever to be.&lt;br /&gt;However, the cap fits the container somewhat improperly. I have a hard time lining it up to screw it shut, so often I lose a bit in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I have no intention of not re-buying this product when I&#x27;ve run out of it. Recommended, but be careful with the lid!</li>
            <li> This product is just no big deal!  My pores did not look greatly improved like I expected.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me.    Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  Service was GREAT with this company.</li>
            <li> Very good product for a finish powder, highly reccommend</li>
            <li> this leaked in side of the package as i had just opened it...i decided not to keep it because product was wasted and so was my money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I really didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference!!! It does! I am a photographer and this makes skin look flawless without the concern of skin looking ghostly/ashy! Love it! Will buy more!</li>
            <li> I suppose since this type of detailed make up becomes very expesive this is an okay price for the amount that is in the jar. I purchased this one after reading great reviews and how it&#x27;s just like a much more expensive veriosn of HD powder. The finish on my face is silky smooth but gives me almost a ghostly powder coating. Maybe I&#x27;m using to much? It is hard to control the amount however with the jar letting much more than nessecary overflow into the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue witht his make up is that it burns my eyes and nose if I happen to breathe within a minute of application . And don&#x27;t breathe through your mouth you can taste it and it tastes/smells like I described (and no i&#x27;m not breathing in during the application around my mouth and nose of course). It is sort of hard to keep it from getting in the air around you when applying as it&#x27;s so fine and the container does not keep the bulk of the power where it should be when your not using it so you end up with more than you needed in you brush (having this in a makeup bag might not be best).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a try at a different product since I am new to finishing powders, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this one again as I don&#x27;t think beauty should smell funny lol. However, I did find that Tart from Sephora also has a version of finishing powder that doesn&#x27;t smell like this one&#x27;s odd burnt talcm powder, and has about the same consistancy if that helps anyone :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright . And gets everywhere if spilled!! But fun to have . I can&#x27;t tell if it does anything for my face honestly .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> This mineral finishing powder goes a very very long way. I don&#x27;t use too much of it when I finish applying makeup. It does not do very much for my skin; although my skin does feel softer, I don&#x27;t think it does anything for the appearance. I have a tan complexion and I feel like this powder does not blend well, and my skin looks a bit powdery. I&#x27;m sure it works better for a lighter complexion.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, but I love makeup forever&#x27;s version of this product. Because this product was so much cheaper I thought I would give it a dry. BAD IDEA! Every time I put it on my skin would get all dry and flaky. I tried switching primers, moisturizers, and foundations. No matter what I did as long as this product was on my face the result was always the same. I decided to switch back to make up forever and have not had this problem anymore. I would not recommend this product to folks with dry skin. I gave this product two stars instead of one, because if it actually does work for you, its a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product 2wice already and I love it.! It totally takes the shine away from when I put it over my foundation doesn&#x27;t look chalky at all I will continue buying this product.! Comes Ina cute little clear container brush not included which was not a problem :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. The only powder that helps tone down my oily skin is Makeup HD forever. This is the same stuff, just a generic brand and about half the price. Definitely recommend for oily skin!</li>
            <li> Best thing to control oily skin I have found so far and my skin is extremely oily. Now I can wear makeup and it last, I wouldnt even bother wearing it without this powder. Works as well as the more expensive HD powders.</li>
            <li> Best finishing powder I think I have ever used! It made my skin look flawless and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or weighed down. It caused me no skin irritations what so ever. I love it!</li>
            <li> I will be a repeat customer on this product. G8 bang for the buck! Had been using BAre Minerals Finishing Powder but this one absorbs excess oil from face unbelievabl better than BM. Its made with silica which absorbs oil so different usage unlike BM which is just a finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be deceived by the color, the white, disappears upon putting it on as it absorbs the natural oils from face. Use it as a finishing powder not a color powder.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s ok, not UD quality though, by any means! But, I knew spending less would get me less quality. I don&#x27;t think it blended the imperfections like UD does, it did help with providing a matte finish though.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a good finishing powder, and I found the one! This really is the best finishing powder. It goes on great and makes your face look flawless! Not to mention it came super fast!</li>
            <li> 01/02/13: I promised to provide an update after using the product for a while. In my below I was disappointed because there was no product information or method of application like the puff shown in the picture. This stuff is very subtle providing a light sheen wherever applied. I like to use it on shoulders, face, and arms. It&#x27;s easy to apply too much it is tough to remove and looks obvious without blending well into the skin tone. On this product less is more. -That&#x27;s why the inclusion of a puff as in the picture would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just me as I confess that while I like wearing make up I am hardly the expert at applying it. I had expected from the picture that the product would come with a puff or some method of application. No big deal- I have brushes I can use. However, there was no product information either. No instructions at all on how to use it and nothing on dos and don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say it looks very sparkly and pretty in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I use it a while I&#x27;ll update on my experiences with it.</li>
            <li> Do not use too much! Do not use too little either. There is a perfect balance you have to find when applying this. If I let my MyChelle Ivory stick (cream-like, but a solid) foundation dry fully first, this goes on a lot better. It&#x27;s important to use a tiny amount at a time and blend it in over as much area as possible before putting more on the brush. It does spread really well, but the problem is that you can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s spreading to. I normally have to feel where I just applied it to see what feels powdery smooth and what still feels sticky from foundation. If you use too much, it does start turning you white, but with the perfect amount it goes on like it&#x27;s invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin can get pretty oily, but I&#x27;m able to wear this all day long without looking shiny. That&#x27;s a first, because I&#x27;m used to applying more powder halfway through the day to avoid too much shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves the skin feeling really soft, but doesn&#x27;t cover up the benefits of your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! But it&#x27;s a bit difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> This product is very similar to the HD Microfinish Powder by MAKE UP FOR EVER. For the price it is a worthy investment, but I think the MAKE UP FOR EVER product works a bit better.</li>
            <li> The powder is nice, but nothing special.  The container, however, is really bad!  I would advise against getting this product, better to pay more and get a product in a usable container</li>
            <li> I HAVE SUPER OILY SKIN. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER OWNED. I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of the name brand cosmetics for a long time. But I had seen an article in Cosmo about products that are the same formulas, but a fraction of the cost. This is one of those products! I can&#x27;t believe...there is NO DIFFERENCE, except this is only $16.50 and the name brand stuff is over $30.00! Fast shipper and the container looks the same! I&#x27;m sold!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now and I love it. Was inexpensive but works just as good as Mac. I have oily skin so this stuff is a life saver. Stays all night</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I tried this product. It is fantastic!!! I typically use this as a finish over my mineral makeup but it can be worn alone as well to minimize pores and control shine. I have very oily skin and large pores but this really makes my skin look smooth and flawless and helps control oil throughout the day. A little goes a long way. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty devoted Make Up Forever fan, but this product is so much less expensive and works exactly the same that I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy the Make Up Forever product.</li>
            <li> This was useless. It made my skin look awful. Did not work as seller states &amp;#34;Less visible pores and fine lines&amp;#34; this made them worse. It felt and looked as if I had some type of gunk on my face and I applied very little. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for oily, larger pore skin. I sometimes mix it with powder that has some color. Very silky. I&#x27;ve bought this one before. It&#x27;s less expensive than some other name brand HD powders.</li>
            <li> I recommend HD high definition mineral finishing powder makeap  ! IT WORKS , !  I used it for my daughter&amp;#34;s prom makeup &amp; her 2 friends they all LOVED it too . thank you !!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product alone. I actually mixed it with my other face powder-[[ASIN:B001SZ1NUW CoverGirl Trublend Minerals Loose Powder,  Translucent Fair 405,  0.63-Ounce]] and it adds a wonderful glow to my powder. I believe I read that in another review of mixing this product with another and it worked for me. And it also extends the life of the Mineral Powder Extreme. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Has a sort of gritty feel to it that isn&#x27;t very nice but it does give a nice matte appearance to skin.</li>
