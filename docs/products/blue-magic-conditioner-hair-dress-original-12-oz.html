            <li>/&gt;4)Dipped my hand in the Blue Magic Hair Dress to place the product on my finger tips</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Blue Magic.  </li>
            <li>First off, I wanted to let everyone know</li>
            <li>grew up on blue magic</li>
            <li>my mom Been using this blue magic Conditioner on me since i was 5 and up</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I need to protect my hair when I swim and go to the beach.  </li>
            <li>but it grassy and have my hair flat most of the time because</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is way better than dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use the BM Bergermot (green colored) and love it!</li>
            <li>The curl pattern for my twist out lasted for a whole week.</li>
            <li>I really describe this product.  </li>
            <li>A word of caution, don&#x27;t use too much in your bangs or they tend to look greasy.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BM my hair is soft, manageable and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do those high priced natural hair products because they do not keep my natural hair soft and moisturized like BM.</li>
            <li>i really do see it works my hair get dry fast</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length natural hair (4 C).</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m natural and it is $2.66 at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Works like the old school hair dress your Grandma used.</li>
            <li>and now i am in adult (Africa america)</li>
            <li>Makes me think about all the ridiculous things some natural women are doing buying so many products that don&#x27;t work and complaining about breakage and split ends.</li>
            <li>I am an older white woman</li>
            <li>But I looked today and I can barely find any split ends!</li>
            <li>I knew going back to the old school methods would work.</li>
            <li>of all, it works just as good as expensive pomades, but at a fraction of the price!</li>

            <li> so only a little is needed and it last a long time</li>
            <li> I now use it on my children&#x27;s hair and I will continue to use this as long as they continue to make it!</li>
            <li> Let my hair air dry over night&lt;</li>
            <li> I put about a dime size amount on my dry hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> so your scalp wont be too dry</li>
            <li> I bought it at Walmart a while ago for less than $3.00 when I was relaxed and recently priced it as I will need to buy another one now</li>
            <li> I work out a lot and my hair gets very dry</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to apply it again for the next few days.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been trying this for two days and my hair went from incredibly dry to shiny, less split endsy (noticeable ones anyway) and it looks healthier.</li>
            <li> little of this product goes a long way, and I adore it.</li>
            <li> I live on the Big Island and sometimes it is difficult finding items you want.</li>
            <li> Like the reviewers who use it on hair, a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that (having naturally straight hair) when my hair is curly from braids or wavy, and I use this, the curls are still there the next day, rather than having an awkward pony tail mark in the morning.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair moisturized and soft for at least 2 to 3 days!</li>
            <li> have all natural hair, very thick, kinky, curly, and everything in between.</li>
            <li> If you have callicks like me, this stuff gives you the ability to lay &#x27;em down</li>
            <li> I received it undamaged and wrapped tight and intact.......</li>
            <li> Weighs your hair down and keeps things in place without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> I am shocked because last week I dyed my hair medium brown, hated it and a few days ago I bleached my hair back, toned it and did this process without a hair cut or a strong deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will say this is not something you put in everyday as it gets a build up.  </li>
            <li> Incase ya&#x27;ll want to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Relieves chafed areas, dried areas, itchy places</li>
            <li> Been using this stiff for years.</li>
            <li> Took a small portion of my hair that I plan to twist</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a thick hair oil</li>
            <li> I figured my hair would be unhealthy for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I stopped for awhile due articles stating hair grease clogs hair follicles, this stunting hair growth and suffocating the strands.</li>
            <li> I have very thick</li>
            <li> It caught my eye when looking for moisturizers for a baby with infantile eczema.  </li>

            <li> Thank you for this product. I live on the Big Island and sometimes it is difficult finding items you want. I looked for this everywhere and could not find it. Finally, there it was online.... thank you... the price was right, the shipping was fast and easy. I received it undamaged and wrapped tight and intact....... Appreciate  you very much</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length natural hair (4 C). This product really brought out the natural coils of my hair and provided it with a healthy shine. The curl pattern for my twist out lasted for a whole week. Here is the process that I used:&lt;br /&gt;1) Washed and conditioned my hair&lt;br /&gt;2) Separated my hair into 4 sections&lt;br /&gt;3) Took a small portion of my hair that I plan to twist&lt;br /&gt;4)Dipped my hand in the Blue Magic Hair Dress to place the product on my finger tips&lt;br /&gt;5) Proceeded to perform a two strand twist and made sure that the product was on the twist&lt;br /&gt;6) Let my hair air dry over night&lt;br /&gt;7) Untwisted my hair in the morning</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair dressing  that keeps hair in order and makes it easier to comb after washing. It is used for Afro-American hair and  has been on the market for many years.  You can count on it to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Blue Magic.  Need I really describe this product.  It works well for me and always have!  I will say this is not something you put in everyday as it gets a build up.  Great for occasional application.</li>
            <li> I use the BM Bergermot (green colored) and love it! I bought it at Walmart a while ago for less than $3.00 when I was relaxed and recently priced it as I will need to buy another one now that I&#x27;m natural and it is $2.66 at Walmart. I originally first used it when I was relaxed and now that I&#x27;m natural I&#x27;m back to using it again and it works just as great as it did when I was relaxed. I don&#x27;t do those high priced natural hair products because they do not keep my natural hair soft and moisturized like BM. I work out a lot and my hair gets very dry but BM solves that problem. Thanks to BM my hair is soft, manageable and moisturized.</li>
            <li> this was a purchase for my mother not me, however she likes it, used product in the past, this is her first order through amazon she&#x27;s impressed would buy again.</li>
            <li> this is a good hair dress for people like me who need something good for their hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has ever provided sufficient moisture to my 4b naps. I have tried almost everything. I knew going back to the old school methods would work. This keeps my hair moisturized and soft for at least 2 to 3 days! I put just a tiny spread in my hands, dilute with water and apply to 1 section of my hair and repeat and do the next 4 to 5. I won&#x27;t have to apply it again for the next few days. And contrary to popular belief, this DOES wash out. My hair has made such an improvement in every area. I have a simple regime now. I co-wash only and apply this and I&#x27;m done. Makes me think about all the ridiculous things some natural women are doing buying so many products that don&#x27;t work and complaining about breakage and split ends. If they used this, they wouldn&#x27;t have those problems and definitely wouldn&#x27;t need gimmicks like kinky kurly or shea moisture.</li>
            <li> It is good, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen results yet.&lt;br /&gt;I think It may be too soon.&lt;br /&gt;price was good.</li>
            <li> Works like the old school hair dress your Grandma used.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dress for women of color  One can do most anything with it&lt;br /&gt;It is a thick hair oil so only a little is needed and it last a long time</li>
            <li> First off, I wanted to let everyone know this is only $1.93 at Walgreens! Incase ya&#x27;ll want to save a few bucks. So I&#x27;ve been trying this for two days and my hair went from incredibly dry to shiny, less split endsy (noticeable ones anyway) and it looks healthier. I&#x27;ve had a lot of people comment that it looks great. I am shocked because last week I dyed my hair medium brown, hated it and a few days ago I bleached my hair back, toned it and did this process without a hair cut or a strong deep conditioner. I figured my hair would be unhealthy for a few weeks. But I looked today and I can barely find any split ends! I am thrilled to have this and like I said everybody, it&#x27;s $1.93 at Walgreens. SOOO worth it! A word of caution, don&#x27;t use too much in your bangs or they tend to look greasy. I put about a dime size amount on my dry hair and scalp. In my opinion this is way better than dry shampoo. I also noticed that (having naturally straight hair) when my hair is curly from braids or wavy, and I use this, the curls are still there the next day, rather than having an awkward pony tail mark in the morning. LOVE THIS STUFF! :)</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying &amp;#34;I grew up on blue magic hair grease!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have all natural hair, very thick, kinky, curly, and everything in between. My hair is below my bra strap... Let me remind you I have very thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this product goes a long way, and I adore it. I stopped for awhile due articles stating hair grease clogs hair follicles, this stunting hair growth and suffocating the strands. NOOOOOW articles are saying they are good for your hair, well I grew up on hair grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it worked then it will work now!!! I will have a later update.</li>
            <li> my mom Been using this blue magic Conditioner on me since i was 5 and up and now i am in adult (Africa america) i really do see it works my hair get dry fast but it grassy and have my hair flat most of the time because sometimes i over do it but it works i still have it now it magic in my hair i say buy it worth the money</li>
            <li> Oily, Very Oily , great for dry hair though. If you were going to get a swe in or something i would recommend this for you scalp so your scalp wont be too dry</li>
            <li> This product is made of petrolatum and coconut oil and fragrance, smells like coconut.  It caught my eye when looking for moisturizers for a baby with infantile eczema.  It was $2.97 in a grocery store:) so I bought it.  I am an older white woman so haven&#x27;t used it on hair- but it is very soothing to irritated skin anywhere, and very safe.  It helps seal moisture in skin when applied sparingly after bathing, and then acts as a barrier.  Relieves chafed areas, dried areas, itchy places and I use it to remove eye makeup as well.  Like the reviewers who use it on hair, a little goes a very long way.  The granddaughter with eczema has largely outgrown it, but when babies get colds and snotty noses this Magic applied on a tissue removes nose crusties without tears.  It spreads more easily than either ingredient alone.  Who knows- I might try it as a hair conditioner!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I need to protect my hair when I swim and go to the beach.  Then when I wash my hair, I experience a quick recovery to healthy hair again.  It&#x27;s a great protectant and guard for hair!</li>
            <li> I grew up on this grease as well and I see why my family loved it. I now use it on my children&#x27;s hair and I will continue to use this as long as they continue to make it!</li>
            <li> my husband loves this product</li>
            <li> This is one of the staple hair products in my families arsenal......we style hair with water and grease in childhood and it worked wonderfully conditioning it, adding moisture, and sheen......</li>
            <li> Been using this stiff for years. I basically use it as pomade to get a nice pompadour going. Weighs your hair down and keeps things in place without making it stiff. If you have callicks like me, this stuff gives you the ability to lay &#x27;em down flat!&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it works just as good as expensive pomades, but at a fraction of the price!</li>
