            <li>I am glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li>I bouth this for my husband, and I have to say that even with the awesome reviews that have, I was a little exceptical about it, but I found that works perfect and is pretty safe to use</li>
            <li>Works better than cheaper models.</li>
            <li>yes I love this</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>Removes the excess callous wonderfully and leaves enough there to still have protection.</li>
            <li>, I will buy one more for my father soon.</li>
            <li>, i was able to repeat over and over with each.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>These work great and have completely shaved off all of my calluses!  </li>
            <li>Quickly shipped!</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman Callus Remover is very easy to use and delivers the exact results that I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>My mom has a hereditary condition where she grows huge callouses on the palms of her hands and soles of her feet -- even on non-pressure points.</li>
            <li>This keeps your hands callus free, and no blisters with nothing to rub against.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>With the walmart ones there is more room and nice big chunks of callus</li>
            <li>Some reviews of this item said it would not have that problem and thankfully my hands are still useful.</li>
            <li>exactly rusted was the rasp attachment.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t take all the callus out.</li>
            <li>With the idea of having a razor blade in the product I was very apprehensive,&lt;br /&gt;however</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>in all honesty, i was really nervous about buying one of these because i looked through a million callus removers and the reviews scared me.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does exactly what is expected.</li>
            <li>i was so excited when it came to my house that i only soaked my feet for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have problems with calluses on my hands, particularly after sets of lots of pullups.</li>
            <li>After clipping off my huge calluses with toenail clippers for years and mangling my feet in the process, I finally thought I would try something different.  </li>
            <li>had felt the same way at first</li>
            <li>I find myself shaving some and then turning it around to clear off the skin chunks and then going back to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be careful how much you shave off.</li>
            <li>not work nearly as well for big calluses as the 3.00 ones from wal-mart.  </li>
            <li>It is aseparate piece that you click into the shaver and although its housing is plastic, it apparently still rusts on one end...</li>
            <li>only problem was it was confusing how to take out the blade, but now i know its extremely easy.</li>

            <li> only problem was it was confusing how to take out the blade, but now i know its extremely easy.</li>
            <li> Completely repaired my dry rough heels.</li>
            <li> I have had a cheaper version of this in the past, but put too much pressure on it and broke it in half (plus, it was old and probably brittle).  </li>
            <li> The Tweezerman Callus remover worked well enough - although I have to use on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using them on dry skin if you have major calluses I tried it on wet skin</li>
            <li> i had such rough feet that nothing i did would work.</li>
            <li> and it will come loose.</li>
            <li> The blade seems plenty sharp as long as you use it as soon as getting out of a shower.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t this huge exposed blade as I was originally afraid of.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my feet as well as my hands where lots of rough skin&lt;br /&gt;has accumulated over the years.</li>
            <li> instead it just piles on  and becomes so rough.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think it would since it is supposed to be used on feet after it as been wet with water</li>
            <li> the space between the handle and blade is too small with the tweezerman which means only teeny wisps of callus come off.  </li>
            <li> i should have waited till i took a shower so my feet would have been soaked longer, but even only soaking them for 10 minutes the dead skin was falling off!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly I didn&#x27;t detach it after use so the rust ran down into the shaver leaving its rusty stain on the blade, the blade holder and the shaver itself...</li>
            <li> Maybe this is a problem with other shavers as well, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> But after using it a few times, you&#x27;ll def have baby butt feet</li>
            <li> My only knock is that the skin seems to accumulate behind the blade.</li>
            <li> Had on previously lost, Had to replace!</li>
            <li> She used to use old-fashioned razor blades, but used to cut herself pretty badly.</li>
            <li> I neded a new Tweeze badly.</li>
            <li> When the blade got dull I followed the instructions at http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-Comfort-Callus-Shaver-Rasp/dp/B003BMNHEU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355591124&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;tweezerman+callus+shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> noticed that some complained of how they couldn&#x27;t get the blade</li>
            <li> Instructions not really good on how to expose blade, but not that hard to figure out.</li>
            <li> im serious.</li>
            <li> I was afraid after reading reviews of other shavers that I would mangle my hands with one.</li>
            <li> or so it just feels like I&#x27;m cutting stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying because the razor is in an awkward position.</li>

            <li> I have problems with calluses on my hands, particularly after sets of lots of pullups. This keeps your hands callus free, and no blisters with nothing to rub against.</li>
            <li> Instructions made no sense and could not move blade to where it could shave off anything.  Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped! Just what I needed. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I neded a new Tweeze badly. This fits the bill for my family. Manis and pedis are performed twice a  month. It is best for me when I have the salon in my home. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> worked as stated. although still working on how to replace the razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality product.  Works better than cheaper models. If you are looking for a callus razor give this item a try.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t take all the callus out. It&#x27;s annoying because the razor is in an awkward position. But after using it a few times, you&#x27;ll def have baby butt feet</li>
            <li> I have had a cheaper version of this in the past, but put too much pressure on it and broke it in half (plus, it was old and probably brittle).  This version has a sturdier handle.  Just be careful how much you shave off.</li>
            <li> My mom has a hereditary condition where she grows huge callouses on the palms of her hands and soles of her feet -- even on non-pressure points. She used to use old-fashioned razor blades, but used to cut herself pretty badly.This shaver works like a dream.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman Callus Remover is very easy to use and delivers the exact results that I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I was afraid after reading reviews of other shavers that I would mangle my hands with one. Some reviews of this item said it would not have that problem and thankfully my hands are still useful. The blade seems plenty sharp as long as you use it as soon as getting out of a shower. If I wait even 10 minutes or so it just feels like I&#x27;m cutting stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be cut. My only knock is that the skin seems to accumulate behind the blade. Maybe this is a problem with other shavers as well, I&#x27;m not sure. I find myself shaving some and then turning it around to clear off the skin chunks and then going back to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with it and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting use to but once you get the hang of it, it works like a charm.  I also like the Emjoi for callus and corns.</li>
            <li> Wish I knew of your product earlier. I have used it on my feet as well as my hands where lots of rough skin&lt;br /&gt;has accumulated over the years. With the idea of having a razor blade in the product I was very apprehensive,&lt;br /&gt;however it is very gentle and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> this works wonders for mhy feet. yes I love this it gets all the callous off. I have hyperkeratosis. so my skin on my feet and hand don&#x27;t fall off. instead it just piles on  and becomes so rough. I love this.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was thrilled! Until I returned to the bathroom several hourse later and saw it had already rusted. Should come with a tetanus warning - yikes!</li>
            <li> After clipping off my huge calluses with toenail clippers for years and mangling my feet in the process, I finally thought I would try something different.  These work great and have completely shaved off all of my calluses!  I would recommend using them on dry skin if you have major calluses I tried it on wet skin and it didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not work nearly as well for big calluses as the 3.00 ones from wal-mart.  the space between the handle and blade is too small with the tweezerman which means only teeny wisps of callus come off.  With the walmart ones there is more room and nice big chunks of callus come peeling off like ribbon.</li>
            <li> Use it to maintain my hands from doing pull ups.  Removes the excess callous wonderfully and leaves enough there to still have protection.</li>
            <li> Had on previously lost, Had to replace!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does exactly what is expected. I thought I would be scared to use a razor on my heels but it isn&#x27;t this huge exposed blade as I was originally afraid of. It&#x27;s just enough to get the job done. I am glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> I bouth this for my husband, and I have to say that even with the awesome reviews that have, I was a little exceptical about it, but I found that works perfect and is pretty safe to use, I will buy one more for my father soon. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman Callus remover worked well enough - although I have to use on dry skin. When the blade got dull I followed the instructions at http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-Comfort-Callus-Shaver-Rasp/dp/B003BMNHEU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355591124&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;tweezerman+callus+shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I CANNOT GET THE TOP OFF!!</li>
            <li> Works well on foot calluses--well-pleased and would buy again.  Instructions not really good on how to expose blade, but not that hard to figure out.</li>
            <li> I used this once and then i couldn&#x27;t again because it rusted.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think it would since it is supposed to be used on feet after it as been wet with water but it did...&lt;br /&gt;What exactly rusted was the rasp attachment.  It is aseparate piece that you click into the shaver and although its housing is plastic, it apparently still rusts on one end... I&#x27;m guess that it is a defective one since the rust came from only on one end as if water got into the housing and rusty water was coming out of that end..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I didn&#x27;t detach it after use so the rust ran down into the shaver leaving its rusty stain on the blade, the blade holder and the shaver itself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think i&#x27;ll buy the one that doesn&#x27;t have a detachable rasp or have none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that some complained of how they couldn&#x27;t get the blade out.&lt;br /&gt;I had felt the same way at first but once I got it out the one time, i was able to repeat over and over with each.&lt;br /&gt;You have to read the direction which says to hold the side and push the shaver... do just that but with some controlled force and it will come loose.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Completely repaired my dry rough heels.</li>
            <li> i cant believe how well this worked. in all honesty, i was really nervous about buying one of these because i looked through a million callus removers and the reviews scared me. the reason i bought this was because it had the best views, and hey, $10 is pretty good. this was the greatest thing I&#x27;ve ever bought. i had such rough feet that nothing i did would work. but this, worked instantly!! i was so excited when it came to my house that i only soaked my feet for about 10 minutes. i should have waited till i took a shower so my feet would have been soaked longer, but even only soaking them for 10 minutes the dead skin was falling off! i don&#x27;t remember the last time i saw my feet like this! if you tried everything to help your feet,and they didn&#x27;t work, get this. im serious. it helped me a lot! only problem was it was confusing how to take out the blade, but now i know its extremely easy. had to look it up on YouTube, try it, it works.</li>
