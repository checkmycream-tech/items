            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find it cheaper anywhere else.</li>
            <li>My dad love this shampoo</li>
            <li>I used to shampoo with pureology, so this is much more affordable for the quality.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love Sebastian products</li>
            <li>After finishing the bottle I wasn&#x27;t able to get it again.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>About a month ago I ran out of my beloved Drench right before going on vacation.  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>best if you have dry hair, get the conditioner too.</li>
            <li>Shampoo perfect for dry hair, has moisturizing in it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for dry or colored hair.</li>
            <li>Great product for the sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Hair feels super healthy with it.  </li>
            <li>It would take me 2 months to go through a bottle of cheap shampoo, it took me almost a year to use up the 8oz bottle of Sebastian Drench (this review is for the 33oz one!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo and its companion moisturizing/conditioning product for several years and it is a great product</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller for doing such an awesome job.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair with this new bottle of Drench, my hair is back to smelling great, feeling silky smooth, looking shiny and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>AND it gets your hair clean and stuff.</li>
            <li>Good for fine long hair.</li>
            <li>Plus, the lather on this shampoo is very rich, so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>It is the first one to control my curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>So when someone told me about Sebastian Drench, I thought it was worth a try: a salon product at a price much more reasonable than B&amp;b.</li>
            <li>Fortunately she provided me with the first bottle</li>
            <li>frankly I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Great value, more expensive in a salon</li>
            <li>When I start the bottle, I think, \\&quot;wow, this stuff is fantastic on my hair!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>And from this company shipping and handling is amazingly fast!</li>
            <li>Since I wash my hair almost everyday I can trade off between the two for good results.  </li>
            <li>and I had most of my split ends trimmed shortly after I started using this shampoo, and so far, still pretty much split-end free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a third of the amount a $3-6 bottle of shampoo requires to clean my hair; money saved right there!</li>
            <li>They leave my hair soft and clean without that \\&quot;squeaky clean\\</li>
            <li>I am 100% positive it was the shampoo I purchased online.  </li>
            <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t really beat it.</li>
            <li>Can I really stomach another $55 on a bottle of shampoo?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I love this product and now through Amazon I can get it for less money.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have been using shimmer lights shampoo for a long time but since my hair is getting more gray in it I noticed that the shimmer lights is toning down the golden highlights too much and looking too gray.  </li>
            <li>With cheap shampoos I have to wash my hair every other day, with this</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit for a nice sheen and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair a little more moisturized than regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>my hair and my hair is soft and shiny looking,</li>
            <li>&quot; feeling that indicates you&#x27;ve stripped your hair of natural oils.</li>
            <li>and we don&#x27;t smell overtly masculine nor feminine.</li>
            <li>Short on time to make the drive to my salon to purchase another bottle, I jumped on Amazon.com to take advantage of my prime membership perks (free 2 day shipping) and a slightly lower price.  </li>
            <li>I normally purchase it in person from the salon I visit regularly.  </li>
            <li>We also have found it to be economical as you can use small portions to achieve results.</li>
            <li>have fine thin hair</li>

            <li> You only need a small amount to make massive amounts of suds and this does not strip or dry out your hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful folks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve splurged on Bumble and bumble a few times in my life, and one of those big bottles will run your between $50 and $60 bucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff, along with the awesomely thick Drench conditioner, for nearly a year.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference with other shampoos as soon as you finish lathering and rinsing; that so-squeaky-clean-it&#x27;s-tangled feeling just isn&#x27;t there.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I became very suspicious of the product I purchased online.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way (and I have very long, thick hair).</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my hair, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> so I do need a shampoo that will keep down the friz on the ends, but with no oily roots.  </li>
            <li> We have used this shampoo for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Not healthy and not shiny</li>
            <li> Even my scalp suffered horribly and become very tender and red.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my hair felt dry, brittle and had a weird chemical smell equivalent to the smell of gasoline.  </li>
            <li> My hair became unmanagable, dull and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> something I don&#x27;t think you get now (at least I don&#x27;t when I order now).</li>
            <li> It felt thick with buildup.  </li>
            <li> , I feel like I was sold a fake bottle of Sebastian Drench.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, I have experimented like crazy.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical that the product I bought here online is even legit.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t, until I once again get sick of the quality of Pantene or Aussie or</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My stylist recommended this shampoo and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months.  Excellent quality and lasts a long time.  Good for fine long hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian Drench Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner faithfully for about 2 years now and I absolutely love it.  I normally purchase it in person from the salon I visit regularly.  My hair is always silky smooth and great smelling and therefore I have no qualms about paying the money I do for it &#x27;cause frankly I think it&#x27;s worth it.  About a month ago I ran out of my beloved Drench right before going on vacation.  Short on time to make the drive to my salon to purchase another bottle, I jumped on Amazon.com to take advantage of my prime membership perks (free 2 day shipping) and a slightly lower price.  I was estatic when I received my bottle of Drench but after using it for some time I noticed my hair felt dry, brittle and had a weird chemical smell equivalent to the smell of gasoline.  My hair became unmanagable, dull and lifeless.  It felt thick with buildup.  Not healthy and not shiny (what I&#x27;m used to with Drench).  Needless to say, I became very suspicious of the product I purchased online.  Even my scalp suffered horribly and become very tender and red.  I experienced a tingly, burning sensation after every use.  Well, last night I decided I had enough of this bottle and went into the salon to purchase my shampoo in person.  After washing my hair with this new bottle of Drench, my hair is back to smelling great, feeling silky smooth, looking shiny and feeling healthy.  I am 100% positive it was the shampoo I purchased online.  Just a word to the wise, if you read the guarantee on the bottle, it says it&#x27;s only guaranteed when purchased from a licensed salon.  I am very skeptical that the product I bought here online is even legit.  After comparing the two bottles, I finally noticed the difference.  The bottle I purchased from the salon has a lot number/product number on the bottom of the bottle and the one I bought from Amazon does not.  Just be careful folks, I feel like I was sold a fake bottle of Sebastian Drench.  From no on, I&#x27;m purchasing Drench from my salon and I would advise you to do the same.</li>
            <li> I work out twice a day, and sweat (as lovely as that sounds) copiously.  Consequently, I have to shampoo twice a day.  I need a shampoo that won&#x27;t dry out my hair and this is the stuff.  Trust me, I have experimented like crazy.</li>
            <li> I love Sebastian Drench and I do not understand why I can not find it in California. Thanks to the seller for doing such an awesome job.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo here.  It has an awesome, thick lather and great smell.  Hair feels super healthy with it.  Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!  My hubby loves it too!</li>
            <li> Love it. Great product for the sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I save money and my hair looks healthy for days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a third of the amount a $3-6 bottle of shampoo requires to clean my hair; money saved right there! It would take me 2 months to go through a bottle of cheap shampoo, it took me almost a year to use up the 8oz bottle of Sebastian Drench (this review is for the 33oz one!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks healthy and shiny (but not greasy) for days. With cheap shampoos I have to wash my hair every other day, with this I can wait till day 3-4 if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells pleasant, but not overpowering, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING!!! Love this shampoo. Moisturizes my hair, without weighing it down. Great  price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product and now through Amazon I can get it for less money.  This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  I got the recommendation from a beautician.</li>
            <li> We have used this shampoo for about a year and a half. It is everything it is claimed to be. We also have found it to be economical as you can use small portions to achieve results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended by my stylist and I have been using it on color treated hair for two years now.  You only need a small amount to make massive amounts of suds and this does not strip or dry out your hair at all.  Also use the companion conditioner as I have very long hair and need that de-tangling effect.  Hope they never change the formula!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  It is the first one to control my curly, fine hair.My son uses it although his hair does not have the same texrue as mine.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. This is the best product out there. It makes my hair feel clean. I recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> It makes overworked hair look and behave like virgin hair,  I double process my hair and my hair is soft and shiny looking,</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and its companion moisturizing/conditioning product for several years and it is a great product</li>
            <li> This is great salon quality shampoo (&amp; conditioner) that has a pleasant scent. Haven&#x27;t been able to find it cheaper anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very good product for your hair!</li>
            <li> best shampoo for frizzy hair, use the conditioner aswell</li>
            <li> My dad love this shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair colorist recommended this product and I&#x27;ve been using it (and Sebastian&#x27;s conditioner) ever since.  Fortunately she provided me with the first bottle and it came with a pump...something I don&#x27;t think you get now (at least I don&#x27;t when I order now).</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves hair a little more moisturized than regular shampoos. For the price, you can&#x27;t really beat it. I used to shampoo with pureology, so this is much more affordable for the quality.</li>
            <li> Recommended by son&#x27;s hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo a lot because it moisturizes my hair without making it oily or limp.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine thin hair and I have to highlight it for body so I do need a shampoo that will keep down the friz on the ends, but with no oily roots.  I have been using shimmer lights shampoo for a long time but since my hair is getting more gray in it I noticed that the shimmer lights is toning down the golden highlights too much and looking too gray.  Since I wash my hair almost everyday I can trade off between the two for good results.  If I could only have one, I would pick the Drench.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve splurged on Bumble and bumble a few times in my life, and one of those big bottles will run your between $50 and $60 bucks. When I start the bottle, I think, \\&quot;wow, this stuff is fantastic on my hair!\\&quot; But when it&#x27;s time to replenish, I think, \\&quot;Oh jeez. Can I really stomach another $55 on a bottle of shampoo?\\&quot; So I don&#x27;t, until I once again get sick of the quality of Pantene or Aussie or whatever product I grabbed off the shelf at CVS. So when someone told me about Sebastian Drench, I thought it was worth a try: a salon product at a price much more reasonable than B&amp;b. And I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff, along with the awesomely thick Drench conditioner, for nearly a year. They leave my hair soft and clean without that \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feeling that indicates you&#x27;ve stripped your hair of natural oils. Plus, the lather on this shampoo is very rich, so you don&#x27;t need much. A little goes a long way (and I have very long, thick hair). Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love Sebastian products</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful.  You can feel the difference with other shampoos as soon as you finish lathering and rinsing; that so-squeaky-clean-it&#x27;s-tangled feeling just isn&#x27;t there.  I&#x27;ve got long hair and I had most of my split ends trimmed shortly after I started using this shampoo, and so far, still pretty much split-end free.</li>
            <li> I became aquainted with Drench from my hair salon.  After finishing the bottle I wasn&#x27;t able to get it again.  Both my daughter and I use it and my daughter has color treated hair.  Does a great jjob.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried!! It&#x27;s amazing, I wash my hair every 3 to 4 days and when it&#x27;s hair washing time this shampoo takes all the junk away!! And the conditioner is fab as well!! I will not be changing my shampoo/conditioner any time soon! Oh and did I mention it&#x27;s color safeeee yes!!! I totally recommend!!!!! ... And from this company shipping and handling is amazingly fast!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling shampoo ever. AND it gets your hair clean and stuff. Both my girlfriend and I use it and we don&#x27;t smell overtly masculine nor feminine. Just good. You should smell us.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Great value, more expensive in a salon</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best , I use Sebastian Treatment after shower ,  good for hair , keep the hair clean and shine .&lt;br /&gt;I received it on the time , excellent deal.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and needs extra moisturizer. This shampoo works great! You only need a little bit for a nice sheen and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Super transaction !!!  Good price and fast shipping !!!  Product was packaged well !!!! My wife loved the free samples !!!  THANK YOU !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> best if you have dry hair, get the conditioner too.</li>
            <li> Shampoo perfect for dry hair, has moisturizing in it. My beautician uses this in her salon and immediately I saw a difference in the shine in my hair. Excellent product for dry or colored hair.</li>
