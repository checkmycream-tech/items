            <li>VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE SELLER&#x27;S SHIPMENT TIME</li>
            <li>the color is a perfect tan.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned</li>
            <li>It would probably work great on darker skinned persons.</li>
            <li>Those are all the great things about this product and I have no negatives for the product its self</li>
            <li>This is a great solution.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>THE TAN CAME OUT GREAT</li>
            <li>It also helps that my husband paints cars for a living, so he has a great application</li>
            <li>and they were great.</li>
            <li>You put it, its great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s not orange at all, but a wonderful warm tanned colour.</li>
            <li>I really liked this lotion!  </li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for someone who is fair to medium skinned.</li>
            <li>is a good product, but dryes out greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good product would buy again</li>
            <li>Good stuff I have used it for years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and will order again.</li>
            <li>I like how quickly this product dries and it has a very pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased more than just this one from them and they are continually helpful!</li>
            <li>First the smell is wonderful and honestly even this morning you cant even smell it .</li>
            <li>so the application is perfect, but I am pretty sure any good airbrush gun would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and goes on great.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>Product has a great smell, came in the mail fast and works great in my Luminess air system.</li>
            <li>I liked the foot paddings, and the tent.</li>
            <li>Nice color,not orange.</li>
            <li>I would estimate it&#x27;s good for 30 or more sessions.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t appear orange at all just nice and bronzed</li>
            <li>I just used this today and it is by far the best out there.</li>
            <li>A very fine mist insures an even application.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a week to keep my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; going strong!</li>
            <li>Dries fast and smells good!</li>
            <li>Wish it produced more of a chocolate/medium brown color than a medium orange/brown color however.</li>
            <li>it really is more orangy than brown .</li>
            <li>It was just ok.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love the color.  </li>
            <li>(Safe too.)</li>
            <li>and you are able to cover everything evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I AM SURE</li>
            <li>best way,  I think, is to take a shower earlier and exfoliate and lotion.</li>
            <li>do more than one layer.</li>
            <li>I know it looks like you need to do more, but you don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I love this tanning color.</li>
            <li>AND WILL SEE IF THAT WORKS BETTER.</li>
            <li>I have try this more then once.</li>
            <li>You find alot better than this.</li>
            <li>And product washes out of clothing and most DHA solution</li>
            <li>have red hair with freckles so very fair skin hoping this will give me a nice&lt;br /&gt;dark</li>
            <li>Good shipping and fast.</li>
            <li>and I also received my package very quickly</li>
            <li>so my tan is hanging strong.  </li>
            <li>I found this product very good as long as you are patient and not rush the application.  </li>
            <li>First I want to say that this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Natural color..dries quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li>Loved the smell and dry time is amazing.</li>
            <li>The tent is huge.</li>
            <li>great for a lasting tan and sweating in the summer wont run on clothes .</li>
            <li>Nice :) be sure to prep skin properly.</li>
            <li>color always looks fantastic</li>
            <li>The color is very golden but can appear orange on some people skin.</li>
            <li>i was sooo excited to get this when i got home yesterday .</li>
            <li>Have tried a bunch of different solutions and I like this one the best so far!</li>
            <li>No streaks, if the color was more natural looking it would be wayyyy better.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and you only should use about 3 oz per application.</li>
            <li>I tried this (in a smaller size) and really loved the result-</li>
            <li>Also, the larger bottles are a good price as well.</li>
            <li>But it does smell a lot better that most solutions &amp; that is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>I used the PH balancer as well and that helped, but ultimately, I liked the other brad better.</li>
            <li>very natural, i just wish i had a better machine to spray it with.</li>
            <li>So the product is amazing just dont purchase it from the same company I did.</li>
            <li>I am fair-skinned and was instantly bronzed to a nice color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind I buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tan looks great for 5 days, you can get away with 7 days before your pale comes through</li>
            <li>I got started right away .</li>
            <li>I had to get it off right away, so I took a shower and some of the color still stayed on.</li>
            <li>Gives me good dark color.</li>
            <li>THIS DARK ONE WOULD BE GOOD FOR ANY TYPE OF COMPETITION (CHEERLEADING, FITNESS ETC...)</li>
            <li>just a very very light tan (I&#x27;m very white).</li>
            <li>Works good in my little airbrush gun.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase from this seller, the product is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>But Im gonna try some different approaches and see if it works better .</li>
            <li>Fast S&amp;H tracking included !</li>
            <li>I just wish it wasn&#x27;t as sticky, it&#x27;s not terribly sticky, just enough to notice it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>My first experience with airbrush tanning.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product, I used it with the glow gun...</li>
            <li>(and im fair skinned) and has no strong smell.</li>
            <li>Nice dark color no streaks and not orange.</li>
            <li>This tanning solution is nice, its dark but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking orange.</li>
            <li>good smell and easy to use, not as dark as i expected but satified over all with the product.</li>
            <li>more natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;The dark spray on color makes it easy to ensure that you don&#x27;t miss a spot</li>
            <li>Then you are fine to take a shower that next morning</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>i bought this solution with my Fusion Glow Air Gun (which is a whole nother story) .</li>
            <li>it is very brassy</li>
            <li>Drys really fast.</li>
            <li>But the gun was cheap looking, not only that, but the hose kept disconnecting from the each side, the button to turn the compressor on was pushed in all the way and</li>
            <li>it was a very believable, natural dark tan color.</li>
            <li>AND THAT PUT A BIG SMILE ON MY FACE WHEN MY ROOMATES HAD HANDED ME MY PACKAGE!  </li>
            <li>The solution if very dark which I love because I can see exactly where its goin to avoid streaking.</li>
            <li>takes a good 24 hours to see color but lasts long and not orange like other sprays.</li>
            <li>I do love that it has a slight tint to it</li>
            <li>bottle is much bigger because I paid more for medium/bronze (smaller bottle )&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brand</li>
            <li>If I am fresh out of the shower again, I will just wait until later to apply lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WITH THE NEW STUFF AND SPRAYED MYSELF WITH IT.  </li>
            <li>It looks very natural and not orange and it does&#x27;nt streak.</li>
            <li>I do fitness competitions and this is a very natural looking and bronze-y tanner.</li>
            <li>SO IT WILL DEFINITELY SAVE YOU SOME MONEY BECAUSE THIS SHOULD LAST FOR UP TO 9 TANS IF YOU DO FULL BODY AIRBRUSH TANS.</li>
            <li>Corp\\&quot; and it came wrapped very secure and even hard to unwrap</li>
            <li>Love the clear version I expected so much more with tinted and was really unhappy</li>
            <li>felt less tacky after treatment, surfaces dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it my look a little bloche in certain spots and look really dark, but wait about 8 hours and when you take a shower it looks like a real natural tan.</li>
            <li>I THOUGHT THE PRODUCT WAS A LITTLE ON THE PRICY SIDE AND HAVE NOT HAD ENOUGH TIME TO RATE THE ITEM&#x27;S QUALITY BECAUSE I HAVNT DONE AN ENTIRE FULL BODY AIRBRUSH</li>
            <li>Second it does not wash off which can be a huge plus and a negative .</li>
            <li>BUT MAY BE A LITTLE TOO INTENSE FOR DAILY WEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> If I am fresh out of the shower again, I will just wait until later to apply lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WITH THE NEW STUFF AND SPRAYED MYSELF WITH IT.  </li>
            <li> It looks very natural and not orange and it does&#x27;nt streak.</li>
            <li> I do fitness competitions and this is a very natural looking and bronze-y tanner.</li>
            <li> SO IT WILL DEFINITELY SAVE YOU SOME MONEY BECAUSE THIS SHOULD LAST FOR UP TO 9 TANS IF YOU DO FULL BODY AIRBRUSH TANS.</li>
            <li> Corp\\&quot; and it came wrapped very secure and even hard to unwrap</li>
            <li> Love the clear version I expected so much more with tinted and was really unhappy</li>
            <li> felt less tacky after treatment, surfaces dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it my look a little bloche in certain spots and look really dark, but wait about 8 hours and when you take a shower it looks like a real natural tan.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THE PRODUCT WAS A LITTLE ON THE PRICY SIDE AND HAVE NOT HAD ENOUGH TIME TO RATE THE ITEM&#x27;S QUALITY BECAUSE I HAVNT DONE AN ENTIRE FULL BODY AIRBRUSH</li>
            <li> Second it does not wash off which can be a huge plus and a negative .</li>
            <li> BUT MAY BE A LITTLE TOO INTENSE FOR DAILY WEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IF YOU USE THE VERSASPA, OR THE OTHER TANNING SPRAY MACHINES, OR IF YOU GET AIRBRUSHED AT THE TANNING SALON BY A PROFESSIONAL OR SOMEONE WORKING AS THE SPRAYER.  </li>
            <li> It was very hard to get it on right.</li>
            <li> solution is thick; pro very little &amp;#34;fogginess&amp;#34; when spraying, con it requires a bit more air pressure to push it through, slowing down the spray time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> if you yahoo her through yahoo images and put \\&quot;chantelle houghton orange,\\&quot; my color resembles the fourth picture where she is inside a car with a yellow and black dress...</li>
            <li> but once I finally got it open the seal was ripped off and about 1/4 of the product was missing.</li>
            <li> Other tanners wash off the second you get wet</li>
            <li> The only downside is it doesn&#x27;t get me as dark as I would like.</li>
            <li> It left them a little bit orange.</li>
            <li> I HAD A LITTLE LEFT FROM THE  COLOR  </li>
            <li> &amp; hopefully i like it after a couple tries .</li>
            <li> A few of my clients did not like the way it left their skin looking when it started to fade.</li>
            <li> IT CAME WAY BEFORE THE ITEM WAS EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED</li>
            <li> I tested it against the Norvell brand on my other leg and the Ocean brand came out slighter darker.</li>
            <li> I tan my face and neck almost every other day.  </li>
            <li> Thats a huge plus to not really have a bad smell at all .</li>
            <li> STAYS ON FOR A SOLID 5 DAYS, THEN STARTS TO SLOWLY COME OFF.</li>
            <li> but it still does a better&lt;br /&gt;job than other tanning lotions !</li>
            <li> It lasts about a week to a week and a half.</li>
            <li> MAY BE A LITTLE TOO DARK FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Still working on getting the legs and arms a little less patchy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much addicted to it!!</li>
            <li> I use disposable gloves and pour a little bit onto my skin and just rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> and you start to look a little lizard-y.</li>
            <li> They said that it was very hard to remove &amp; left their skin looking splotchy when trying to scrub it off.</li>
            <li> product goes on VERY dark, once set and rinsed</li>
            <li> and I tanned unevenly, and orange!</li>
            <li> hard to spread</li>
            <li> HARDLY</li>
            <li> When it fades it doesnt start to crack it just simply loses color.</li>
            <li> The color is where its not good .</li>
            <li> it was very hard to turn on and off...</li>
            <li> I do not use any sprayer because it is unhealthy to inhale.</li>
            <li> the hairnet is made of ultra thin fabric...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all FAKE.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant but you still smell like you just spray</li>
            <li> bad if you get it places</li>
            <li> Not too bad a smell.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t smell all that bad like the mystic tanning does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been sick as a dog all week</li>
            <li> im gonna wear gloves which i hate doing</li>
            <li> shows I do a base 2-3 days before then a coat the night before or morning of.</li>
            <li> &quot; FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> that nasty tan smell the lotions give off.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I will continue to purchase from this seller, the product is exactly what I want. I have purchased more than just this one from them and they are continually helpful!</li>
            <li> good smell and easy to use, not as dark as i expected but satified over all with the product. thanks</li>
            <li> Nice product. Pleasant smell. Wish it produced more of a chocolate/medium brown color than a medium orange/brown color however.</li>
            <li> i was sooo excited to get this when i got home yesterday . i bought this solution with my Fusion Glow Air Gun (which is a whole nother story) . I got started right away . First the smell is wonderful and honestly even this morning you cant even smell it . Thats a huge plus to not really have a bad smell at all . Second it does not wash off which can be a huge plus and a negative . Other tanners wash off the second you get wet but this does not wash off . great for a lasting tan and sweating in the summer wont run on clothes . bad if you get it places you dont want it like your hands and feet .    The color is where its not good . it really is more orangy than brown . My feet and hands are literatly orange . AND im not as tan as I want . I could definitally stand to be shades darker .    But Im gonna try some different approaches and see if it works better . 1. im gonna wear gloves which i hate doing thats why i switched to a spray instead of a lotion . AND my gun \\&quot;leaks\\&quot; sooo i have to wear gloves . 2. im gonna wear socks . since the spray constantly falls to the grownd your feet just keep collectiong the stuff layer after layer sooo it looks rediculous . sooo im thinking if i wear socks and gloves &amp; then just blend it in with a tanning lotion it will be perfect.  Im gonna shower and keep applying &amp; hopefully i like it after a couple tries . KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED .     Keep you posted .</li>
            <li> Love the clear version I expected so much more with tinted and was really unhappy it is very brassy</li>
            <li> It was just ok. I would not recommend it for someone who is fair to medium skinned. It left them a little bit orange. But it does smell a lot better that most solutions &amp; that is a definite plus. It would probably work great on darker skinned persons. A few of my clients did not like the way it left their skin looking when it started to fade. They said that it was very hard to remove &amp; left their skin looking splotchy when trying to scrub it off.</li>
            <li> Fast S&amp;H tracking included !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is much bigger because I paid more for medium/bronze (smaller bottle )&lt;br /&gt;I have red hair with freckles so very fair skin hoping this will give me a nice&lt;br /&gt;dark tan !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Ocean tan Solution at all times it would probably be a nicer tan with darker skin with my white skin it wears off after a couple days but it still does a better&lt;br /&gt;job than other tanning lotions !&lt;br /&gt;If you get it on your clothes or bedding it does wash off.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that this product is amazing. Not orangey color at all (and im fair skinned) and has no strong smell. When it fades it doesnt start to crack it just simply loses color. It lasts about a week to a week and a half. The solution if very dark which I love because I can see exactly where its goin to avoid streaking. Those are all the great things about this product and I have no negatives for the product its self BUT I purchased it from \\&quot;TCP Global Corp\\&quot; and it came wrapped very secure and even hard to unwrap but once I finally got it open the seal was ripped off and about 1/4 of the product was missing. So the product is amazing just dont purchase it from the same company I did.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion!  Like the smell and the color.  I am fair-skinned and was instantly bronzed to a nice color.  Got lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Dries fast and smells good! Doesn&#x27;t leave you looking orange. Have tried a bunch of different solutions and I like this one the best so far!</li>
            <li> I have to say this tanning solution is really great! It looks very natural and not orange and it does&#x27;nt streak. My fiance has an airbrush gun and applied it on me. When you first put it on it my look a little bloche in certain spots and look really dark, but wait about 8 hours and when you take a shower it looks like a real natural tan. My tan came out even all over. The smell is pleasant and you only should use about 3 oz per application.</li>
            <li> I like how quickly this product dries and it has a very pleasant smell.  The color is very golden but can appear orange on some people skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I am very fair skinned and it goes on wonderfully! Natural color..dries quickly and smells great. I&#x27;m pretty much addicted to it!!</li>
            <li> This is a great solution. I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s not orange at all, but a wonderful warm tanned colour. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t as sticky, it&#x27;s not terribly sticky, just enough to notice it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> its the best i have tryed it comes off splotchy but i think they all do and this one stays on all day when you are swimming usuall the chlorine washes the tan off but this one stays on</li>
            <li> Ocean spray tan solution 12.5% is the best! I do fitness competitions and this is a very natural looking and bronze-y tanner. Not orange at all. I like that it has enough bronzer to ensure even coat.for shows I do a base 2-3 days before then a coat the night before or morning of. Nice :) be sure to prep skin properly.</li>
            <li> My first experience with airbrush tanning.  I found this product very good as long as you are patient and not rush the application.  A very fine mist insures an even application.  Gives me good dark color. No orange.  I&#x27;m very satisfied and will order again.</li>
            <li> I tried this (in a smaller size) and really loved the result- it was a very believable, natural dark tan color. I tested it against the Norvell brand on my other leg and the Ocean brand came out slighter darker. I do not use any sprayer because it is unhealthy to inhale. I use disposable gloves and pour a little bit onto my skin and just rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again !</li>
            <li> liquid has not moisturizers in it.  hard to spread</li>
            <li> is a good product, but dryes out greasy.&lt;br /&gt;my clients like the smell . I probably  buy it again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only kind I buy. Drys really fast. Nice dark color no streaks and not orange.</li>
            <li> Great product. Nice color. Not too bad a smell.</li>
            <li> Product has a great smell, came in the mail fast and works great in my Luminess air system. The only downside is it doesn&#x27;t get me as dark as I would like.</li>
            <li> very natural, i just wish i had a better machine to spray it with. But over all, great tanner! And it doesn&#x27;t smell all that bad like the mystic tanning does.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product, I used it with the glow gun... It splattered everywhere... It was very hard to get it on right. I had to get it off right away, so I took a shower and some of the color still stayed on. It wasn&#x27;t an orangy color just a very very light tan (I&#x27;m very white). No streaks, somewhat of a funky tan smell in some areas of my body. I then bought the gun from TCP group, the package of 169.99... and well the bras and thongs are see-through.. the hairnet is made of ultra thin fabric...I liked the foot paddings, and the tent. The tent is huge. But the gun was cheap looking, not only that, but the hose kept disconnecting from the each side, the button to turn the compressor on was pushed in all the way and it was very hard to turn on and off...The gun never stays up, overall, it&#x27;s a hassle.... I tanned myself again using the same product and I tanned unevenly, and orange! My face didn&#x27;t take the color evenly, the color all over looks like the fur of an orangutan... No streaks, if the color was more natural looking it would be wayyyy better. Some areas of my body smell like that nasty tan smell the lotions give off.&lt;br /&gt;The color I turned is like chantelle houghtons... if you yahoo her through yahoo images and put \\&quot;chantelle houghton orange,\\&quot; my color resembles the fourth picture where she is inside a car with a yellow and black dress...</li>
            <li> I tan with what used to be my cake decorating airbrush gun.  I tan my face and neck almost every other day.  Still working on getting the legs and arms a little less patchy but I&#x27;m getting better.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color.  Its perfect if you have the skills to do it correctly.  Otherwise, any color is going to look stupid.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been sick as a dog all week so my tan is hanging strong.  People keep telling me, \\&quot;You look wonderful.\\&quot; FAKE!!! I tell them.  It&#x27;s all FAKE.  (Safe too.)</li>
            <li> I have been a home tanner with air brush for several years, call it an addiction!&lt;br /&gt;This product goes on VERY dark, once set and rinsed it is lighter more natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;The dark spray on color makes it easy to ensure that you don&#x27;t miss a spot and you are able to cover everything evenly.&lt;br /&gt;The solution is thick; pro very little &amp;#34;fogginess&amp;#34; when spraying, con it requires a bit more air pressure to push it through, slowing down the spray time.&lt;br /&gt;I felt less tacky after treatment, surfaces dry very quickly. The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant but you still smell like you just spray tanned.&lt;br /&gt;Tan looks great for 5 days, you can get away with 7 days before your pale comes through and you start to look a little lizard-y.</li>
            <li> takes a good 24 hours to see color but lasts long and not orange like other sprays. good product would buy again</li>
            <li> VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ORDER AND RECEIVING THE ORDER. SHIPPING WAS EXCELLENT BY THE TIME I WENT TO TRY TO TRACK IT, IT HAD ALREADY ARRIVED.  VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE SELLER&#x27;S SHIPMENT TIME BECAUSE THEY SENT IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER I HAD ORDERED IT.  HARDLY ANY WAIT TIME  IT CAME WAY BEFORE THE ITEM WAS EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED AND THAT PUT A BIG SMILE ON MY FACE WHEN MY ROOMATES HAD HANDED ME MY PACKAGE!  I WILL DEFINTELY ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.  I THOUGHT THE PRODUCT WAS A LITTLE ON THE PRICY SIDE AND HAVE NOT HAD ENOUGH TIME TO RATE THE ITEM&#x27;S QUALITY BECAUSE I HAVNT DONE AN ENTIRE FULL BODY AIRBRUSH WITH THE PRODUCT JUST YET.  I HAD A LITTLE LEFT FROM THE  COLOR  I GOT WITH THE SPRAY GUN.  SO I MIXED THAT WITH THE NEW STUFF AND SPRAYED MYSELF WITH IT.  THE TAN CAME OUT GREAT BUT THAT IS FROM COMBINING THE TWO MIXTURES TOGETER.  HOWEVER, I AM SURE THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS OF QUALITY BECAUSE IT WOULDNT BE SO PRICEY.  FOR A SPRAY TAN AT THE TANNING SALON IT CAN RANGE ANYWHERE FROM 45-100 BUCKS DEPENDING ON IF YOU USE THE VERSASPA, OR THE OTHER TANNING SPRAY MACHINES, OR IF YOU GET AIRBRUSHED AT THE TANNING SALON BY A PROFESSIONAL OR SOMEONE WORKING AS THE SPRAYER.  SO IT WILL DEFINITELY SAVE YOU SOME MONEY BECAUSE THIS SHOULD LAST FOR UP TO 9 TANS IF YOU DO FULL BODY AIRBRUSH TANS.</li>
            <li> Nice color,not orange. Works good in my little airbrush gun. I would estimate it&#x27;s good for 30 or more sessions.</li>
            <li> Good stuff I have used it for years</li>
            <li> I just used this today and it is by far the best out there. It smells fantastic and goes on great. My husband has a spray gun so the application is perfect, but I am pretty sure any good airbrush gun would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I used lotion before and I won&#x27;t do that again. If I am fresh out of the shower again, I will just wait until later to apply lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way,  I think, is to take a shower earlier and exfoliate and lotion. Then, several hours later apply the tanning solution. Then you are fine to take a shower that next morning if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t do more than one layer. If you do, it could be sticky. I know it looks like you need to do more, but you don&#x27;t.  I do love that it has a slight tint to it so you can see where it has been applied. It also helps that my husband paints cars for a living, so he has a great application technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The specific distributor I purchased from was TCP Global Corporation and they were great. Good shipping and fast. Bottle came in tact. They did raise the price by a couple bucks after I purchased, so when I buy again it will be more expensive, but it still beats getting it done at a salon. Also, the larger bottles are a good price as well. Now that I know I like this brand,  I will be purchasing the larger bottle. Again from TCP Global Corporation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up switching brands as this started to turn me orange after time. I used the PH balancer as well and that helped, but ultimately, I liked the other brad better.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning color. I had a spray tanner, but it broke. So now I use this as &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; and apply while wearing rubber gloves so I don&#x27;t stain my hands.  There are no streaks and the color is a perfect tan.</li>
            <li> STAYS ON FOR A SOLID 5 DAYS, THEN STARTS TO SLOWLY COME OFF. MAY BE A LITTLE TOO DARK FOR ME. I HAVE ORDERD THE 8% AND WILL SEE IF THAT WORKS BETTER. THIS DARK ONE WOULD BE GOOD FOR ANY TYPE OF COMPETITION (CHEERLEADING, FITNESS ETC...) BUT MAY BE A LITTLE TOO INTENSE FOR DAILY WEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I have try this more then once. And its always the same. You put it, its great. But it only last untill you have a shower. Cuz all the tan goes with water. I do not recommend. You find alot better than this.</li>
            <li> This tanning solution is nice, its dark but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking orange. I use it once a week to keep my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; going strong!</li>
            <li> color always looks fantastic all my friends always compliment me! doesn&#x27;t appear orange at all just nice and bronzed I would highly recommend this brand and I also received my package very quickly</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and dry time is amazing. And product washes out of clothing and most DHA solution do not&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering another bottle soon</li>
