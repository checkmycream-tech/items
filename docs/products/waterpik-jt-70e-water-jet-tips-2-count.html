            <li>I love my water pik</li>
            <li>But the kid&#x27;s love it.  </li>
            <li>Tried to save money but was probably better off buying from the waterpik website.</li>
            <li>Be sure to check your model number.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works well on appropriate water pik.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get these replacement tips anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I love my Water Pik irrigator.</li>
            <li>He is more dedicated to using this than he was to flossing.</li>
            <li>I would do it again and sure that i will.</li>
            <li>Glad I did</li>
            <li>They did. :-)</li>
            <li>Make sure the ones you buy match your model # or match the ones you already have.  </li>
            <li>Probably my fault but no warning that there are more than one type and size of these pik tips.</li>
            <li>My husband and I are both sharing a Water Pik and really love it.  </li>
            <li>They are as good as the original ones, they work fine.</li>
            <li>This product is just like the original, just wish I could have selected my own colors.</li>
            <li>They arrived in good condition, and they work really well.</li>
            <li>It is more fun than flossing and better at it too.</li>
            <li>The water pik machine does a fine job for teeth cleaning and plaque attack.  </li>
            <li>Work fine, just like the ones they replaced.</li>
            <li>be sure to check your model to insure the tip is correct, luckily I did &amp; have no problems in that department.</li>
            <li>although they fit fine they had rubber tips and the stream produced</li>
            <li>These tips fit fine and do the job.  </li>
            <li>These fit my water pik just fine.</li>
            <li>Waterpik jets fit just fine for my unit and work as designed.</li>
            <li>The tips fit my model 65</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for this size and am happy to have finally found it.</li>
            <li>The pic fit my water Jet, there were two in a packet which I can use.  </li>
            <li>These tips fit the model for which they were purchased .  </li>
            <li>All as ordered however I did not look at my machine and these don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately Amazon had it covered with replacement tips.  </li>
            <li>Local stores don&#x27;t stock these so it was very nice to see we could still get replacement tips.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s to say except they fit, they do the job &amp; are OEM original and not knock-offs.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>so being able to replace the tips is great especially for my older model.</li>
            <li>Cannot do without it, as it helps to keep my mouth clean.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t exactly know if these were for the model I had, Waterpic must of done some upgrades, but these fit fine.</li>
            <li>Good quality, but can be a bit fragile and break if accidentally dropped</li>
            <li>So I was glad to find it online in the size I needed for my older unit.</li>
            <li>The Water Pik jet tip I ordered was the exact fit for my Water Pik.  </li>
            <li>I liked the original WaterPic Classic better than this new one that is made out of very light weight plastic that looks and feels cheap and is less stable.</li>
            <li>, didn&#x27;t want to buy new machine, they aren&#x27;t as good as the old one.</li>
            <li>The pics were available and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these tips so all the members of my family could have their own personal tip.</li>
            <li>Not much to say except that they fit nicely into the Water Pik and do the job intended.</li>
            <li>This was an old unit and wasn&#x27;t sure if I could find the right parts.</li>
            <li>It turned out that I didn&#x27;t need new jet tips, but instead I needed a new handle assembly, which is available from WaterPik and super easy to install.  </li>
            <li>and it fits right in.</li>
            <li>The company will not attempt to make things right.</li>
            <li>Fit our older model WP-72W with no problems..</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the right ones for the right number machine, as they have different mounting sockets depending on which machine you have.</li>
            <li>Good made my old wather pick back to work</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I think it does a better job than traditional flossing.</li>
            <li>good product.&lt;br /&gt;Be advised: One size does not fit all.</li>
            <li>A quick check on line connected me to several sellers who had the jet tips available.  </li>
            <li>Hard time finding them in store - so was glad I was able to find them.</li>
            <li>If you have an older water pik then these are the right choice.</li>
            <li>These water pik jets tips (classic) were received timely and arrived exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>Just be sure they fit and its hard to tell.</li>
            <li>you so  much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I thought were generic fit for all water pics.  </li>
            <li>Finally got the one to fit my model of Waterpik.</li>
            <li>his breath is much nicer now.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Water Pik is a real quality item.</li>
            <li>Exact size to replace the old one.</li>
            <li>I looked for these in the stores locally and found only one place that sold them, for more than twice what they cost here.</li>
            <li>It is an older model that I have</li>
            <li>There are 2 main designs of water pik jet tips.  </li>
            <li>...arrived quickly, and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Finally ordered the right size for my Waterpik Flosser...</li>
            <li>Everything is working like brand new again</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to buy a new Waterpik.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to buy a new unit.</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;ancient&amp;#34; Water Pik was still working like new, (noisy but working) but</li>
            <li>They are new tips, that&#x27;s all.  </li>
            <li>Dentist ordered my husband to buy one rather than try to floss around his new bridge.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live in the US and my Water Pik</li>
            <li>They look the same as the originals, but they seem to fit a bit differently.</li>
            <li>These work with my waterpik, which is over 20 years old.</li>
            <li>So far have not had to replace one.</li>
            <li>These were much better price than stores (if they had them) and delivered quickly in common post soft-pack.</li>
            <li>is quite old.</li>
            <li>I had checked several places in my town (as well as others) and could not find them even though they sold the main unit.  </li>
            <li>It takes too long for the water to come  out of the tip and when it does it shoots out  a very high pressured stream that can cause gums to bleed.</li>
            <li>So I was not sure that the nozzles would fit.</li>
            <li>Exactly as was expected.  </li>
            <li>I needed new tips for a year, finally thought about here.  </li>
            <li>For myself, I have not used the device for long but have high hopes.</li>
            <li>The old units had 4 tips included which, of course, are necessary to use the damn thing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really need to buy these because several came with water pic but not worth sending back figuring I will use them eventually.</li>

            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Water Pik is a real quality item.</li>
            <li> Exact size to replace the old one.</li>
            <li> I looked for these in the stores locally and found only one place that sold them, for more than twice what they cost here.</li>
            <li> It is an older model that I have</li>
            <li> There are 2 main designs of water pik jet tips.  </li>
            <li> ...arrived quickly, and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Finally ordered the right size for my Waterpik Flosser...</li>
            <li> Everything is working like brand new again</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to buy a new Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to buy a new unit.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;ancient&amp;#34; Water Pik was still working like new, (noisy but working) but</li>
            <li> They are new tips, that&#x27;s all.  </li>
            <li> Dentist ordered my husband to buy one rather than try to floss around his new bridge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live in the US and my Water Pik</li>
            <li> They look the same as the originals, but they seem to fit a bit differently.</li>
            <li> These work with my waterpik, which is over 20 years old.</li>
            <li> So far have not had to replace one.</li>
            <li> These were much better price than stores (if they had them) and delivered quickly in common post soft-pack.</li>
            <li> is quite old.</li>
            <li> I had checked several places in my town (as well as others) and could not find them even though they sold the main unit.  </li>
            <li> It takes too long for the water to come  out of the tip and when it does it shoots out  a very high pressured stream that can cause gums to bleed.</li>
            <li> So I was not sure that the nozzles would fit.</li>
            <li> Exactly as was expected.  </li>
            <li> I needed new tips for a year, finally thought about here.  </li>
            <li> For myself, I have not used the device for long but have high hopes.</li>
            <li> The old units had 4 tips included which, of course, are necessary to use the damn thing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really need to buy these because several came with water pic but not worth sending back figuring I will use them eventually.</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t fir the tip into the jet but then pushed a little harder</li>
            <li> The end of the original had broken off.</li>
            <li> so I relied on the picture to show me what I was getting and the ones I got were totally different with rubber tips and extra long bases.</li>
            <li> wrong fit.</li>
            <li> My problem is with the seller that took way way too long to start order then even longer to send it.</li>
            <li> It takes too long for the excess water to drain out of the tubing after the machine is turned off.</li>
            <li> These additional tips make it possible for other members of our family to use the water flosser.</li>
            <li> P&amp;H was high, but as this item is not available everywhere, I had little choice.</li>
            <li> There is not much more to say about such a simple product.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to have new pick after the original eventually broke at the base of the handle when removing for rinse off.  </li>
            <li> Thought these were going to be universal, they did not fit our water pik model.</li>
            <li> was so anemic it was not capable of dislodging any food.</li>
            <li> the water pik jet tips were as expected.  </li>
            <li> We have an older but functioning water pik and the tips had broken.  </li>
            <li> Not available in stores.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the Jet Tips that were sent to me did not fit my Water Pik.  </li>
            <li> The jet tips did not fit my water pik.</li>
            <li> Says on the package that it fits the WP-60, but does not fit in mine</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding these at the drug store.</li>
            <li> This product will not fit your water pik.</li>
            <li> The replacement tips are rather expensive, but since they last forever, the price is not really relevant.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say besides that.</li>
            <li> The jet tips are for a different model and useless to me.</li>
            <li> However, these tips are too hard to get on and off the head.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd bad experience on Amazon in regards to these replacement parts.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit fragile; I&#x27;ve broken two trying to remove them from the base.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> they are worthless to me and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> duhhhh.</li>
            <li> These were the wrong size for my waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find this product in any stores in my area, thus the price was \\&quot;unbeatable\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also sometime hard to insert into the base.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> I was disappointed as the tips that came were not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> service from them was pathetic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It turned out that I didn&#x27;t need new jet tips, but instead I needed a new handle assembly, which is available from WaterPik and super easy to install.  Everything is working like brand new again</li>
            <li> They arrived in good condition, and they work really well. Not much more to say besides that. I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Product took only took three days to get here from ordering.  Didn&#x27;t exactly know if these were for the model I had, Waterpic must of done some upgrades, but these fit fine.</li>
            <li> Great product and inexpensive.  Took about a week or so to get to me.  Fits models WP-60/65/70/75, the difference being the length of the attachment end.</li>
            <li> These work with my waterpik, which is over 20 years old. Still works well. I was so glad to find these.  Not available in stores.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that the replacement jet tips for the Water Pik could be ordered through Amazon.  I had checked several places in my town (as well as others) and could not find them even though they sold the main unit.  The tips fit my model 65 perfectly so happy to be up and running again.  The order was received in a timely manner and packaged well.</li>
            <li> These fit my waterpik WP-70 perfectly! I looked everywhere for this size and am happy to have finally found it. Now I don&#x27;t have to buy a new Waterpik.</li>
            <li> My wife and I like the tips purchased and they work great with my unit.  Great pressure and flow control direction for cleaning between teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> ...arrived quickly, and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The pic fit my water Jet, there were two in a packet which I can use.  I could not find the pics at any of my neighborhood stores So I was happy to find it on line; and, It arrived much sooner than it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so  much.</li>
            <li> Just want i needed. This was an old unit and wasn&#x27;t sure if I could find the right parts. Thanks</li>
            <li> The tips are perfect for my old Water Pik cleaner. I couldn&#x27;t find these tips anywhere in town, but I was able to order them from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really need to buy these because several came with water pic but not worth sending back figuring I will use them eventually.</li>
            <li> great value for the price and as good as oem i will reorder when the time comes machine still works good</li>
            <li> If you have an older water pik then these are the right choice. They work perfectly with my older system. I love my water pik so being able to replace the tips is great especially for my older model.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacements</li>
            <li> The Water Pik jet tip I ordered was the exact fit for my Water Pik.  It also came in a two pack so now I have a spare.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the Jet Tips that were sent to me did not fit my Water Pik.  They were different from the pictured items in the &amp;#34;catalogue.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These tips fit the model for which they were purchased .  Arrived in great time.  No complaints.  Water pin is a great product.  The model 65, for which these were purchased, is a bit noisy.  But the kid&#x27;s love it.  It is more fun than flossing and better at it too.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tips so all the members of my family could have their own personal tip. However they are not universal for each waterpik, even though I was under that impression from the description. Tried to save money but was probably better off buying from the waterpik website.Its not the product that lacked quality, it was the overall universality of the tips.</li>
            <li> I am extremly disssatisfied with the waterpik jet tips I received. The jet tips are for a different model and useless to me. How can I get my money back? Please advise.</li>
            <li> I bought these tips, as it did not appear from the picture, that there were enough tips with the flosser. The old units had 4 tips included which, of course, are necessary to use the damn thing.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed. Service very good.</li>
            <li> The water flosser came with only 2 Jet Tips and we needed at lest three.  These additional tips make it possible for other members of our family to use the water flosser.</li>
            <li> Thought these were going to be universal, they did not fit our water pik model. Package had been ripped open so we did not return. Just be sure they fit and its hard to tell.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say except they fit, they do the job &amp; are OEM original and not knock-offs.&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to check your model to insure the tip is correct, luckily I did &amp; have no problems in that department.</li>
            <li> The jet tips did not fit my water pik. I tried calling 4 times with the number that they gave if you had a problem. They never returned my call. You should remove the company from your list. Very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the model number to my unit so I relied on the picture to show me what I was getting and the ones I got were totally different with rubber tips and extra long bases. They look nothing like the picture posted by the company. Unfortunate. I&#x27;m just going to buy a new unit. This is the 2nd bad experience on Amazon in regards to these replacement parts. I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Good made my old wather pick back to work</li>
            <li> These water pik jets tips (classic) were received timely and arrived exactly as shown. We were happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed as the tips that came were not as pictured. although they fit fine they had rubber tips and the stream produced was so anemic it was not capable of dislodging any food. they are worthless to me and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The water pik machine does a fine job for teeth cleaning and plaque attack.  These tips fit fine and do the job.  Thought they were a bit pricey for what you got, but so be it.</li>
            <li> good product.&lt;br /&gt;Be advised: One size does not fit all. Be sure to check your model number.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on appropriate water pik.</li>
            <li> They are as good as the original ones, they work fine.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Fits the product, works well. Good quality, but can be a bit fragile and break if accidentally dropped</li>
            <li> I looked for these in the stores locally and found only one place that sold them, for more than twice what they cost here. Just make sure you get the right ones for the right number machine, as they have different mounting sockets depending on which machine you have.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;ancient&amp;#34; Water Pik was still working like new, (noisy but working) but when the last jet tip broke, I could not find a replacement in the local stores.  A quick check on line connected me to several sellers who had the jet tips available.  My product was ordered, paid for and promptly received without any hitches.  Too bad I can&#x27;t do dental work the same way.</li>
            <li> They fit my Water Pik perfectly. No runs no drips no errors. So far have not had to replace one.</li>
            <li> this  is a great product and speedy delivery. The water pik does a good job of keeping the plac from forming.</li>
            <li> Says on the package that it fits the WP-60, but does not fit in mine</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was just as described!</li>
            <li> The Waterpick jet works great.  The replacement tips are rather expensive, but since they last forever, the price is not really relevant.</li>
            <li> Everything went well with my transaction, overall order and purchase. I am pleased with it all. Thank You !</li>
            <li> Saved me $60!  I wasn&#x27;t able to get these replacement tips anywhere else.  I love my Water Pik!</li>
            <li> Nothing about the product per se.  They are new tips, that&#x27;s all.  Vendor was prompt and they arrived in a timely fashion. P&amp;H was high, but as this item is not available everywhere, I had little choice.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these jets anywhere but online.  The price was great and they came in no time.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> All as ordered however I did not look at my machine and these don&#x27;t fit.  Make sure you search with the model number of the machine you own.  I thought were generic fit for all water pics.  Wrong!  Delivery was good. Would order again from this company.</li>
            <li> Finally got the one to fit my model of Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Finally ordered the right size for my Waterpik Flosser...Great</li>
            <li> wrong fit. Not working.</li>
            <li> Works good,  pricey for plastic...</li>
            <li> We have an older but functioning water pik and the tips had broken.  Fortunately Amazon had it covered with replacement tips.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these replacement tips ANYWHERE except on Amazon. I love my Water Pik irrigator. I think it does a better job than traditional flossing. However, these tips are too hard to get on and off the head. Don&#x27;t know why. They look the same as the originals, but they seem to fit a bit differently.</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t fir the tip into the jet but then pushed a little harder and it fits right in.</li>
            <li> Fit and function perfectly, just as the originals.  There is not much more to say about such a simple product.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding these at the drug store. I was happy to fine them.</li>
            <li> Dentist ordered my husband to buy one rather than try to floss around his new bridge. Seems to work well and his breath is much nicer now. He is more dedicated to using this than he was to flossing.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised, works good, and was received very quick. I would do it again and sure that i will. Thanks</li>
            <li> the water pik jet tips were as expected.  Delivery was on time. Hard time finding them in store - so was glad I was able to find them.</li>
            <li> works great every morning before I brush my teeth. Cannot do without it, as it helps to keep my mouth clean.</li>
            <li> I could not find the water pik jet tip replacements anywhere.  So I was glad to find it online in the size I needed for my older unit.</li>
            <li> These are the tips that I needed and were just perfect. It is an older model that I have so I thought I would difficulty finding these tips. Item came as described and I am happy.</li>
            <li> Fit our older model WP-72W with no problems.. These jet tips are made by WaterPik. Item shipped quickly, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to have new pick after the original eventually broke at the base of the handle when removing for rinse off.  These were much better price than stores (if they had them) and delivered quickly in common post soft-pack.</li>
            <li> I have looked for replacement pics in brick n&#x27; mortar stores to no avail. Amazon always comes to the rescue. The pics were available and the price was reasonable.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I needed new tips for a year, finally thought about here.  Glad I did, didn&#x27;t want to buy new machine, they aren&#x27;t as good as the old one.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the spare parts. I don&#x27;t live in the US and my Water Pik is quite old. So I was not sure that the nozzles would fit. They did. :-)</li>
            <li> Work fine, just like the ones they replaced.</li>
            <li> Fit my model perfectly and arrived promptly</li>
            <li> I needed them for my water pik.  The end of the original had broken off. These fit my water pik just fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement tips for the Water Pic model that we have (WP-70W). These jet tips get a lot of use as both my wife and I use the Water Pik every day.</li>
            <li> There are 2 main designs of water pik jet tips.  Make sure the ones you buy match your model # or match the ones you already have.  duhhhh.</li>
            <li> These worked great with the WP 65. So happy that we can use our waterpik again.</li>
            <li> Waterpik jets fit just fine for my unit and work as designed. My problem is with the seller that took way way too long to start order then even longer to send it. service from them was pathetic.</li>
            <li> these water pics were just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Not much to say except that they fit nicely into the Water Pik and do the job intended. Good buy.</li>
            <li> These were the wrong size for my waterpik.  Probably my fault but no warning that there are more than one type and size of these pik tips.</li>
            <li> Exact size to replace the old one. Can&#x27;t find &#x27;em in the stores, so I was happy to find these!</li>
            <li> I liked the original WaterPic Classic better than this new one that is made out of very light weight plastic that looks and feels cheap and is less stable. It takes too long for the water to come  out of the tip and when it does it shoots out  a very high pressured stream that can cause gums to bleed. It takes too long for the excess water to drain out of the tubing after the machine is turned off.</li>
            <li> The jet tips are essential for my dental health and they do their job.  They&#x27;re a bit fragile; I&#x27;ve broken two trying to remove them from the base.  They&#x27;re also sometime hard to insert into the base.  This is probably a flaw in the Water Pik device, not the jet tips.</li>
            <li> I bought extra tips so my wife and son could use my Water Pik.  For myself, I have not used the device for long but have high hopes.</li>
            <li> This product will not fit your water pik. It is not the same as what is pictured. The company will not attempt to make things right. They suck.</li>
            <li> Exactly as was expected.  Local stores don&#x27;t stock these so it was very nice to see we could still get replacement tips.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this product in any stores in my area, thus the price was \\&quot;unbeatable\\&quot;.  This product is just like the original, just wish I could have selected my own colors.</li>
            <li> Great service great product as always everything was perfect. Water Pik is a real quality item. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both sharing a Water Pik and really love it.  Thank you for separting our lives and teeth!</li>
