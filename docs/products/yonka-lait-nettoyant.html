            <li>What an amazing line of products.</li>
            <li>It really works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Love its aroma, that it&#x27;s good for my skin and feels like silk.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face and let it set for a bit until I wash it off with a warm cloth.</li>
            <li>It even removes eye make-up (although it&#x27;s not as effective on Lancome waterproof mascara)</li>
            <li>I think it would be a great product for the right face, but my face isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>By the way--since starting to use the L&#x27;Oreal, people have been commenting on how beautiful my skin is!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and have found nothing better.  </li>
            <li>I have always been pleased shopping on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have told many of my friends about your service.</li>
            <li>it came with top cap leaking.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by an award winning Spa in Michigan.</li>
            <li>I love YONKA products.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>, so I don&#x27;t need two products most of the time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cap with a hole in the top that dispenses, rather than a pump dispenser, which this appears to be.</li>
            <li>My favorite skin care product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and product in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the cap so that was fine with me.</li>
            <li>The clear gels/foams dont work for my very sensitive skin, this cream fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>I found this great price on the first two steps and decided it was worth $40 to look good, especially for job interviews.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried all the Yonka products, but every one I have tried has been fabulous.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>making my skin really smooth day and night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>facial salon recommended me and I am really happy about it.</li>
            <li>Great cleansing cream and removes eye makeup without stinging your eyes, not all facial cleansers can be used to remove eye makeup, one has to purchase a special eyemake up remover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL to very sensitive skin, and was the only thing I&#x27;d use.</li>
            <li>They are pricey but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I feel clean and fresh but hydrated!</li>
            <li>Does the same wonderful \\&quot;sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a clean feeling</li>
            <li>love this stuff; the smell, the feel and how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li>order arrived quickly and was packed well.</li>
            <li>I am 48 and have dry skin, to his cleanser gently cleans and hydrates beautifully.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of it to be effective, so that relatively high price is really quite worth it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend $30-40 on this when a cheaper product is a little better! :-)</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin fresh and without blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I will not stop using this product, the price is not inexpensive but the quality is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear and soft and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I even had a Yonka facial at a spa recently - wow, so nice!</li>
            <li>My skin felt light, clean, soft and really glowed after using these products.      </li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>The cleanser leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This product came on time and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I first was introduced to Yonka (or YonKa) products at a spa and have used it ever since.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m traveling, one of the first things I do when I hit the motel room is to get out all my Yonka products and feel relaxed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the Gel Lettoyant first.</li>
            <li>I ran out and thought this would be better for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been worth the trade off.</li>
            <li>It makes a difference in the texture of my skin, and gets all make up off gently.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This is a gentle cleanser, so it does not strip all the oil away (you do need some).</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m ready to remove make-up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but as I got into my mid-30s, I started to have dry, flaky patches on my forehead, chin and cheeks and parched lines down my nose.  </li>
            <li>have tried many other milk soaps and always come back to this</li>
            <li>If your skin is mostly problem-free, but just has some moisture imbalance/dryness and looks dull, this combination of products will make it radiant and glowing.  </li>
            <li>But you will smell like an old lady.</li>
            <li>Immediately, my skin was soft and dewey.  </li>
            <li>always give my 83 year old mother a  bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Minor, but a plus when getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>Just like the Yonka product, with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product, you only need a tiny dot on the scubette to really clean your face--and the scrubette also takes off any dry skin!</li>
            <li>This is a very soft feeling, skin conditioning facial wash.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years now and this is by far</li>
            <li>she naturally lets me when she is running low..</li>

            <li> I tend to have oily skin, but other cleansers would dry my skin too much, so I would end up with oily &amp; dry flaky skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> If you can treat yourself to some Yonka, please do -- all their products go a long way.</li>
            <li> Or I use the Lotion PS Toner, after the cleanser if I feel dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> If dry, use this one.</li>
            <li> I never use anything else to cleanse my face and one bottle lasts a long time as you only need very little to do the job.   </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for everyone&#x27;s skin type, I&#x27;m b/w biracial and have had few skin problems - not in my teens nor as I approach 40 next year.  </li>
            <li> I am middle aged but still have oily skin with occasional breakouts, although I live in a cold climate so need to be careful of dehydration.</li>
            <li> It also seems to work well with my Neutrogena sunscreen moisturizer, which is less expensive than the Yonka and has the higher SPF and helioplex</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way and leaves your skin feeling plump and moist.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works as well as my La Mer cleansing products and it costs much less.</li>
            <li> It was recommended  by my facialist as the previous product I was using was making my skin dehydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unemployed and tried to make due with store brands for over a year, but they just didn&#x27;t do the trick, the dryness remained and pores on my nose were large and dirty.      </li>
            <li> Wish it was not so expensive, but I will try to make it last!!  </li>
            <li> I usually buy this lotion in salon sizes when I can, but this was for a gift for my daughter</li>
            <li> and my skin is plump with very few lines.  </li>
            <li> I was also skeptical of a cream/non-foaming cleanser.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes makeup, dirt and grim without drying out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using Yonka products for almost 20 years now. They are pricey but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how wonderful your face feels after cleansing with this product. I suffered with rosacia for years, but this is part of the skin care routine I have now, and my skin looks like a teenager&#x27;s (I&#x27;m 48). I haven&#x27;t tried all the Yonka products, but every one I have tried has been fabulous. I even had a Yonka facial at a spa recently - wow, so nice! If you can treat yourself to some Yonka, please do -- all their products go a long way. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it to be effective, so that relatively high price is really quite worth it.</li>
            <li> This removes all makeup including mascara, etc.   I never use anything else to cleanse my face and one bottle lasts a long time as you only need very little to do the job.   You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> YonKa products are great.  This cream cleanser is just what i needed.  The clear gels/foams dont work for my very sensitive skin, this cream fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Yonka line 5-6 years ago by an my skin care lady. What an amazing line of products. I am middle aged but still have oily skin with occasional breakouts, although I live in a cold climate so need to be careful of dehydration. This cleansing lotion keeps the skin moist but not oily. Very gentle. Use with the spray toner as a follow up.</li>
            <li> Others have said the same. It&#x27;s a pleasure to feel - my skin loves it. Not drying. Removes makeup well. Works great with Clarisonic. But you will smell like an old lady. So far, it&#x27;s been worth the trade off. Crazy when other Yon Ka products like the toner smell SOOO good.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft feeling, skin conditioning facial wash. A small amount goes a long way and leaves your skin feeling plump and moist.</li>
            <li> It really works wonderfully.  Wish it was not so expensive, but I will try to make it last!!  It makes a difference in the texture of my skin, and gets all make up off gently.  I like it.  Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for about two years now and it is great. I am 48 and have dry skin, to his cleanser gently cleans and hydrates beautifully. I feel clean and fresh but hydrated! Great product</li>
            <li> Best for cleansing the face.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over 10 years now. It&#x27;s INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL to very sensitive skin, and was the only thing I&#x27;d use. Now I&#x27;ve traded it in for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s 360 cleanser with the scrubette at a price of $5-7 a bottle. Does the same wonderful \\&quot;sensitive skin thing,\\&quot; AND smells better! Plus I am in love with the scrubette! Don&#x27;t spend $30-40 on this when a cheaper product is a little better! :-) By the way--since starting to use the L&#x27;Oreal, people have been commenting on how beautiful my skin is! Just like the Yonka product, with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product, you only need a tiny dot on the scubette to really clean your face--and the scrubette also takes off any dry skin!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and have found nothing better.  The cleanser leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works as well as my La Mer cleansing products and it costs much less. I use this cleanser with the spritzer/toner it&#x27;s a wonderful combination for your skin with no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer the gel cleanser from Yonka to the lotion cleanser.  I don&#x27;t care for the way my skin feels when I use this product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a clean feeling and I can&#x27;t use it for an  eyemakeup remover the way I can the gel cleanser.  I think it would be a great product for the right face, but my face isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but as I got into my mid-30s, I started to have dry, flaky patches on my forehead, chin and cheeks and parched lines down my nose.  About 3 years ago, Yonka was recommended by a salon owner after a facial.  It was pricey, but the facial turned out well, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was also skeptical of a cream/non-foaming cleanser.  My skin felt light, clean, soft and really glowed after using these products.      Although it was over $100 for the 3 steps (this cream cleanser, spray lotion/exfoliant and moisturizer), the 3 bottles lasted almost 2 years.  I&#x27;m unemployed and tried to make due with store brands for over a year, but they just didn&#x27;t do the trick, the dryness remained and pores on my nose were large and dirty.      I found this great price on the first two steps and decided it was worth $40 to look good, especially for job interviews.  Immediately, my skin was soft and dewey.  It also seems to work well with my Neutrogena sunscreen moisturizer, which is less expensive than the Yonka and has the higher SPF and helioplex my dermatologist recommended.    I can&#x27;t speak for everyone&#x27;s skin type, I&#x27;m b/w biracial and have had few skin problems - not in my teens nor as I approach 40 next year.  If your skin is mostly problem-free, but just has some moisture imbalance/dryness and looks dull, this combination of products will make it radiant and glowing.  My skin looks like I just walked out of a facial and I&#x27;m not even cleansing at night!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades. Love its aroma, that it&#x27;s good for my skin and feels like silk.</li>
            <li> This product came on time and is exactly what I wanted.I definitely would buy this again from this vendor.  I have always been pleased shopping on amazon.  The prices aregood and I get good quality.I have told many of my friends about your service.</li>
            <li> it came with top cap leaking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now and this is by far the best milk soap around.&lt;br /&gt;It removes makeup, dirt and grim without drying out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other milk soaps and always come back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;It simply can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;I always give my 83 year old mother a  bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Now she naturally lets me when she is running low..&lt;br /&gt;Her skin is peaches and cream.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser.  Been using for years.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and product in good condition.  However, the picture showed product with a pump, and it did not have one with the box.  Minor, but a plus when getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over ten years.  It keeps my skin fresh and without blemishes.  I&#x27;m sixty five and my skin is plump with very few lines.  I will not stop using this product, the price is not inexpensive but the quality is well worth it.  Take care of your skin and it will take care of you, no need for face lifts here.</li>
            <li> love this stuff; the smell, the feel and how fast it arrived. Thanks</li>
            <li> I am giving this five stars because the product is excellent.  The seller was timely in shipment.  The product picture displayed appears to be a pump dispenser.  The product I received was not a pump dispenser.  It, however, makes no difference to me because the container works just as well.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 5 years. It was recommended to me by an award winning Spa in Michigan. I tend to have oily skin, but other cleansers would dry my skin too much, so I would end up with oily &amp; dry flaky skin at the same time. This is a gentle cleanser, so it does not strip all the oil away (you do need some). If I ever feel too oily (like in the summer), I do the Yonka mask #105 that week to get back in balance. Or I use the Lotion PS Toner, after the cleanser if I feel dry in the winter. I love YONKA products.</li>
            <li> Another product I have used for over 20 years. Great cleansing cream and removes eye makeup without stinging your eyes, not all facial cleansers can be used to remove eye makeup, one has to purchase a special eyemake up remover.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my skin feel so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to Yonka (or YonKa) products at a spa and have used it ever since. This is my favorite because it smells great and feels good. When I&#x27;m ready to remove make-up I put it on my face and let it set for a bit until I wash it off with a warm cloth. It even removes eye make-up (although it&#x27;s not as effective on Lancome waterproof mascara), so I don&#x27;t need two products most of the time. When I&#x27;m traveling, one of the first things I do when I hit the motel room is to get out all my Yonka products and feel relaxed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This order arrived quickly and was packed well. The packaging doesn&#x27;t look like this though---it&#x27;s a cap with a hole in the top that dispenses, rather than a pump dispenser, which this appears to be. I prefer the cap so that was fine with me. I usually buy this lotion in salon sizes when I can, but this was for a gift for my daughter and I know she&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine not using this one anymore. making my skin really smooth day and night.&lt;br /&gt;My facial salon recommended me and I am really happy about it.</li>
            <li> My favorite skin care product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It was recommended  by my facialist as the previous product I was using was making my skin dehydrated. I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and it&#x27;s made a huge difference. My skin is clear and soft and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Great face wash and eye makeup remover.  Its all i will ever use on my face!</li>
            <li> I used the Gel Lettoyant first. I ran out and thought this would be better for my dry skin.  I love it.  I would recommend the gel if you&#x27;re oily.  If dry, use this one.</li>
            <li> The best cleansing milk on the market.</li>
