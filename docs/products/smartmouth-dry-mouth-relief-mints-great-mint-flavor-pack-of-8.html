            <li>This product is refreshing and contains NO aspartame!!  </li>
            <li>They are a very nice, tasty, milder mint.</li>
            <li>These sugar free mints are an excellent after meal supplement for those who use SmartMouth mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I have been impressed with these sugar free mints, and like that I could get this product on the subscribe and save system here.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>I am also delighted that I can buy them in quantity.  </li>
            <li>Also buying the 8-pk is a good savings.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>the best of mints I have tried and you can really feel them working as a breath mint</li>
            <li>Handy to have.</li>
            <li>Still it&#x27;s a nice product that delivers what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>And they taste good without being too strong.  </li>
            <li>Easy to carry, nice dispenser, works well.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing taste.  </li>
            <li>They are okay.  </li>
            <li>I think Ice Chips or sugar-free mint cough drops are way better.</li>
            <li>This product is the best and actually works like it says it does.  </li>
            <li>My favorite breath mints...</li>
            <li>Love Smints&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried it many of the nighttime mints you know which brand I am writing about.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>He was glad to get them and thanked us for them.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love these.</li>
            <li>They are not overpowering mints, like some, but taste great, dissolve away fairly quickly and leave your breath fresh.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry mouth</li>
            <li>I wish there was an easy way to combine both bottles, though.  </li>
            <li>These are, by far, the absolute best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll finish these off over time, but they&#x27;re just three-star mints for me, nothing special at all.</li>
            <li>This is fine because they do not leave a brown and sticky stuff on my teeth and gums that I have to immediately brush off when I rise in the morning.</li>
            <li>They do a great job almost instantly.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product, I initially thought it was gum that I ordered</li>
            <li>The packaging is very handy, it is a low calorie product (and no sugar)</li>
            <li>These are great, along with sugar-free gum and Biotene gel, to get me through my days and nights of dry mouth.</li>
            <li>These melt a lot faster than most mints and they aren&#x27;t very minty tasting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you, Smart Mouth!!</li>
            <li>Same wonderful taste as the mouthwash, but doesn&#x27;t pack the same punch and staying power.</li>
            <li>Mild flavor.  </li>
            <li>These mints have helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li>they help a lot with my dry mouth and the taste is good</li>
            <li>The item was really well packaged!!  </li>
            <li>When I awake with a dry mouth in the middle of the night they are the best.  </li>
            <li>They are especially good in the middle of the night when you have a dry mouth and don&#x27;t want to get up and get a drink of water.</li>
            <li>These are handy breath mints that last just a bit longer than others.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my breath fresh.</li>
            <li>Then I discovered this product on Amazon and thought it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Fresh breath for anytime you are in doubt.</li>
            <li>Minty fresh.</li>
            <li>Makes your mouth and breath feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>Tastes great, not sure about the 12 hr. &amp;#34;freshness.&amp;#34; time will tell...</li>
            <li>Smart mouth mints work!  </li>
            <li>Smart mouth is a winner in our house!  </li>
            <li>Just as good as xylimelts but cost much less.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last as long as the mouthwash itself, but they are great in between.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the only effective mint.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many of the products on the market for nighttime relief of dry mouth.</li>
            <li>and they last a good long while, about six months for me, so its an inexpensive investment in your breath.</li>
            <li>Especially because there are so many situations when using a special mouth wash like Biotene or its generic equivalents is not practical.  </li>
            <li>But this product works well with the Smart Mouth Mouthwash.</li>
            <li>i. Like smart mouth mouth wash.</li>
            <li>so this really works for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this was a real problem.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works the whole 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>When I get ready for bed</li>
            <li>If I wake in the night and it has all ready melted away - I tuck another one</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>But they work very well.</li>
            <li>highly recommend, along with Smart Mouth Rinse.</li>
            <li>I figure if it helps just a little, that&#x27;s better than not trying anything at all.</li>
            <li>They use the same zinc ion technology to enhance fresh breath.</li>
            <li>I also bought the new cinnamon mouthwash, which I haven&#x27;t tried (haven&#x27;t received</li>
            <li>These mints works the same as other mints but cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>I thought these were really unremarkable, and they feel dry when I put them in my mouth.</li>
            <li>would suggest everyone to get the whole system and you can buy a smaller set before spending the money on the regular size.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to put one in your mouth as you go to bed and let it slowly dissolve.  </li>
            <li>but as I grew older I have suffered with dry mouth, which even my dentist has commented on.  </li>
            <li>He also liked them even though he was skeptical.  </li>

            <li> It does not really last long in mouth either</li>
            <li> They last a really long time that way.</li>
            <li> These mints do double duty in relieving my dry mouth and freshening my breath.</li>
            <li> This is a long lasting dry mouth relief mint.  </li>
            <li> I had radiation treatments over 20 years ago and left me with a dry mouth but these work!</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t last long or prevent dry mouth for long.</li>
            <li> Much better than Therabreath, Listerine, Scopre, gums of all kinds, and other expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> None of the advertised products (Biotene) for dry mouth worked for me.  </li>
            <li> i suffer from dry mouth from medication I have to take and the mints work well to relieve the dry mouth issue.</li>
            <li> My mouth was consistantly dry from medications.</li>
            <li> Recommended by cancer folks for dry mouth and seems to help.  </li>
            <li> Put one in your maouth,chew it up and the dry mouth is gone.</li>
            <li> I keep a pack by the bed and will chew one if I wake up during the night with the dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Great-tasting mint that relieves dry mouth ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Relieves dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have severe problems with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> After i tried these I found that they did get rid of dry mouth.</li>
            <li> When my mouth gets dry, I just rub my tongue over the mint.</li>
            <li> bought the mints for my Mom who is on a lot of prescription medicine and it makes her mouth very dry, she says the mints help her a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The mints have helped a lot and even helps, if only a little, with some of the nausea.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint while teaching it takes several per hour.</li>
            <li> This may be due to the rough texture.</li>
            <li> I just got my second order this past week</li>
            <li> Frankly, I got tired of having to keep using them and the taste got old.  </li>
            <li> For those of us using CPAP machines to deal with our sleep apnea dry mouth can be really bad, so this is a product worth trying.</li>
            <li> I tried one pack myself and while the item is a little pricey, they help a lot.  </li>
            <li> No more stinky breath and no more dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> My Father suffers from &amp;#34;Dry Mouth&amp;#34; and he says that these mints work really well for him.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little difficult to get out of the package and sometimes I have to upend the box several times to get a mint out.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding these</li>
            <li> Slowly dissolves over the course of the night.  </li>
            <li> These mints are no better or worse than anything you buy in the store.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the mints are just average.  </li>
            <li> The price for this pack of 8 boxes is just ridiculous because to buy them retail is around $7 - $8 PER</li>
            <li> My husband was addicted to them and broke his habit.</li>
            <li> Really stupid that the opening is so small that you have to shake it over and over to get a piece or two out.</li>
            <li> They also contain artificial sweetener.</li>
            <li> Give it a week and your bad breath is GONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> Supposed to suck and not chew but I always forget and accidentally chew</li>
            <li> These mints are no better or worse than anything you buy in the store.  Definitely don&#x27;t last long or prevent dry mouth for long.</li>
            <li> Smart mouth mints work!  No more stinky breath and no more dry mouth.  It has a refreshing taste.  It is east to carry in a pocket or purse.  I got my order within 2 days.  The item was really well packaged!!  I am happy with this purchase.  If I had it to do again...I would.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product!!!!</li>
            <li> They are okay.  Didn&#x27;t realize I was buying an entire box of them.  But they&#x27;ll get used.</li>
            <li> These sugar free mints are an excellent after meal supplement for those who use SmartMouth mouthwash. They use the same zinc ion technology to enhance fresh breath.</li>
            <li> These are handy breath mints that last just a bit longer than others.  Best for me is that this mint flavor does not aggravate my GERD which is often triggered by eating mint (spearmint, peppermint).</li>
            <li> My husband was addicted to them and broke his habit. We really enjoyed them!!</li>
            <li> None of the advertised products (Biotene) for dry mouth worked for me.  The SmarMouth mints helped, but as soon as they melted, I had to use another mint.  Frankly, I got tired of having to keep using them and the taste got old.  I&#x27;m still using them, however, because I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works.  Even my doctor couldn&#x27;t prescribe anything for this problem.</li>
            <li> The mints are working well for me they help a lot with my dry mouth and the taste is good</li>
            <li> These melt a lot faster than most mints and they aren&#x27;t very minty tasting. They also contain artificial sweetener. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Keeps my breath fresh.</li>
            <li> I thought these were really unremarkable, and they feel dry when I put them in my mouth. This may be due to the rough texture. I think Ice Chips or sugar-free mint cough drops are way better. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll finish these off over time, but they&#x27;re just three-star mints for me, nothing special at all.</li>
            <li> i suffer from dry mouth from medication I have to take and the mints work well to relieve the dry mouth issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the mouthwash for a couple of years and think it&#x27;s the best on the market for taste and longevity.  Unfortunately, the mints are just average.  Same wonderful taste as the mouthwash, but doesn&#x27;t pack the same punch and staying power.</li>
            <li> Tastes great, not sure about the 12 hr. &amp;#34;freshness.&amp;#34; time will tell...</li>
            <li> You get eight packs for under 25.00, which is a great price, and they work in conjunction with the Great Mouth mouthwash. They are not overpowering mints, like some, but taste great, dissolve away fairly quickly and leave your breath fresh. I just got my second order this past week and they last a good long while, about six months for me, so its an inexpensive investment in your breath.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why but as I grew older I have suffered with dry mouth, which even my dentist has commented on.  I have tried a number of products with not the best results.  Then I discovered this product on Amazon and thought it would be worth a try.  Especially because there are so many situations when using a special mouth wash like Biotene or its generic equivalents is not practical.  I have been impressed with these sugar free mints, and like that I could get this product on the subscribe and save system here.  It is also easy to put one in your mouth as you go to bed and let it slowly dissolve.  For those of us using CPAP machines to deal with our sleep apnea dry mouth can be really bad, so this is a product worth trying.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding these but so happy they were on Amazon! I got a great deal too! I had radiation treatments over 20 years ago and left me with a dry mouth but these work!</li>
            <li> This product is refreshing and contains NO aspartame!!  You heard it here.  I carry them everywhere,  they have replaced gum, candy.. etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to aspartame.. so this really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Smart Mouth!!</li>
            <li> Smart mouth is a winner in our house!  Does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Does the job.  Have reordered.</li>
            <li> My mouth was consistantly dry from medications. I sing in a hour and this was a real problem. These mints saved the day.</li>
            <li> Recommended by cancer folks for dry mouth and seems to help.  As one can not go back in time and see with and then without if any differences were felt.</li>
            <li> I have had these before.They do a great job almost instantly.Put one in your maouth,chew it up and the dry mouth is gone.I keep a pack by the bed and will chew one if I wake up during the night with the dry mouth.</li>
            <li> the best of mints I have tried and you can really feel them working as a breath mint</li>
            <li> Really stupid that the opening is so small that you have to shake it over and over to get a piece or two out.</li>
            <li> This product is the best and actually works like it says it does.  I have the mouthwash and toothpaste also.  The price for this pack of 8 boxes is just ridiculous because to buy them retail is around $7 - $8 PER BOX!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the mouthwash is the morning and at night, the toothpaste in the morning and if needed the mints during the day.  Give it a week and your bad breath is GONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the mints for my Mom who is on a lot of prescription medicine and it makes her mouth very dry, she says the mints help her a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest everyone to get the whole system and you can buy a smaller set before spending the money on the regular size.  It is not cheap, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> Fresh breath for anytime you are in doubt. Handy to have.</li>
            <li> Seem to work well great taste.</li>
            <li> Just as good as xylimelts but cost much less. Use every night.</li>
            <li> My favorite breath mints...I have these on an auto delivery....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works the whole 12 hours.  Still it&#x27;s a nice product that delivers what it advertises.  Much better than Therabreath, Listerine, Scopre, gums of all kinds, and other expensive stuff.  I wish there was an easy way to combine both bottles, though.  Perhaps a 2 chamber design for the bottle in the future???</li>
            <li> Not so great. Love Smints&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My Father suffers from &amp;#34;Dry Mouth&amp;#34; and he says that these mints work really well for him. I have not tried them myself.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product, I initially thought it was gum that I ordered so I was disappointed. But this product works well with the Smart Mouth Mouthwash. Minty fresh. I also bought the new cinnamon mouthwash, which I haven&#x27;t tried (haven&#x27;t received yet)&lt;br /&gt;So I will write a review after I try it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the products on the market for nighttime relief of dry mouth. I would have given this product five stars. The problem with these mints is that they are gritty.  I still use them at night, however, I find the gritty feeling in my mouth interferes with speaking during the day. I also find I have to use two minutes at night. This is fine because they do not leave a brown and sticky stuff on my teeth and gums that I have to immediately brush off when I rise in the morning. If you&#x27;ve tried it many of the nighttime mints you know which brand I am writing about.</li>
            <li> Great-tasting mint that relieves dry mouth ... highly recommend, along with Smart Mouth Rinse.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry mouth</li>
            <li> This is a long lasting dry mouth relief mint.  When I get ready for bed I like to put one of these between my cheek and gums.  Slowly dissolves over the course of the night.  If I wake in the night and it has all ready melted away - I tuck another one in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relieves dry mouth.  Mild flavor.  Makes your mouth and breath feel fresh.  No residue left after the mint is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice container to carry in purse or pocket.  I keep a pack with me at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought the 6 pack of this mint and put one in each of my purses and in the car, too. They are a very nice, tasty, milder mint. Yet they work great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Really works.</li>
            <li> Best mint out there!!! They are habit forming...can&#x27;t try just one!  When I awake with a dry mouth in the middle of the night they are the best.  I always keep them on my nightstand.  Instant help!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long as the mouthwash itself, but they are great in between.  Mine is caused by meds and is gnarly.  This is by far the only effective mint.  But you must try the mouthwash itself.  This is only in addition to.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have severe problems with dry mouth.  These mints have helped me tremendously.  The packaging is very handy, it is a low calorie product (and no sugar) and I can use them whenever.  I always have a pack with me.  I am also delighted that I can buy them in quantity.  And they taste good without being too strong.  Marian</li>
            <li> These are great, along with sugar-free gum and Biotene gel, to get me through my days and nights of dry mouth. They&#x27;re a little difficult to get out of the package and sometimes I have to upend the box several times to get a mint out. But they work very well.</li>
            <li> I bought the product because i. Like smart mouth mouth wash. After i tried these I found that they did get rid of dry mouth. My only complaint while teaching it takes several per hour.</li>
            <li> These mints works the same as other mints but cost a lot more. It does not really last long in mouth either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three different brands. These are, by far, the absolute best. When I put one in my mouth, I push it up between my teeth and my gum. When my mouth gets dry, I just rub my tongue over the mint. They last a really long time that way. Also buying the 8-pk is a good savings.</li>
            <li> Bought these for chemo patient.  I tried one pack myself and while the item is a little pricey, they help a lot.  The person for whom they were purchased asked if I had tried them and I said yes.  He also liked them even though he was skeptical.  The mints have helped a lot and even helps, if only a little, with some of the nausea.  He was glad to get them and thanked us for them.  Now if they work like this for everyone, I wouldn&#x27;t know.  Each person is different with chemo and each chemo treatment is different.  This is one person&#x27;s opinion on this use for the mints.  I figure if it helps just a little, that&#x27;s better than not trying anything at all.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love these. They are especially good in the middle of the night when you have a dry mouth and don&#x27;t want to get up and get a drink of water.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry, nice dispenser, works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and can&#x27;t be carrying around a bottle of water with me. These mints do double duty in relieving my dry mouth and freshening my breath. Very pleased with them.</li>
