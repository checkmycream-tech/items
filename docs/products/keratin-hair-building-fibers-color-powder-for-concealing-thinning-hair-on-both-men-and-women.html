            <li>Keratin Hair Building Fibers/Color Powder is great useful product for people who need the help.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many people complimented me on my hair, saying how nice and full it looked!  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you do not apply on a damp scalp and make sure your hair is</li>
            <li>The colors blend perfectly with my wife&#x27;s hair, but that&#x27;s an individual thing.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re pleased with this product and intend to continue using it.  </li>
            <li>I like this product better than others because it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>The product that worked the best for me for the last two years was from &amp;#34;Joan Collins&amp;#34; but truth be told it was time consuming to use in my case.</li>
            <li>This product works well to cover and blend the areas on top that have thinned.</li>
            <li>I am sure to re-order before I run out.</li>
            <li>I received this product to review for free or at a promotional price in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I used Strand yesterday for the first time and felt very confident.</li>
            <li>and it looks full again!</li>
            <li>The coloring was easy for me</li>
            <li>The product sure is a confidence builder, I love it very much.</li>
            <li>Although I have fine hair, I do not suffer from hair loss.  </li>
            <li>always had fine hair.</li>
            <li>this product is excellent  if your hair needs a little help.  </li>
            <li>I am getting a little more skilled every day and I am so happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color match isn&#x27;t perfect for my natural brown/blonde hair color (sincerely considering dying my hair to match this product), but it only matters if I apply a lot of this product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>So we tried this product and find it does the job just fine, making the thinning areas appear full again.  </li>
            <li>It covered my bold spot and gave me volume.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making possible that I can cover my bold spots and be confident!</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and I received very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I put it on the part in my hair and it makes my fine hair look so much fuller.  </li>
            <li>This a great product it covers up the missing patches and makes my hair look fuller</li>
            <li>Works so well easy to apply does not rub-off and washes out fast and is exactly like the product listing.</li>
            <li>I have seen people with finer hair, but I&#x27;m right up there</li>
            <li>and right now I&#x27;m going through the &amp;#34;all of my hair is falling out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and I am now switching to Strand Maximizer.</li>
            <li>Matched my hair exactly and adds lots of volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and actually  had a hair transplant as well.</li>
            <li>Well he didn&#x27;t want to try it at first</li>
            <li>After chemo my hair starting to grow but still have bold spot specially in front.  </li>
            <li>If I spend an hour doing my hair, it looks nice down for about an hour.</li>
            <li>The results make me as happy as I have ever been with my hair: my hair actually looks fuller (the hair building fibers bring the hair up and keep it from laying flat against my scalp) and provide a soft camouflage that keep the appearance of my scalp from peeking through.</li>
            <li>The powder is very light weight,stays on the area without being brushed off, and gives full coverage until the next shampooing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays fast until the next shampoo.  </li>
            <li>: I have had fine hair my entire life.</li>
            <li>Works great for everyday use or just as an occasional filler for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fuller, looks fuller, takes much longer to appear greasy and I no longer to the bald crease check every time I walk by a mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks again ~  </li>
            <li>You must choose carefully or buy more than one color so you can blend them on application.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>matches really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons</li>
            <li>and it really worked ,</li>
            <li>She is experiencing some hair loss as she gets older from perming, straightening, and coloring her hair for all of these years.  </li>
            <li>Takes a few tries but once you figure it out, the results are great.  </li>
            <li>;: Anyone with fine hair knows that the wash your hair every other day trick just doesn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li>If I spend ten minutes doing my hair, it looks good down for about ten minutes.</li>
            <li>and I found the medium brown was too dark, but light brown worked better, especially when the salon color begins to fade a bit after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost completely bald.  </li>
            <li>Surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast the merchant is efficient,  just placed my second order.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the results I achieved with this product are way better than I expected and will be less time consuming for me.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I have just started using it, and so far I really like it!</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t really thinning other than age related thinning, but it really made it look thicker.</li>
            <li>Also, it is much cheaper than other hair fillers that are on the market now.</li>
            <li>When the average amount of hair grease gets on my fine little hairs, it shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally realized that I can never get my old hair back and should focus on what I have left.</li>
            <li>I used to have super thick hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I found this product to be a very good value for the price. It provides excellent coverage to thinning areas of your hair. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Summary: These colored keratin hair building fibers &amp;#34;bandaid&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been waiting for. My hair feels fuller, looks fuller, takes much longer to appear greasy and I no longer to the bald crease check every time I walk by a mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brief history: I have had fine hair my entire life. I have seen people with finer hair, but I&#x27;m right up there If I spend an hour doing my hair, it looks nice down for about an hour. If I spend ten minutes doing my hair, it looks good down for about ten minutes. So lets just say I&#x27;m a hair up kind of girl. (And yes I have done all the shampoos, texturizing treatments, weird haircuts that are supposed to help, and blow drying tricks with which help a little).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems continue: Though I don&#x27;t have patches of hair loss, over the past few years I have had increasing difficulty keeping my scalp from showing through my loosely pulled back hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34;: Anyone with fine hair knows that the wash your hair every other day trick just doesn&#x27;t work for us. When the average amount of hair grease gets on my fine little hairs, it shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Strand Keratin Hair Building Fibers impact&lt;br /&gt;I use this a bit differently than someone with bald patches would: I apply right after I blow dry (and as touch up as needed) to the areas of my scalp that are vulnerable to showing through. I pulse/wave my fingers from my scalp up through the base of my hairs. The results make me as happy as I have ever been with my hair: my hair actually looks fuller (the hair building fibers bring the hair up and keep it from laying flat against my scalp) and provide a soft camouflage that keep the appearance of my scalp from peeking through. The color match isn&#x27;t perfect for my natural brown/blonde hair color (sincerely considering dying my hair to match this product), but it only matters if I apply a lot of this product. I am getting a little more skilled every day and I am so happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus surprise: these little fibers must absorb or prevent oil from accumulating because my hair fluffy (not greasy) hair look is lasting longer that it ever has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchange for my unbiased review.nt oil from accumulating because my hair fluffy (not greasy) hair look is lasting longer that it ever has.

            <li> Although I have fine hair, I do not suffer from hair loss.  Therefore, I never would have thought to purchase this, and didn&#x27;t even know it existed.  However, it was offered to me at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, and boy am I glad I did!! This stuff is amazing!  I put it on the part in my hair and it makes my fine hair look so much fuller.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many people complimented me on my hair, saying how nice and full it looked!  I&#x27;ve tried volumizing products to try to make my hair look fuller but nothing ever worked. Who knew what a difference it would make just by covering up my part?  I gave it to my mother to try and it worked wonders for her, too.  She is experiencing some hair loss as she gets older from perming, straightening, and coloring her hair for all of these years.  She is going to buy one now!&lt;br /&gt;Just recently I found out about this product and now I don&#x27;t leave home without putting it on! I suggest that you try it, too!</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my hair! It covered up balding areas effortlessly and is well-worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the best thinning hair concealer I have ever used. The coloring was easy for me b/c I have black hair, but I&#x27;ve been using concealers for years due to a thinning area on the crown of my head. It is completely undetectable even in sunlight that I am missing any hair. The price is very reasonable and I am now switching to Strand Maximizer. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Reasonably priced and I received very quickly.  I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again!  Thanks again ~  Rhonda</li>
            <li> Great product!  Just make sure you do not apply on a damp scalp and make sure your hair is&lt;br /&gt;very dry.</li>
            <li> Great product that reduces the appearance of thinning hair and is easy to use. Works great for everyday use or just as an occasional filler for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife who is elderly and losing hair.  I&#x27;m almost completely bald.  We&#x27;d contemplated buying her a wig but were advised they&#x27;re hot and uncomfortable.  So we tried this product and find it does the job just fine, making the thinning areas appear full again.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays fast until the next shampoo.  You need to apply hair spray after product application so it won&#x27;t come off.  The colors blend perfectly with my wife&#x27;s hair, but that&#x27;s an individual thing.  You must choose carefully or buy more than one color so you can blend them on application.  We&#x27;re pleased with this product and intend to continue using it.  It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and sure beats a hot uncomfortable expensive high-maintenance wig.  My wife think she looks younger now, and so do I.</li>
            <li> I used Strand yesterday for the first time and felt very confident. I used to have super thick hair but it&#x27;s thinning due to the medications I take. This product works great and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I use it correctly or if it just doesn&#x27;t work, but this doesn&#x27;t stick to the surface. It should have some kind of adhesive. If you touch it it rubs out and it will be all over.</li>
            <li> Surprised at how well it worked. Matched my hair exactly and adds lots of volume. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This product really works.Also, it is much cheaper than other hair fillers that are on the market now.Give it a try....</li>
            <li> I like this product better than others because it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch. My hair is salon color medium ash brown and I found the medium brown was too dark, but light brown worked better, especially when the salon color begins to fade a bit after a few weeks. So, in my opinion the brown colors run a bit dark. Other than that, I have just started using it, and so far I really like it!</li>
            <li> This a great product it covers up the missing patches and makes my hair look fuller it&#x27;s great I received this product at a discounted price to try and I am truly impressed very happy</li>
            <li> Awesome product...i like it</li>
            <li> Great Product, and seller was great too!  Will do business again!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Just love this! Works so well easy to apply does not rub-off and washes out fast and is exactly like the product listing. The delivery was fast the merchant is efficient,  just placed my second order.  Happy customer</li>
            <li> As good as advertised</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. Puffs up thinning&lt;br /&gt;hair &amp; camouflages scalp!!  Does everything a leading competitor does&lt;br /&gt;at a fraction of the cost! Extremely satisfied with this product!!</li>
            <li> I have a form of alopecia caused by brain trauma. I&#x27;ve tried many products and actually  had a hair transplant as well. I finally realized that I can never get my old hair back and should focus on what I have left. The product that worked the best for me for the last two years was from &amp;#34;Joan Collins&amp;#34; but truth be told it was time consuming to use in my case. When I saw all the great reviews on &amp;#34;Strand Maximizer&amp;#34; I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed and very happy with the ease of use. I will say that I will have a learning curve using the shaker rather than a brush but the results I achieved with this product are way better than I expected and will be less time consuming for me. If you are on the fence, give this a try, you may get a life changing surprise like I did. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> This is awesome, I had a baby a couple of months ago and right now I&#x27;m going through the &amp;#34;all of my hair is falling out&amp;#34; stage. I just brush a little bit on where my hair parts and it looks full again! This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try it out!</li>
            <li> My hair is short and close cropped. Its begging to look a bit &amp;#34;spotty&amp;#34;. This product works well to cover and blend the areas on top that have thinned. I&#x27;m using Strand Maximizer moderatly, so  it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34;  up or get on my face or neck.  It also washes out in the shower without a shampoo,.I am sure to re-order before I run out. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;PM</li>
            <li> After chemo my hair starting to grow but still have bold spot specially in front.  My stylist recommended I try this product and it is amazing!  It covered my bold spot and gave me volume.  It lasts all day!  Thank you for making possible that I can cover my bold spots and be confident!</li>
            <li> Takes a few tries but once you figure it out, the results are great.  Be patient until you figure out what works for you.</li>
            <li> I was super impressed with this product, looks great and feels natural! I never used anything to hide my thinning hair, but this works like a charm. My only wish is that it came in a larger size! I will keep buying in the future!</li>
            <li> great product  will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product, works great and fills in the thinning areas really well. As others mentioned just use some hair spray to lock it in and you are good all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;washes off easy&lt;br /&gt;fills in thinning areas&lt;br /&gt;color matches really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;none yet</li>
            <li> this product is excellent  if your hair needs a little help.  The color was perfect. my hairdresser suggested I try it and it really worked ,</li>
            <li> I got this for my son to try because his hair is thinning a little. Well he didn&#x27;t want to try it at first so I used it. I was happy with the results. It made my hair look fuller. My hair isn&#x27;t really thinning other than age related thinning, but it really made it look thicker. Then my son decided he wanted to give it a try. He thought it was awesome. He has now taken it from me for his own use. I think he will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product to review for free or at a promotional price in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Keratin Hair Building Fibers/Color Powder is great useful product for people who need the help. The powder is very light weight,stays on the area without being brushed off, and gives full coverage until the next shampooing. I feel my hair looks and feels noticeably thicker, fuller and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I always had fine hair. I recommend it to anybody who needs to look and feel ones very best. The product sure is a confidence builder, I love it very much. Only very little sprinkles are needed to finish the styling so the bottle goes a long way. It is a very good product for the money.</li>
