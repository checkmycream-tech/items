            <li>Awesome fast delivery by the super Amazon Prime delivery service.</li>
            <li>Never thought it would but sure does.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to find replacement blades for it since the shaver was bought in Asia.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>and I guess I should do this more often.</li>
            <li>Just wish they were cheaper as I&#x27;ve ordered many of these replacement blades over the many years I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li>But, are much more convenient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed to replace the blade or not.  </li>
            <li>I replaced foil and blade and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This is his favorite razor.</li>
            <li>I have even replaced the head cover and blades at the same time and results weren&#x27;t that impressive.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best price at the time I look to buy them.</li>
            <li>Obviously better than the ones I replaced.</li>
            <li>so many of these shaver are like 1/3 to 1/3</li>
            <li>Its better than what I had and what I had lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li>this razor is the best can not brag enough about it</li>
            <li>Sure, these replacement blades cut OK, but not as closely as the blades that originally came with the Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>rEPLACEMENT BLADES GOOD, BUT CANNOT GET A REALLY CLOSE SHAVE WITH THIS ELECTRIC SHAVER</li>
            <li>I can see why I should of paid more to get something like the original.</li>
            <li>Better than original  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re still as good as new, so</li>
            <li>Shaver works as good as new.  </li>
            <li>I popped the old blades out and popped the new ones in (VERY EASY TO DO!!!)</li>
            <li>Amazon was the cheapest I found so overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Are the replacement blades cheap knock off&#x27;s?</li>
            <li>Fit my shaver and seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>Comfortable</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>WITH ORIGINAL SHAVER.  </li>
            <li>I lost my original blade while shaking shavings into the trash can.</li>
            <li>(Also, since I can keep $20 worth of blades for a year, it&#x27;s cheaper too!)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>i would recomend this razor to anyone special if you have to shave your head</li>
            <li>I was slightly skeptical, but found that replacing the blade was very easy and they worked great!  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the saver in general.</li>
            <li>While the shave is better than my worn out blades, it is not by much.  </li>
            <li>I have had my Panasonic shaver for about five years it finally reached a point where it was not giving a good shave.</li>
            <li>My husband is thrilled to get his razor fixed.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t think it is any sharper then my 2 year old one, could of just kept it longer then.  </li>
            <li>Pretty easy to switch out too.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if these were exact matches or not when I ordered, but it was an exact match.</li>
            <li>I feel better knowing the blades are new.</li>
            <li>These weren&#x27;t easy to find at a reasonable price, but Amazon came through again.</li>
            <li>hair doesn&#x27;t grow that fast and is fairly fine.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase to replace these.</li>
            <li>I installed these blades and quickly noticed a big difference in shaving ability, seems to cut much closer and more easily.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much about the product : there are original replacement blades after all.</li>
            <li>They just pop right on, no screws or adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be surprised how nicely your shaver works with new blades.....</li>
            <li>I do know they are sharp, work great, and are cheaper than a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and easy to replace old blades.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>These are the factory standard replacement blades for many of the Panasonic Linear wet/dry electric razors.  </li>
            <li>Amazing what sharp blades can do, back in love with my electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Product was real panasonic and performed exactly as the blades that were replaced.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not too much you can say about a pair of replacement shaver blades.</li>
            <li>These blades fit my Panasonic ES8092NC Pro Curve Pro Curve wet/dry shaver I purchased here on Amazon back in Aug04.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a very close and even shave</li>
            <li>The cutters do a reasonable job, but could be sharper.  </li>
            <li>and I like that so much</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I replace the inner blades every six months for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>After 2 years of razor use the raplacement was much needed and it really made it feel like a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li>makes my 10-year-old razor new again!</li>
            <li>I replace the blades on my razor with these, and now my razor works like new!</li>
            <li>Tried them and they really bring new life to the electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My razor was 2 years old and was not gettinga close enough shave, even though I would spend 10 minutes trying to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that my beard is so wiry that I don&#x27;t ever get a clean shave, but a couple new blades and a new foil come close enough to giving me that close-to-smooth shave</li>
            <li>but I really have never kept track of which one lasts longer between blade replacements and in my opinion they a pretty much equal in that reguard..  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic is still going strong and actually like it a little better than the Braun but use each on alternate weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have had this Panasonic shaver for many years (probably at least 6 or more) and this is only the second time I have changed the blades.</li>
            <li>but these blades also fit other Panasonic shaver models.</li>
            <li>I renew the life of the shaver by getting new blades every 5 years or so.</li>
            <li>Replacing the blades made it just like new.</li>
            <li>Made my razor new again.</li>
            <li>New blades make the shaver quieter and the shave smoother.  </li>
            <li>I was about to junk my razor until I bought these new blades.  </li>
            <li>and it is just like a new razor for a fraction of the cost of buying a new one.</li>
            <li>works just like when it was new</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li>Just like new again.  </li>
            <li>I never got into wet shaving but both work great as a dry beard shaver and wet cleanup.</li>
            <li>the blades were an exact match and simple to switch out.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>just unplug the old blade and insert the new one.</li>
            <li>After some research, I was pleasantly surprised that these replacement blades are compatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product came arrived a day late, otherwise I am pleased with the professionalism of the shipper and</li>
            <li>These are not as close as the old fashion blades.</li>
            <li>Love the product, blades lasted at least a year.  </li>
            <li>In seconds I can replace the old rezors with these</li>
            <li>The replacement blades really brought the razor back to life.  </li>
            <li>but, why do such simple blades have to be almost as much as the whole razor?  </li>
            <li>Purchased this blade set and WES9085PC (Outer Foil) for a four year old Panasonic that was not shaving well and getting noisy.  </li>
            <li>new blades are actual Panasonic brand, made in Japan and the quality seems high.</li>
            <li>My razor is back to new again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of silly to write a review on the factory standard blades for an electric razor, but I have to say that I really like the Linear.</li>
            <li>The new blades rejuvenated my Panasonic shaver and brought back the close shave.  </li>
            <li>Works like a champ and brings my ES8043 back to new shaving performance.  </li>
            <li>I have replaced my shaver blades before and the results didn&#x27;t seem all that different from my old blades.  </li>
            <li>Rather than buy a new entire razor system, he perferred to find parts for his current model.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure why these blades are that much better that my previous sets and they were from the same source and brand.</li>

            <li> I got a very close and even shave</li>
            <li> The cutters do a reasonable job, but could be sharper.  </li>
            <li> and I like that so much</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I replace the inner blades every six months for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> After 2 years of razor use the raplacement was much needed and it really made it feel like a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li> makes my 10-year-old razor new again!</li>
            <li> I replace the blades on my razor with these, and now my razor works like new!</li>
            <li> Tried them and they really bring new life to the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My razor was 2 years old and was not gettinga close enough shave, even though I would spend 10 minutes trying to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that my beard is so wiry that I don&#x27;t ever get a clean shave, but a couple new blades and a new foil come close enough to giving me that close-to-smooth shave</li>
            <li> but I really have never kept track of which one lasts longer between blade replacements and in my opinion they a pretty much equal in that reguard..  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic is still going strong and actually like it a little better than the Braun but use each on alternate weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have had this Panasonic shaver for many years (probably at least 6 or more) and this is only the second time I have changed the blades.</li>
            <li> but these blades also fit other Panasonic shaver models.</li>
            <li> I renew the life of the shaver by getting new blades every 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> Replacing the blades made it just like new.</li>
            <li> Made my razor new again.</li>
            <li> New blades make the shaver quieter and the shave smoother.  </li>
            <li> I was about to junk my razor until I bought these new blades.  </li>
            <li> and it is just like a new razor for a fraction of the cost of buying a new one.</li>
            <li> works just like when it was new</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Just like new again.  </li>
            <li> I never got into wet shaving but both work great as a dry beard shaver and wet cleanup.</li>
            <li> the blades were an exact match and simple to switch out.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> just unplug the old blade and insert the new one.</li>
            <li> After some research, I was pleasantly surprised that these replacement blades are compatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product came arrived a day late, otherwise I am pleased with the professionalism of the shipper and</li>
            <li> These are not as close as the old fashion blades.</li>
            <li> Love the product, blades lasted at least a year.  </li>
            <li> In seconds I can replace the old rezors with these</li>
            <li> The replacement blades really brought the razor back to life.  </li>
            <li> but, why do such simple blades have to be almost as much as the whole razor?  </li>
            <li> Purchased this blade set and WES9085PC (Outer Foil) for a four year old Panasonic that was not shaving well and getting noisy.  </li>
            <li> new blades are actual Panasonic brand, made in Japan and the quality seems high.</li>
            <li> My razor is back to new again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of silly to write a review on the factory standard blades for an electric razor, but I have to say that I really like the Linear.</li>
            <li> The new blades rejuvenated my Panasonic shaver and brought back the close shave.  </li>
            <li> Works like a champ and brings my ES8043 back to new shaving performance.  </li>
            <li> I have replaced my shaver blades before and the results didn&#x27;t seem all that different from my old blades.  </li>
            <li> Rather than buy a new entire razor system, he perferred to find parts for his current model.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why these blades are that much better that my previous sets and they were from the same source and brand.</li>
            <li> I can notice the improvement in the cut, particularly with a little water or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> And they are lasting as long as the originals.  </li>
            <li> They last a really long, long time.  </li>
            <li> No more pulling with these, so they&#x27;re pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li> My old blades were pulling the hair just a little bit, so I knew it was time to replace them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> I know that is to long between intervals.</li>
            <li> Takes too long...</li>
            <li> This is a repeat order as long as I have the razor.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a Brawn series 3 340s-4 a few years back as a possible replacement should the ES8043 ever die.  </li>
            <li> But I also knew the blade was 2 years old with very little use.  </li>
            <li> an were less money than buying them at my local WalMart.</li>
            <li> I never changed the blades on my Panasonic wet dry shaver.....</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if they are as sharp as the originals, it&#x27;s been way too long.</li>
            <li> careful when you shake off the shavings.</li>
            <li> they do cut just not very well.</li>
            <li> No much but some.</li>
            <li> I would have to shave every other day if I didn&#x27;t work from home</li>
            <li> The razor blades do not seem to hold up and stay as sharp for a longer period of time as they did a year or so ago.</li>
            <li> On the Panasonic you also need to replace the micro screen about every other blade replacement time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order a foil and blades because that combo pack is as expensive as a new razor.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> Received the replacement blades on time and my shaves are smoother, cause less skin irritation and take much less time now!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little bit of plastic and metal.</li>
            <li> Close shave now in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Only stays sharp a few months, and the blades are expensive.</li>
            <li> It is a less expensive razor than some others, such as the Norelco RQ10, and the replacement is 1/2 that of the Norelco.</li>
            <li> so I can usually go a week</li>
            <li> not sure why they recommend replacing the outer foil (not included in this pack) because the foil doesn&#x27;t seem like something that would wear out.</li>
            <li> I do not know why people still use ordinary razors.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how dull my blades were until I could run a finger over them without any resistance.</li>
            <li> I got these this morning on a Saturday, one day late.</li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IS CUTTING.  </li>
            <li> IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND AN ELECTRIC SHAVER THAT ACTUALLY CUTS WISKERS.  </li>
            <li> This razor has been there for me through thick and thin.</li>
            <li> thought the razor was dying as had to spend a lot of time and go over and over to get mediocre shave</li>
            <li> The info on the link is wrong.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the item...</li>
            <li> I WISH THE MANUFACTURERS OF SHAVERS WOULD CONCENTRATE ON CUTTING RATHER THAN ALL THE NON ESSENTIALS.</li>
            <li> I did notice a change in cutting.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that bad of a shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wee bit disappointed.</li>

            <li> IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF GREED IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND AN ELECTRIC SHAVER THAT ACTUALLY CUTS WISKERS.  BOUGHT THIS AFTER 1 YR. WITH ORIGINAL SHAVER.  AS EXPECTED VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IS CUTTING.  I WISH THE MANUFACTURERS OF SHAVERS WOULD CONCENTRATE ON CUTTING RATHER THAN ALL THE NON ESSENTIALS.</li>
            <li> the blades were an exact match and simple to switch out.  After 2 years of razor use the raplacement was much needed and it really made it feel like a brand new razor.  Amazon was the cheapest I found so overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I got the blades for my razor  I purchased at Amazon three years ago and popped them in just to test and got the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.  I&#x27;m 65 years old and have a heavy beard so I couldn&#x27;t believe that without water or pre electric  stuff shave was great, best ever with an electric and close to non electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the razor was dying as had to spend a lot of time and go over and over to get mediocre shave but it was the blades.  I&#x27;m getting another pair now that i realize how this shaver should work.  It never, never, since day one, shaved this close.</li>
            <li> This was a pair of replacement blades for the Panasonic electric shaver Model ES8092. The cost for the blades was $19.60 plus $4.90 (shipping and handling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well. There&#x27;s not too much you can say about a pair of replacement shaver blades. I think the cost and convenience to purchase this type of thing makes sense over the internet rather than try to find them at a store.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time and as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t easy to find at a reasonable price, but Amazon came through again. My razor is back to new again!</li>
            <li> I just replaced these blades with the originals.  You can see they are not designed as well as the originals.  I will not get 7 years out of these blades.  While the shave is better than my worn out blades, it is not by much.  Guess I will have to stock up on Lectric Shave.  BTW, this shaver is awesome and I am still on the original batteries.</li>
            <li> Makes quite a difference in shaving when you replace these. Never thought it would but sure does. Worth the purchase to replace these.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a National ES8093 Shaver. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to find replacement blades for it since the shaver was bought in Asia. After some research, I was pleasantly surprised that these replacement blades are compatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades get noticeably duller in about a year but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when you shake off the shavings. The blade attaches to shavers via a magnet. I lost my original blade while shaking shavings into the trash can.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Sure, these replacement blades cut OK, but not as closely as the blades that originally came with the Panasonic shaver. I&#x27;m a wee bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is a less expensive razor than some others, such as the Norelco RQ10, and the replacement is 1/2 that of the Norelco. I am satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> What can you say about razor blades....they fit and worked great an were less money than buying them at my local WalMart.</li>
            <li> Received the replacement blades on time and my shaves are smoother, cause less skin irritation and take much less time now! Happy face!  Wish I had replaced the blades lot sooner.</li>
            <li> The blades are very easy to install and work well.  My old blades were pulling the hair just a little bit, so I knew it was time to replace them.  No more pulling with these, so they&#x27;re pretty sharp.  I&#x27;ve had them a month and they&#x27;re still as good as new, so I will assume they&#x27;ll last me quite a while.  If you get these and your razor still isn&#x27;t performing well, then maybe it&#x27;s time to replace your foil as well.</li>
            <li> makes my 10-year-old razor new again! super-easy to replace</li>
            <li> Just replacement blades for my shaver........ will see how they work.....</li>
            <li> These blades fit my Panasonic ES8092NC Pro Curve Pro Curve wet/dry shaver I purchased here on Amazon back in Aug04.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t grow that fast and is fairly fine. I would have to shave every other day if I didn&#x27;t work from home so I can usually go a week (but I also shave my head). I have to replace these blades every 8mos to a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if they are as sharp as the originals, it&#x27;s been way too long. I do know they are sharp, work great, and are cheaper than a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Hey,what&#x27;s going on? I ordered replacement inner blades for my ES8068 and they are not the same. This razor has been there for me through thick and thin. I did not notice till after I opened the pack. I been buying through Amazon for a while now. I buy all my text books here with never a problem. Are the replacement blades cheap knock off&#x27;s? The originals are like freaken Samurai swords in quality when compared to the ones I bought here. I&#x27;m so dissapointed with Amazon. You are the middle man. Fix this!!!!! The info on the link is wrong.</li>
            <li> These are the factory standard replacement blades for many of the Panasonic Linear wet/dry electric razors.  They last a really long, long time.  I have to admit that my beard is so wiry that I don&#x27;t ever get a clean shave, but a couple new blades and a new foil come close enough to giving me that close-to-smooth shave, that I can truly say that the Panasonic Linear cuts closer than a manual.  (Also, since I can keep $20 worth of blades for a year, it&#x27;s cheaper too!)  It&#x27;s kind of silly to write a review on the factory standard blades for an electric razor, but I have to say that I really like the Linear.</li>
            <li> I have had my Panasonic razor now for about 10 years. I renew the life of the shaver by getting new blades every 5 years or so. I know that is to long between intervals. I got these this morning on a Saturday, one day late. Tried them and they really bring new life to the electric shaver. I got a very close and even shave and I guess I should do this more often.</li>
            <li> Great product. I replace the inner blades every six months for a clean shave. I always order the blades through Amazon. Never a problem with ordering and delivery. I will continue to replace the blades through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say it on the box or product description but these blades also fit other Panasonic shaver models. Specifically models ES 7035 and ES 7037 (the one I have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new blades are actual Panasonic brand, made in Japan and the quality seems high. Installation is a snap. They just pop right on, no screws or adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why they recommend replacing the outer foil (not included in this pack) because the foil doesn&#x27;t seem like something that would wear out. I didn&#x27;t order a foil and blades because that combo pack is as expensive as a new razor.</li>
            <li> After changing the blade on my Panasonic razor, it shaves as close as a Gillette Fusion. It was an excellent investment,</li>
            <li> I was thinking about going back to a safety razor since I was no longer getting a close enough shave from my Panasonic electric shaver.  I then realized that I&#x27;ve had the Panasonic razor for 16 months and I&#x27;ve never changed the blade so I ordered the replacement blade.  The installation was a breeze.  These are OEM blades from Panasonic; not knock-offs.  The new blades rejuvenated my Panasonic shaver and brought back the close shave.  I especially noticed the closer shave under the chin which was my problem area.</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the price. I can see why I should of paid more to get something like the original. they do cut just not very well. Takes too long...I have to shave over the same spot until all my hair is cut.</li>
            <li> I replace the blades on my razor with these, and now my razor works like new! I suggest replacing the blades once a year or so. It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Fit my shaver and seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> The razor blades do not seem to hold up and stay as sharp for a longer period of time as they did a year or so ago.</li>
            <li> Fit was perfect and they cut better than the factory ones!!!! Will recommend to my friends!!</li>
            <li> I have had my Panasonic shaver for about five years it finally reached a point where it was not giving a good shave. Replacing the blades made it just like new.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit.  Work great.</li>
            <li> The cutters do a reasonable job, but could be sharper.  The shave still leaves some stubs that you feel, especially underneath the chin.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ and brings my ES8043 back to new shaving performance.  Just wish they were cheaper as I&#x27;ve ordered many of these replacement blades over the many years I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic shaver.  I also purchased a Brawn series 3 340s-4 a few years back as a possible replacement should the ES8043 ever die.  The Panasonic is still going strong and actually like it a little better than the Braun but use each on alternate weeks.  On the Panasonic you also need to replace the micro screen about every other blade replacement time. The Braun replacement is screen and blade combined as one unit.  The Braun in theory has a longer blade life but I really have never kept track of which one lasts longer between blade replacements and in my opinion they a pretty much equal in that reguard..  I never got into wet shaving but both work great as a dry beard shaver and wet cleanup.</li>
            <li> Made my razor new again. Works great</li>
            <li> The product came arrived a day late, otherwise I am pleased with the professionalism of the shipper and the product was perfectly what had been ordered. Would repeat the order and would recommend the product and service to all. SS</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be surprised how nicely your shaver works with new blades.....</li>
            <li> New blades make the shaver quieter and the shave smoother.  These do that.  Still doesn&#x27;t help with the jawline problem, but what the hey.</li>
            <li> These are not as close as the old fashion blades. But, are much more convenient.</li>
            <li> Love the product, blades lasted at least a year.  Best price around and easy to find.  This is a repeat order as long as I have the razor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s from Panasonic and lasts for 2 years. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> works great and great value for money.  Perhaps best wet/dry electric shaver</li>
            <li> Working great this is what I want.</li>
            <li> Indispensable replacement parts for an excellent electric razor.</li>
            <li> Great. Just what I hoped for. Inexpensive and easy to replace old blades. Should have done it&lt;br /&gt;years ago !</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed to replace the blade or not.  It wasn&#x27;t that bad of a shave.  But I also knew the blade was 2 years old with very little use.  My father used it for maybe 100 shaves.  I replaced foil and blade and glad I did.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if these were exact matches or not when I ordered, but it was an exact match.</li>
            <li> I have had this Panasonic shaver for many years (probably at least 6 or more) and this is only the second time I have changed the blades. I am very pleased with the saver in general. I&#x27;m happy with the price and changing them was literally a snap. I can notice the improvement in the cut, particularly with a little water or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how dull my blades were until I could run a finger over them without any resistance. Pretty easy to switch out too.</li>
            <li> great seller  perfect product met my expectations</li>
            <li> Only stays sharp a few months, and the blades are expensive.</li>
            <li> I was about to junk my razor until I bought these new blades.  I forgot how close this razor shaves.  Wow!</li>
            <li> Could not find these anywhere in town. Fit perfectly, and was exactly as described. Arrived earlier than the estimated delivery time. Great product, great seller.</li>
            <li> My husband is thrilled to get his razor fixed.  Thank you for having the replacement parts.  This is his favorite razor.</li>
            <li> My razor was 2 years old and was not gettinga close enough shave, even though I would spend 10 minutes trying to get a smooth shave. I popped the old blades out and popped the new ones in (VERY EASY TO DO!!!) and it is just like a new razor for a fraction of the cost of buying a new one. Close shave now in just a few minutes.Received the blades on time when prommissed!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> Fit the razor well and provides a good shave. So so priced.</li>
            <li> I do not know why people still use ordinary razors.  In seconds I can replace the old rezors with these and they last for over a year.  My shave is done in about a minute tops.</li>
            <li> Product was real panasonic and performed exactly as the blades that were replaced.  I would buy these again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my shaver blades before and the results didn&#x27;t seem all that different from my old blades.  I have even replaced the head cover and blades at the same time and results weren&#x27;t that impressive.  I installed these blades and quickly noticed a big difference in shaving ability, seems to cut much closer and more easily.  I am not sure why these blades are that much better that my previous sets and they were from the same source and brand.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of razor improvement.</li>
            <li> Works like they are supposed to</li>
            <li> The replacement blades really brought the razor back to life.  I&#x27;ll buy these again!</li>
            <li> awesome parts. works just like when it was new</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my razor.  Amazing what sharp blades can do, back in love with my electric shaver.</li>
            <li> These are perfect replacements. And they are lasting as long as the originals.  Can&#x27;t find any issues with these or the originals.</li>
            <li> Better than original  my razor when I got it did not cut close these do and I like that so much</li>
            <li> Thought it would be sharper, but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the item... but, why do such simple blades have to be almost as much as the whole razor?  It&#x27;s just a little bit of plastic and metal.</li>
            <li> According to my Dad, these things work well in his razor.</li>
            <li> rEPLACEMENT BLADES GOOD, BUT CANNOT GET A REALLY CLOSE SHAVE WITH THIS ELECTRIC SHAVER</li>
            <li> Work as well as you would expect.</li>
            <li> Replacement parts for my son&#x27;s razor.  Rather than buy a new entire razor system, he perferred to find parts for his current model.  Razor is working fine and it was great to find the parts needed on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Been using this electric shaver for years.  Can&#x27;t do without these replacement parts.  Simply the best price at the time I look to buy them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about the product : there are original replacement blades after all. Excellent service by the seller, product arrived sealed in its original packaging in record time across the border.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the blades on my panasonic shaver.  I did this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a new razor.  I was slightly skeptical, but found that replacing the blade was very easy and they worked great!  Just like new again.  Great way to avoid buying throw away razor blades.</li>
            <li> No hassle. Does it&#x27;s job. Obviously better than the ones I replaced.</li>
            <li> I worked on my ancient panasonic electric shaver.  To be honest, I don&#x27;t think it is any sharper then my 2 year old one, could of just kept it longer then.  Just not sur emy the blade for so many of these shaver are like 1/3 to 1/3 the price of the shaver it self.</li>
            <li> I never changed the blades on my Panasonic wet dry shaver.....ever (like 5 years) I saw these and and said &amp;#34;Oh, these are replaceable?&amp;#34; So I got some. I did notice a change in cutting. No much but some. Its better than what I had and what I had lasted 5 years. Two blades came in the package so its a great deal. 8 months later and no issues. I feel better knowing the blades are new.</li>
            <li> Purchased this blade set and WES9085PC (Outer Foil) for a four year old Panasonic that was not shaving well and getting noisy.  Purchased separately as it was a bit cheaper than the combination set.  Shaver works as good as new.  Awesome fast delivery by the super Amazon Prime delivery service.</li>
            <li> A replacement that I get every 5 months.  Works great. I will continue to buy and use these blades.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with reasonable price! Arrived on time as promised and works great. Very easy to install. just unplug the old blade and insert the new one.</li>
            <li> this razor is the best can not brag enough about it i would recomend this razor to anyone special if you have to shave your head</li>
            <li> Comfortable but it takes a lot off time to shave with the shaver... But fits well in the machine, and works good.</li>
            <li> I use &amp;#34;Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3-Blade Nanotech Wet/dry Rechargeable Shaver,&amp;#34; and it is good to know it has a replacement for the Shaver. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. So far so good.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with my purchase items came well packed and on time.price was very good i will be shopping at this store again</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then projected and does what they are supposed to. Have been using the same Panasonic razor for 6 years now.</li>
