            <li> Only down side is the mesh inside its hard</li>
            <li> but I thought the material could be a little heavier</li>

            <li> The fabric is plenty thick though.  </li>
            <li> Useless to me at this point.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed!</li>

            <li> I like the design and fabric BUT there is no padding what so ever. I got it to carry glass oil bottles in but probably won&#x27;t use it much because of no padding to protect the glass bottles. A little disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very cute bag for my essential oils.  Seems to be made well but I thought the material could be a little heavier but all in all I feel I will enjoy this bag.  Bought it for traveling!  Received promptly and package well.</li>
            <li> Perfect Size for every use and keeps my oils organized.</li>
            <li> practical to carry essential oils</li>
            <li> Love the fabric. Only down side is the mesh inside its hard the get the bottles out with ease. But it does what it needed to.</li>
            <li> Would definitely order again</li>
            <li> was a gift, she loves it.  :)</li>
            <li> Great product! Now I need to get oils to fill it. Thank you for the quick delivery.</li>

            <li> Great for traveling and protecting essential oil bottles. Each bottle is held upright in its own compartment. The pattern and style is really nice as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice bag but I was hoping for vinyl lining just in case the oils leaked.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping and it is perfect for carrying my Young Living Oils and a 2 oz bottle of carrier oil. It fits perfectly in my coach purse so I can have my favorite oils with me at all times. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Was exactly as I needed. I love it and have used it on many trips so far.</li>
            <li> This is so perfect for carrying Young Living Essential Oils in your purse!  Even fits the longer bottle like Deep Relief.  I will be recommending this product to all my YL friends!</li>
            <li> So pretty. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great price! Holds oils perfectly</li>
            <li> Love the size and quality.  The pockets seem very well made and I think will last a long time.  Zipper is good quality too.  Only suggestion to Improve would be a little bit of padding quilted in.  The fabric is plenty thick though.  Just might be nice for a little buffer when carrying in my purse with other things.

            <li> Great product &amp; service was quick!</li>
            <li> Love it! Great deal at a great price! I have 2!</li>
            <li> Holds 10 vials 5-15ml and even some in between so I&#x27;ve been able to hold about 14-15 bottles at a time. Was perfect when traveling. Also love the design!</li>
            <li> Nice bag for my oils, arrived in a very timely manner ad in great condition. Thanks</li>
            <li> It does is job but I&#x27;m looking for something better...</li>
            <li> This is a really safe way to travel with your oils. I even used it to bring some oils over to a friends home to let her try some. I have even put a larger glass spray bottle in it and stood it upright in bag to keep it from breaking or spilling.  I only wish it came in brown instead of black..</li>
            <li> This is a great bag; it is even better in person! The shipping was also super fast! Thank you for a smooth transaction :).</li>
            <li> Just what I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Flimsy material &amp; structure. Not accurate with picture</li>
            <li> Zipper broke shortly after I first used it. Useless to me at this point.</li>
