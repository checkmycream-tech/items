            <li>They&#x27;re easy to cut and I would recommend them to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;best</li>
            <li>I wanted little ones, so I was very happy....</li>
            <li>and I doubt they would fit even the smallest nails.</li>
            <li>but cut then in half you have perfect tips, cut them up and they can be added to any nail are or just pasted whole over the nail.</li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>I love this product novelty of the new styles for nails, the problem with this product is that it brings and really use a guide is needed.</li>
            <li>I received these very fast.</li>
            <li>First time ordering, even hearing, about fimo canes.</li>
            <li>it was exactly like it was described, wish it was pre cut for easier use while doing my nails.</li>
            <li>Yeah, I absolutely would !</li>
            <li>I bought two packages of the canes and have the other package to cut nicely still.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I was very upset about my results.</li>
            <li>The canes are awesome got my craft knife and started cutting slices.</li>
            <li>Sticks are about 2 inches long, and you can fit about 3 slices on your one fingernail....</li>
            <li>these canes are good, vibrant color and strong just a little smaller than what i expected.</li>
            <li>the like are much better deals as its cute to have a little 3d cherry as opposed to this odd animal print block hanging off your finger.</li>
            <li>Of the 10 canes I got a white square cane with the Baby Phat design &amp; words (was an added plus) and two other designs that are nice as well.</li>
            <li>In the picture it looks a lot larger that when I received, But if you think about it than the art would not look right on the nail.  </li>
            <li>My final review is they handled the situation very well</li>
            <li>They are super small, and you have to actually cut them yourself (which is a total pain) with a knife or razor.</li>

            <li> I do not recommend this product, because does not make sense, are to big to use it as 3D stickers and too small to use as complete sticker</li>
            <li> There are no instructions for use with the product and it takes a long time to ship.  </li>
            <li> ... i thought they were a bunch of nail stickers in long cases</li>
            <li> so if you are expecting 2 inch around, and 5 inch long, you will not like these....</li>
            <li> The package came earlier than I had expected!</li>
            <li> expected it to be a little longer in length, i guess i didn&#x27;t read the description properly</li>
            <li> I ordered this product expecting to get animal designs, I got one leopard design and the rest were not animal print, i got an american flag, 3 weird line designs, then a blue block design and a pink design.... and a few others which also wern&#x27;t</li>
            <li> A little tuff to cut through, i</li>
            <li> When they emailed me back I felt they were very rude</li>
            <li> These are rather hard, but uncooked I believe.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Money wasted.</li>
            <li> In addition even cutting these with a very sharp razor and getting them super thin</li>
            <li> And lets not forget that if you do it wrong and the piece is to big , that piece is now wasted.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival of the item i was VERY unhappy with the product right away.</li>
            <li> not sure what the heck you use them for or how</li>
            <li> The sticks are so hard I couldn&#x27;t even cut it them.</li>
            <li> Thus product sucks.</li>
            <li> comes in  VERY small hard blocks and were not usable to me</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!!</li>
            <li> The rods are very small and thin.</li>
            <li> When they found this out they then emailed me and asked if they could fix the problem in any way and then told me to keep the product and refunded my money anyhow, as long as I took my bad review of them off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> these are irrelevant for nails and does not work.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I wrote a bad review</li>
            <li> verrryyyy dissapointed :(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> First time ordering, even hearing, about fimo canes. Received them after watching youtube tutorials. Love the 3D affect they give when I do nails!</li>
            <li> Love this product a lot! The patterns are just amazing.The colors are absolutely amazing and a great reasonable price I might add :)</li>
            <li> Did not come with any instructions so I do not know how to use them. Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Thus product sucks. The sticks are so hard I couldn&#x27;t even cut it them. I wouldn&#x27;t record them at all.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use them and it came with no instuructions. I had bought two packs because I do my nails all the time and had planned on using them. I just couldn&#x27;t figure out what to do with them. Money wasted. DON&#x27;T BUY</li>
            <li> it was exactly like it was described, wish it was pre cut for easier use while doing my nails. thanks</li>
            <li> I thought they were bigger, but theyre smaller than your pinky but theyre beautiful and look great. A little tuff to cut through, i</li>
            <li> these canes are good, vibrant color and strong just a little smaller than what i expected. but cut then in half you have perfect tips, cut them up and they can be added to any nail are or just pasted whole over the nail. they make up in cuteness tho!!</li>

            <li> OMG!!!  If you do nail art or any arts &amp; crafts THESE ARE SOOOOOO amazing!!  The size is perfect lots of variety!!  Love these!</li>
            <li> These canes are so beautiful! They are perfect for nail art and so cute. They&#x27;re easy to cut and I would recommend them to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;best fimo canes I&#x27;ve ever purchased...</li>
            <li> INOT STICKERS!  The rods are very small and thin. I was very upset about my results. I definatly will not buy again. How are you supposed to cut them anyways</li>
            <li> Is a good design, but the forms doesn&#x27;t help for making a good cut</li>
            <li> IT DOESNT WORK AT ALL, I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS TO A FRIEND, MY GIRLFRIEND SAYS IT JUST DOES NOT WORK</li>
            <li> Received my product quickly and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> these are irrelevant for nails and does not work. comes in  VERY small hard blocks and were not usable to me</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to my nail art collection.  I can not wait to use these with some of my designs. Excellent price and fast delivery. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> There are no instructions for use with the product and it takes a long time to ship.  this is not a product i would order again.</li>
            <li> I received these very fast. They are adorable. I will order more from this company.  11 11 11 1 1</li>
            <li> I love this product novelty of the new styles for nails, the problem with this product is that it brings and really use a guide is needed.</li>
            <li> not sure what the heck you use them for or how... i thought they were a bunch of nail stickers in long cases but they are these werid bendy sticks... whats the point?</li>
            <li> I like them but they are way smaller than I thought they would be. So I just cut them up into hearts or stripes. Wish they were bigger though.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival of the item i was VERY unhappy with the product right away. Needless to say I wrote a bad review and I emailed the seller and asked them  a couple questions about it. When they emailed me back I felt they were very rude so I concluded that I wanted to return the item and i wanted my money back. When they found this out they then emailed me and asked if they could fix the problem in any way and then told me to keep the product and refunded my money anyhow, as long as I took my bad review of them off of Amazon. My final review is they handled the situation very well and I am happy with the end result..,would o buy fimo canes again ? Probably not, would I shop the seller again? Yeah, I absolutely would !</li>
            <li> liked it it came in a timely fashion was excited to get it can&#x27;t wait to use them they look cool</li>
            <li> This is not at all what I thought it was. They are super small, and you have to actually cut them yourself (which is a total pain) with a knife or razor. Plus they dont give you all animal prints, its whatever goes in the bag!! Dont waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product expecting to get animal designs, I got one leopard design and the rest were not animal print, i got an american flag, 3 weird line designs, then a blue block design and a pink design.... and a few others which also wern&#x27;t animal.. verrryyyy dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> These are not big enough to cover the width or length of any of my fingernails and I doubt they would fit even the smallest nails. In addition even cutting these with a very sharp razor and getting them super thin they still were not flexible and could not conform to the shape of my nails. All in all the actual ones that are shaped like flowers and the like are much better deals as its cute to have a little 3d cherry as opposed to this odd animal print block hanging off your finger.</li>
            <li> I like the fimo blocks but I think I will stick with the Fimo Canes. They are alot more easier.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product, because does not make sense, are to big to use it as 3D stickers and too small to use as complete sticker</li>
            <li> love love love!! would recommend to al my friends!! cant wait to do my nails and my three daughters nails!!</li>
            <li> Came quick and fun to use, thanks for your great service and product, hope everyone has fun with it lol</li>
            <li> These are rather hard, but uncooked I believe. You need to be a great cutter to get many out of these. Sticks are about 2 inches long, and you can fit about 3 slices on your one fingernail....so if you are expecting 2 inch around, and 5 inch long, you will not like these....I wanted little ones, so I was very happy....I do suggest getting an ergo shaped exacto knife, so you don&#x27;t have sore fingers. You can fine that on Amazon too!</li>
            <li> does not fit over whole nail tip and you need a razor cut pieces of it off. And lets not forget that if you do it wrong and the piece is to big , that piece is now wasted.</li>
            <li> The package came earlier than I had expected! The canes are awesome got my craft knife and started cutting slices. Of the 10 canes I got a white square cane with the Baby Phat design &amp; words (was an added plus) and two other designs that are nice as well. I bought two packages of the canes and have the other package to cut nicely still. I will buy from this supplier again in the future.</li>
