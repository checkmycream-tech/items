            <li>Best brush I ever uses worth the investment</li>
            <li>This brush has a very handsome finish.</li>
            <li>This brush was amazing.</li>
            <li>This brush is an amazing brush.</li>
            <li>But still a nice brush.</li>
            <li>Originally i chose it cause its cheaper and its cqp, seems like a good choice.</li>
            <li>but I just love how Amazon has everything on point.</li>
            <li>I was better off getting a dianne.</li>
            <li>Since this purchase I have bought 3 more brushes from &amp;#34;CQP&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Thanks Great Brush.</li>
            <li>I love the shape and feel.</li>
            <li>This is the best brush money can possibly buy.</li>
            <li>Great brush 4 real wavers....</li>
            <li>and now I have the mahogany ceaser softy love this brush</li>
            <li>The brush is good, but when I first got it the bristles fell out every time I used it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and love the mahogany.</li>
            <li>The quality is outstanding &amp; the contour to the brush helps to accurately hit weaker areas.</li>
            <li>Love the brush, quick shipping .</li>
            <li>lol the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is this</li>
            <li>These are very good brushes that go out of stock often, this one is soft but not to soft.</li>
            <li>The price is worth the results.</li>
            <li>This fresh Mahogany CQP Soft Brush will leave you looking fresh!</li>
            <li>I love Diane (8119 to be specific) but (CQP) is all about quality &amp; effectiveness.</li>
            <li>the first day i recieve this brush the bristles fell out and the brush split.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipment!</li>
            <li>the top an bottom ends cracked open</li>
            <li>I was Reading other reviews about these brushes and it kind of made me hesitant plus</li>
            <li>Covers more of your head with less brushing.... .... ..</li>
            <li>The sides have been slightly channeled for better grip.</li>
            <li>but that happens to every new brush I buy anyway</li>
            <li>I got it and within the first brushing session, plenty of waves were finally breaking it, i still like my dianes though</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and can see results in less than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I think the Soft is firmer than the medium.</li>
            <li>Overall if your a person who wants waves, it&#x27;ll do the trick.</li>
            <li>Beware buyers, I bought this brush (soft)</li>
            <li>but after going strong for six weeks my waves are spinning hard haven&#x27;t been like this since high school an that was ten years ago....</li>
            <li>all in all this is a very good brush if your serious about waves you need to get this brush ASAP!!!!</li>
            <li>Get your hair right in just a few strokes trust me</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars only because I couldn&#x27;t get a half to make 4.5 because at first some of the bristle was falling out</li>
            <li>but when I got it, the box said soft on the outside with a sticker but it was too hard to be a soft brush, I later removed the sticker to find out that on the box it was really labeled as \\&quot;Hard\\&quot;.</li>

            <li> My only beef is the limited supply or lack of availability.</li>
            <li> This Caesar Soft Brush is for an on the go everyday use, but don&#x27;t forget to add the Premium Med/Soft, or Medium Brush to your collection.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hoping CQP can come back out with the Crown Hard in White again (A must have!)</li>
            <li> I use it everyday multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> This is a pricey brush, but for me it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> It covers a wide area while brushing your head, more-so than the Dianne, Annie, and wave enforcers.</li>
            <li> It looks used and beaten up but other than that</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking hard about buying another one just in case the same thing to happen again.</li>
            <li> A Black Man knows Black hair!</li>
            <li> I have the emerald green crown and ceaser premium</li>
            <li> I have the onyx black hard ceaser..</li>
            <li> The brush conform see ahead and gives you waves 75% faster than usual</li>
            <li> The beauty about the Medium is that you can use it as a Hard brush as well</li>
            <li> Ppl complained about bristles falling out!</li>
            <li> poor quality for all that money.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product and with poor shipping and handling packaging</li>
            <li> but you really can&#x27;t go wrong with cqp..</li>
            <li> I washed the brush under cold and</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Would purchase again.  Definitely help define waves. Easy to use and love the mahogany. Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Love the brush, quick shipping . I use it everyday multiple times a day. These are very good brushes that go out of stock often, this one is soft but not to soft. Perfect</li>
            <li> This brush was amazing. Originally i chose it cause its cheaper and its cqp, seems like a good choice. I got it and within the first brushing session, plenty of waves were finally breaking it, i still like my dianes though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from CQP before but I just love how Amazon has everything on point. This brush is an amazing brush. The quality is outstanding &amp; the contour to the brush helps to accurately hit weaker areas. Both the Caesar &amp; Crown brushes come second to none. I love Diane (8119 to be specific) but (CQP) is all about quality &amp; effectiveness. This Caesar Soft Brush is for an on the go everyday use, but don&#x27;t forget to add the Premium Med/Soft, or Medium Brush to your collection. Definitely great additions so that you can rotate during your wave sessions! They all have their individual purposes. The beauty about the Medium is that you can use it as a Hard brush as well but I&#x27;m hoping CQP can come back out with the Crown Hard in White again (A must have!) This fresh Mahogany CQP Soft Brush will leave you looking fresh!</li>
            <li> the first day i recieve this brush the bristles fell out and the brush split. poor quality for all that money. I was better off getting a dianne.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best brush I have in my collection. This brush gives great results. My waves were in but since have deepened and are bolder, if that makes sense.Since this purchase I have bought 3 more brushes from &amp;#34;CQP&amp;#34;. I also bought a couple for my lil&#x27; cousins trying to get waves. The price is worth the results.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!! Would buy another if I lost this brush! Great quality! Fast Shipment! Does it&#x27;s job! Try it for yourself</li>
            <li> Thanks Great Brush. Every thing that i was expecting was in the brush i would definently reccommend this brush to anyone trying to get waves.</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever uses worth the investment Ppl complained about bristles falling out! but Hey!!!! it&#x27;s just anything else that u have to break in</li>
            <li> I think the Soft is firmer than the medium. But still a nice brush. I love the shape and feel.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush money can possibly buy. The brush conform see ahead and gives you waves 75% faster than usual so of course There is a reason for everybody like it.</li>
            <li> Great brush 4 real wavers....does what its supposed 2 do. Covers more of your head with less brushing.... .... ..</li>
            <li> The brush is good, but when I first got it the bristles fell out every time I used it. Since then they have stopped. Overall if your a person who wants waves, it&#x27;ll do the trick. I have since given up my ambitions.</li>
            <li> Beware buyers, I bought this brush (soft) but when I got it, the box said soft on the outside with a sticker but it was too hard to be a soft brush, I later removed the sticker to find out that on the box it was really labeled as \\&quot;Hard\\&quot;. I will keep it and no doubt it&#x27;s a great brush but I&#x27;m thinking hard about buying another one just in case the same thing to happen again.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my son because he is into waves.  He loves it.  The brush has a curve to it that is perfect for the contours of your head.  Definitely a quality product.</li>
            <li> This brush does what it says it would do if you do t believe me check out my Instagram page an see for yourself @mrmotorcitynellz after two weeks I started to see something but after going strong for six weeks my waves are spinning hard haven&#x27;t been like this since high school an that was ten years ago....lol the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is this I washed the brush under cold and the top an bottom ends cracked open it shouldn&#x27;t be doing this after three weeks but all in all this is a very good brush if your serious about waves you need to get this brush ASAP!!!!</li>
            <li> Yet another winner by Cqp..  This is my sixth cqp brush and it completes my set I have the royal blue medium  crown and ceaser ..  I have the onyx black hard ceaser.. I have the emerald green crown and ceaser premium and now I have the mahogany ceaser softy love this brush but you really can&#x27;t go wrong with cqp.. Shot out to the designer /owner Robert Watson brilliant design</li>
            <li> It will change your life! Best brush on the market! Get your hair right in just a few strokes trust me</li>
            <li> Bar-none the best brush i ever put in my head period if anyone was to ask this is the brush to get i have all four brushes an all of them meet or exceeded my expectations out of the product</li>
            <li> The best brush that I even used I started seeing waves in about a week must get brush if ur trying to get waves</li>
            <li> I was Reading other reviews about these brushes and it kind of made me hesitant plus the price but i had a lil extra cash so i was like what the hell and I must say I LOVE!!!!! the brush and I plan on ordering another one when they are back in stock. I gave it 4 stars only because I couldn&#x27;t get a half to make 4.5 because at first some of the bristle was falling out but that happens to every new brush I buy anyway but all in all good brush</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and can see results in less than 3 weeks. The only problem is the quality of the box that they give it to me in. It looks used and beaten up but other than that, it&#x27;s an awesome brush for every waver.</li>
            <li> This is a pricey brush, but for me it was money well spent. A Black Man knows Black hair! This brush has a very handsome finish. It&#x27;s elliptical or football shaped, and contoured. The sides have been slightly channeled for better grip. It covers a wide area while brushing your head, more-so than the Dianne, Annie, and wave enforcers. My only beef is the limited supply or lack of availability. Even if you&#x27;re not growing waves this is the brush to get. Go ahead and spend the money for a quality product and call it day!</li>
            <li> I ordered the product and with poor shipping and handling packaging my brush was stolen I&#x27;ve contacted. Them and they never responded but the toke my money</li>
