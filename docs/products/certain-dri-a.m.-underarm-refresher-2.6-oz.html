            <li>I love that it comes in a 2 pack.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more when I run out.</li>

            <li>so I was glad to find it on here.</li>

            <li>This Certain Dri AM Stick is the perfect pairing with the PM Roll-On, and it is also a great choice as a standalone deodorant/antiperspirant for someone without excessive sweating.</li>

            <li>This is no so easy to find in stores because it is never in stock.</li>
            <li>I received the product very quickly.  </li>
            <li>you get both a strong antiperspirant  and deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>A good standalone product for people with average sweat…and a good compliment to the PM Roll-On.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rather than using a scent that was more masculine or feminine, the scent chosen was clean &amp; fresh, so this will work great for both guys and gals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Theisproduct is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that is fresh and appropriate for both guys and girls.</li>

            <li>sweat a bit more than others, partly because I work in an office that tends to be hot</li>
            <li>Use w/ the original formal applied at night for optimal effect.</li>
            <li>It also allows me to utilize a 2-product system so that each product can better target certain scenarios.</li>
            <li>It also allows me to utilize a 2-product system so that each product can better target certain scenarios.</li>
            <li>is their daily-use stick product that contains both an antiperspirant AND a deodorant, and is often considered more gentle on skin than the AM Roll-On.</li>
            <li>Helps me continue to feel fresh &amp; sweat free.</li>
            <li>WELL DOES CERTAIN DRI’S AM DEODORANTS WORK???&lt;br /&gt;While the PM Roll-On is the workhorse of the Certain Dri family, this deodorant is an effective product.</li>
            <li>This product is tremendous.  </li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>This one is smooth and last all day love it</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful cruelty-free product with almost the same amount of aluminum as &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; type antipersperants from other brands who test on animals.</li>
            <li>yeah right...</li>
            <li>I find it rather better than Mitchum which was my previous favorite.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that has worked for me and its great it comes in a solid</li>
            <li>I use a lotion by a different company on a regular basis, but this product is a great in between.  </li>
            <li>For someone with more significant sweating issues, this most likely won’t be enough and you will want to pair it with the Certain Dri PM Roll-On.</li>
            <li>For someone with more significant sweating issues, this most likely won’t be enough and you will want to pair it with the Certain Dri PM Roll-On.</li>
            <li>someone without significant sweating issues, this AM Stick is probably capable of being your standalone deodorant and working really well.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily start with it, if other, cheaper brands work for you, but let&#x27;s face it, having a good deodorant is a necessity!</li>
            <li>The roll on for me is much better and provides the same results.</li>
            <li>I order  the first  one and resive the 2 one tow times</li>
            <li>It is effective, it has a mildly clean scent, and it helps avoid excessive irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pairs perfectly with the roll on and dramatic difference within a week!</li>
            <li>Works well with the PM Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>the Certain Dri Roll-On Anti-Perspirant 1.2 Fl Ozs.</li>
            <li>the Certain Dri Roll-On Anti-Perspirant 1.2 Fl Oz and just use that.</li>
            <li>I was recommended Certain Dri’s PM Roll-</li>
            <li>Certain Dri Clinical Strength Anti-Perspirant Roll-On” AKA the PM</li>
            <li>It does not have a scent and is a pure antiperspirant (i.e., not a deodorant.)</li>

            <li>I have been using the combination of Night and Day Certain Dri products for about a month</li>
            <li>Certain Dri absolutely works.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t sweat as much.</li>
            <li>For real.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>and it gives additional antiperspirant action as well as a fresh scent to get through the day.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not as aggressive of an antiperspirant as the Roll-On version, but it is still quite capable.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other product but the scent is nothing to O write home about</li>
            <li>It felt like sometimes using this took away what the normal Certain Dri was suppose to do.</li>
            <li>It’s antiperspirant action is comparable to many other premium over-the-counter antiperspirants, but is nowhere near as strong as the Certain Dri PM products above.</li>

            <li>Both do a great job at avoiding irritation, but I have generally chosen the stick as I find it to be the least irritating, which makes it a good pair with the PM Roll-On so that you minimize the chance the stronger product causes</li>

            <li>My husband uses this and likes is much better than the brand he used previously (Degree for men)  </li>
            <li>Buy it and enjoy being dry and not having to worry about embarrassing pit stains.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this AM</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this AM Stick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of antiperspirants, many with the same effective ingredient at the same percentage, but since they go on thinly, they don&#x27;t protect me.</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t had to try anything new since.  </li>
            <li>So while it does the heavy lifting, it needs to be paired with a deodorant made for more frequent usage.</li>
            <li>It comes in a light blue &amp; white box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also comes in a light blue &amp; white box, and this listing is for this</li>
            <li>However, Certain Dri’s PM Roll-On is a standalone antiperspirant, and one generally applied on a 48-72 hour schedule.</li>
            <li>IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO ON CLEAR!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete miracle!</li>
            <li>I accidentally was only using this one at first &amp; saw some results.</li>
            <li>Although my underarms are not perspiring, I find the refresher necessary as with my arms down at my sides most of the day, bacteria (in the form of odor) does occur.  </li>
            <li>This leaves white residue in pretty much all shirts that I own, which got annoying very quickly.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the vendor had shipped the antipersperant with the new packaging, rather than the old one.</li>
            <li>Dri’s PM Roll-On is one of the few products I have used that TRULY works through a strong antiperspirant action.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri has been the only deodorant that I have found to work for me.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri Clinical Strength Solid Anti-Perspirant”</li>
            <li>but the thing is sometimes it doesn&#x27;t go on clear.</li>
            <li>Much prefer the solid version.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one I can really trust</li>
            <li>Certain Dri’s PM Roll-On took a major problem that bothered me immensely and totally &amp; completely resolved it.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not one of them - I live near a river in an already humid climate, and spring is soon approaching!</li>
            <li>I historically would have to specifically only buy certain color shirts, and refrain from taking my outer coat off because I felt it was noticeable.</li>
            <li>As a cruelty-free product user, it&#x27;s hard to find deodorant that actually works, because many people have forgone the use of aluminum in their antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Certain Dri AM underarm refresher daily since 2007 along with the PM solid version (which i only use 2 times per week).  </li>
            <li>Dri offers 4 different products:&lt;br /&gt;---1.</li>
            <li>Apparently it works for some people, just not me.  </li>
            <li>It lasts longer than the others and doesn&#x27;t need to be applied at night like the other Certain Dri.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the other formula &amp; have really seen a difference.</li>

            <li> For real.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> and it gives additional antiperspirant action as well as a fresh scent to get through the day.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not as aggressive of an antiperspirant as the Roll-On version, but it is still quite capable.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other product but the scent is nothing to O write home about</li>
            <li> It felt like sometimes using this took away what the normal Certain Dri was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> It’s antiperspirant action is comparable to many other premium over-the-counter antiperspirants, but is nowhere near as strong as the Certain Dri PM products above.</li>

            <li> Both do a great job at avoiding irritation, but I have generally chosen the stick as I find it to be the least irritating, which makes it a good pair with the PM Roll-On so that you minimize the chance the stronger product causes</li>

            <li> My husband uses this and likes is much better than the brand he used previously (Degree for men)  </li>
            <li> Buy it and enjoy being dry and not having to worry about embarrassing pit stains.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this AM</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this AM Stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of antiperspirants, many with the same effective ingredient at the same percentage, but since they go on thinly, they don&#x27;t protect me.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t had to try anything new since.  </li>
            <li> So while it does the heavy lifting, it needs to be paired with a deodorant made for more frequent usage.</li>

            <li> It also comes in a light blue &amp; white box, and this listing is for this</li>
            <li> However, Certain Dri’s PM Roll-On is a standalone antiperspirant, and one generally applied on a 48-72 hour schedule.</li>
            <li> IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO ON CLEAR!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete miracle!</li>
            <li> I accidentally was only using this one at first &amp; saw some results.</li>
            <li> Although my underarms are not perspiring, I find the refresher necessary as with my arms down at my sides most of the day, bacteria (in the form of odor) does occur.  </li>
            <li> This leaves white residue in pretty much all shirts that I own, which got annoying very quickly.</li>

            <li> Dri’s PM Roll-On is one of the few products I have used that TRULY works through a strong antiperspirant action.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri has been the only deodorant that I have found to work for me.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri Clinical Strength Solid Anti-Perspirant”</li>
            <li> but the thing is sometimes it doesn&#x27;t go on clear.</li>
            <li> Much prefer the solid version.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I can really trust</li>

            <li> I historically would have to specifically only buy certain color shirts, and refrain from taking my outer coat off because I felt it was noticeable.</li>
            <li> As a cruelty-free product user, it&#x27;s hard to find deodorant that actually works, because many people have forgone the use of aluminum in their antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Certain Dri AM underarm refresher daily since 2007 along with the PM solid version (which i only use 2 times per week).  </li>
            <li> Dri offers 4 different products:&lt;br /&gt;---1.</li>
            <li> Apparently it works for some people, just not me.  </li>
            <li> It lasts longer than the others and doesn&#x27;t need to be applied at night like the other Certain Dri.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the other formula &amp; have really seen a difference.</li>
            <li> “Everyday Strength Certain Dri AM Underarm Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Roll-On”&lt;br</li>
            <li> “Everyday Strength Certain Dri AM Underarm Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Solid”&lt;br</li>
            <li> After going through every brand in the stores (even clinical strength protections), I found that this is the one that actually keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> Not only for keeping you dry</li>
            <li> It definitely keep you very dry.</li>
            <li> I have to use the other solid you apply at nigh as well.  </li>
            <li> Got this, and I am always dry in the armpit.</li>
            <li> This product keeps him dry all day, where before he was always having problems with underarm wetness throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> My daughter uses the PM version of this product and loves how it keeps her dry.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dry</li>
            <li> I stay perfectly dry all day every day regardless of my stress level or the weather conditions.  </li>
            <li> but the AM works every single day.</li>
            <li> I used to soak every shirt, limited to black or white to hide it.</li>
            <li> Friend recommended this item - stopped within two days and haven&#x27;t had an issue in over a year and a half  since starting to use.</li>
            <li> On (found in a green and white box) and everything changed.</li>
            <li> It comes in a green and white box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes in a green &amp; white box also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are stronger than any other over the counter product we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> One in Germany and rhe other one as soon as I got back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dri’s PM Roll-On is used by me only at night and usually every other day.</li>
            <li> It cured the frustrating condition on the young teenager</li>
            <li> I used to have armpit sweat all the way down my shirt.</li>
            <li> Due to medicine I created an excessive sweat.</li>

            <li> This deodorant is getting hard to find in non on-line store</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> It stops at least 95% of my sweating and now I can wear any color shirt</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> This was a factory second with a terrible odor.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy from a different seller</li>
            <li> I hate how &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; other deodorants feel and don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a heavy sweater, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Useless, so I ended up throwing both away.</li>
            <li> Take it from a person who tried everything and failed.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it was really bad.</li>
            <li> Anyone who suffers knows it embarrassing and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> (and my husband sweats a lot), but it also keeps you from smelling bad throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was disgusting!</li>
            <li> I went from nasty man playing hockey player arm pits to no smell at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great compliment to the PM stuff</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant ever! This is the only one I buy now. I used to have armpit sweat all the way down my shirt. Got this, and I am always dry in the armpit. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sweat as much. Big difference.Used for 2 months but saw a change within a days of using it. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that the vendor had shipped the antipersperant with the new packaging, rather than the old one. This is a wonderful cruelty-free product with almost the same amount of aluminum as &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; type antipersperants from other brands who test on animals. As a cruelty-free product user, it&#x27;s hard to find deodorant that actually works, because many people have forgone the use of aluminum in their antiperspirant. I&#x27;m not one of them - I live near a river in an already humid climate, and spring is soon approaching! This product keeps the sweat at bay, and has a pleasant smell too. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve used so far but the thing is sometimes it doesn&#x27;t go on clear.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works for me.  I have to use the other solid you apply at nigh as well.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Broke out with a rash so I don&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> Has always worked great for me but need to use with the Certain Dri  night time product.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried everything in the store, and when he came across this on amazon he figured he would give it a try.  He hasn&#x27;t had to try anything new since.  This product keeps him dry all day, where before he was always having problems with underarm wetness throughout the day.  He would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Look I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I started using this product about 4 years ago. Prior to this product I could not find anything to combat my armpit funk for several years. Seriously, it was really bad. I&#x27;d stain my sweaters and the smell was disgusting! I was so embarrassed. I became so self conscience about it to the point I sprayed perfume on myself constantly. When my friend told me about this product I was like yeah right...it was a God send. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I went from nasty man playing hockey player arm pits to no smell at all. I tried the PM but it burns but the AM works every single day. I&#x27;m so grateful for this product and I hope this helps others who are combating the hockey player pit syndrome.</li>
            <li> Theisproduct is fantastic. It works better than any other product but the scent is nothing to O write home about</li>
            <li> I have been using this Certain Dri AM underarm refresher daily since 2007 along with the PM solid version (which i only use 2 times per week).  It is the only deodorant/antiperspirant that stops underarm sweat.  For real.  The PM version actually stops the sweating.  I use the AM version as a refresher just as it is aptly named.  Although my underarms are not perspiring, I find the refresher necessary as with my arms down at my sides most of the day, bacteria (in the form of odor) does occur.  I can safely add that I no longer pit out my blouses even on the hottest of summer days.</li>
            <li> Works very well. My only problem is with the scent. My nose does not find it pleasant.</li>
            <li> IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO ON CLEAR! WELL, GUESS WHAT? IT DOESN&#x27;T! IT RUINED MY CLOTHES! IT SMELLS GOOD FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF HOURS, THEN MY ARMPITS START SMELLING LIKE MILK! DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
            <li> I have hyperhidrosis and have tried every brand over the counter as well as some prescription. This is the only thing that has worked for me and its great it comes in a solid and I don&#x27;t have to apply it at night. This is no so easy to find in stores because it is never in stock. I love that it comes in a 2 pack. I plan on buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Successfully does what it&#x27;s intended for , husband and son love this product! Highly recommend! We will be ordering more as needed</li>
            <li> Perfect deodorant for intense swet</li>
            <li> Good product but they sent roll-on, not solid as stated on picture.  Much prefer the solid version.  This deodorant is getting hard to find in non on-line store</li>
            <li> Due to medicine I created an excessive sweat. Anyone who suffers knows it embarrassing and uncomfortable. Friend recommended this item - stopped within two days and haven&#x27;t had an issue in over a year and a half  since starting to use. I use during the day and the roll on at night!</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to purchase!!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses the PM version of this product and loves how it keeps her dry.  We couldn&#x27;t find the AM version at our local store so we needed to buy it through Amazon.  The AM help is a great deodorant.  Combined with the PM you get both a strong antiperspirant  and deodorant.  They are stronger than any other over the counter product we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri has been the only deodorant that I have found to work for me. After going through every brand in the stores (even clinical strength protections), I found that this is the one that actually keeps me dry. Yes, it&#x27;s pricier, but if you&#x27;re struggling to find a deodorant that does it&#x27;s job, then definitely give this product a try! I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily start with it, if other, cheaper brands work for you, but let&#x27;s face it, having a good deodorant is a necessity!</li>
            <li> Item ordered did not match item received.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this product since we got it and he has been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I would like to try one unscented for the day.</li>
            <li> I used to buy them at walgreens when thet on sale. The price on Amazon was good also, so I decided to order it and stock up. So when I went to Germany this summer, I took it with me.....OMG,&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant smelled like a hair relaxer, horrible smell. Useless, so I ended up throwing both away. One in Germany and rhe other one as soon as I got back.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will buy from Walgreens. What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I use a lotion by a different company on a regular basis, but this product is a great in between.  It works well for me.</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly.  I love this deodorant.  It&#x27;s the only one I can really trust and I&#x27;ve used them all.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and likes is much better than the brand he used previously (Degree for men)  I&#x27;ve noticed that his clothes don&#x27;t have deodorant residue or carry the scent that the Degree stick used to release.  We like this much better</li>
            <li> The perfect refreshner. Also look for P.M.</li>
            <li> This has changed my life. I used to soak every shirt, limited to black or white to hide it. I can wear colors now. It&#x27;s like i CAN&#x27;T sweat. It&#x27;s a complete miracle! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Works well with the PM Certain Dri. Will buy again. Bought for our teen boys and they actually like it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the stick this time to give a try. I broke out in a rash after 4 days and returned it. Like others who cannot use the roll on, I cannot use the stick. The roll on for me is much better and provides the same results. Amazon refunded my money with no issues and I ordered the roll on.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product since it came out on the market. This is a good price. The scent is not overbearing, and the antiperspirant quality is excellent.I am happy to find Certain Dri here since it is often out of stock in stores.</li>
            <li> I order  the first  one and resive the 2 one tow times</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. I was using another clinical one before and it wasn&#x27;t working anymore. This one keeps you from pitting and smelling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best, hands down. Buy it and enjoy being dry and not having to worry about embarrassing pit stains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything and this works the best for me.  It lasts longer than the others and doesn&#x27;t need to be applied at night like the other Certain Dri.  I find it rather better than Mitchum which was my previous favorite.</li>
            <li> It really works. It definitely keep you very dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.  Not necessary though.  You can use any back up anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> Good effect but i prefer the stick</li>
            <li> This product is tremendous.  If you&#x27;re a heavy sweater, you will not be disappointed. It cured the frustrating condition on the young teenager</li>
            <li> I got this along side the Certain Dri Roll-On Anti-Perspirant 1.2 Fl Ozs. This is not as necessary to use. This leaves white residue in pretty much all shirts that I own, which got annoying very quickly. It felt like sometimes using this took away what the normal Certain Dri was suppose to do. Sometimes I would sweat when putting this on. I would just more so recommend the Certain Dri Roll-On Anti-Perspirant 1.2 Fl Oz and just use that.</li>
            <li> A good standalone product for people with average sweat…and a good compliment to the PM Roll-On.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain Dri’s PM Roll-On is one of the few products I have used that TRULY works through a strong antiperspirant action. That is, it dramatically reduces sweating, and hence dramatically reduces odors. However, Certain Dri’s PM Roll-On is a standalone antiperspirant, and one generally applied on a 48-72 hour schedule. So while it does the heavy lifting, it needs to be paired with a deodorant made for more frequent usage. The Certain Dri AM Stick is a great choice. It is effective, it has a mildly clean scent, and it helps avoid excessive irritation.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE NEED &amp; HOW I USE THE AM STICK&lt;br /&gt;I sweat a bit more than others, partly because I work in an office that tends to be hot and I wear a sports coat. I historically would have to specifically only buy certain color shirts, and refrain from taking my outer coat off because I felt it was noticeable. This bothered me. I was recommended Certain Dri’s PM Roll-On (found in a green and white box) and everything changed. It stops at least 95% of my sweating and now I can wear any color shirt I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain Dri’s PM Roll-On is used by me only at night and usually every other day. This AM Stick fills the gaps in that I can apply it in the morning prior to the day’s work and it gives additional antiperspirant action as well as a fresh scent to get through the day.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CERTAIN DRI PRODUCT OFFERINGS&lt;br /&gt;Certain Dri offers 4 different products:&lt;br /&gt;---1. “Certain Dri Clinical Strength Anti-Perspirant Roll-On” AKA the PM Roll-On&lt;br /&gt;This is their 72-hour antiperspirant and their strongest product, made for use before going to bed. It does not have a scent and is a pure antiperspirant (i.e., not a deodorant.) It comes in a green and white box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---2. “Certain Dri Clinical Strength Solid Anti-Perspirant” AKA the PM Stick&lt;br /&gt;This is their 72-hour antiperspirant designed to be gentler on skin than the roll-on, made for use before going to bed. It is not as aggressive of an antiperspirant as the Roll-On version, but it is still quite capable. It does not have a scent and is a pure antiperspirant (i.e., not a deodorant.) It comes in a green &amp; white box also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---3. “Everyday Strength Certain Dri AM Underarm Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Roll-On”&lt;br /&gt;This is their daily-use roll-on product that contains both an antiperspirant AND a deodorant. It has a light scent that is fresh and appropriate for both guys and girls. It’s antiperspirant action is comparable to many other premium over-the-counter antiperspirants, but is nowhere near as strong as the Certain Dri PM products above. It comes in a light blue &amp; white box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---4. “Everyday Strength Certain Dri AM Underarm Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Solid”&lt;br /&gt;This is their daily-use stick product that contains both an antiperspirant AND a deodorant, and is often considered more gentle on skin than the AM Roll-On. It has a light scent that is fresh and appropriate for both guys and girls. It’s antiperspirant action is comparable to many other premium over-the-counter antiperspirants, but is nowhere near as strong as the Certain Dri PM products above. It also comes in a light blue &amp; white box, and this listing is for this product.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW WELL DOES CERTAIN DRI’S AM DEODORANTS WORK???&lt;br /&gt;While the PM Roll-On is the workhorse of the Certain Dri family, this deodorant is an effective product. It has an effective antiperspirant, and it has a mild scent. Rather than using a scent that was more masculine or feminine, the scent chosen was clean &amp; fresh, so this will work great for both guys and gals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone without significant sweating issues, this AM Stick is probably capable of being your standalone deodorant and working really well. It reduces the amount of sweating and can effectively control odors without the need for fragrances that are so strong that they are borderline offensive. For someone with more significant sweating issues, this most likely won’t be enough and you will want to pair it with the Certain Dri PM Roll-On. Unfortunately, the only way to know which category you fall into is experimenting first-hand.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IRRITATION&lt;br /&gt;This AM deodorant comes in both a roll-on and stick form. Both do a great job at avoiding irritation, but I have generally chosen the stick as I find it to be the least irritating, which makes it a good pair with the PM Roll-On so that you minimize the chance the stronger product causes irritation.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;These days I don&#x27;t care what color shirt I wear. Certain Dri’s PM Roll-On took a major problem that bothered me immensely and totally &amp; completely resolved it. It also allows me to utilize a 2-product system so that each product can better target certain scenarios. This Certain Dri AM Stick is the perfect pairing with the PM Roll-On, and it is also a great choice as a standalone deodorant/antiperspirant for someone without excessive sweating. I highly recommend this AM Stick.duces the amount of sweating and can effectively control odors without the need for fragrances that are so strong that they are borderline offensive.

            <li> Keeps me dry but I use their PM formula once a week to keep it under control</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Me and my husband both wear the am one and it works fantastically.  Not only for keeping you dry (and my husband sweats a lot), but it also keeps you from smelling bad throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I also love it cause DSE Healthcare doesn&#x27;t do animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This was a factory second with a terrible odor.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy from a different seller</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Still sweating as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing it.  Apparently it works for some people, just not me.  The roll on version works great though.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! I absolutly love it!</li>
            <li> Certain Dri absolutely works.  I wish I would have discovered this product 25 years ago!  I have tried literally every deodorant on the market and nothing....not even the more expensive &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength product works like this product does.  It is Amazing.  I used to carry deodorant in my handbag and re-apply every time I visited the ladies room throughout my work day.  Those days are over.  I stay perfectly dry all day every day regardless of my stress level or the weather conditions.  I have been using the combination of Night and Day Certain Dri products for about a month and I can not say enough about it!</li>
            <li> great product, not carried always in stores.</li>
            <li> Helps me continue to feel fresh &amp; sweat free. Use w/ the original formal applied at night for optimal effect. I accidentally was only using this one at first &amp; saw some results. I ordered the other formula &amp; have really seen a difference.</li>
            <li> Only product that has ever helped me with over perspiration! Pairs perfectly with the roll on and dramatic difference within a week!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!!  The thickness of this product is what makes it work.  Even though it&#x27;s more expensive than drug-store antiperspirants, it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of antiperspirants, many with the same effective ingredient at the same percentage, but since they go on thinly, they don&#x27;t protect me.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before (roll on) and really love it.  All the reviews of how well it works is correct. Take it from a person who tried everything and failed.  Still using the same bottle I ordered 4 months ago.  Super product.</li>
            <li> I have excessive sweating and this works pretty well</li>
            <li> I use this stuff regularly and it works. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so I was glad to find it on here.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant I&#x27;ll use! I hate how &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; other deodorants feel and don&#x27;t work. This one is smooth and last all day love it</li>
