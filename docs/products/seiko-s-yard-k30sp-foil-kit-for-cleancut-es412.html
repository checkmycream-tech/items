            <li>I love the Seiko</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>and I love my Cleancut.</li>
            <li>As always this is still my favorite shaver for the womans privates.</li>
            <li>However, it doesnt stay on well and ended up not being able to use the shaver anymore.  </li>
            <li>The Seiko Cleancul Shaver, the T Razor and the powder were all about 1/2 times more on the Seiko site.  </li>
            <li>I use my shaver more than the 5-10 mins/day suggested in the write up.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see the replacement here at an</li>
            <li>okay price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I was able to return it easily.</li>
            <li>This works fine with our Seiko.  </li>
            <li>Her blade was fine</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s had the trimmer for a little over a year and thinks it is the greatest!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, quiet and doesn&#x27;t cut although its not water proof its still great</li>
            <li>As some others here have experienced, it&#x27;s NOT the same as what came with the Cleancut</li>
            <li>It is great for personal areas.  </li>
            <li>Keeps one smooth.  </li>
            <li>It also happens to fit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As usual, Amazon&#x27;s return policy is flawless.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this tiny shaver, which has a great design for women&#x27;s personal areas.  </li>
            <li>Gives close, clean shaves.....</li>
            <li>The original foil shaver blades lasted a good long time.</li>
            <li>After more than two years, my Cleancut needed a new foil.</li>
            <li>the razor still gave a nice clean shave..but took longer to achieve the same quality the new blades do</li>
            <li>Quick shipping appreciated.</li>
            <li>Product was new in original packaging and arrived quicky.</li>
            <li>Using Amazon was a quick and easy way to get the replacement part I needed (blade assembly) for this personal shaver.  </li>
            <li>I actually haven&#x27;t had the need to change the foil and blade that came with my shaver yet (have had it for maybe five months), but I&#x27;ll be glad I bought a spare when the time comes to change it out.</li>
            <li>Looked exactly like the cleancut I purchased in 2007.  </li>
            <li>The Seiko site charges about 1/2 times more than Amazon for the same items.  </li>
            <li>It was listed as a real Seiko foil head.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you get them here!</li>
            <li>I compared them very closely, and the ONLY difference is that the plastic cover on the replacement blade is made of a thinner plastic than the one on the original.</li>
            <li>Not the same OEM foil that came with the original shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok replacement for the other foil.  </li>
            <li>I got my original items from the Seiko site and they are the same quality.  </li>
            <li>Remember a little baby powered helps the head glide around better.  </li>
            <li>I find that kind of hard to</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking at the new blade, I could really see how beaten up the old blade was.</li>
            <li>Package includes a new trimmer head blade, foil screen, with retaining ring and cover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to, but after replacing the blades and foil it&#x27;s just like new.  </li>
            <li>so now it works like new.</li>
            <li>Fixed my older shaving unit; it now runs like new.  </li>
            <li>This foil WILL draw blood where the original foil that came with the shaver was plenty sharp but never nicked, not even</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll just opt for a whole new shaver!</li>
            <li>I have been using the replacement for a week and it is a bit rough, but that may be due to the fact that I had become accustomed to an older, more beat up foil/blade.</li>
            <li>The closest shave by far.</li>
            <li>Needed a replacement blade for the old razor.  </li>
            <li>so she put the new one away for future use.</li>
            <li>And this foil WILL nick you, especially if you use it, like many do, in and around those delicate parts.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;rebuild\\&quot; kit for the personal shaver did not take the shaver back to anything like new performance.  </li>
            <li>She won&#x27;t use any other shaver for intimate grooming.</li>

            <li> Package arrived as expected, within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> It is either a lower quality foil made in another country other than Japan, or it&#x27;s just made to cheaper standards.</li>
            <li> We have not had any of the issues that other people reported.</li>
            <li> There appears to be nothing wrong with this product, but it is a poor substitute for the screen/foil that is supplied with the original shaver.  </li>

            <li> She dropped her trimmer on the tile floor and bashed the foil a few weeks ago, prompting this replacement head order.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ll be using your shaver everyday, do yourself a favor and set up auto delivery.</li>
            <li> I had managed to adjust the blade a few times to keep it working, but a few weeks ago, the foil was damaged.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s not much better than the year-old blade-and-foil set which I replaced.  </li>
            <li> It had gotten dull, and I decided it was time to replace the foil and blades...and after 2 years, it was over</li>
            <li> hadnt realized how dull the razor had become....until I replaced it with these...</li>
            <li> But if you break it down into the time of use over the course of the time of ownership, then I suppose it&#x27;s not that bad.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, she was fretting the wait until the shipment arrived.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>

            <li> I actually haven&#x27;t had the need to change the foil and blade that came with my shaver yet (have had it for maybe five months), but I&#x27;ll be glad I bought a spare when the time comes to change it out.</li>
            <li> Not going to spend a lot of time on this one. I love the Seiko [[ASIN:B001IZZX1C Cleancut ES412 Personal Shaver]]. The original foil shaver blades lasted a good long time. But they were coming to the end of their use so I purchased this foil kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ouch! Not the same OEM foil that came with the original shaver. Ouch! It is either a lower quality foil made in another country other than Japan, or it&#x27;s just made to cheaper standards. As some others here have experienced, it&#x27;s NOT the same as what came with the Cleancut Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful. This foil WILL grab your skin. And this foil WILL nick you, especially if you use it, like many do, in and around those delicate parts. This foil WILL draw blood where the original foil that came with the shaver was plenty sharp but never nicked, not even once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all I can say is be mindful that this replacement foil can and may nick you! Ouch!</li>
            <li> This product is great. The closest shave by far. You do need to replace the blade every year or sooner depending on how often you use it. If you use it year round, replace it every six months. Otherwise, I&#x27;ve had mine for about 4 years and it still works great!</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;rebuild\\&quot; kit for the personal shaver did not take the shaver back to anything like new performance.  In fact, it&#x27;s not much better than the year-old blade-and-foil set which I replaced.  Next time, I&#x27;ll just opt for a whole new shaver!</li>
            <li> This was a very good product and delivered in a very timely manner great transaction</li>
            <li> It was listed as a real Seiko foil head. This was important because the \\&quot;Knock Off\\&quot; reviews were poor. Well it wasn&#x27;t. Thankfully, I was able to return it easily. Good work Amazon.</li>
            <li> Husband swears by this is absolutely  great.</li>
            <li> The Seiko gets closer than anything I have used without any razor  burn.  It is great for personal areas.  It is a great product</li>
            <li> My fault I think.  Typing cleancut only came up with this replacement.  Looked exactly like the cleancut I purchased in 2007.  There is actually a replacement for the S-Yard ES1080 offered by Amazon.  As usual, Amazon&#x27;s return policy is flawless.</li>
            <li> This works fine with our Seiko.  We have not had any of the issues that other people reported. Time will tell if it lasts as long as the origional.</li>
            <li> Using Amazon was a quick and easy way to get the replacement part I needed (blade assembly) for this personal shaver.  It&#x27;s a hard-to-find item at stores.  Product was new in original packaging and arrived quicky.</li>
            <li> I replaced the foil head and razor worth the matched set in the package and now it is working better than I remember the original ever working, very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> If you have one of these razors. We feel  it is essential that you change the blades and screen every three months</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this tiny shaver, which has a great design for women&#x27;s personal areas.  I am so glad to be able to order replacement parts to keep it humming!</li>
            <li> The Cleancut is an excellent razor for personal use and this replacement kit is very nice.  I love this and I love my Cleancut.</li>
            <li> As always this is still my favorite shaver for the womans privates. It&#x27;s smooth, quiet and doesn&#x27;t cut although its not water proof its still great</li>
            <li> You need to replace the foil every 18 months or so. This foil does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok replacement for the other foil.  However, it doesnt stay on well and ended up not being able to use the shaver anymore.  There&#x27;s a little fragile metal ring that hold the foil to the metal siding.  It came off and broke.</li>
            <li> I got my original items from the Seiko site and they are the same quality.  The Seiko site charges about 1/2 times more than Amazon for the same items.  The Seiko Cleancul Shaver, the T Razor and the powder were all about 1/2 times more on the Seiko site.  I highly recommend that you get them here!</li>
            <li> Need to always have a backup, fragile!</li>
            <li> I gave this one star because I had no choice.  The medal screen was stuck in the plastic cover and when I tried to remove it, it broke !  What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Fixed my older shaving unit; it now runs like new.  It&#x27;s good to know that the manufacturer supports the repair of their product.</li>
            <li> There appears to be nothing wrong with this product, but it is a poor substitute for the screen/foil that is supplied with the original shaver.  The replacement just never seems to perform properly.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s had the trimmer for a little over a year and thinks it is the greatest! She dropped her trimmer on the tile floor and bashed the foil a few weeks ago, prompting this replacement head order. Needless to say, she was fretting the wait until the shipment arrived. Package includes a new trimmer head blade, foil screen, with retaining ring and cover. Her blade was fine so she put the new one away for future use. Package arrived as expected, within a couple of days. The new foil screen fits perfectly, just like the original. She won&#x27;t use any other shaver for intimate grooming.</li>
            <li> I had bought the Cleancut razor a couple of years ago, and it&#x27;s an incredible piece of technology.  It had gotten dull, and I decided it was time to replace the foil and blades...and after 2 years, it was over due.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, this ENTIRE razor is something like $32.  The Foil Kit alone is $26.  Um, what?  81% of the product cost is in the foil and blades?  I find that kind of hard to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because of the price.  But if you break it down into the time of use over the course of the time of ownership, then I suppose it&#x27;s not that bad.  Still, a bit of a slap.</li>
            <li> Keeps one smooth.  Long lasting product.</li>
            <li> We have used the Cleancut razor for a couple of years now and remain very happy with its performance.  Remember a little baby powered helps the head glide around better.  Very good for legs, armpits, chins and some sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> This a an excellent replacement head; works perfectly and both my wife and I use it almost daily. Perfect replacement head</li>
            <li> Has a replacement blade which I need it because I had broke the blades when I rocket so this saved me big time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product best ever!!!!</li>
            <li> The shaver is great and the replacement blade and foil look like original items in original packaging. Quick shipping appreciated.</li>
            <li> I use my shaver more than the 5-10 mins/day suggested in the write up.  After three months it stopped delivering the close shave I&#x27;m use to, but after replacing the blades and foil it&#x27;s just like new.  If you&#x27;ll be using your shaver everyday, do yourself a favor and set up auto delivery.</li>
            <li> hadnt realized how dull the razor had become....until I replaced it with these...the razor still gave a nice clean shave..but took longer to achieve the same quality the new blades do</li>
            <li> After more than two years, my Cleancut needed a new foil. I had managed to adjust the blade a few times to keep it working, but a few weeks ago, the foil was damaged. I was glad to see the replacement here at an okay price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this last week. So I can only speak about the item that was in stock then and sent to me then. The foil and blade kit I received appear to be identical to the originals that came with my Cleancut. I compared them very closely, and the ONLY difference is that the plastic cover on the replacement blade is made of a thinner plastic than the one on the original. It also happens to fit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the new blade, I could really see how beaten up the old blade was. I have been using the replacement for a week and it is a bit rough, but that may be due to the fact that I had become accustomed to an older, more beat up foil/blade.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement blade for the old razor.  Figured after 10 years it was time to replace it so now it works like new.</li>
            <li> Gives close, clean shaves..... I love it</li>
