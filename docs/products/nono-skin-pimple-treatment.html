    <ol>
            <li>Remington was the best investment ever.</li>
            <li>It works great for eliminating acne however The No!no!</li>
            <li>I saw this product on a program about skin care and was quite impressed.  </li>
            <li>so I could have given 3.5, but I&#x27;m just happy that I have not had sufficient opportunity to test the thing out like I thought.</li>
            <li>and I am extremely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>So so so happy I found this.</li>
            <li>Amazing !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even own a No!No! Hair and never bought one</li>
            <li>To me, if it stops the development of a zit and begins the healing process, then I&#x27;m good with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even with the No!No!, you still need to take good care of your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably still one of the best heat/light solutions available, but for the price, it should be more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>I used the product per instructions and Mt St Hellens was handily avoided both times.</li>
            <li>This was my own fault as I read online that this company&#x27;s products don&#x27;t hold up well.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t as effective but it&#x27;s the closest alternative I could find.</li>
            <li>Better than good.</li>
            <li>Amazon is great though, we got a full refund.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re still considering buying this, I encourage you to first invest in a good cleanser, toner, exfoliator, treatment (e.g., benzoyl, salicylic acid, etc.), and a good night and day lotion.</li>

            <li>I wrote this more than a year ago.</li>
            <li>testimonials claim that most people will notice a difference in 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>It is magic.  </li>
            <li>i have asked the official website for help for many times, but they havent reply me yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ok with it if I can use it while plugged in charger but not the case either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not quite sure how to rate this thing.  </li>
            <li>think they rely on the fact that most people are willing to part with large sums of money for the promise of looking their best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s recommended that you use it at first sign of a zit, and this is good advice.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t return it because the ads said I had more time and the order- fine</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no muss no fuss.</li>
            <li>I first used the Zeno device and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I bought an adapter for a couple bucks and now it works fine.</li>
            <li>It was huge by the time I treated it</li>
            <li>Because of the cheap design (i.e. Battery and cover) I give this product a rating of 3.</li>
            <li>I keep using it because the concept makes sense; light and heat should help reduce and heal skin blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Plus, for the price, I want to make sure I get my money&#x27;s worth out of</li>
            <li>The zaps combine light and heat</li>
            <li>(Zeno doesn&#x27;t include light).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this device twice since receiving it, where I had that all too familiar tender spot, indicating that a monster, super-size me zit was forthcoming.</li>
            <li>I really hope it works better for others out</li>
            <li>I really hope it works better for others out there.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and sometimes my pimples come and go rather quickly</li>
            <li>I found it okay, as it did clear up mild acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Always right there when you need it.</li>
            <li>For those of us prone to sudden &amp;#34;white heads&amp;#34; this heat treatment is quick, safe, and scarless.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t like the rather large one-off pimples I would occasionally get and when a friend liked using this I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and was in my early 40&#x27;s with very mild acne if you can even call it that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 40s with sensitive, fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Even with my fair and sensitive skin, the heat is not a problem for me, especially for just 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I did find it somewhat helpful on occasion, but can&#x27;t possibly give it more than 1 star considering the product died after 11 months.</li>
            <li>I gave this to a relative who was initially pleased.</li>
            <li>Even though it says \\&quot;FDA cleared,\\&quot; remember that this only means that the FDA has deemed this product to be safe, not that the FDA has approved this product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Even though it says \\&quot;FDA cleared,\\&quot; remember that this only means that the FDA has deemed this product to be safe, not that the FDA has approved this product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>For the most part, if you test it on one blemish and not on another, they will both heal at about the same time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be pretty PO&#x27;d if it dies within a couple years- at this price.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>first.</li>
            <li>But remember, you must help yourself first in order for this product to work.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer needs a better design for the lid, as the current design is inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I payed more than 100 dlls and the words part is that the plug is for european plug</li>
            <li>So if you zap it a few times an hour, you are generating a good amount of heat.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m very careful with my things and this easily broke from one drop on the floor) and not durable, but worked fine when it did.  </li>
            <li>It barely finished 1 zap and went out like a light.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It claims that the light it emits will kill bacteria and that it will also emit heat to open up your pores (let me warn you that the heat can become uncomfortably hot, especially on sensitive areas).</li>
            <li>For the price it has a very flimsy lid</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t really say if it helped or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product was not received in the time frame promised and dealing with the company (Beauty in Style) was an absolute nightmare.  </li>
            <li>all be all cure for acne (or even REALLY helped)</li>
            <li>I do about 5 times because that is when the tip really starts to heat up</li>
            <li>It was the heat form the Zeno that really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Batterie dies fast though.</li>
            <li>It really helps out the treatment.</li>
            <li>When I did this, many of my zits went away and never really emerged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to irritating drying agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really wished it was durable.</li>
            <li>It will absolutely work.  </li>
            <li>Honestly this item doesn&#x27;t do anything, don&#x27;t waste your time/money.</li>
            <li>scanned the internet for other reviews and noticed that people either love this product or see no improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it took about three days to clear up just one zit, which was about the normal time it would take for my zits to clear up originally...</li>
            <li>Maybe more bad than good?</li>
            <li>Sometimes* it seems to prevent an inflammed pimple from becoming a monstrous cyst, but other times it doesn&#x27;t seem to stop the cyst from forming.  </li>
            <li>bought this from a high end dept store not amazon</li>
            <li>does works for little while but the battery drains out and u can&#x27;t zap it more then two time before having to charge it again.</li>
            <li>You can kinda feel it working, but it is kind of hard to use continuously because it&#x27;s not immediate response.</li>
            <li>Because my acne patterns behaved normally even with</li>
            <li>skin sales new for $110.00 with a manufatures warranty and a 60 return policy.</li>
            <li>JAN 2014:  I bought a second unit in Feb. 2013 and used it only lightly.  </li>
            <li>and it clearly says No!No!</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t be sure that it&#x27;s doing anything other than what daily cleansing would do.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it certainly did not impress especially with its high price tag.</li>
            <li>Following your directions there was a noticible positive difference after a week.</li>
            <li>Actually i wish I were able to give half star</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;d rather be taming two little ones than suffering with one huge and unsightly one.  </li>
            <li>When I use it a bit more frequently than the instructions say to, it does help, but only a little.  </li>
            <li>Using the no no skin didn&#x27;t seem to clear it up any quicker than it would have on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So combination of all three products helps to keep my skin looking clear.  </li>
            <li>I also found that the No!No! helped reduce some of my old zits that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First let me say that holding this product on your shoulder long enough to treat several pimples is a huge pain in the... arm.</li>
            <li>also believe this device is simply a little light that heats up a bit, and is grossly over priced!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is different in that it uses lights... but just seems like it&#x27;s a little light bulb... not a laser or anything</li>
            <li>I will write a new review later to inform you on how well the manufacture honors the warranty.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it heavily and expected better durability.  </li>
            <li>I might recommend this product at $20.00, but at the current price, it should be a miracle tool for clear skin</li>
            <li>biggest one that developed after I got the nono became very big and puffy all within the course of one day.</li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s much more expensive at first, it&#x27;s cheaper to use in the long run.  </li>
            <li>But after a life time of acne trouble ... everything is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In order for this to really work, you HAVE to accompany it with other products.</li>
            <li>No first, and by the time I am finished with that, the Zeno has fully warmed up and is ready to use.  </li>
            <li>Seemed liked it might actually help with pimples, but its useless to me now as it couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Since they advertise that this product can make a noticeable difference within 24 hours, I followed their instructions step-by-step for the first week and saw little to no improvement.</li>
            <li>I occasionally have mild acne, usually on my forehead.</li>
            <li>While it worked, it was great, but am disappointed now.  </li>
            <li>I can really feel it working deep down.  </li>

            <li> I just can&#x27;t be sure that it&#x27;s doing anything other than what daily cleansing would do.</li>
            <li> Anyways, it certainly did not impress especially with its high price tag.</li>
            <li> Following your directions there was a noticible positive difference after a week.</li>
            <li> Actually i wish I were able to give half star</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;d rather be taming two little ones than suffering with one huge and unsightly one.  </li>
            <li> When I use it a bit more frequently than the instructions say to, it does help, but only a little.  </li>
            <li> Using the no no skin didn&#x27;t seem to clear it up any quicker than it would have on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So combination of all three products helps to keep my skin looking clear.  </li>
            <li> I also found that the No!No! helped reduce some of my old zits that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First let me say that holding this product on your shoulder long enough to treat several pimples is a huge pain in the... arm.</li>
            <li> also believe this device is simply a little light that heats up a bit, and is grossly over priced!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is different in that it uses lights... but just seems like it&#x27;s a little light bulb... not a laser or anything</li>
            <li> I will write a new review later to inform you on how well the manufacture honors the warranty.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it heavily and expected better durability.  </li>
            <li> I might recommend this product at $20.00, but at the current price, it should be a miracle tool for clear skin</li>
            <li> biggest one that developed after I got the nono became very big and puffy all within the course of one day.</li>
            <li> while it&#x27;s much more expensive at first, it&#x27;s cheaper to use in the long run.  </li>
            <li> But after a life time of acne trouble ... everything is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In order for this to really work, you HAVE to accompany it with other products.</li>
            <li> No first, and by the time I am finished with that, the Zeno has fully warmed up and is ready to use.  </li>
            <li> Seemed liked it might actually help with pimples, but its useless to me now as it couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Since they advertise that this product can make a noticeable difference within 24 hours, I followed their instructions step-by-step for the first week and saw little to no improvement.</li>
            <li> I occasionally have mild acne, usually on my forehead.</li>
            <li> While it worked, it was great, but am disappointed now.  </li>
            <li> I can really feel it working deep down.  </li>
            <li> So, not good, not bad.  </li>
            <li> biggest concern is how long the light/heat element is going to last.</li>
            <li> It feels a little like an extraction during a facial, so if you are really sensitive, the heat may not be for you.  </li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery does not last for very long, even after being fully charged.</li>
            <li> so is expensive to replace, and it is too easy to accidentally push the activate button.  </li>
            <li> It is now 3 1/2 years later with rarely using it these past couple of years that I must declare it dead.  </li>
            <li> , although smaller, one will pop up near by and I have to tame two.  </li>
            <li> other times it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect pustules from forming or actually, getting larger?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and so far, I&#x27;m not sure that it does anything.  </li>
            <li> They took too long to send me a replacement.</li>
            <li> The downfalls of Zeno, however, are that you have to hold it on each zit for 3 minutes, it has a limited number of uses</li>
            <li> Unlike the Zeno, the No!No! recharges and doesn&#x27;t have a limited number of uses, so</li>
            <li> I still really like this, but the lid did break and is no good now.  </li>
            <li> With regard to Amazon, their customer service was professional and helpful as usual.</li>
            <li> The same thing happened to me as with other reviewers; this product died after only a few months.  </li>
            <li> I think it works; but for the price, I was looking for a miracle cure (or to at least actually heal it in 24 hours, which it never has in my experience) and while it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other treatments, and cause an even bigger, peeling, irritated, red problem...</li>
            <li> What was about to erupt into a monster is suddenly tamed to a small nuisance that only I can notice.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s been over a year but only used it less then 15 times.</li>
            <li> I think it has lasted me 3-4 days on average (remember that it&#x27;s only being used twice a day for only a few minutes each time).</li>
            <li> I tried this out for a few weeks before sending it back.</li>
            <li> Skin is now having trouble charging (keeps blinking red) and the plastic coves no longer stays on.</li>
            <li> Contacted the NoNo company service center</li>
            <li> I say Mario badescu pink lotion work like a charm</li>
            <li> I consider it a waste of money for the little use I got out of it, and it&#x27;s apparent they don&#x27;t bother to improve the product considering the dates of these posts.</li>
            <li> This is the correct product to remove hair, this is not for acne or any other purpose.  </li>
            <li> If you are on a budget, I have to give it to Zeno hands down.  </li>
            <li> READ IT, said I had less.  </li>
            <li> This died in less than a year of working.</li>
            <li> It did not do all the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; healing claims that the manufacturer claims it does and on top of that, the product will be worthless after a few months and you will have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> so I returned it and ordered a different product since the ratings on this were not good.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> When I feel a big painful bump coming on, I immediately start zapping and will continue every hour or two for four days, and the zit will be completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I have to let it sit for a few minutes and then unplug it to use it</li>
            <li> I have to let it sit for a few minutes and then unplug it to use it</li>
            <li> of the ones I&#x27;ve treated that were there before I got the nono all stopped getting bigger and worse and went away within a couple days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is not really working, at least for</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I will tame one and then another</li>
            <li> The ability to charge is poor even when I inadvertently ran the battery down to empty.  </li>
            <li> Seeing that other reviewers have rather glowing reviews, it disappointed me that, after using this product for three weeks, it had only a minimal effect on me; perhaps it had none whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: 2 out of 5 stars for doing at least a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: 2 out of 5 stars for doing at least a little.</li>
            <li> When I finally received a replacement, it turned out to be the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Not sure it works.</li>
            <li> so not really sure how this works.  </li>
            <li> and I was not able to returned.</li>
            <li> If you buy this item here then you do not work hard for your money.</li>
            <li> Filed a complaint with BBB.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems that instead of destroying pimples within 24 hours, it stops them from progressing and getting worse.</li>
            <li> They never got worse though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> poor choice</li>
            <li> all kinda disappointing because its soooo expensive and does so very little.</li>
            <li> It has yet to fail me.  </li>
            <li> update: As expected, dealing with horrible customer service.</li>
            <li> Just really disappointed to have expensive equipment and the quality does not meet the price.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But the unit stopped working, so it was worthless before the month was out.  </li>
            <li> VERY disappointed!!  </li>
            <li> , that is how disgusted we were.  </li>
            <li> Customer service was terrible and would not do anything to accommodate their faulty product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this and was in my early 40&#x27;s with very mild acne if you can even call it that.  I got it in April 2011.  I just didn&#x27;t like the rather large one-off pimples I would occasionally get and when a friend liked using this I decided to try it.  For the price it has a very flimsy lid (I&#x27;m very careful with my things and this easily broke from one drop on the floor) and not durable, but worked fine when it did.  The ability to charge is poor even when I inadvertently ran the battery down to empty.  Within a year, I had to keep it charged all the time and even then it would go through 2-3 zaps before I had to charge it again.  It is now 3 1/2 years later with rarely using it these past couple of years that I must declare it dead.  It barely finished 1 zap and went out like a light.  I consider it a waste of money for the little use I got out of it, and it&#x27;s apparent they don&#x27;t bother to improve the product considering the dates of these posts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this device twice since receiving it, where I had that all too familiar tender spot, indicating that a monster, super-size me zit was forthcoming. I used the product per instructions and Mt St Hellens was handily avoided both times. As I said, twice now so I couldn&#x27;t give a 5 star. Actually i wish I were able to give half star so I could have given 3.5, but I&#x27;m just happy that I have not had sufficient opportunity to test the thing out like I thought.</li>
            <li> I tried this out for a few weeks before sending it back. I could see no difference what so ever. I occasionally have mild acne, usually on my forehead. Using the no no skin didn&#x27;t seem to clear it up any quicker than it would have on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I also believe this device is simply a little light that heats up a bit, and is grossly over priced!&lt;br /&gt;I think they rely on the fact that most people are willing to part with large sums of money for the promise of looking their best.</li>
            <li> Purchased mine on HSN.com on 5/13/11. The product died on 4/18/12. I did find it somewhat helpful on occasion, but can&#x27;t possibly give it more than 1 star considering the product died after 11 months. The product supposedly comes with a 1 year warranty. Contacted the manufacturer, will see what happens. This should not happen to a product that costs ~$200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/21/12 update: As expected, dealing with horrible customer service. It&#x27;s been over 4 weeks since I contacted them and the soap opera goes on. They took too long to send me a replacement. When I finally received a replacement, it turned out to be the wrong product. They sent me a No!No! Hair instead of Skin. When I called to report the error, they blamed everything on me saying I sent them a proof of purchase for No!No! Hair instead of Skin. I don&#x27;t even own a No!No! Hair and never bought one so how I could&#x27;ve sent them a proof of purchase for that I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m sitting here staring at a fax I sent them with a proof of purchase and it clearly says No!No! Skin. Filed a complaint with BBB.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a relative who was initially pleased. But the unit stopped working, so it was worthless before the month was out.  I think she said it had stopped heating. So we had to return it and we will buy another brand that does not use that method of clearing skin.</li>
            <li> This worked well for a friend so I hoped it would work for me but it didn&#x27;t. Amazon is great though, we got a full refund. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Seeing that other reviewers have rather glowing reviews, it disappointed me that, after using this product for three weeks, it had only a minimal effect on me; perhaps it had none whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from the company&#x27;s website, because they have a 30 day trial. Since they advertise that this product can make a noticeable difference within 24 hours, I followed their instructions step-by-step for the first week and saw little to no improvement. I have mild acne and sometimes my pimples come and go rather quickly and sometimes they don&#x27;t. Because my acne patterns behaved normally even with no!no!, I can&#x27;t really say if it helped or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, during the second week, I decided to overuse it. It claims that the light it emits will kill bacteria and that it will also emit heat to open up your pores (let me warn you that the heat can become uncomfortably hot, especially on sensitive areas). However, instead of using it in the morning and at night, I used it about 6 times each day, and I think I noticed a tiny improvement. Tiny, at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use it according to their instructions for the third week and once again, I saw no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I scanned the internet for other reviews and noticed that people either love this product or see no improvement. If you&#x27;re hesitant, I encourage you to go through the 30 day money-back trial and see how it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product&#x27;s quality, the body is made out of plastic. I can&#x27;t tell if the sides are brushed chrome or plastic that looks like brushed chrome. Anyways, it certainly did not impress especially with its high price tag. The cap and tip are made out of plastic too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery does not last for very long, even after being fully charged. I think it has lasted me 3-4 days on average (remember that it&#x27;s only being used twice a day for only a few minutes each time). However, what irks me is that when it&#x27;s out of juice and I plug it in, I can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging. I have to let it sit for a few minutes and then unplug it to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still considering buying this, I encourage you to first invest in a good cleanser, toner, exfoliator, treatment (e.g., benzoyl, salicylic acid, etc.), and a good night and day lotion. If you&#x27;ve got those bases covered and are still looking for something else, then you might want to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 2 out of 5 stars for doing at least a little. Even though it says \\&quot;FDA cleared,\\&quot; remember that this only means that the FDA has deemed this product to be safe, not that the FDA has approved this product&#x27;s effectiveness. I really hope it works better for others out there.while it&#x27;s charging.

            <li> This review is for Radiancy no!no! Skin (This is the \\&quot;No! no! hair remover\\&quot;.  This is the correct product to remove hair, this is not for acne or any other purpose.  When you look at ythe product online, \\&quot;Radiance\\&quot; is part of the name.  Check the link http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028476N0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did everything as indicated.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell, if it works, I can deal with it.  NO RESULTS!  VERY disappointed!!  Couldn&#x27;t return it because the ads said I had more time and the order- fine print- READ IT, said I had less.  BY THE TIME I was done giving it a chance to work, the time was expired.  I GOT STUCK WITH IT&gt;  Don&#x27;t make my mistake, don&#x27;t throw your money away on this product.  Now I use Remington laser hair remover and I am extremely happy with the results.  Update: I wrote this more than a year ago. After having used Remington I forget how hair was such a problem for me.  Remington was the best investment ever.</li>
            <li> I purchased the No!no! Skin Acne Treatment System 6 months ago. It works great for eliminating acne however The No!no! Skin is now having trouble charging (keeps blinking red) and the plastic coves no longer stays on. Because of the cheap design (i.e. Battery and cover) I give this product a rating of 3. I will write a new review later to inform you on how well the manufacture honors the warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and so far, I&#x27;m not sure that it does anything.  I keep using it because the concept makes sense; light and heat should help reduce and heal skin blemishes.  I&#x27;d like to think that - even though I don&#x27;t see a physical difference or notice belmishes healing faster - it is doing something.  Plus, for the price, I want to make sure I get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The testimonials claim that most people will notice a difference in 24 hours.  I&#x27;ve never known this to be the case.  When I use it a bit more frequently than the instructions say to, it does help, but only a little.  For the most part, if you test it on one blemish and not on another, they will both heal at about the same time.  I might recommend this product at $20.00, but at the current price, it should be a miracle tool for clear skin and it is not that at all.</li>
            <li> I found it okay, as it did clear up mild acne.&lt;br /&gt;However, it took about three days to clear up just one zit, which was about the normal time it would take for my zits to clear up originally...&lt;br /&gt;over all kinda disappointing because its soooo expensive and does so very little.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a program about skin care and was quite impressed.  As the mom of a teen I thought we&#x27;d try it.  The product was not received in the time frame promised and dealing with the company (Beauty in Style) was an absolute nightmare.  We did not even open the product, that is how disgusted we were.  Don&#x27;t do business with them! With regard to Amazon, their customer service was professional and helpful as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered the last 10 years with monthly hormone-related cystic acne.  Nothing I did could control it.  This product has done the trick!  As soon as I feel one coming on, I start the treatment.  What was about to erupt into a monster is suddenly tamed to a small nuisance that only I can notice.  It is magic.  The only downside is sometimes I feel like I am chasing the acne around my face.  Sometimes, I will tame one and then another, although smaller, one will pop up near by and I have to tame two.  Before, I would have one and that was it.  But, I&#x27;d rather be taming two little ones than suffering with one huge and unsightly one.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a week. I&#x27;m male and in my mid-30&#x27;s and deal with some facial acne but a lot on my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that holding this product on your shoulder long enough to treat several pimples is a huge pain in the... arm. Still, that has nothing to do with the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that instead of destroying pimples within 24 hours, it stops them from progressing and getting worse. Thats the \\&quot;noticeable difference.\\&quot; Every one I&#x27;ve treated as soon as I started seeing a red spot stopped developing and took a couple days to go away. They never got worse though.&lt;br /&gt;All of the ones I&#x27;ve treated that were there before I got the nono all stopped getting bigger and worse and went away within a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest one that developed after I got the nono became very big and puffy all within the course of one day. It was huge by the time I treated it but once I did, it stopped. The pain also went away. The pimple was still there but it was starting to heal. 3 or 4 days later it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about the way this product is being marketed is in how you define \\&quot;noticeable difference.\\&quot; To me, if it stops the development of a zit and begins the healing process, then I&#x27;m good with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest concern is how long the light/heat element is going to last. I&#x27;m going to be pretty PO&#x27;d if it dies within a couple years- at this price.</li>
            <li> Not sure it works. Sometimes it seems to ... other times it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect pustules from forming or actually, getting larger? But after a life time of acne trouble ... everything is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow I ordered two of them ... didn&#x27;t discover the 2nd one until I was about to throw out the shipping box weeks later. Amazon allowed me to return it without any issues! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This died in less than a year of working. Seemed liked it might actually help with pimples, but its useless to me now as it couldn&#x27;t hold a charge. This was my own fault as I read online that this company&#x27;s products don&#x27;t hold up well. Who knows, maybe they make better products now, but fact of the matter is its an expensive paper weight for me now.</li>
            <li> I think it works; but for the price, I was looking for a miracle cure (or to at least actually heal it in 24 hours, which it never has in my experience) and while it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other treatments, and cause an even bigger, peeling, irritated, red problem...I just can&#x27;t be sure that it&#x27;s doing anything other than what daily cleansing would do.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I cannot say the same for the seller however. The thing came in a box that looked like it had been opened and returned. The actual product look like it had been re shrink wrapped, and when I unwrapped it there were scratches on the product under the shrink wrap. All and all something seems fishy, and if it was used I would have like a discount for a used product. So buy from another seller if you want this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but I have been ill and still need to use it more.  Always right there when you need it.</li>
            <li> Honestly this item doesn&#x27;t do anything, don&#x27;t waste your time/money. If it was the end all be all cure for acne (or even REALLY helped), you would see them all over. It&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I bought this now that the Zeno is no longer being made.  That was my holy grail product for cystic acne.  This product is different in that it uses lights... but just seems like it&#x27;s a little light bulb... not a laser or anything so not really sure how this works.  It says to only treat the area twice a session.  I do about 5 times because that is when the tip really starts to heat up and I can feel it working.  It was the heat form the Zeno that really worked for me.  This product isn&#x27;t as effective but it&#x27;s the closest alternative I could find.</li>
            <li> My name is Autumn. I get pimples periodically and with two treatments it&#x27;s gone . Amazing ! Batterie dies fast though.</li>
            <li> In order for this to really work, you HAVE to accompany it with other products. For example, I was prescribed an ointment from my doctor that I must put on every night. Of course before I apply it, I use No! No! first. It really helps out the treatment. Obviously not everyone will have an ointment that was prescribed to them, but anyone could go to their local Wal-Mart or Target and pick up some sort of pimple/acne solution...Overall, I would suggest this product because of its help. But remember, you must help yourself first in order for this product to work.</li>
            <li> i did not like this item . i  thought that this is the hair removal device. to my shame . poor choice</li>
            <li> You can kinda feel it working, but it is kind of hard to use continuously because it&#x27;s not immediate response.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40s with sensitive, fair skin.  I get regular acne as well as cystic.  My skin doesn&#x27;t do well with some drying acne treatments, so I decided to give heat a try.  I first used the Zeno device and liked it.  The downfalls of Zeno, however, are that you have to hold it on each zit for 3 minutes, it has a limited number of uses so is expensive to replace, and it is too easy to accidentally push the activate button.  One Zeno for $35+ only lasted me a month.  After reading reviews for the No!No! acne system, I decided to give it a try instead.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now, and I prefer it to Zeno.  Each zap takes only 10 seconds (not 3 minutes).  You zap each zit 2X twice a day.  The zaps combine light and heat (Zeno doesn&#x27;t include light).  It feels a little like an extraction during a facial, so if you are really sensitive, the heat may not be for you.  Even with my fair and sensitive skin, the heat is not a problem for me, especially for just 10 seconds.  I can really feel it working deep down.  Unlike the Zeno, the No!No! recharges and doesn&#x27;t have a limited number of uses, so while it&#x27;s much more expensive at first, it&#x27;s cheaper to use in the long run.  It&#x27;s recommended that you use it at first sign of a zit, and this is good advice.  When I did this, many of my zits went away and never really emerged.  Those that did surface went away quicker.  I also found that the No!No! helped reduce some of my old zits that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  Even with the No!No!, you still need to take good care of your skin.  No!No! is not a preventative, only a treatment if you get a zit.  It&#x27;s also not intended for blackheads or whiteheads, although it does work for stubborn cystic acne.  It&#x27;s a great alternative to irritating drying agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE FEB. 2012:  I still really like this, but the lid did break and is no good now.  The manufacturer needs a better design for the lid, as the current design is inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE MARCH 2012:  The unit nowflashes and doesn&#x27;t always charge.  I haven&#x27;t used it heavily and expected better durability.  While it worked, it was great, but am disappointed now.  I&#x27;ve downgraded my review to 3 stars.  It&#x27;s probably still one of the best heat/light solutions available, but for the price, it should be more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JAN 2014:  I bought a second unit in Feb. 2013 and used it only lightly.  Now it&#x27;s flashing red and won&#x27;t take a charge.  I&#x27;m done with No!No!.  Really wished it was durable.</li>
            <li> I use my No No in combination with Zeno, Claro, and Baby Quasar.  It&#x27;s like a med spa in my bathroom.  Hee hee.  It helps to shorten the life cycle of a zit so that you can get on with your life and start looking at people in their eyes again.  I have never just tried the No No by itself, since I bought the Zeno, Claro and Baby Quasar.  So I just Claro and No No first, and by the time I am finished with that, the Zeno has fully warmed up and is ready to use.  So combination of all three products helps to keep my skin looking clear.  If you are on a budget, I have to give it to Zeno hands down.  But you do have to buy replacement cartridges over and over again if you break out a lot, but No No, there are no cartridges that you need to buy in the future.</li>
            <li> If you buy this item here then you do not work hard for your money. The no ! no ! skin sales new for $110.00 with a manufatures warranty and a 60 return policy. How do I know? because I sale them for radiancy.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but there&#x27;s no replacement parts so it&#x27;s a one time buy. It has worked as described in the product description so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller I purchase from was in Europe. I received it with a Euro spec charger. I bought an adapter for a couple bucks and now it works fine.</li>
            <li> Following your directions there was a noticible positive difference after a week. Easy to use, no muss no fuss. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You have to overuse it.  It will absolutely work.  When I feel a big painful bump coming on, I immediately start zapping and will continue every hour or two for four days, and the zit will be completely gone.  It has yet to fail me.  All you have to do is get to four days without picking at it.  did not work at the recommended amounts of twice a day bc it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to kill the bacteria.  So if you zap it a few times an hour, you are generating a good amount of heat.  I have no side effects from overuse.  No drying. So so so happy I found this.</li>
            <li> I would give this a zero rating if I could.  The same thing happened to me as with other reviewers; this product died after only a few months.  Customer service was terrible and would not do anything to accommodate their faulty product.  It did not do all the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; healing claims that the manufacturer claims it does and on top of that, the product will be worthless after a few months and you will have to throw it away. Way overpriced for a product that is essentially disposable. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> For those of us prone to sudden &amp;#34;white heads&amp;#34; this heat treatment is quick, safe, and scarless. Better than good.</li>
            <li> i have a lot of issue with this machine. it is not really working, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt; i have asked the official website for help for many times, but they havent reply me yet.</li>
            <li> I gave it a two star instead of one or zero.&lt;br /&gt;It does works for little while but the battery drains out and u can&#x27;t zap it more then two time before having to charge it again. I&#x27;ll be ok with it if I can use it while plugged in charger but not the case either.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from a high end dept store not amazon and it&#x27;s only one yr warranty, it&#x27;s been over a year but only used it less then 15 times. Contacted the NoNo company service center and they said nothing they can do but I could of bought  the product from them and the extended warranty. Just really disappointed to have expensive equipment and the quality does not meet the price. I say Mario badescu pink lotion work like a charm and it&#x27;ll never disappoint me like No No did!</li>
            <li> While no! no! doesn&#x27;t get rid of pimples, per say, it does make those red swollen things either speed up to get over with or it helps them to fade away.  If you have cystic acne, this is for you.  A godsend.</li>
            <li> I hatet that I order this by misstake and I was not able to returned. I payed more than 100 dlls and the words part is that the plug is for european plug so I can even give to someone to used because we can not plug that in. This is the words thing I ever buy with you guys</li>
            <li> Not quite sure how to rate this thing.  The cap broke, so it no longer stays in place.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s truly helping my pimples.  I still get pimples.  *Sometimes* it seems to prevent an inflammed pimple from becoming a monstrous cyst, but other times it doesn&#x27;t seem to stop the cyst from forming.  So, not good, not bad.  Maybe more bad than good?</li>
            <li> I was ordering the hair and got the skin so I returned it and ordered a different product since the ratings on this were not good.</li>
