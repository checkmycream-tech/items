    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Lathers wells and to me its excellent rating is based on where the lather is placed.</li>
            <li>excellent for travel as it dries well</li>
            <li>made me realize it&#x27;s the perfect size.</li>
            <li>I would like to buy another simpson&#x27;s - [[ASIN:B00677I7NW Simpson CH1 Chubby Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush]]</li>
            <li>I have a goatee and this brush is perfect for the parts of my face that I do shave.</li>
            <li>You want a great brush in your collection?</li>
            <li>If you understand how to whip up a great lather, the Wee Scot will not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>This is a great travel brush.  </li>
            <li>AOS best badger is actually better suited to  travel and home.</li>
            <li>I think this is perfect for accurate use on the face, under the nose and sideburns without getting shaving cream everywhere.</li>
            <li>and I am delighted.</li>
            <li>Brush feels good.</li>
            <li>But, oh my, if you use a tube soap (original version Proraso from the mall, or better,) you get a wonderful shave.</li>
            <li>Awesome backbone and retains water very well!  </li>
            <li>I can get the lather exactly where I want it, and the quality of the badger hair is top-notch.</li>
            <li>truly amazing how it builds lather....</li>
            <li>The Wee Scot fits perfectly in a plastic medicine bottle (see my posted images) and now resides at the ready in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li>The Best Badger Bristles are soft, and thirsty.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this too anyone who wants a really nice silvertip with a great price.</li>
            <li>I know, because I have done it many times.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>Probably works better with soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So small it looks a bit like something from a doll house, but a really beautifully made brush, and very effective.</li>
            <li>May be good as a supplemental brush if your large brush doesn&#x27;t do a neat job around your nose for example.  </li>
            <li>The thing most reviewers have right is the way it lathers: this thing is a beast!  </li>
            <li>Very small in size, however, fans out perfect and really gets a great lather.</li>
            <li>It will develop and hold a tremendous amount of lather and will give you more latherings than you can handle.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush, but I do prefer a larger brush.</li>
            <li>in all well worth the money and a top notch brush.</li>
            <li>Best small shaving brush out there.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that I can see what I&#x27;m doing much better, because the larger brushes kind if get in the way when lathering up for a shave.</li>
            <li>Bought as a travel brush but like it better than my large home brush.</li>
            <li>It does not hold enough lather for even one good pass.  </li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft, no hairs have fallen out of the brush.</li>
            <li>Although small, it works very well and a very good lather can be easily produced.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li>will EASILY lather up enough for 4+ passes (if you need that many).  </li>
            <li>great little travel brush</li>
            <li>I can get about 3 lathers worth.</li>
            <li>I respectfully, but adamantly disagree.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li>This is a very nice small brush.</li>
            <li>Quality seems good, though it does shed a little bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure what the advantages of a bigger brush are, but this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>At first the size put me off, then I used it and the quality and use of it</li>
            <li>Odds are if you got a prescription in the last year or two for something that bottle fits better and it came with your pills.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the travel side, the small brush dries out extremely quick, and it fits quite nicely into a prescription bottle with airholes drilled.  </li>
            <li>The guy on YouTube is right; more than seven full latherings can be had from this little beast!  </li>
            <li>This little brush does magic on your face!  </li>
            <li>But I works very well .</li>
            <li>I actually use it as a daily driver and have no trouble getting 3 good passes when shaving.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying a bigger brush, other wise its made well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite being a little tight on how much product it holds, I find the smaller size perfect for applying lather exactly where I want it.  </li>
            <li>Also its small size makes it perfect for travel - put it in a small pill bottle</li>
            <li>I got this little beauty from a gent on my favorite shaving website Shave Nook</li>
            <li>Less messy, no shedding, and great all around.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The Wee Scot may be small, but it more than makes up for it in the amount of shave cream it will hold.</li>
            <li>Particularly the upper lip and around my side burns, and honestly, I don&#x27;t understand why typical shaving brushes are so much larger now that I&#x27;ve used this one.  </li>
            <li>I like it for travel, and the brush is exceptionally soft.</li>
            <li>Handle is as thick as a felt highlighter, but feels much better.</li>
            <li>No wonder the creator chose this particular (and only) model of Simpsons brushes to put his signature on.  </li>
            <li>Given the smaller size, control of lather placement is much better than the few larger brushes I have.</li>
            <li>No other simpson has his name on it.</li>
            <li>I normally do a 3-pass shave, and the wee scot can just barely hold enough product for 3 passes, although I usually do a minor recharge after the second pass.  </li>
            <li>Nothing ( at least my big badger doesn&#x27;t ) works well with cheaply made solid soaps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles have just the right feel and have lathered anything I&#x27;ve thrown at it, including hotel facial bar soap when I left my usual puck at home one time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> brush is a bit rough and pretty firm</li>
            <li> Every serious wet shaver needs to have one of these for daily use or just for fun and amazement.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased this brush a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s small, but was actually a tad bit larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> This little dynamo produces enough lather for three passes.</li>
            <li> yes this little brush will stand with any larger badger...</li>
            <li> No worries about a wet bag or mildew build</li>
            <li> It lathers like any other premium brush.</li>
            <li> This brush was the pinnacle of simpson shave brushes - Alexander Simpson mentioned that only the expert brush makers built this brush since you needed to have experience to work with something so small.</li>
            <li> I also tried it at home with a hard soap, and it held just enough for three passes plus touch-up.</li>
            <li> But by no means does it mean it can&#x27;t compete with a regular sized brush.</li>
            <li> Despite having to recharge the brush a little bit, a lot less product seems to go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having read all the reviews online, I was a little apprehensive about just how &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; this brush would be.  </li>
            <li> The small size is also an asset for controlling where the lather goes and getting into tight spots.  </li>
            <li> This is a really small brush.</li>
            <li> Too small for me.</li>
            <li> Small, fits in a pill bottle to store.</li>
            <li> No shedding, but is too small for my razor &amp; brush stand.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s small, but that&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li> I do want to say it is a small brush, about the size of your pinky.</li>
            <li> Like everyone said this is a small!</li>
            <li> But definitely not a good every day brush.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shine with mediocre soaps.</li>
            <li> A disappointment.</li>

            <li> Best small shaving brush out there. It lathers like any other premium brush. You want a great brush in your collection? Get this one.</li>
            <li> This is a really small brush. Too small for me.</li>
            <li> This little brush does magic on your face!  It will develop and hold a tremendous amount of lather and will give you more latherings than you can handle.  The guy on YouTube is right; more than seven full latherings can be had from this little beast!  No wonder the creator chose this particular (and only) model of Simpsons brushes to put his signature on.  Every serious wet shaver needs to have one of these for daily use or just for fun and amazement.</li>
            <li> This thing is tiny! But by no means does it mean it can&#x27;t compete with a regular sized brush. I actually use it as a daily driver and have no trouble getting 3 good passes when shaving. Also its small size makes it perfect for travel - put it in a small pill bottle and you are set to go.</li>
            <li> Small, fits in a pill bottle to store. I think this is perfect for accurate use on the face, under the nose and sideburns without getting shaving cream everywhere. I can get about 3 lathers worth. I use this in conjunction with the pacific company pre-shave oil, shaving cream and aftershave. This brush was the pinnacle of simpson shave brushes - Alexander Simpson mentioned that only the expert brush makers built this brush since you needed to have experience to work with something so small. It even has his signature on it. No other simpson has his name on it.</li>
            <li> I like the size. Solid shave when paired with TOBS sandalwood cream.</li>
            <li> Wow! When they said, &amp;#34;Wee Scot,&amp;#34; I never realized how wee &amp;#34;Wee&amp;#34; was! This is a great brush, but I do prefer a larger brush. No complaints about this brush except for its size and that&#x27;s a personal preference thing. No shedding, but is too small for my razor &amp; brush stand. Holds lots of water and creates a lot of foam.</li>
            <li> Way too small….I bought this for my father and he don&#x27;t like the size. I recommend buying a bigger brush, other wise its made well</li>
            <li> A disappointment. I bought this on a recommendation.  It does not hold enough lather for even one good pass.  May be good as a supplemental brush if your large brush doesn&#x27;t do a neat job around your nose for example.  But definitely not a good every day brush.</li>
            <li> A couple of reviewers say this brush doesn&#x27;t hold enough lather for one pass. I respectfully, but adamantly disagree. This little dynamo produces enough lather for three passes. I know, because I have done it many times. I got this little beauty from a gent on my favorite shaving website Shave Nook and I am delighted. I travel a lot and am always looking to reduce space in my luggage. The Wee Scot fits perfectly in a plastic medicine bottle (see my posted images) and now resides at the ready in my shaving kit. The Best Badger Bristles are soft, and thirsty. Yes, it&#x27;s small, but that&#x27;s the point. If you understand how to whip up a great lather, the Wee Scot will not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected. Handle is as thick as a felt highlighter, but feels much better. Lathers wells and to me its excellent rating is based on where the lather is placed. Given the smaller size, control of lather placement is much better than the few larger brushes I have. I can go around my mouth not just over it. Brush feels good.</li>
            <li> I bought the wee scot as a travel brush since I travel a lot for work, and client visits require I be presentable.  However, this brush has also become the only one I use whether at home or  on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles have just the right feel and have lathered anything I&#x27;ve thrown at it, including hotel facial bar soap when I left my usual puck at home one time.  I normally do a 3-pass shave, and the wee scot can just barely hold enough product for 3 passes, although I usually do a minor recharge after the second pass.  I face lather, but if you use a bowl or scuttle even that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being a little tight on how much product it holds, I find the smaller size perfect for applying lather exactly where I want it.  Particularly the upper lip and around my side burns, and honestly, I don&#x27;t understand why typical shaving brushes are so much larger now that I&#x27;ve used this one.  Despite having to recharge the brush a little bit, a lot less product seems to go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the travel side, the small brush dries out extremely quick, and it fits quite nicely into a prescription bottle with airholes drilled.  No worries about a wet bag or mildew build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all well worth the money and a top notch brush.</li>
            <li> Having read all the reviews online, I was a little apprehensive about just how &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; this brush would be.  Yes, it&#x27;s small, but was actually a tad bit larger than I expected.  The thing most reviewers have right is the way it lathers: this thing is a beast!  I use it for travel (I&#x27;m on the road 13-16 nights per month) with Bigelow (Prorasso) cream -- a nickel to quarter sized blob of cream will EASILY lather up enough for 4+ passes (if you need that many).  I also tried it at home with a hard soap, and it held just enough for three passes plus touch-up. The small size is also an asset for controlling where the lather goes and getting into tight spots.  The brush I received has not lost a hair, yet (after three weeks and about 10 shaves)!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably smaller than you imagine, but it is actually functional for me. I like it for travel, and the brush is exceptionally soft.</li>
            <li> Bought as a travel brush but like it better than my large home brush. I&#x27;ve purchased two as gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what the advantages of a bigger brush are, but this is perfect for me. Can take it traveling and use it at home. Quality seems good, though it does shed a little bit.</li>
            <li> great little travel brush</li>
            <li> yes this little brush will stand with any larger badger...truly amazing how it builds lather....excellent for travel as it dries well and it is a Simpson..says it all..get it be amazed!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into artisan wet-shaving you will want this gem on your shelf. It doesn&#x27;t shine with mediocre soaps. Nothing ( at least my big badger doesn&#x27;t ) works well with cheaply made solid soaps. But, oh my, if you use a tube soap (original version Proraso from the mall, or better,) you get a wonderful shave. Go for it.</li>
            <li> Very small in size, however, fans out perfect and really gets a great lather. At first the size put me off, then I used it and the quality and use of it made me realize it&#x27;s the perfect size. Less messy, no shedding, and great all around. I would recommend this too anyone who wants a really nice silvertip with a great price.</li>
            <li> So small it looks a bit like something from a doll house, but a really beautifully made brush, and very effective. This tiny brush will produce enough lather for a 3 pass shave. I would like to buy another simpson&#x27;s - [[ASIN:B00677I7NW Simpson CH1 Chubby Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush]]</li>
            <li> This is a great travel brush.  Although small, it works very well and a very good lather can be easily produced.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased this brush a long time ago.  Awesome backbone and retains water very well!  Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> This is a very nice small brush. But it is tiny small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and buy the case (tube) to carry it in when you travel. The case is way to big for it even though the site says it fits. It does but then a bicycle fits in a garage also. The case is twice the size of the brush. Odds are if you got a prescription in the last year or two for something that bottle fits better and it came with your pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a bit rough and pretty firm but it does lather a cream OK. Probably works better with soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My AOS best badger is actually better suited to  travel and home.</li>
            <li> The Wee Scot may be small, but it more than makes up for it in the amount of shave cream it will hold. I also like the fact that I can see what I&#x27;m doing much better, because the larger brushes kind if get in the way when lathering up for a shave. I can get the lather exactly where I want it, and the quality of the badger hair is top-notch.</li>
            <li> Like everyone said this is a small! brush. But I works very well . I have a goatee and this brush is perfect for the parts of my face that I do shave. The brush is nice and soft, no hairs have fallen out of the brush. I do want to say it is a small brush, about the size of your pinky. The only problem I have is I have not found a brush stand for it. I may have to make one.</li>
