            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for safe, non-toxic polish for your child</li>
            <li>and I wish it was a more shimmery color.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>

            <li>Overall great non toxic nail polish.</li>
            <li>quick drying, easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Con: peels off very quickly.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves to have her nails painted and this is a nice safe alternative to regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>They are NOT the cheaply made clear kind of polish</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m ok with either really), then this will work for you.</li>
            <li>The product itself doesn&#x27;t really stay on for more than a couple days.</li>
            <li>It does wear away somewhat quickly, though.  </li>
            <li>my Grandaughter loves her pretty toes!</li>
            <li>LOVE Piggy Paint and the fact that my little one can still chew on her toes and is safe!</li>
            <li>So, if you buy this just be aware that you are not getting 3 full sized bottles...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a fun craft for a rainy day.</li>
            <li>Fun  </li>
            <li>Feel safe using on my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>It chips right on off</li>
            <li>My 2 1/2 year old gets so excited when we paint her nails!</li>
            <li>no fumes, FAST dry and fairly good hold-up</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re okay with reapplying on almost a daily basis or having super duper chipped nails on your kiddo</li>
            <li>Luckily, my kid doesn&#x27;t care too much about painted nails.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it chipped off very fast</li>
            <li>The polish doesn&#x27;t  last more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like you paid for a paint job to only be able to wear it for a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I love this polish for kids, chemical free and doesn&#x27;t smell like all the other chemical ones!!!  </li>
            <li>but we really don&#x27;t mind--she loves doing her nails</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this</li>
            <li>chips fast on nails.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and dries quickly - good for impatient little ones!  </li>
            <li>I have had much better luck with the more expensive brand, Priti NYC.  </li>
            <li>w it even if it&#x27;s a high price item</li>
            <li>Love this for my little girl.</li>
            <li>Love it, but I gave it 4 stars because the bristles on the brushes were all uneven and had to be cut.</li>
            <li>It works great for little ones comes off in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I thought the blue and purple seemed to cover better than the pink if your looking for darker colors.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors and fast dry time.</li>
            <li>Love that it is non-toxic, but I would have to reapply everyday (or twice a day!)</li>
            <li>The only thing that I like about this product is that it ha no smell and an easy dry.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 3 month old, its</li>
            <li>I used on my 1 yr old granddaughter and used soap &amp; water to take off.</li>
            <li>3 year old daughter, who couldn&#x27;t handle the fumes of my nail polish...</li>
            <li>I have used this on my daughter since she was three years old.</li>
            <li>Plus I feel much safer with the ingredients than with regular polish.</li>
            <li>Wears off rather fast, so I could only give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute and my 3 year old loves to &amp;#34;paint my paint nails&amp;#34; (her words), but despite multiple coats and letting them dry properly, if it lasts more than 24 hours I&#x27;m shocked.</li>
            <li>The down side is it basically comes off the first time in water (bath, pool etc)</li>
            <li>Loved the pink and purple colors but the pink brush was completely mangled and unable to use to place polish properly.</li>

            <li> the polish doesn&#x27;t last long on the nails.</li>
            <li> I feared that this polish would not last long.</li>
            <li> my 4 and 6 year olds it lasts 1 or 2 days before it starts coming off...which is about as long as regular polish works for them</li>
            <li> The only polish so far that I will use on my little ones.</li>
            <li> The trick we use for longer wear is to dry it with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The paint literally comes off as soon as its dry.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not my main complaint.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re kids, they&#x27;re rough on their nails).  </li>
            <li> They are just a little less durable than regular polish</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in applying than other polishes.  </li>
            <li> Within an hour the polish on her fingers and toes started peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: not worth the price.</li>
            <li> At 5am, four nails no longer had paint and the rest had 50% coverage or less.</li>
            <li> This may not be a bad thing, but with bottles so small, it could cause you to go through it quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, I did not realize how small the bottles of polish were.</li>
            <li> Not sure who I need to contact in regards to this issue.</li>
            <li> guess my head didn&#x27;t realize how tiny and expensive these r</li>
            <li> not like she&#x27;s rough on her nails!! :(</li>
            <li> disappointed in that.</li>

            <li> Pretty colors and fast dry time. However, I did not realize how small the bottles of polish were. But that&#x27;s not my main complaint. The polish doesn&#x27;t  last more than 24 hours. I use it on my 3 month old, its not like she&#x27;s rough on her nails!! :( disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved the nailpolish</li>
            <li> It works great for little ones comes off in just a few days.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to have her nails painted and this is a nice safe alternative to regular nail polish. The down side is it basically comes off the first time in water (bath, pool etc)</li>
            <li> my 2 years old daugter loves having her pink, purple or &amp;#34;boo&amp;#34; toes and i feel ok abut it with this polish. no fumes, FAST dry and fairly good hold-up</li>
            <li> I painted my 10 month olds finger and toe nails at 4:30pm. She was in bed at 8pm. At 5am, four nails no longer had paint and the rest had 50% coverage or less. Its not like she was sitting there, picking at it. It chips very easily. Love that it is non-toxic, but I would have to reapply everyday (or twice a day!) if I cared about the appearance.</li>
            <li> These are mini sized! The description does not explain this at all. So, if you buy this just be aware that you are not getting 3 full sized bottles...</li>
            <li> I love this polish for kids, chemical free and doesn&#x27;t smell like all the other chemical ones!!!  The only polish so far that I will use on my little ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute and my 3 year old loves to &amp;#34;paint my paint nails&amp;#34; (her words), but despite multiple coats and letting them dry properly, if it lasts more than 24 hours I&#x27;m shocked. If you&#x27;re okay with reapplying on almost a daily basis or having super duper chipped nails on your kiddo (I&#x27;m ok with either really), then this will work for you. Non-toxic is a good thing - except for the fact that it&#x27;s non-stick too. I probably won&#x27;t buy again, but we will use what we have before we find something else.</li>
            <li> Pro: quick drying, easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Con: peels off very quickly. Within an hour the polish on her fingers and toes started peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: not worth the price. I will be looking for a different polish to use for my toddler.</li>
            <li> Great polish! No smell easy to remove. I used on my 1 yr old granddaughter and used soap &amp; water to take off. Hardest part was putting on the tiny nails lol</li>
            <li> I love that it does not have harmful chemicals so I can use this with my toddler.  It goes on easily and dries quickly - good for impatient little ones!  It does wear away somewhat quickly, though.  This may not be a bad thing, but with bottles so small, it could cause you to go through it quickly.  Luckily, my kid doesn&#x27;t care too much about painted nails.  It&#x27;s just a fun craft for a rainy day.</li>
            <li> Really love this.  Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in applying than other polishes.  Great colors.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my soon to be 3 year old daughter, who couldn&#x27;t handle the fumes of my nail polish...&lt;br /&gt;piggy paint has NO FUMES!! ...she LOVED it! She just smiled ear to ear...I thought the blue and purple seemed to cover better than the pink if your looking for darker colors. I didn&#x27;t think it chipped off very fast but we really don&#x27;t mind--she loves doing her nails and I love being able to let her now!</li>
            <li> I like the colors but it does not last long AT ALL.  I have had much better luck with the more expensive brand, Priti NYC.  I picked this up as a stocking stuffer for my daughter but won&#x27;t be purchasing this brand again.  You get what you pay for and Priti NYC is a much better quality product.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, easy application, nice smaller sized bottles. My daughter likes it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for safe, non-toxic polish for your child then I do recommend Piggy Paint. It isn&#x27;t long lasting like the smelly, toxic polish. But then again, you won&#x27;t freak out when your child puts their fingers in their mouth either. I have used this on my daughter since she was three years old. The trick we use for longer wear is to dry it with a hair dryer. A big difference from air drying!</li>
            <li> Loved the pink and purple colors but the pink brush was completely mangled and unable to use to place polish properly. Not sure who I need to contact in regards to this issue. The blue polish is very bright and I wish it was a more shimmery color.</li>
            <li> Loved these! Safe and fume free. Looks adorable on my  baby girl!</li>
            <li> Cute colors and safe for kids but beware these bottles are mini sized. The product itself doesn&#x27;t really stay on for more than a couple days.</li>
            <li> Chips off very quickly. Only lasted a day on my daughters fingernails.</li>
            <li> Fun  colors my Grandaughter loves her pretty toes!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I like about this product is that it ha no smell and an easy dry. The paint literally comes off as soon as its dry. It chips right on off and it&#x27;s like you paid for a paint job to only be able to wear it for a couple hours. I would have to do my daughter&#x27;s nails every day almost to keep them painted.</li>
            <li> the polish doesn&#x27;t last long on the nails.</li>
            <li> Chips off easily but great for kiddos.</li>
            <li> I feared that this polish would not last long. However, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;For my 4 and 6 year olds it lasts 1 or 2 days before it starts coming off...which is about as long as regular polish works for them (they&#x27;re kids, they&#x27;re rough on their nails).  On me it lasts a week or more!! Plus I feel much safer with the ingredients than with regular polish.</li>
            <li> Love this for my little girl. They are just a little less durable than regular polish and I&#x27;m ok with that. They are NOT the cheaply made clear kind of polish I remember having as a girl.</li>
            <li> guess my head didn&#x27;t realize how tiny and expensive these r but my tot likes polish and chews it so I feel safer w it even if it&#x27;s a high price item</li>
            <li> Great product. Feel safe using on my 2 year old. Wears off rather fast, so I could only give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 year old gets so excited when we paint her nails! She absolutely loves this and I love that it comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> LOVE Piggy Paint and the fact that my little one can still chew on her toes and is safe!</li>
            <li> Good on toes but chips fast on nails.  Overall great non toxic nail polish.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved this!</li>
            <li> Love it, but I gave it 4 stars because the bristles on the brushes were all uneven and had to be cut.</li>
