            <li>it was easier to apply and worked better at soaking up the oil for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>The blonde tint is perfect</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this shade even though my hair isn&#x27;t really blonde anymore.</li>
            <li>I like most about this</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love it.</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps and that you all enjoy!</li>
            <li>The blonde blends in perfectly with my hair.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this product -</li>
            <li>but no aerosol to spray it, so make sure to shake well before use.</li>
            <li>I will repurchase for sure.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a must-have for healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I also love how you don&#x27;t have to wait two minutes to brush it out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Reasons Why I Love It:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am considering ordering a case and hoarding them, as I cannot imagine my life now without this magical elixir.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK for the price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s even better than the original!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this one is awesome!  </li>
            <li>The best dry shampoo ever</li>
            <li>Truly the best dry shampoo available, I have tried many and this by far is the best, the texture of your hair after you apply it is so soft and smells good as well</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used</li>
            <li>best dry shampoo for blondes.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li>my hair color perfectly without looking chalky or too dry</li>
            <li>It has a nice blonde color which is great for holding off on coloring your hair.</li>
            <li>The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>It smells awesome, much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love that there is color which leaves hair looking very fresh.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, but just a nice strong fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!  </li>
            <li>It shows dirt so easily.</li>
            <li>the color from the spray just made it look like I lightened the roots to match the blonde highlights, which looks great, by the way.</li>
            <li>hint of blonde is great.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it suck up excess oil, but it gives my roots a nice hint of blonde, it smells wonderful, AND</li>
            <li>Goes on light and does the purpose well.</li>
            <li>This time I bought the light and blond.</li>
            <li>a nice and gentle smell that my husband loves too!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this particular one is awesome for covering my roots enough for me to extend the time between highlights.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is by far the best dry shampoo I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Looks fresh!</li>
            <li>I gave the original cherry I had been using to my mom who is gray anyway.</li>
            <li>oh, it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>The fact that it has a little color in it is great too, helps to hide the dirt even more.</li>
            <li>It adds a little bit more texture to my hair, makes it smell great, and lightens up my roots.  </li>
            <li>I even have noticed my hair is still clean the day</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo out of the many different brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>But this stuff works great - spray it on the roots from a distance, and then massage in a little, and your hair looks and feels clean!</li>
            <li>I have tried Tresemme and the new brand carried at Sally&#x27;s - neither worked, but Batiste&#x27;s Dry Shampoo is AWESOME!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Natural looking spray that smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this product many many many more times in the future.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I have a bottle in my gym bag, at the office &amp; at home.</li>
            <li>It never leaves my hair feeling gunky or full of residue and it helps hide my roots when they grow out.</li>
            <li>I went through a whole can and bought more, not just for me, but also for my sister who&#x27;s hair is just like mine.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST dry shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this brand of dry shampoo, It always smells nice and works well in my hair.</li>
            <li>, smell seems to be the main problem I find with the dry shampoos,the blond color gives you great coverage especially if you are getting close to needing a  touch up at the salon Great Product.</li>
            <li>Great product, works well in between Washington or to use as the gray grows in prior to getting my roots redone,  fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My order didn&#x27;t arrive quickly, so I called customer service.  </li>
            <li>I deal with this by spraying quickly, holding my breath, and leaving the room for a minute afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty cheap too</li>
            <li>Great price, like better than the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>and then you must shake some of it out, but once you have used it you get almost a full day of freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li>You retain the smooth and light feel of your normal hair.</li>
            <li>A couple of quick sprays on my roots, and my hair looks freshly washed.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!!</li>
            <li>I wish I had enough words to say how much I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I have straight, fine, and somewhat oily hair.  </li>
            <li>pretty cool.</li>
            <li>so I was going to wait it out and see if there were complaints about it or if it was a success.</li>
            <li>With this product my hair looks and feels fresh</li>
            <li>The color of this spray is golden blond/honey colored.</li>
            <li>The nozzle/spray is a powerful burst..</li>
            <li>I recently bought my own bottle and have been using it sometimes right</li>
            <li>THEY WERE RIGHT.  </li>
            <li>will spray this in right after the shower if my hair is looking \\&quot;too clean\\&quot; too.</li>
            <li>Now I just need to figure out what will I do now with all the time that I save?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note to seller: I&#x27;m wishing there was a subscription option, because if there was, I would be signing myself up right now.)</li>
            <li>I am sure it may work very well for some as it was highly recommended but the color was a bright yellow and did not look natural at all on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to lose the daily date with my blow dryer and cut back to washing it</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for getting this to me so quickly!</li>
            <li>Amazing dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is better for my golden blond hair as it does not leave the roots white and chalky looking.</li>
            <li>I have tried several types of dry shampoo and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have light ash blonde hair, and when it&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li>This has a little bit of color to make it blend in with your hair and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I loved batiste&#x27;s original dry shampoo, and recently I&#x27;ve been wanted to bring out my highlights and make my hair a bit lighter without having to dye it, and this product made my hair lighter and cleaner with just one use!</li>
            <li>I just came back and ordered more and to leave this review.</li>
            <li>All together I love this product and will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>The lemon scent is more reminiscent of cleaning products, not beauty products.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake the can well and hold it back away from your hair like the directions state.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying the color version</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I would like to be able to go in between washings without my hair looking oily and gross.  </li>
            <li>It actually thickens my hair and it looks better with each day.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that on the first use, but it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>If you use it for too many days in a row, your scalp may start to get more tense and it can build up though, so good for the every other day wash or every three day wash when you have a ton of hair and pony tail options for a day.</li>
            <li>great dry shampoo the only one I would ever use.</li>
            <li>Not only will it leave your hair hair looking clean, my hair actually looks BETTER than it does right after a fresh shampoo and blow out -- healthier, and shinier.</li>
            <li>I am considering taking this to my hair stylist at my next appointment and spraying it on my hair and asking her to match the color, it&#x27;s a nice matte blonde color that looks way more natural than the colors they use.</li>
            <li>The color that is in the spray comes out really yellow/brassy on my super light blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to the good smelling, colorless blush next time.</li>
            <li>This is great especially when I&#x27;m due for a highlight.</li>
            <li>The smell was also not as attractive as all the other different Batiste&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used (5).  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the added hint of blonde, rather than a baby powder white snow storm on top of my head that never seems to go away</li>
            <li>A little spritz and your hair feels and looks so much better!</li>
            <li>So much better than the drug store dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love this dry shampoo, it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>, the white looks more normal on me.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to hide my roots more than a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and left my hair looking very fresh.</li>
            <li>Great for a little lift of volume to flat straight hair!</li>
            <li>This spray leaves a fine layer of yellow dust all over your scalp that you feel the urge to immediately wash off.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>I get my hair foiled every few months and this not only works well as a dry shampoo (giving my hair more body between \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shampoos) but the hint of blonde in it does a great job of minimizing the look of my darker roots!</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>beforehand, if my hair was greasy or put on too much product, I always used baby powder.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time between washing my hair - THanks</li>
            <li>I spray it and then use a pick to fluff up the top of my head and soak up the oil.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Looks very unnatural.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>my streaks really DO appear to be highlights.  </li>
            <li>However,if you have really light blonde hair, I would not recommend this spray.</li>
            <li>I just think it is mislabeled as &#x27;light and blonde&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure no one else notices, even a little, because no one pays as much attention to your hair as you do.</li>
            <li>I was so excited after I sprayed it on because it totally looked like I just got my hair colored and washed.</li>
            <li>after I wash, blowdry, and style my hair because it gives it some volume, due to the texture it creates, and I also love the color.</li>
            <li>I like the blond tint, gives extra body and the smell is clean</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look great when I have little time to wash and dry it.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite, by far of all the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I part my hair in the middle and that whole strip of my scalp was super colored.</li>
            <li>anyway, some talk show convinced me to try these, and this brand far exceeded the others in popularity, so first I ordered &amp;#34;original cherry&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would advise is do not get this product if you are looking for a spray just to make your hair lighter, the reason being is this is a very good dry shampoo and gets oil out very well, so if you use this for just lightning your hair you may find your hair dried out.</li>
            <li>This blends in well with my hair, and leaves it feeling fresh and with volume with out feeling fried and dry, like most dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li>The blonde color is subtle enough to blend in, but does a great job at covering roots!</li>
            <li>I used two bottles of it knowing it left my hair somewhat white, but I was able to blend it.  </li>
            <li>You can comb or brush some of it out if the color is too blonde bold for your hair color.  </li>
            <li>It was super yellow!  </li>
            <li>If you have a more golden/dirty blonde/dark blonde tone, this could definitely work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little yellower than my hair is, so I can see it, and I just try to massage it in more</li>
            <li>There was no other way to get any volume without washing and setting on hot rollers every morning.</li>
            <li>lol it&#x27;s a weird color.</li>
            <li>Until I tried this brand I thought the tacky texture was normal.</li>
            <li>Also, the tone of the dry shampoo would be better for &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; blondes, not those who have more white or pale tones in their hair.</li>
            <li>This is the fourth dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m absolutely in love.  </li>
            <li>The sprays seem to add more body and keep your hair stiff and polished looking too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-gives my hair new life and bounce</li>
            <li>I recommend it, my only issue would be that I didn&#x27;t realize how important it is to shake vigorously because I still have some product left</li>
            <li>This WOULD work if you have a very golden, caramel, honey, yellow blonde.  </li>
            <li>Really happy I bought it, brightens up dull blonde hair in an instant.</li>
            <li>I have dark blonde/ light mousy ashy brown hair.</li>
            <li>unless you have YELLOW hair, it won&#x27;t look to pretty.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>(although smell is personal preference, this is pretty neutral).  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every single day, also the color is fine as I have blonde hair</li>
            <li>This blonde dry shampoo looks perfectly natural and makes my fine hair easier to style too.  </li>
            <li>I have medium blonde hair with streaks of white (okay, grey), which I can no longer claim to be the result of artful highlighting at the salon.</li>
            <li>The rep I spoke with was very curteous and was prepared to send a new shipment if my order didn&#x27;t come by the following day (which it</li>
            <li>This review is for the Light &amp; Blonde dry shampoo by Batiste...  </li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, I had to hurry over to my friend&#x27;s house one morning and spent the entire time whining about how gross I felt because my hair was oily but my friend&#x27;s mother had this exact bottle of Batiste dry shampoo in the light &amp; blonde</li>
            <li>I use it right after I dry my washed hair and set.</li>
            <li>better than more expensive dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dry everywhere except in the center top of my scalp, which is really the only part that ever gets oily.</li>
            <li>seems relatively natural, and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I try to spray it just near my roots and work it in well.  </li>
            <li>I am completely sold on this product,....</li>
            <li>My hair naturally has body, but this product adds to it.</li>
            <li>But I suppose wanting more of the product really isn&#x27;t that big of a complaint anyway.  </li>
            <li>Batiste dry shampoos are my favorite hands down.</li>
            <li>I find that this dry shampoo really extends that time as it sort of blends the roots!  </li>
            <li>So this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Batiste line of dry shampoos</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo works very well but only get light and blonde color if your hair is bleach blonde</li>
            <li>the color is too light for my dark blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have pale blond hair I would stick with the original spray which goes on \\&quot;white\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 7 different brands, some were highly rated on amazon, others were recommend by my salon.</li>
            <li>This is the only dry shampoo I have ever used that made my hair feel freshly washed after use.</li>
            <li>I have always been iffy about dry shampoos, because how is putting more product in your hair supposed to make it less greasy and gross looking?</li>
            <li>I spray it in first thing in the morning, then get ready and once its had time to soak up the oil, style my hair as usual.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d note about it is that the color really is quite yellow.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t enough colour to hide my roots as they grow in, but it also doesn&#x27;t leave a wipe powdery residue on my scalp and my hair feels very natural &amp; has lots of movement.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that this stuff does its just in acting as a dry shampoo mechanically.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in my hair resulting in that nasty grey color.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find this locally, but so far must order it online.  </li>
            <li>Spent a while longer rubbing the shampoo out of my hair to really get everything out.</li>
            <li>A few spritzes of this tinted dry shampoo, a quick scalp massage to distribute, and voila!</li>
            <li>I have medium light blonde hair and have used regular, white, dry shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li>This Batiste Dry Shampoo, Light and Blonde does the job, keeps the hair less greasy</li>
            <li>It takes away the greasy shine and adds extra manageability and body to my fine hair without the dull, gray residue you can get from non colored products.</li>
            <li>I am new to using dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It is really too bad because it smells like amazing vanilla.</li>
            <li>The color was supposed to be blonde, but, it&#x27;s FAR from blonde that I&#x27;m used to...</li>
            <li>I was super skeptical at first because I assumed that it would leave a noticeable residue</li>
            <li>a bottle of pssssst lasts so much longer and costs less.</li>
            <li>I generally have to shampoo my hair daily, and sometimes even multiple times a day to keep the oil at bay.  </li>
            <li>You have you brush it out a little and maybe blow dry the roots some to get it absorbed (and not look like a powdered wig), but it will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I LOVED the rockaholic dry shampoo (Dirty Secret) but a design flaw with the can made it only last about 2 uses before it pretty much emptied itself out.</li>
            <li>Batiste dry shampoo in light blonde has helped me with a thin oily hair problem I have dealt with my entire adult life.</li>

            <li> The blonde tint is perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this shade even though my hair isn&#x27;t really blonde anymore.</li>

            <li> Anyway, I love it.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps and that you all enjoy!</li>
            <li> The blonde blends in perfectly with my hair.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love this product -</li>
            <li> but no aerosol to spray it, so make sure to shake well before use.</li>
            <li> I will repurchase for sure.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a must-have for healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I also love how you don&#x27;t have to wait two minutes to brush it out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Reasons Why I Love It:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am considering ordering a case and hoarding them, as I cannot imagine my life now without this magical elixir.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for the price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even better than the original!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this one is awesome!  </li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo ever</li>
            <li> Truly the best dry shampoo available, I have tried many and this by far is the best, the texture of your hair after you apply it is so soft and smells good as well</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used</li>
            <li> best dry shampoo for blondes.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li> my hair color perfectly without looking chalky or too dry</li>
            <li> It has a nice blonde color which is great for holding off on coloring your hair.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It smells awesome, much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love that there is color which leaves hair looking very fresh.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, but just a nice strong fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!  </li>
            <li> It shows dirt so easily.</li>
            <li> the color from the spray just made it look like I lightened the roots to match the blonde highlights, which looks great, by the way.</li>
            <li> hint of blonde is great.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it suck up excess oil, but it gives my roots a nice hint of blonde, it smells wonderful, AND</li>
            <li> Goes on light and does the purpose well.</li>
            <li> This time I bought the light and blond.</li>
            <li> a nice and gentle smell that my husband loves too!&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this particular one is awesome for covering my roots enough for me to extend the time between highlights.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is by far the best dry shampoo I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Looks fresh!</li>
            <li> I gave the original cherry I had been using to my mom who is gray anyway.</li>
            <li> oh, it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> The fact that it has a little color in it is great too, helps to hide the dirt even more.</li>
            <li> It adds a little bit more texture to my hair, makes it smell great, and lightens up my roots.  </li>
            <li> I even have noticed my hair is still clean the day</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo out of the many different brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> But this stuff works great - spray it on the roots from a distance, and then massage in a little, and your hair looks and feels clean!</li>
            <li> I have tried Tresemme and the new brand carried at Sally&#x27;s - neither worked, but Batiste&#x27;s Dry Shampoo is AWESOME!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Natural looking spray that smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this product many many many more times in the future.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I have a bottle in my gym bag, at the office &amp; at home.</li>
            <li> It never leaves my hair feeling gunky or full of residue and it helps hide my roots when they grow out.</li>
            <li> I went through a whole can and bought more, not just for me, but also for my sister who&#x27;s hair is just like mine.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST dry shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this brand of dry shampoo, It always smells nice and works well in my hair.</li>
            <li> , smell seems to be the main problem I find with the dry shampoos,the blond color gives you great coverage especially if you are getting close to needing a  touch up at the salon Great Product.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well in between Washington or to use as the gray grows in prior to getting my roots redone,  fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My order didn&#x27;t arrive quickly, so I called customer service.  </li>
            <li> I deal with this by spraying quickly, holding my breath, and leaving the room for a minute afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty cheap too</li>
            <li> Great price, like better than the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> and then you must shake some of it out, but once you have used it you get almost a full day of freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li> You retain the smooth and light feel of your normal hair.</li>
            <li> A couple of quick sprays on my roots, and my hair looks freshly washed.  </li>
            <li> I really like it!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had enough words to say how much I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I have straight, fine, and somewhat oily hair.  </li>
            <li> pretty cool.</li>
            <li> so I was going to wait it out and see if there were complaints about it or if it was a success.</li>
            <li> With this product my hair looks and feels fresh</li>
            <li> The color of this spray is golden blond/honey colored.</li>
            <li> The nozzle/spray is a powerful burst..</li>
            <li> I recently bought my own bottle and have been using it sometimes right</li>
            <li> THEY WERE RIGHT.  </li>
            <li> will spray this in right after the shower if my hair is looking \\&quot;too clean\\&quot; too.</li>
            <li> Now I just need to figure out what will I do now with all the time that I save?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note to seller: I&#x27;m wishing there was a subscription option, because if there was, I would be signing myself up right now.)</li>
            <li> I am sure it may work very well for some as it was highly recommended but the color was a bright yellow and did not look natural at all on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to lose the daily date with my blow dryer and cut back to washing it</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for getting this to me so quickly!</li>
            <li> Amazing dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is better for my golden blond hair as it does not leave the roots white and chalky looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried several types of dry shampoo and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have light ash blonde hair, and when it&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li> This has a little bit of color to make it blend in with your hair and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I loved batiste&#x27;s original dry shampoo, and recently I&#x27;ve been wanted to bring out my highlights and make my hair a bit lighter without having to dye it, and this product made my hair lighter and cleaner with just one use!</li>
            <li> I just came back and ordered more and to leave this review.</li>
            <li> All together I love this product and will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The lemon scent is more reminiscent of cleaning products, not beauty products.</li>
            <li> Make sure you shake the can well and hold it back away from your hair like the directions state.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying the color version</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I would like to be able to go in between washings without my hair looking oily and gross.  </li>
            <li> It actually thickens my hair and it looks better with each day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that on the first use, but it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> If you use it for too many days in a row, your scalp may start to get more tense and it can build up though, so good for the every other day wash or every three day wash when you have a ton of hair and pony tail options for a day.</li>
            <li> great dry shampoo the only one I would ever use.</li>
            <li> Not only will it leave your hair hair looking clean, my hair actually looks BETTER than it does right after a fresh shampoo and blow out -- healthier, and shinier.</li>
            <li> I am considering taking this to my hair stylist at my next appointment and spraying it on my hair and asking her to match the color, it&#x27;s a nice matte blonde color that looks way more natural than the colors they use.</li>
            <li> The color that is in the spray comes out really yellow/brassy on my super light blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to the good smelling, colorless blush next time.</li>
            <li> This is great especially when I&#x27;m due for a highlight.</li>
            <li> The smell was also not as attractive as all the other different Batiste&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used (5).  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the added hint of blonde, rather than a baby powder white snow storm on top of my head that never seems to go away</li>
            <li> A little spritz and your hair feels and looks so much better!</li>
            <li> So much better than the drug store dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo, it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> , the white looks more normal on me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to hide my roots more than a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and left my hair looking very fresh.</li>
            <li> Great for a little lift of volume to flat straight hair!</li>
            <li> This spray leaves a fine layer of yellow dust all over your scalp that you feel the urge to immediately wash off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I get my hair foiled every few months and this not only works well as a dry shampoo (giving my hair more body between \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shampoos) but the hint of blonde in it does a great job of minimizing the look of my darker roots!</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> beforehand, if my hair was greasy or put on too much product, I always used baby powder.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time between washing my hair - THanks</li>
            <li> I spray it and then use a pick to fluff up the top of my head and soak up the oil.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Looks very unnatural.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> my streaks really DO appear to be highlights.  </li>
            <li> However,if you have really light blonde hair, I would not recommend this spray.</li>
            <li> I just think it is mislabeled as &#x27;light and blonde&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure no one else notices, even a little, because no one pays as much attention to your hair as you do.</li>
            <li> I was so excited after I sprayed it on because it totally looked like I just got my hair colored and washed.</li>
            <li> after I wash, blowdry, and style my hair because it gives it some volume, due to the texture it creates, and I also love the color.</li>
            <li> I like the blond tint, gives extra body and the smell is clean</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look great when I have little time to wash and dry it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite, by far of all the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I part my hair in the middle and that whole strip of my scalp was super colored.</li>
            <li> anyway, some talk show convinced me to try these, and this brand far exceeded the others in popularity, so first I ordered &amp;#34;original cherry&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would advise is do not get this product if you are looking for a spray just to make your hair lighter, the reason being is this is a very good dry shampoo and gets oil out very well, so if you use this for just lightning your hair you may find your hair dried out.</li>
            <li> This blends in well with my hair, and leaves it feeling fresh and with volume with out feeling fried and dry, like most dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> The blonde color is subtle enough to blend in, but does a great job at covering roots!</li>
            <li> I used two bottles of it knowing it left my hair somewhat white, but I was able to blend it.  </li>
            <li> You can comb or brush some of it out if the color is too blonde bold for your hair color.  </li>
            <li> It was super yellow!  </li>
            <li> If you have a more golden/dirty blonde/dark blonde tone, this could definitely work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little yellower than my hair is, so I can see it, and I just try to massage it in more</li>
            <li> There was no other way to get any volume without washing and setting on hot rollers every morning.</li>
            <li> lol it&#x27;s a weird color.</li>
            <li> Until I tried this brand I thought the tacky texture was normal.</li>
            <li> Also, the tone of the dry shampoo would be better for &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; blondes, not those who have more white or pale tones in their hair.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m absolutely in love.  </li>
            <li> The sprays seem to add more body and keep your hair stiff and polished looking too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-gives my hair new life and bounce</li>
            <li> I recommend it, my only issue would be that I didn&#x27;t realize how important it is to shake vigorously because I still have some product left</li>
            <li> This WOULD work if you have a very golden, caramel, honey, yellow blonde.  </li>
            <li> Really happy I bought it, brightens up dull blonde hair in an instant.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde/ light mousy ashy brown hair.</li>
            <li> unless you have YELLOW hair, it won&#x27;t look to pretty.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> (although smell is personal preference, this is pretty neutral).  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every single day, also the color is fine as I have blonde hair</li>
            <li> This blonde dry shampoo looks perfectly natural and makes my fine hair easier to style too.  </li>
            <li> I have medium blonde hair with streaks of white (okay, grey), which I can no longer claim to be the result of artful highlighting at the salon.</li>
            <li> The rep I spoke with was very curteous and was prepared to send a new shipment if my order didn&#x27;t come by the following day (which it</li>
            <li> This review is for the Light &amp; Blonde dry shampoo by Batiste...  </li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, I had to hurry over to my friend&#x27;s house one morning and spent the entire time whining about how gross I felt because my hair was oily but my friend&#x27;s mother had this exact bottle of Batiste dry shampoo in the light &amp; blonde</li>
            <li> I use it right after I dry my washed hair and set.</li>
            <li> better than more expensive dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dry everywhere except in the center top of my scalp, which is really the only part that ever gets oily.</li>
            <li> seems relatively natural, and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I try to spray it just near my roots and work it in well.  </li>
            <li> I am completely sold on this product,....</li>
            <li> My hair naturally has body, but this product adds to it.</li>
            <li> But I suppose wanting more of the product really isn&#x27;t that big of a complaint anyway.  </li>
            <li> Batiste dry shampoos are my favorite hands down.</li>
            <li> I find that this dry shampoo really extends that time as it sort of blends the roots!  </li>
            <li> So this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Batiste line of dry shampoos</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works very well but only get light and blonde color if your hair is bleach blonde</li>
            <li> the color is too light for my dark blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have pale blond hair I would stick with the original spray which goes on \\&quot;white\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 7 different brands, some were highly rated on amazon, others were recommend by my salon.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo I have ever used that made my hair feel freshly washed after use.</li>
            <li> I have always been iffy about dry shampoos, because how is putting more product in your hair supposed to make it less greasy and gross looking?</li>
            <li> I spray it in first thing in the morning, then get ready and once its had time to soak up the oil, style my hair as usual.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d note about it is that the color really is quite yellow.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t enough colour to hide my roots as they grow in, but it also doesn&#x27;t leave a wipe powdery residue on my scalp and my hair feels very natural &amp; has lots of movement.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this stuff does its just in acting as a dry shampoo mechanically.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in my hair resulting in that nasty grey color.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this locally, but so far must order it online.  </li>
            <li> Spent a while longer rubbing the shampoo out of my hair to really get everything out.</li>
            <li> A few spritzes of this tinted dry shampoo, a quick scalp massage to distribute, and voila!</li>
            <li> I have medium light blonde hair and have used regular, white, dry shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li> This Batiste Dry Shampoo, Light and Blonde does the job, keeps the hair less greasy</li>
            <li> It takes away the greasy shine and adds extra manageability and body to my fine hair without the dull, gray residue you can get from non colored products.</li>
            <li> I am new to using dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It is really too bad because it smells like amazing vanilla.</li>
            <li> The color was supposed to be blonde, but, it&#x27;s FAR from blonde that I&#x27;m used to...</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical at first because I assumed that it would leave a noticeable residue</li>
            <li> a bottle of pssssst lasts so much longer and costs less.</li>
            <li> I generally have to shampoo my hair daily, and sometimes even multiple times a day to keep the oil at bay.  </li>
            <li> You have you brush it out a little and maybe blow dry the roots some to get it absorbed (and not look like a powdered wig), but it will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I LOVED the rockaholic dry shampoo (Dirty Secret) but a design flaw with the can made it only last about 2 uses before it pretty much emptied itself out.</li>
            <li> Batiste dry shampoo in light blonde has helped me with a thin oily hair problem I have dealt with my entire adult life.</li>
            <li> I have very fine dirty blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or that weird baby powder smell like most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> When I run out, I will actually order dry shampoo without the extra color.</li>
            <li> like to go as long as possible without washing in to keep the natural oils in there and keep it less processed looking.</li>
            <li> Yes, it comes out quite yellow upon initial application, but after it dries and has been finger-combed through one&#x27;s hair, the color tones down and one is left with just a hint of blonde.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is terrific!</li>
            <li> and it is almost impossible to add any kind of body or depth to it</li>
            <li> My hair stylist suggested I try dry shampoos, so I&#x27;ve been sampling different ones- until I came across this one.  </li>
            <li> I have british friends who always were raving about dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo brand you should ever use.  </li>
            <li> this dry shampoo thickened hair and lifted it between shampoos with a hint of colour rather than just white powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 10 different dry shampoos and can&#x27;t find this at any stores.</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> You would use the whole bottle and it is quite yellow if that thick.</li>
            <li> I can wait longer between washing my hair thanks to this product, and thus my overall hair is less dry than it previously was.</li>
            <li> tried several dry shampoo&#x27;s, most made my hair feel dirty and some even oilier.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for buying a tinted dry shampoo to help with roots and have almost bleach blonde or white blonde hair, I would go with a plain white batiste dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Batiste allows me to go several days with out \\&quot;wet shampooing\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not very strong, which could be a good or bad thing depending on how you see it.</li>
            <li> I have blonde highlights with some caramel and my natural dull dark blonde mixed in so</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and usually wash 1-2 times per day, but my hairdresser is trying to get me to wash every other day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t turn my fingers or scalp yellow like other dry shampoos for blondes</li>
            <li> but then dry shampoo started popping up everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a dry shampoo for years.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a dry shampoo before</li>
            <li> Additionally, my hair is highlighted and colored, and the color in the dry shampoo helps blend in the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are not careful when spraying this product in your hair, you can end up with small streaks of blonde throughout your hair.  </li>
            <li> The only down side to this product is the color.  </li>
            <li> Avoid this dry shampoo at all cost!</li>
            <li> i have no clue why no one mentioned in previous reviews that it literally is YELLOW.</li>
            <li> :(  I recently bleached my hair so I thought I would give the Light and Blonde a try.  </li>
            <li> Next morning all you have to do is put a showering cap on (because you don&#x27;t want to get the dry shampoo wet or a little gooping happens).  </li>
            <li> But if your hair isn&#x27;t quite this shade of blonde, you may notice it a little...</li>
            <li> My hair gets dry when I wash it every other day</li>
            <li> /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t clump or flake like other dry shampoos</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I wish I could find this in a bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li> It gets oily and greasy at an alarming rate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just aight - neither amazing nor cruddy.  </li>
            <li> It restores the fullness to my hair and keeps the oil down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a week and a half, and I&#x27;m over half-way through with this bottle.  </li>
            <li> a natural dirty blonde with highlights, but</li>
            <li> As it is being misted out of the can, there is a slight smell, and I have to hold my breath because the aerosolized particles will make me cough.</li>
            <li> I have some outgrowth of dark blond and it covered it!</li>
            <li> I wish the spray was a little finer.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair that also happens to be very thin.</li>
            <li> I use this product to freshen up my hair, and now I&#x27;m so addicted to it, I&#x27;m even using it after I finish drying my hair from regular shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Had to wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to set</li>
            <li> I thought I would give them one a try since I have dirty blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Have used frequently and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> ; brand dry shampoo works well for that purpose, but is very expensive, and not good color choices.  </li>
            <li> But as soon as it is a little dirty, it looks terrible and gross, it looks oily and darker and just not pretty.</li>
            <li> hair doesn&#x27;t develop the dreaded bad, funky powdery smell that I had noticed with another dry shampoo I have tried.</li>
            <li> so I decided to use it since my hair couldn&#x27;t look any worse than it already did.</li>
            <li> So I hate giving this low of a review</li>
            <li> But for pale blonde, NO:&#x27;(</li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair every night and felt guilty about over-washing it</li>
            <li> There is a definite yellowish tint and it looks horrible on silver/gray hair.</li>
            <li> I also tried TIGI&#x27;s dry shampoo and that product was just awful.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t want to leave out that this does not make your hair feel sticky or dirty.</li>
            <li> The smell is overpowering and leave you smelling like bad perfume.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I also picked up two bottles of the brunette version to give to my friend and to my sister, both of whom are sick of always fighting the grays, hopefully that will subdue them to some degree.</li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed when I got this.  </li>
            <li> and I found it to be horrible.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This spray leaves a fine layer of yellow dust all over your scalp that you feel the urge to immediately wash off. Don&#x27;t ever scratch your head or your fingernails will turn yellow. I was so relieved to switch back to the non-colored type of Batiste.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even function without this anymore. Best product I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> This works really well. You just need to shake it well before spraying so it doesn&#x27;t leave a yellow residue on your scalp or in your hair. I spray it in first thing in the morning, then get ready and once its had time to soak up the oil, style my hair as usual. Looks fresh!</li>
            <li> I think I preferred the powder that came out of the brush- it was easier to apply and worked better at soaking up the oil for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Great product. Truly helps with oily hair and looks great. Masks your roots as well when you need a touch up!</li>
            <li> A great product hat lives up to its claims!</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo ever</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is terrific! I get my hair foiled every few months and this not only works well as a dry shampoo (giving my hair more body between \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shampoos) but the hint of blonde in it does a great job of minimizing the look of my darker roots! I just came back and ordered more and to leave this review. I also picked up two bottles of the brunette version to give to my friend and to my sister, both of whom are sick of always fighting the grays, hopefully that will subdue them to some degree.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the color. Didn&#x27;t match my blonde.</li>
            <li> The blonde tint is perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this one is awesome!  I used to use B&amp;B (white) but it made my (blonde) hair look chalky.  This blonde dry shampoo looks perfectly natural and makes my fine hair easier to style too.  This is one of the best beauty category values I have ever found.  And I use a LOT of beauty products.</li>
            <li> The smell is overpowering and leave you smelling like bad perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 yo, and just started using these. beforehand, if my hair was greasy or put on too much product, I always used baby powder. which of course leaves your hair white until u fruitlessly try and shake it out. anyway, some talk show convinced me to try these, and this brand far exceeded the others in popularity, so first I ordered &amp;#34;original cherry&amp;#34;. I used two bottles of it knowing it left my hair somewhat white, but I was able to blend it.  annnd it hadn&#x27;t dawned on me to try tinted ones. I have dark blonde/ light mousy ashy brown hair. lol it&#x27;s a weird color. anyway I read horror stories in the reviews for medium brown- saying it gets all over bedding, hands, etc.  so I tried the blonde tint. I really like it!! if you spray too much, it actually brings out the highlights and makes your hair blonde. pretty cool. I&#x27;m very happy with this shade even though my hair isn&#x27;t really blonde anymore. it has faded highlights that this emphasizes. would definitely recommend. I gave the original cherry I had been using to my mom who is gray anyway. so win win.&lt;br /&gt;what I like most about this is you can&#x27;t overuse it. unlike serums or sprays, this does the opposite. no funky buildup or grease. it&#x27;s dries up the grease using the same mechanism as rice. that&#x27;s actually one of the ingredients. seems relatively natural, and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have light ash blonde hair, and when it&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s really pretty. But as soon as it is a little dirty, it looks terrible and gross, it looks oily and darker and just not pretty. It shows dirt so easily. I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair every day, who has time for that? But this stuff works great - spray it on the roots from a distance, and then massage in a little, and your hair looks and feels clean! The fact that it has a little color in it is great too, helps to hide the dirt even more. But if your hair isn&#x27;t quite this shade of blonde, you may notice it a little... it&#x27;s a little yellower than my hair is, so I can see it, and I just try to massage it in more so it&#x27;s not so obvious. I&#x27;m pretty sure no one else notices, even a little, because no one pays as much attention to your hair as you do. Anyway, I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 7 different brands, some were highly rated on amazon, others were recommend by my salon. Until I tried this brand I thought the tacky texture was normal. My hair felt &amp; looked just as good after using this as it did after my shower - and it continued to look great for 5 days!! There isn&#x27;t enough colour to hide my roots as they grow in, but it also doesn&#x27;t leave a wipe powdery residue on my scalp and my hair feels very natural &amp; has lots of movement. I love it so much I have a bottle in my gym bag, at the office &amp; at home. It&#x27;s a great way to freshen up before a meeting or event.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and it is almost impossible to add any kind of body or depth to it and my hair gets oily after 24 hours. I used to wash my hair every night and felt guilty about over-washing it but then dry shampoo started popping up everywhere. I was super skeptical at first because I assumed that it would leave a noticeable residue so I was going to wait it out and see if there were complaints about it or if it was a success. Fortunately for me, I had to hurry over to my friend&#x27;s house one morning and spent the entire time whining about how gross I felt because my hair was oily but my friend&#x27;s mother had this exact bottle of Batiste dry shampoo in the light &amp; blonde so I decided to use it since my hair couldn&#x27;t look any worse than it already did. I was so excited after I sprayed it on because it totally looked like I just got my hair colored and washed. I have blonde highlights with some caramel and my natural dull dark blonde mixed in so the color from the spray just made it look like I lightened the roots to match the blonde highlights, which looks great, by the way. I recently bought my own bottle and have been using it sometimes right after I wash, blowdry, and style my hair because it gives it some volume, due to the texture it creates, and I also love the color. I am considering taking this to my hair stylist at my next appointment and spraying it on my hair and asking her to match the color, it&#x27;s a nice matte blonde color that looks way more natural than the colors they use. I hope this review helps and that you all enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite dry shampoo.  It restores the fullness to my hair and keeps the oil down.  It never leaves my hair feeling gunky or full of residue and it helps hide my roots when they grow out.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works very well but only get light and blonde color if your hair is bleach blonde</li>
            <li> So much better than the drug store dry shampoo. It smells great, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in my hair resulting in that nasty grey color.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Great product, works well in between Washington or to use as the gray grows in prior to getting my roots redone,  fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m absolutely in love.  I have very fine dirty blonde hair.  It gets oily and greasy at an alarming rate.  I generally have to shampoo my hair daily, and sometimes even multiple times a day to keep the oil at bay.  My hair stylist suggested I try dry shampoos, so I&#x27;ve been sampling different ones- until I came across this one.  It&#x27;s my favorite, by far of all the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  I use this product to freshen up my hair, and now I&#x27;m so addicted to it, I&#x27;m even using it after I finish drying my hair from regular shampooing.  It adds a little bit more texture to my hair, makes it smell great, and lightens up my roots.  The blonde blends in perfectly with my hair.  The only complaint I have is that I wish I could find this in a bigger bottle.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a week and a half, and I&#x27;m over half-way through with this bottle.  But I suppose wanting more of the product really isn&#x27;t that big of a complaint anyway.  :)</li>
            <li> I LOVED the rockaholic dry shampoo (Dirty Secret) but a design flaw with the can made it only last about 2 uses before it pretty much emptied itself out. This one has no such problems and works just as well (at a smaller price!).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dry shampoo! I have medium brown hair that sometimes gets a bit oily. I loved batiste&#x27;s original dry shampoo, and recently I&#x27;ve been wanted to bring out my highlights and make my hair a bit lighter without having to dye it, and this product made my hair lighter and cleaner with just one use! The only thing I would advise is do not get this product if you are looking for a spray just to make your hair lighter, the reason being is this is a very good dry shampoo and gets oil out very well, so if you use this for just lightning your hair you may find your hair dried out. All together I love this product and will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.  I have british friends who always were raving about dry shampoo.  I tried Tresemme and was so underwhelmed.  Well, my friends said that there was nothing comparable to Batiste.  THEY WERE RIGHT.  BATISTE ROCKS!  So effective without excess product build up.  I have straight, fine, and somewhat oily hair.  Had to wash my hair everyday.  Now, I can save hours of styling!  My system: Style your hair with a regular wash in the morning.  Put Batiste in before bed.  Next morning all you have to do is put a showering cap on (because you don&#x27;t want to get the dry shampoo wet or a little gooping happens).  Brush your hair and off!  This is the only dry shampoo brand you should ever use.  I even have noticed my hair is still clean the day after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hint of blonde is great.  Looks yellow til brushed.  However, I don&#x27;t agree that it works as root coverup.  You would use the whole bottle and it is quite yellow if that thick.</li>
            <li> It has a nice blonde color which is great for holding off on coloring your hair. It doesn&#x27;t give you enough body though, I still add regular powder to make it look fuller.</li>
            <li> This is great especially when I&#x27;m due for a highlight. Has extended my time in between by 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is by far the best dry shampoo I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using Oscar Blandi and I found it to be horrible. The lemon scent is more reminiscent of cleaning products, not beauty products. I also tried TIGI&#x27;s dry shampoo and that product was just awful. This product helps lighten my roots which gets darker in the winter months and it makes my hair smell and feel great. My hair gets dry when I wash it every other day but I feel scuzzy not washing it that often. With this product my hair looks and feels fresh and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product - I use it all the time between washing my hair - THanks and I will continue ordering it</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a dry shampoo for years.  I thought I would give them one a try since I have dirty blonde hair.  This is by far the BEST dry shampoo I have ever used.  I found that by using this I can go about 2 days without washing my hair.  Make sure you shake the can well and hold it back away from your hair like the directions state.  You can comb or brush some of it out if the color is too blonde bold for your hair color.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or that weird baby powder smell like most dry shampoos. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Truly the best dry shampoo available, I have tried many and this by far is the best, the texture of your hair after you apply it is so soft and smells good as well, smell seems to be the main problem I find with the dry shampoos,the blond color gives you great coverage especially if you are getting close to needing a  touch up at the salon Great Product.</li>
            <li> This Batiste Dry Shampoo, Light and Blonde does the job, keeps the hair less greasy so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every single day, also the color is fine as I have blonde hair and I don&#x27;t notice any particles on my hair.</li>
            <li> Not only is it helpful in terms of those &amp;#34;days you can&#x27;t shampoo,&amp;#34; it provides some blonde coverage to roots and volume.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Batiste products!  5 stars on the others!  So I hate giving this low of a review:(  I recently bleached my hair so I thought I would give the Light and Blonde a try.  It was super yellow!  It put a yellow/honey color where ever I sprayed AND turned my scalp gold lol.  The smell was also not as attractive as all the other different Batiste&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used (5).  This WOULD work if you have a very golden, caramel, honey, yellow blonde.  But for pale blonde, NO:&#x27;(</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used and it is also the best value. It lasted quite a while and the blonde tint helped hide my roots growing out so I could stretch my salon visits another 2 to 3 weeks. This is the only dry shampoo I have ever used that made my hair feel freshly washed after use. It takes a few minutes to set and then you must shake some of it out, but once you have used it you get almost a full day of freshly washed hair. I recommend it, my only issue would be that I didn&#x27;t realize how important it is to shake vigorously because I still have some product left but no aerosol to spray it, so make sure to shake well before use. I will repurchase for sure.</li>
            <li> good price, good item</li>
            <li> Natural looking spray that smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this product many many many more times in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  The smell is toxic and I suggest you not buy this product unless you have lost your sense of smell and just want to throw your money away.  There is NO return and NO refund on this product.  Buyer BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just aight - neither amazing nor cruddy.  Be warned - it is for blonde blondes.  There is a definite yellowish tint and it looks horrible on silver/gray hair.</li>
            <li> I am new to using dry shampoo.  This is a great product.  It smells heavenly and works well to freshen up my hair.  The only down side to this product is the color.  If you are not careful when spraying this product in your hair, you can end up with small streaks of blonde throughout your hair.  I try to spray it just near my roots and work it in well.  When I run out, I will actually order dry shampoo without the extra color.</li>
            <li> best dry shampoo for blondes. period.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! The smell is not very strong, which could be a good or bad thing depending on how you see it. (Just a side note, I bought the blonde one) This blends in well with my hair, and leaves it feeling fresh and with volume with out feeling fried and dry, like most dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo out of the many different brands I&#x27;ve tried. I love the smell and it works great. The fact that is also helps to conceal darker roots is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I have always been iffy about dry shampoos, because how is putting more product in your hair supposed to make it less greasy and gross looking? But this is SO perfect. A little spritz and your hair feels and looks so much better! The best part is is that it smells wonderful too. Not too strong, but just a nice strong fresh scent. And it&#x27;s pretty cheap too, it&#x27;s a must-have for healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works exactly as described. Have used frequently and have not been disappointed. I have a neck injury so having this product has been a blessing for me.</li>
            <li> I have medium light blonde hair and have used regular, white, dry shampoo for a long time. This is SO MUCH BETTER! It takes away the greasy shine and adds extra manageability and body to my fine hair without the dull, gray residue you can get from non colored products. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad. It&#x27;s better than others I&#x27;ve used. I went through a whole can and bought more, not just for me, but also for my sister who&#x27;s hair is just like mine. She loves it too! I also don&#x27;t want to leave out that this does not make your hair feel sticky or dirty. You retain the smooth and light feel of your normal hair.</li>
            <li> The color of this spray is golden blond/honey colored. If you have pale blond hair I would stick with the original spray which goes on \\&quot;white\\&quot;. This is better for my golden blond hair as it does not leave the roots white and chalky looking.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Light &amp; Blonde dry shampoo by Batiste...  I wish I had enough words to say how much I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s incredible!  Not only does it suck up excess oil, but it gives my roots a nice hint of blonde, it smells wonderful, AND I get a ton of body!  I also love how you don&#x27;t have to wait two minutes to brush it out.  I spray it and then use a pick to fluff up the top of my head and soak up the oil.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for getting this to me so quickly! I will definitely use again! I recommend this product and store</li>
            <li> Smells good. Goes on light and does the purpose well. It doesnt take a lot. Great for those days that I dont leave the house but want to freshen up. I&#x27;ll definetly purchase again.Price is good.</li>
            <li> Avoid this dry shampoo at all cost! i have no clue why no one mentioned in previous reviews that it literally is YELLOW. unless you have YELLOW hair, it won&#x27;t look to pretty.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is AMAZING!!!!! I have some outgrowth of dark blond and it covered it! I am going to stock up!!!! It is absolutely amazing and I am SO HAPPY!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brand of dry shampoo, It always smells nice and works well in my hair. I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; coloring in this product as it doesn&#x27;t always match my hair and its visible till I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this locally, but so far must order it online.  It is nice that it is not just &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; and blends in with your hair.  I highlight my hair about every 2 months... I find that this dry shampoo really extends that time as it sort of blends the roots!  A bonus I wasn&#x27;t expecting!</li>
            <li> I was bummed when Sally&#x27;s stopped carrying Batiste!  I have tried Tresemme and the new brand carried at Sally&#x27;s - neither worked, but Batiste&#x27;s Dry Shampoo is AWESOME!!!!!!!  This was my first time trying the color version and it&#x27;s even better than the original!  I will be buying more and it came quickly!!!!!!!!!!!  THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this dry shampoo thickened hair and lifted it between shampoos with a hint of colour rather than just white powder.</li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo, it works wonders.  I have tried several types of dry shampoo and this is by far the best. I love that there is color which leaves hair looking very fresh. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Batiste line of dry shampoos and I do have to say it works great. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and left my hair looking very fresh. It smells awesome, much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. The only thing I&#x27;d note about it is that the color really is quite yellow. I part my hair in the middle and that whole strip of my scalp was super colored. Spent a while longer rubbing the shampoo out of my hair to really get everything out. I&#x27;ll probably try to brush my hair back before spraying. Will be getting the regular version next time, the white looks more normal on me.</li>
            <li> Batiste dry shampoos are my favorite hands down. But this particular one is awesome for covering my roots enough for me to extend the time between highlights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 10 different dry shampoos and can&#x27;t find this at any stores. I order two bottles at once now, so I don&#x27;t get in a bind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a natural dirty blonde with highlights, but like to go as long as possible without washing in to keep the natural oils in there and keep it less processed looking. I can also use this product to lighten my roots if I haven&#x27;t made it to the salon in a while. You have you brush it out a little and maybe blow dry the roots some to get it absorbed (and not look like a powdered wig), but it will do the trick. The sprays seem to add more body and keep your hair stiff and polished looking too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will spray this in right after the shower if my hair is looking \\&quot;too clean\\&quot; too. It will help with fly aways and smooth it out. If you use it for too many days in a row, your scalp may start to get more tense and it can build up though, so good for the every other day wash or every three day wash when you have a ton of hair and pony tail options for a day.</li>
            <li> love it!...arrived on time and great price!</li>
            <li> If you have blonde oily hair this is for you!  I love it so much.  It makes my hair look great when I have little time to wash and dry it.</li>
            <li> This time I bought the light and blond. It should be called, \\&quot;YELLOW.\\&quot; Wow! It is so very yellow. Looks very unnatural. I&#x27;ll go back to the good smelling, colorless blush next time. If your hairdresser says, \\&quot;Quit washing your hair so often,\\&quot; this is what you use in between washes on your roots.</li>
            <li> Nice color but a bottle of pssssst lasts so much longer and costs less. Maybe if you alternate the two products?</li>
            <li> Amazing dry shampoo.  My order didn&#x27;t arrive quickly, so I called customer service.  The rep I spoke with was very curteous and was prepared to send a new shipment if my order didn&#x27;t come by the following day (which it did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on days when I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair.  A couple of quick sprays on my roots, and my hair looks freshly washed.  I have very oily hair and usually wash 1-2 times per day, but my hairdresser is trying to get me to wash every other day.  The only way this is possible is with this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better than more expensive dry shampoos.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> If your hair is platinum it makes it yellow.</li>
            <li> Company was very, very nice and helped me with this product.  I am sure it may work very well for some as it was highly recommended but the color was a bright yellow and did not look natural at all on me.</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos. Batiste allows me to go several days with out \\&quot;wet shampooing\\&quot;.  I like the blond tint, gives extra body and the smell is clean (although smell is personal preference, this is pretty neutral).  Great price, like better than the more expensive brands.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am completely sold on this product,....it can extend my time between washes by double! I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair that also happens to be very thin. It&#x27;s very dry everywhere except in the center top of my scalp, which is really the only part that ever gets oily. This product has changed my day-to-day routine and has become one of my &amp;#34;must-haves&amp;#34;. I can wait longer between washing my hair thanks to this product, and thus my overall hair is less dry than it previously was. I also feel much more confident knowing that if I ever need to go in a hurry I can use this product in a moment! I take it with me on trips &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for camping too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons Why I Love It:&lt;br /&gt;-matches my hair color perfectly without looking chalky or too dry&lt;br /&gt;-gives my hair new life and bounce so I can skip washing it and over-drying it in the shower&lt;br /&gt;-has a nice and gentle smell that my husband loves too!&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t turn my fingers or scalp yellow like other dry shampoos for blondes&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t clump or flake like other dry shampoos&lt;br /&gt;-is the BEST VALUE for your $$$ by FAR</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I would like to be able to go in between washings without my hair looking oily and gross.  This stuff works and adds great volume to your roots.  I have never used a dry shampoo before so I can&#x27;t say how it compares to others.  This has a little bit of color to make it blend in with your hair and it smells pretty good. Doesn&#x27;t feel gross in your hair and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothing or hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover my roots in between salon treatments. I wish the spray was a little finer. Also, the tone of the dry shampoo would be better for &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; blondes, not those who have more white or pale tones in their hair. The tint to the shampoo is very, very yellow. If you are looking for buying a tinted dry shampoo to help with roots and have almost bleach blonde or white blonde hair, I would go with a plain white batiste dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have medium blonde hair with streaks of white (okay, grey), which I can no longer claim to be the result of artful highlighting at the salon. A few spritzes of this tinted dry shampoo, a quick scalp massage to distribute, and voila! my streaks really DO appear to be highlights.  Yes, it comes out quite yellow upon initial application, but after it dries and has been finger-combed through one&#x27;s hair, the color tones down and one is left with just a hint of blonde.  It also adds body to my baby-fine hair.  I am considering ordering a case and hoarding them, as I cannot imagine my life now without this magical elixir.</li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed when I got this.  The color was supposed to be blonde, but, it&#x27;s FAR from blonde that I&#x27;m used to...this is like using Gold....I had to wash this out, and then I threw the can away!</li>
            <li> Love it! great dry shampoo the only one I would ever use. I tried many others but this is the best</li>
            <li> This stuff buys me an extra 2-3 weeks before I have to get my hair re-highlighted.  The blonde color is subtle enough to blend in, but does a great job at covering roots!</li>
            <li> Batiste dry shampoo in light blonde has helped me with a thin oily hair problem I have dealt with my entire adult life. I used to wash my hair every morning before work. There was no other way to get any volume without washing and setting on hot rollers every morning. (yes I had to get up 2 hours before work to get ready)&lt;br /&gt;I tried several dry shampoo&#x27;s, most made my hair feel dirty and some even oilier. A hair dresser with similar hair to mine told me about Batiste. It actually thickens my hair and it looks better with each day. I go 4 days with no shampoo and could go a week. I use it right after I dry my washed hair and set. When rollers come out it stays all day with lots of volume. Then next 3 days I touch up with curling iron and spray roots with Batiste for a lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wished I would have had this product 30 yrs ago!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you Batiste !!</li>
            <li> The product works perfectly well. I enjoy the added hint of blonde, rather than a baby powder white snow storm on top of my head that never seems to go away completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative: Smells very strong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for the price. I was looking for something to hide my roots more than a dry shampoo.  The &amp;#34;Bumble &amp; Bumble&amp;#34; brand dry shampoo works well for that purpose, but is very expensive, and not good color choices.  I think tfor this product the color is too light for my dark blonde hair.  The nozzle/spray is a powerful burst.. I didn&#x27;t expect that on the first use, but it didn&#x27;t bother me. after the initial &#x27;scare&#x27;.  I&#x27;m going back to using the Rita Hazan root concealer, but I don&#x27;t regret trying this.</li>
            <li> As it is being misted out of the can, there is a slight smell, and I have to hold my breath because the aerosolized particles will make me cough. Big time! I deal with this by spraying quickly, holding my breath, and leaving the room for a minute afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But oh, it is so worth it! Not only will it leave your hair hair looking clean, my hair actually looks BETTER than it does right after a fresh shampoo and blow out -- healthier, and shinier. My hair naturally has body, but this product adds to it. Additionally, my hair is highlighted and colored, and the color in the dry shampoo helps blend in the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t develop the dreaded bad, funky powdery smell that I had noticed with another dry shampoo I have tried. I&#x27;m on day 3 today and there&#x27;s no smell -- that I can detect -- at all. I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to lose the daily date with my blow dryer and cut back to washing it maybe 2x a week. Now I just need to figure out what will I do now with all the time that I save?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note to seller: I&#x27;m wishing there was a subscription option, because if there was, I would be signing myself up right now.)</li>
            <li> Great for a little lift of volume to flat straight hair! Really happy I bought it, brightens up dull blonde hair in an instant.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this stuff does its just in acting as a dry shampoo mechanically. However,if you have really light blonde hair, I would not recommend this spray. The color that is in the spray comes out really yellow/brassy on my super light blonde hair. If you have a more golden/dirty blonde/dark blonde tone, this could definitely work.I just think it is mislabeled as &#x27;light and blonde&#x27;. It is really too bad because it smells like amazing vanilla.</li>
