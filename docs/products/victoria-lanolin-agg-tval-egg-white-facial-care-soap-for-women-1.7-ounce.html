            <li>The smell is fresh, clean, &amp; perfect for all genders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I first found it in Europe and was happy to find it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to give this face wash a chance and have been using it for many months.  </li>
            <li>So many rashes!!Now</li>
            <li>This version is way better than the camomile scented soap which I find more drying.  </li>
            <li>I have used this soap for many years.</li>
            <li>I really love this soap.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use moisturizer afterwards (I recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>this was the top 5.</li>
            <li>more than 6 months</li>
            <li>The package arrived safely in a matter of 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I purchased this soap on a whim and am so glad to I did.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I need to give it more time, but all of the rave reviews I have read before purchasing have not become a reality for me.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the way it makes my skin feel and have used it for years and years.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, and of course, the cute packaging.</li>
            <li>Leave skin glowing, taut and smooth!</li>
            <li>The box is really adorable though.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found the product here on Amazon, also at a lower price than I paid at the boutique.</li>
            <li>Based on Vogue editors&#x27; top picks, I purchased this and a Konjac sponge  </li>
            <li>hope that it will be more cheaper than it is.</li>
            <li>She will love you for it.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my face after using this soap.  </li>
            <li>:) So far so good!</li>
            <li>and I was happy this soap was so gentle to my sensitive skin and does a great job brightening and cleansing.</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used..leaves my face &amp;#34;sqeaky&amp;#34; clean...</li>
            <li>One thing I enjoy about this box size is that I will often give a bar to a friend to try when it comes up in conversation - they always love it too.</li>
            <li>Great quality and very mild soap for my wrinkled old face.</li>
            <li>I am 67 and my skin looks wonderful due to using this soap for a number of years.  </li>
            <li>more moisture but not so oily and feel nice for the whole day</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>But if you have acne-prone or sensitive skin, this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Gentle effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very likely that that person will greatly appreciate it.</li>
            <li>Dries up pimples and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>How fortunate I am to have happened across this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with complexion issues (though no product beats good old fashioned sleep).</li>
            <li>So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard good ratings, so hope I&#x27;ll continue to like the product.</li>
            <li>THis is a good soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>still on my first soap after a month of use and this soap, i would probably use the rest of my life!&lt;br /&gt;love it!!</li>
            <li>The soaps on those listings are exactly the same as these ones, they just have a more attractive name that may convince some to buy those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited - for</li>
            <li>It feels clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It cleans very effectively, but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good soap</li>
            <li>I read such good reviews about it and bought it as a pack of six.</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good about this</li>
            <li>I use it mostly as a mask by sudsing it on my face, letting it dry, then steaming it off with a warm washcloth followed by rinsing my face.</li>
            <li>This soap is mild and great for sensitive skin, yet completely cleansing - unlike some products which leave my face feeling oily.</li>
            <li>nothing note worthy.</li>
            <li>Very hot and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this and will continue to use it daily!</li>
            <li>Each bar lasts about a month for me, so it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Then a friend was surfing around &amp; remembered my mention of it and that it would likely be better for her rosacea and found it here!</li>
            <li>apprently, it is very well known in asian countries and they are one of the best sellers in asian countries.&lt;br /&gt;TRY</li>
            <li>I read lots of comments and this is good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Of all the products I&#x27;ve ever used to cleanse my face, this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>In the summer I use it in the am and pm, but in the winter I usually just use in the am, and I use Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery in the pm, and that keeps my skin in line and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I use it as a cleanser and mask several times a week in warm weather.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of cleaning with an egg white product</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work well for my skin type (early 40s, oily, congested, touch of rosacea) caused more blackheads rather than cleared them up.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, makes a good lather, pretty long lasting, but a bit drying for my skin.</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s really nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>I like the very mild smell, &amp; made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I gave a gift of this soap to my sister in law ( who has very dry skin) and she was thrilled with the result.  </li>
            <li>omg they smell pretty</li>
            <li>My favorite facial soap.</li>
            <li>but I just use only 1 let see more result.</li>
            <li>I am almost done with my first one.</li>
            <li>I bought it a few times up in a good Drug store in Saratoga NY and now they dont sell it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle to the face, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be sticking with this product &amp; ordering another box soon.</li>
            <li>I also have large pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li>Also, I rarely get pimples or blackheads because this stuff keeps my skin super clear and soft.</li>
            <li>bar works on my whole body; it provides a smooth surface on my legs for shaving &amp; cleans my extra-sensitive private areas with no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin really</li>
            <li>you so much</li>
            <li>my face skin feels much</li>
            <li>I make form and apply to the whole face and wait for 1-2 min.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected a lot more out of it.</li>
            <li>would recomend this soap to anyone with skin sensitivities who wants to control breakouts.</li>
            <li>used them daily for 8 months and so far, i love the product.&lt;br /&gt;it is intended to use it as a mask ( leave it on your face for 5 mins then wash it off w water )</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one bar so far, and it has been okay,</li>
            <li>have severe oily skin; I don&#x27;t get many pimples, but I require frequent powder applications &amp; I simply dislike the feeling of overly-oily skin.</li>
            <li>This soap is very gentle and lathers nicely - very soft skin afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I bought a tiny bar of this at a Scandinavian store in Poulsbo Wa a few years ago and loved it then.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it seemed like a simple fun classic to try.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it day and night for a couple of weeks now and it has helped clear my skin so much.</li>
            <li>As a daily makeup wearer, I need a soap that is a little more versatile (can remove makeup as well as impurities all at once, so I have been using this after I remove my makeup first.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this solution is a lot better than using expensive facial soaps, scrubs, etc which either leave some kind of residue or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>You apply a light layer from the soap directly onto your wet face.</li>
            <li>so very soft and supple</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin type, so</li>
            <li>I use this soap after my first cleansing with oil and use this soap as second cleanser.</li>
            <li>i am willing to buy it again later</li>
            <li>However i don&#x27;t find anything special about it compare to other face cleanser i&#x27;ve used, besides it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li>But as I&#x27;ve aged, my skin has turned more combination, and I had problems with dry patches on my cheeks in the winter.</li>
            <li>It is very mild on skin but be careful not to open your eye with soap.</li>
            <li>My redness seems to have calmed down a bit, and my pores have significantly shrinked.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let it get anywhere near your eyes, it will hurt, a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I wash with water, this makes my skin looks uniform and soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts, so I have probably tried every product in the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to impure ingredients, which will cause my face to sting.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin softly.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin type, then I recommend it.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean -- not oily; not dried out and tight, either.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling it leaves, but it just feels very clean, but still moisturized.</li>
            <li>I live in Canada, and the only place they sell this soap is quebec</li>
            <li>My back is naturally so oily that I often have trouble getting it clean without scrubbing the skin.</li>
            <li>Daily use makes for clear, soft skin and rosy cheeks.</li>
            <li>Long lasting - I&#x27;m still on my first bar after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>last pretty long time too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Travel friendly (small size</li>
            <li>Skin feels tight (can&#x27;t decide if it just feels dry) and clean as far as I can see.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely made a dent on it even though I use it almost every day, twice a</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and younger looking-will never use anything else.  </li>
            <li>As far as an overall face wash, it only gets 3 stars from me.</li>
            <li>Helps with skin smoothness and does not dry skin.</li>
            <li>I get these all the time for my face and they do not dry my skin, I have a sking condition and this does not effect my skin negativly at all.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>quickly washed my face with towel, but it is too late.</li>
            <li>I was in my late 30&#x27;s and have always had super oily skin.</li>
            <li>Moreover, although this soap gets rids of my extra oil it does not dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use daily and a couple of times a week let it dry completely like mask.  </li>

            <li> I have tried to give this face wash a chance and have been using it for many months.  </li>
            <li> So many rashes!!Now</li>
            <li> This version is way better than the camomile scented soap which I find more drying.  </li>
            <li> I have used this soap for many years.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use moisturizer afterwards (I recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> this was the top 5.</li>
            <li> more than 6 months</li>
            <li> The package arrived safely in a matter of 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap on a whim and am so glad to I did.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I need to give it more time, but all of the rave reviews I have read before purchasing have not become a reality for me.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the way it makes my skin feel and have used it for years and years.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, and of course, the cute packaging.</li>
            <li> Leave skin glowing, taut and smooth!</li>
            <li> The box is really adorable though.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found the product here on Amazon, also at a lower price than I paid at the boutique.</li>
            <li> Based on Vogue editors&#x27; top picks, I purchased this and a Konjac sponge  </li>
            <li> hope that it will be more cheaper than it is.</li>
            <li> She will love you for it.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my face after using this soap.  </li>
            <li> :) So far so good!</li>
            <li> and I was happy this soap was so gentle to my sensitive skin and does a great job brightening and cleansing.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used..leaves my face &amp;#34;sqeaky&amp;#34; clean...</li>
            <li> One thing I enjoy about this box size is that I will often give a bar to a friend to try when it comes up in conversation - they always love it too.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very mild soap for my wrinkled old face.</li>
            <li> I am 67 and my skin looks wonderful due to using this soap for a number of years.  </li>
            <li> more moisture but not so oily and feel nice for the whole day</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> But if you have acne-prone or sensitive skin, this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Gentle effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very likely that that person will greatly appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Dries up pimples and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> How fortunate I am to have happened across this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with complexion issues (though no product beats good old fashioned sleep).</li>
            <li> So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard good ratings, so hope I&#x27;ll continue to like the product.</li>
            <li> THis is a good soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> still on my first soap after a month of use and this soap, i would probably use the rest of my life!&lt;br /&gt;love it!!</li>
            <li> The soaps on those listings are exactly the same as these ones, they just have a more attractive name that may convince some to buy those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited - for</li>
            <li> It feels clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It cleans very effectively, but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good soap</li>
            <li> I read such good reviews about it and bought it as a pack of six.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good about this</li>
            <li> I use it mostly as a mask by sudsing it on my face, letting it dry, then steaming it off with a warm washcloth followed by rinsing my face.</li>
            <li> This soap is mild and great for sensitive skin, yet completely cleansing - unlike some products which leave my face feeling oily.</li>
            <li> nothing note worthy.</li>
            <li> Very hot and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this and will continue to use it daily!</li>
            <li> Each bar lasts about a month for me, so it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Then a friend was surfing around &amp; remembered my mention of it and that it would likely be better for her rosacea and found it here!</li>
            <li> apprently, it is very well known in asian countries and they are one of the best sellers in asian countries.&lt;br /&gt;TRY</li>
            <li> I read lots of comments and this is good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Of all the products I&#x27;ve ever used to cleanse my face, this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> In the summer I use it in the am and pm, but in the winter I usually just use in the am, and I use Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery in the pm, and that keeps my skin in line and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I use it as a cleanser and mask several times a week in warm weather.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of cleaning with an egg white product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for my skin type (early 40s, oily, congested, touch of rosacea) caused more blackheads rather than cleared them up.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, makes a good lather, pretty long lasting, but a bit drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s really nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> I like the very mild smell, &amp; made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I gave a gift of this soap to my sister in law ( who has very dry skin) and she was thrilled with the result.  </li>
            <li> omg they smell pretty</li>
            <li> My favorite facial soap.</li>
            <li> but I just use only 1 let see more result.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with my first one.</li>
            <li> I bought it a few times up in a good Drug store in Saratoga NY and now they dont sell it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle to the face, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be sticking with this product &amp; ordering another box soon.</li>
            <li> I also have large pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Also, I rarely get pimples or blackheads because this stuff keeps my skin super clear and soft.</li>
            <li> bar works on my whole body; it provides a smooth surface on my legs for shaving &amp; cleans my extra-sensitive private areas with no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin really</li>
            <li> you so much</li>
            <li> my face skin feels much</li>
            <li> I make form and apply to the whole face and wait for 1-2 min.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected a lot more out of it.</li>
            <li> would recomend this soap to anyone with skin sensitivities who wants to control breakouts.</li>
            <li> used them daily for 8 months and so far, i love the product.&lt;br /&gt;it is intended to use it as a mask ( leave it on your face for 5 mins then wash it off w water )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one bar so far, and it has been okay,</li>
            <li> have severe oily skin; I don&#x27;t get many pimples, but I require frequent powder applications &amp; I simply dislike the feeling of overly-oily skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is very gentle and lathers nicely - very soft skin afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I bought a tiny bar of this at a Scandinavian store in Poulsbo Wa a few years ago and loved it then.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it seemed like a simple fun classic to try.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it day and night for a couple of weeks now and it has helped clear my skin so much.</li>
            <li> As a daily makeup wearer, I need a soap that is a little more versatile (can remove makeup as well as impurities all at once, so I have been using this after I remove my makeup first.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this solution is a lot better than using expensive facial soaps, scrubs, etc which either leave some kind of residue or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> You apply a light layer from the soap directly onto your wet face.</li>
            <li> so very soft and supple</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin type, so</li>
            <li> I use this soap after my first cleansing with oil and use this soap as second cleanser.</li>
            <li> i am willing to buy it again later</li>
            <li> However i don&#x27;t find anything special about it compare to other face cleanser i&#x27;ve used, besides it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li> But as I&#x27;ve aged, my skin has turned more combination, and I had problems with dry patches on my cheeks in the winter.</li>
            <li> It is very mild on skin but be careful not to open your eye with soap.</li>
            <li> My redness seems to have calmed down a bit, and my pores have significantly shrinked.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for mature skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it get anywhere near your eyes, it will hurt, a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I wash with water, this makes my skin looks uniform and soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts, so I have probably tried every product in the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to impure ingredients, which will cause my face to sting.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin softly.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin type, then I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean -- not oily; not dried out and tight, either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling it leaves, but it just feels very clean, but still moisturized.</li>
            <li> I live in Canada, and the only place they sell this soap is quebec</li>
            <li> My back is naturally so oily that I often have trouble getting it clean without scrubbing the skin.</li>
            <li> Daily use makes for clear, soft skin and rosy cheeks.</li>
            <li> Long lasting - I&#x27;m still on my first bar after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> last pretty long time too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Travel friendly (small size</li>
            <li> Skin feels tight (can&#x27;t decide if it just feels dry) and clean as far as I can see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely made a dent on it even though I use it almost every day, twice a</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and younger looking-will never use anything else.  </li>
            <li> As far as an overall face wash, it only gets 3 stars from me.</li>
            <li> Helps with skin smoothness and does not dry skin.</li>
            <li> I get these all the time for my face and they do not dry my skin, I have a sking condition and this does not effect my skin negativly at all.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> quickly washed my face with towel, but it is too late.</li>
            <li> I was in my late 30&#x27;s and have always had super oily skin.</li>
            <li> Moreover, although this soap gets rids of my extra oil it does not dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use daily and a couple of times a week let it dry completely like mask.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps with decreasing breakouts and unlike other products does not cause redness or other</li>
            <li> one last really long-</li>
            <li> I plan on keeping this as a part of my skincare regimen for the foeesable future, as long as my skin responds well.</li>
            <li> so they last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a facial soap for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is a bit drying, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with already dry skin.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This truley is a miracle soap in some regard because it provides the numerous proven benefits of an egg white mask without the mess or wasting eggs.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hands only for a couple of weeks, and found it to be extremely drying.</li>
            <li> I bought several boxes of this and kept one for myself, gave the other two to girlfriends.  </li>
            <li> It does not bother my roseca and it helps my son&#x27;s dry skin issues too.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and roscacea.</li>
            <li> Skin is not as flakey or dry.</li>
            <li> This soap works fantastically on my back by removing the extra oil &amp; hair conditioner that&#x27;s run onto my back without any heavy scrubbing or harsh exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything before for black heads and this is the only thing that has EVER WORKED.</li>
            <li> I am so exciting to use the soaps, but sadly, it does not work for me.</li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s just like any other cleanser</li>
            <li> This is not first time for using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly to love it, but hate it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you that tight feeling some soaps due after washing your face.</li>
            <li> I no longer suffer from black heads.</li>
            <li> a while I was having trouble finding the egg white/rosewater soap.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on for a few minutes for a deeper cleanse every morning.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff is another waste of money.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;exfoliates\\&quot; your skin and dead skin seems to \\&quot;peel\\&quot; off.</li>
            <li> so you want to avoid the area which could be difficult at times for me personally since I need to wash my eye makeup off.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a change in minimizing pores or decreasing breakouts, it&#x27;s just a mediocre facial soap.</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t feel the need to use moisturizer....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is because my skin is too thin?</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d lost the little box with the name :(  </li>
            <li> Had difficult time finding and substituted with Eiwit Zeep Eggwhite Soap.  </li>
            <li> I switched to when they decided that anti bacterial soap was actually bad for you.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried to give this face wash a chance and have been using it for many months.  I heard a lot of good things about it and it seemed like a simple fun classic to try.  I wanted so badly to love it, but hate it.  It burns the heck out of my skin and takes forever to wash off.  I do not recommend this product.  Only giving it one star because I can&#x27;t give it zero.  I think the company has changed ingredients, and it&#x27;s no longer what is used to be.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used..leaves my face &amp;#34;sqeaky&amp;#34; clean...</li>
            <li> This soap has a nice smell, and would be best for an oily complexion. I used it on my hands only for a couple of weeks, and found it to be extremely drying. I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I like this soap. It&#x27;s very gentle to the face, very moisturizing. However i don&#x27;t find anything special about it compare to other face cleanser i&#x27;ve used, besides it&#x27;s organic i guess. Also it STINGS my eyes so you want to avoid the area which could be difficult at times for me personally since I need to wash my eye makeup off.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! Daily use makes for clear, soft skin and rosy cheeks. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a decade now - I used to buy it at Anthropologie but so glad I can now have it shipped from Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect on my skin!</li>
            <li> I am so exciting to use the soaps, but sadly, it does not work for me. Maybe it is because my skin is too thin? I am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;but after I got the soap with the water and did the facial massage on my face, it starts to \\&quot;burn\\&quot; on my skin. Very hot and painful.&lt;br /&gt;I quickly washed my face with towel, but it is too late. So many rashes!!Now I am trying to make a treatment for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;S!A!D!I would never buy this again!</li>
            <li> I bought a tiny bar of this at a Scandinavian store in Poulsbo Wa a few years ago and loved it then. I kept meaning to find it again but I&#x27;d lost the little box with the name :(  Then a friend was surfing around &amp; remembered my mention of it and that it would likely be better for her rosacea and found it here! Joy! This is kind to my skin and cleans without damaging it. Try it - you might love it!</li>
            <li> Have used Victoria Lanolin-Agg-Tval Eggwhite Facial Care for several years.  Had difficult time finding and substituted with Eiwit Zeep Eggwhite Soap.  Glad I found Victoria again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited - for a while I was having trouble finding the egg white/rosewater soap.  And now here it is, back again!  This version is way better than the camomile scented soap which I find more drying.  Someone gave me a bar as a gift years ago and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for many years. Gentle effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> Both my girlfriend and I really love this soap. You apply a light layer from the soap directly onto your wet face. Then massage it into a nice lather. Let it set for a minute or two. Rinse. Be sure to use moisturizer afterwards (I recommend [[ASIN:B00365DABC Cerave Facial Moisturizing Lotion PM 3 oz]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Provides a deep clean&lt;br /&gt;2) Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;3) Travel friendly (small size, no TSA rules against solid soaps)&lt;br /&gt;4) Long lasting - I&#x27;m still on my first bar after a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve barely made a dent on it even though I use it almost every day, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;5) Prevents acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Leaves skin really dry.&lt;br /&gt;2) If you have any microscopic cuts from shaving, you will feel it stinging&lt;br /&gt;3) Don&#x27;t let it get anywhere near your eyes, it will hurt, a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with complexion issues (though no product beats good old fashioned sleep).</li>
            <li> This soap is so wonderful!!!!Makes your face so very soft and supple I would definately buy this again.thank you so much</li>
            <li> omg they smell pretty and they make your face feel amazing. they were given the best review from a stufy on MSN out of 325 soaps. this was the top 5.</li>
            <li> Great soap for my skin, healthy!</li>
            <li> i saw the youtube video about this and found this here.&lt;br /&gt;ive used them daily for 8 months and so far, i love the product.&lt;br /&gt;it is intended to use it as a mask ( leave it on your face for 5 mins then wash it off w water ) but i used it daily like a facial soap.&lt;br /&gt;i can tell the difference when i use this soap everyday.&lt;br /&gt;each one last really long- more than 6 months so i gave it away to my friends.&lt;br /&gt; apprently, it is very well known in asian countries and they are one of the best sellers in asian countries.&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT! you won&#x27;t regret</li>
            <li> I live in Canada, and the only place they sell this soap is quebec so I was very pleased to find out this seller ships to Toronto, ON. The package arrived safely in a matter of 2 weeks and I was happy this soap was so gentle to my sensitive skin and does a great job brightening and cleansing. I bought a second box for my mother and she enjoys it as well :) So far so good!</li>
            <li> i love this soap!! i&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my face skin feels much better.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve always have acne problems on my face but after using this soap, i havent had acne problem on my face yet.&lt;br /&gt;the soap last pretty long time too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first soap after a month of use and this soap, i would probably use the rest of my life!&lt;br /&gt;love it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is excellent but it is more than good!! my face, skin.. feels tighter after I use this soap. I will continue to use this!!</li>
            <li> I read lots of comments and this is good as I expected. I use this soap after my first cleansing with oil and use this soap as second cleanser. I make form and apply to the whole face and wait for 1-2 min. After I wash with water, this makes my skin looks uniform and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for over twenty years, and I find that if I try to use something else it just doesn&#x27;t feel right. Great stuff. You can give yourself a facial every day by just leaving it on your face before rinsing</li>
            <li> This, actually, works!! Helps with skin smoothness and does not dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it as soon as I got it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for my face as a pack, rather than as a soap.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.  So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard good ratings, so hope I&#x27;ll continue to like the product.</li>
            <li> This truley is a miracle soap in some regard because it provides the numerous proven benefits of an egg white mask without the mess or wasting eggs. Great for my acne prone skin, but use sparingly as one or two applications a week will produce results without drying. One bar lasts for over a month so this box of six will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap on a whim and am so glad to I did. Within a week I could tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts, so I have probably tried every product in the market. As far as an overall face wash, it only gets 3 stars from me. As a daily makeup wearer, I need a soap that is a little more versatile (can remove makeup as well as impurities all at once, so I have been using this after I remove my makeup first. I&#x27;ve only used one bar so far, and it has been okay, nothing note worthy. Skin feels tight (can&#x27;t decide if it just feels dry) and clean as far as I can see. I have not noticed a change in minimizing pores or decreasing breakouts, it&#x27;s just a mediocre facial soap. Perhaps I need to give it more time, but all of the rave reviews I have read before purchasing have not become a reality for me.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It cleans my face without drying my skin. Second time I have ordered it, and will buy again. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Of all the products I&#x27;ve ever used to cleanse my face, this is by far my favorite. I&#x27;m sensitive to impure ingredients, which will cause my face to sting. This soap is mild and great for sensitive skin, yet completely cleansing - unlike some products which leave my face feeling oily. It has a wonderful mild scent and lathers to a very nice foam when you rub your hands together after getting the soap on them. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. One thing I enjoy about this box size is that I will often give a bar to a friend to try when it comes up in conversation - they always love it too.</li>
            <li> I like it. Rather, I like that my wife LOVES it. She uses nightly and has said it has done wonders for her skin. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right. I guess I expected a lot more out of it. To me it&#x27;s just like any other cleanser and there&#x27;s really nothing special about it. Sadness. I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My skin has changed for the best with this soap-lather, apply, wait 5 minutes to form a mask and then wash. I&#x27;ve tried everything before for black heads and this is the only thing that has EVER WORKED. Makes my skin soft and younger looking-will never use anything else.  I no longer suffer from black heads.</li>
            <li> I used it for 4years. It&#x27;s my necessary thing. It makes my skin softly. I can&#x27;t stop using it even one day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 2 years, and I love it! After reading a review in Allure I took a chance and ordered the 6 pack. I was in my late 30&#x27;s and have always had super oily skin. But as I&#x27;ve aged, my skin has turned more combination, and I had problems with dry patches on my cheeks in the winter. This soap is awesome! It cleans very effectively, but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling it leaves, but it just feels very clean, but still moisturized. I&#x27;ve never used anything that&#x27;s given me the same effect. In the summer I use it in the am and pm, but in the winter I usually just use in the am, and I use Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery in the pm, and that keeps my skin in line and beautiful. I use it as a cleanser and mask several times a week in warm weather.  I plan on keeping this as a part of my skincare regimen for the foeesable future, as long as my skin responds well.</li>
            <li> Go get it. So good. My face is a lot cleaner now. You can use this as soap or leave it on as a five-minute mask, either way is great. I have sensitive skin and this solution is a lot better than using expensive facial soaps, scrubs, etc which either leave some kind of residue or irritate my skin. Each soap bar is also quite dense, so it takes quite a while to use up one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that there are several listings of swedish eggwhite exfoliating, pore-shrinking, blackhead-removing, etc soaps on amazon. Combined with shipping, those soaps cost $9 each. Just get this a box of 6, it&#x27;ll end up being cheaper. I saw on the Victoria Sweden website and there is only one type of Lanolin-Agg-Tval formula. The soaps on those listings are exactly the same as these ones, they just have a more attractive name that may convince some to buy those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you end up not liking this soap, you can give the rest away as gifts. It&#x27;s very likely that that person will greatly appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for over 7 years. I bought it a few times up in a good Drug store in Saratoga NY and now they dont sell it. I found it on Amazon and am so happy to continue to have my favorite soap for my great complection.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers into a nice &amp; creamy soap.  Leaves my skin feeling moisturized and I usually don&#x27;t feel the need to use moisturizer....however I do.</li>
            <li> Great lather.  But doesn&#x27;t smell like eggs at all.  Actually kind of like playdoh.  I switched to when they decided that anti bacterial soap was actually bad for you.  Plus it&#x27;s Swedish so it makes me feel fancy and international.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the way it makes my skin feel and have used it for years and years. The bars of soap are dense so they last a really long time. It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I will use on my face from here on out.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gave some away as gifts!</li>
            <li> I have used this product since 2010. I have very sensitive skin type, so I don&#x27;t like foam type for cleansing make up. If you have sensitive skin type, then I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial soap. Dries up pimples and leaves skin feeling smooth. Does a good job of taking off make-up. Love the scent, and of course, the cute packaging. Would make a nice gift, but I always keep it for myself.</li>
            <li> This product really helps with decreasing breakouts and unlike other products does not cause redness or other sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend this soap to anyone with skin sensitivities who wants to control breakouts.</li>
            <li> more moisture but not so oily and feel nice for the whole day but I just use only 1 let see more result.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use this on  my face, instead I used this on my body.  I like the very mild smell, &amp; made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> My favorite luxury beauty product! I use it mostly as a mask by sudsing it on my face, letting it dry, then steaming it off with a warm washcloth followed by rinsing my face. Leave skin glowing, taut and smooth!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, makes a good lather, pretty long lasting, but a bit drying for my skin. The box is really adorable though.</li>
            <li> I bought several boxes of this and kept one for myself, gave the other two to girlfriends.  It&#x27;s unanimous; this soap is great.  Cleanses without stripping your skin, tightens, brightens.  Will definitely keep using this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is. I won&#x27;t be reordering because my skin didn&#x27;t feel any different. Good nutrition, exercise, and quality sleep will do more for your skin than this, imho.</li>
            <li> THis is a good soap for sensitive skin. It does not bother my roseca and it helps my son&#x27;s dry skin issues too.</li>
            <li> The foam it makes it&#x27;s amazing  (: i use it for my face n all over my body when im taking shower but wasn&#x27;t expecting any scent but it&#x27;s bit strong for me. Overall it&#x27;s a good soap (;</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and roscacea. I&#x27;ve been looking for a facial soap for quite a long time. I read the reviews on this soap and everyone seemed to give it a thumbs up. So I ordered a box. I have been using it for about two weeks now and definitely notice a difference. Skin is not as flakey or dry. Doesn&#x27;t give you that tight feeling some soaps due after washing your face. It feels clean and moisturized. I still use a moisturizer but this soap has definitely helped with the dryness and the reddness that I have on my face. This soap is definitely a keeper. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very mild soap for my wrinkled old face. Wonderful! Have two bars left and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I have been using it day and night for a couple of weeks now and it has helped clear my skin so much. Also, my pores are smaller! I&#x27;m very pleased with this and will continue to use it daily!</li>
            <li> I bought a box of six in a boutique since it was the cheapest soap offered in the boutique &amp; the boutique owner said this brand makes the personal care products for the royal Swedish court. I liked the idea of cleaning with an egg white product so I purchased a box. How fortunate I am to have happened across this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar works on my whole body; it provides a smooth surface on my legs for shaving &amp; cleans my extra-sensitive private areas with no irritation at all. The smell is fresh, clean, &amp; perfect for all genders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have severe oily skin; I don&#x27;t get many pimples, but I require frequent powder applications &amp; I simply dislike the feeling of overly-oily skin. This soap has worked wonders for reducing my oiliness. My back is naturally so oily that I often have trouble getting it clean without scrubbing the skin. This soap works fantastically on my back by removing the extra oil &amp; hair conditioner that&#x27;s run onto my back without any heavy scrubbing or harsh exfoliation. Moreover, although this soap gets rids of my extra oil it does not dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently on my fourth bar out of six. I&#x27;m glad to have found the product here on Amazon, also at a lower price than I paid at the boutique. I will certainly be sticking with this product &amp; ordering another box soon.</li>
            <li> Based on Vogue editors&#x27; top picks, I purchased this and a Konjac sponge  and the combo is awesome!  Works beautifully!</li>
            <li> This soap is very gentle and lathers nicely - very soft skin afterwards.  It worked great to remove sunscreen and leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> This is not first time for using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that it will be more cheaper than it is. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Creamy.  Lathers well.  Leaves skin feeling clean -- not oily; not dried out and tight, either.  Just perfection.  Using it as facial and body bar.  THE perfect soap.  Beautiful box if you want to give it as a gift to a girlfriend.  She will love you for it.</li>
            <li> great product and great price</li>
            <li> I get these all the time for my face and they do not dry my skin, I have a sking condition and this does not effect my skin negativly at all.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my face after using this soap.  It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful product.  It was packaged nicely.  The soap lathers well and has a pleasant scent.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have been using this soap for years, gentle, good cleansing , and used with a clarisonic, we all look great!</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser for oily skin. Not too drying. Gentle enough for mature skin.  Pores disappear and lines areally softened. I leave it on for a few minutes for a deeper cleanse every morning.  Had definitely improved my skin tone and clarity.</li>
            <li> I read such good reviews about it and bought it as a pack of six. I am almost done with my first one. I have used it 3-4 times a week. I have oily skin and wanted to shrink my pores. But this stuff is another waste of money. I wish it works for me like others do.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for my skin type (early 40s, oily, congested, touch of rosacea) caused more blackheads rather than cleared them up. Quality soap, nonetheless. Smells great, lathers well--will use for shaving &amp; bathing.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Lanolin-Agg-Tval Swedish Eggwhite Soap for 5 days now and I have noticed a difference in my skin.  I have combination skin (the dreaded T-zone) and my skin has improved in softness and smoothness.  My blemishes have disappeared and my skin is radiant.  I follow up with using an oil-free moisturizer to combat any potential dryness since the soap has astringent qualities. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i can see my skin tones brighter after using this soap. i am willing to buy it again later</li>
            <li> This soap is the BOMB. I have combination oily skin, and have the occasional pimple along with rosacea. I also have large pores and blackheads. This soap is a miracle- it somehow \\&quot;exfoliates\\&quot; your skin and dead skin seems to \\&quot;peel\\&quot; off. My redness seems to have calmed down a bit, and my pores have significantly shrinked. Also, I rarely get pimples or blackheads because this stuff keeps my skin super clear and soft. Each bar lasts about a month for me, so it&#x27;s pretty cheap. The only downside is that it is a bit drying, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with already dry skin. But if you have acne-prone or sensitive skin, this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I am 67 and my skin looks wonderful due to using this soap for a number of years.  I first found it in Europe and was happy to find it on amazon.  I gave a gift of this soap to my sister in law ( who has very dry skin) and she was thrilled with the result.  Use daily and a couple of times a week let it dry completely like mask.  Cannot say enough good about this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Barbara&lt;br /&gt;Birmingham, al</li>
            <li> I like it. My skin become softer. It is very mild on skin but be careful not to open your eye with soap.</li>
