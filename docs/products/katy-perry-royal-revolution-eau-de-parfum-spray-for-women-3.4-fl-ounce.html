            <li>, I Love It.</li>
            <li>It smells like the cheap body mists you would get at Bath and Body Works or Victoria Secrets</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon :-)</li>
            <li>Smells great, if only it was designed to stand straight up.</li>
            <li>Like most reviews say it&#x27;s a little bit lighter in smell and more floral/fruity, which I love.</li>

            <li>personally I don&#x27;t like this kind of scent</li>

            <li>lol it was SUPPER big bottle that i wasnt expected to be that big</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the original Killer Queen fragrance but was happy to see she would come out with different versions of the original.</li>
            <li>Wow fast shipping and delivery!</li>
            <li>I usually wear warmer, woodsy fragrances with a little more spice, but I love Royal Revolution.</li>
            <li>, I ordered it because of the reviews and I&#x27;m testing new scents.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little sweet but not too much.</li>
            <li>Typically, most perfumes, I only spray it a couple times and it lasts for half the day.</li>

            <li> I love Royal Revolution.The Perfume smells amazing.I love Katy Perry Katy cat for life</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! My fiance even noticed it was different and complimented me on it. I wish I could explain this scent better but it&#x27;s a little sweet but not too much. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s n feel it&#x27;s sophisticated enough to wear to work. Can definitely hit a wide age range. Not cotton candy little girl scent.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Wish it had a stand to keep it upright.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my GF based off the reviews smell was great BUT IT WORE OFF REALLY FAST i was woried about it that maybe i was sold a fake on I WILL BUY ANOTHER 1 AT THE MALL</li>
            <li> Smells great, if only it was designed to stand straight up.</li>
            <li> Wow fast shipping and delivery! (It came in like 3 days!) personally I don&#x27;t like this kind of scent, I ordered it because of the reviews and I&#x27;m testing new scents. It smells like the cheap body mists you would get at Bath and Body Works or Victoria Secrets</li>
            <li> my sister love this gifts, smells grat</li>
            <li> Love it! lol it was SUPPER big bottle that i wasnt expected to be that big</li>
            <li> Got all the way to New Zealand - packaged perfectly.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how big it is, daughter loves it.  Smells nice.  Thanks Amazon :-)</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Katy Perry and was excited to see that she would have new fragrances come out. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the original Killer Queen fragrance but was happy to see she would come out with different versions of the original. I finally managed to get my hands on the scent and it smells so much better than Killer Queen. Like most reviews say it&#x27;s a little bit lighter in smell and more floral/fruity, which I love. Not only that but the bottle and packaging it came in is extremely adorable and the color of the bottle is very pretty deep blue. However, the only thing that will probably prevent me from replenishing this scent in the future is that it does not last. Typically, most perfumes, I only spray it a couple times and it lasts for half the day. With the Royal Revolution, though, I spray about 10x as much as that and within an hour or so I cannot smell it. I even spray some on my wrists (which is my most sensitive area) and not even then could I smell something. I will probably keep the bottle once I am done with this fragrance but I would not recommend spending the amount of money on a perfume that needs to be reapplied every hour. Wish I could like it more!</li>
            <li> It was much fruitier than I expected, and more youthful than the original Killer Queen(which I also love). I usually wear warmer, woodsy fragrances with a little more spice, but I love Royal Revolution. &amp; have no idea if this has to do with the perfume or not but since I started wearing it men have been giving me a lot of attention.</li>
            <li> It is different, I like it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as good as the sample from the magazine, but was a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> G/F Loves it, smells very nice.</li>
            <li> This Smells So Good, I Love It. I Think It Smells Better Than The Other Two üëç</li>
            <li> Loved it! Arrived very quickly and smells amazing :-D</li>
