            <li>Wonderful product for wrinkles around eye area.  </li>
            <li>As an anti-aging eye cream, Replenix is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The texture is awesome, creamy but not greasy, the area under your eyes feels lifted as soon as you apply it.</li>
            <li>What a wonderful gift.</li>
            <li>I am an eye cream junkie - always searching for the best.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is the best eye cream there is.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for that perfect eye cream for almost 10 years now</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Very good</li>
            <li>I would be so happy if this could be the stuff that works longer than 9 months.</li>
            <li>This is a great eye cream.  </li>
            <li>After reading a lot of great reviews I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>I know there are some really good ones out there, but there are some that aren&#x27;t so good.  </li>
            <li>and I heard some good stuff about it</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and this one lasts the longest and works incredible.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It makes my eyes look so good with no wrinkles</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>but no complaints its great on my fine lines and its great under makeup.</li>
            <li>Happy with this purchase &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got a placebo bottle or if all of these amazing ratings are bought, but this product did absoulutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>but I think it just did not work for me but to be honest</li>
            <li>but puffiness is kind of still there.</li>
            <li>hope I am honest with this review .</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and this one, for my age (63) and my problems, seems to be the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>First two pumps were great.  </li>
            <li>Great results for my eyes, diminishing fine lines and dark circles in just 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Replenix is the best eye cream I have ever had!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking more like I feel</li>
            <li>Over the counter products work just as well or better for me.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>so I thought id love this too.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Seriously?!!Seeing wonderful results after only 2 nights.  </li>
            <li>I hope it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>many days almost none.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked on my friend better on her puffyness.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>I has made my eyes look better.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>and I love everything about it.  </li>
            <li>My skin has always been pretty good, without too many wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve always used daytime moisturizer, night cream and eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have a product where the results are quickly visible.</li>
            <li>It smells nice (and I&#x27;m really picky about that) and it feels nice going on.</li>
            <li>very good product I have used it for several years</li>
            <li>Goes on easily</li>
            <li>It works like a charm and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had read on another site that this Eye Repair Cream was the best for eye puffiness hands down.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>Replenix is the BEST solution for under eye dark circles!  </li>
            <li>Received this as a free sample in a product I ordered on line.</li>
            <li>it is fragrance free, non-irritating</li>
            <li>I will never use another eye cream, this product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I think it is important to buy from an authorized dealer.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Due to great reviews at many websites, I decided to try this eye treatment</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product at a plastic surgeons office and really liked the product as I didn&#x27;t elect to have any work done, when the product was empty</li>
            <li>This is a rich eye cream that I have been using morning and night for years.</li>
            <li>This is by far my most favorite eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth but dries quickly so makeup doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li>and I think  the  it makes in the fine lines around my eyes are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Didn;t get much last night and my eyes looked bright.</li>
            <li>I ordered the full size (elsewhere),</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s the perfect consistency, not too thick,</li>
            <li>Just ok really.</li>
            <li>Shipping came like a day early and it&#x27;s packaged nicely</li>
            <li>will say that the other two pumps were great.</li>
            <li>It works quickly, with no side effects.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used other products  and so far this is the best.</li>
            <li>and it absorbs nicely so my powder foundation brushed on without having cakey look around eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth the price and lasts months .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to see it on amazon and for less Than I originally paid.</li>
            <li>This product is great for dry, aging, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Also I don&#x27;t think it is good for dark circle</li>
            <li>This is packaged PERFECTLY but the product is a bit thick!!</li>
            <li>after couple of days applying in morning and at night the crepe&#x27; appearance under my eyes was gone and after 6wks the lines around my eyes was so greatly improved that even when looking closely in mirror I could hardly see them.  </li>
            <li>After trying many products with the same promise this product does deliver --</li>
            <li>, I got it from Amazon, where it was a better value for the same size product.  </li>
            <li>maybe if I undo the above I would get a satisfying results .</li>
            <li>Fast shippingüëç!</li>
            <li>I have used this cream in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much per application</li>
            <li>Really seems to help appearance under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really feel it works and bought one for my daughter as well.</li>
            <li>This works very well at reducing darkened circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I loved the sample because the cream was so thick.</li>
            <li>I originally received a sample of this in a kit of various products.  </li>
            <li>I am a 54 yr old two time double eye lift gal who was bothered by crepe&#x27;, puffy eye lids and fine lines around my whole eye area.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything magical, however the dark circles became a bit lighter after using over a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eye cream and will use it forever&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It took almost 2 weeks to see really noticeable results, but my deep lines are more shallow, the fine lines and cross-hatching are faded.</li>
            <li>Was excited to try this product, and willing to shell out the extra $ for something that had such glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice, is thick and moisturing but soaks in.  </li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive eyes and skin and had no problem), firming, and wrinkle smoothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them, both cheap and expensive, and I usually am looking for the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have tried that actually works!</li>
            <li>This also wasn&#x27;t shipped by amazon when it clearly stated that&#x27;s who sold and shipped it,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 36 years old</li>
            <li>So far, this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>Works well on 40 year old plus skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use on regular basis, because of the price plus only really need it during allergy flare-ups.</li>
            <li>It also does not work well in conjunction with under eye concealer or makeup as it does not completely dry for a very long time and causes makeup/concealer to smudge or stick to certain areas where product was applied.</li>
            <li>My laugh lines are just starting to get a bit deeper and this is really helping my eye area look smoother and me a few years younger.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a little pricey, it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>In general, this eye cream has a lot of positives:  </li>
            <li>I had dark circles since I was a child, but this is the first time I use something for them</li>
            <li>Cream is thick and goes on smoothly, absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>little right</li>
            <li>I think my eyes are the most aged looking area on my face, due to lifelong allergies, freq.</li>
            <li>I gave it only 3 stars because I had high hopes that the green tea and vitamin K would eliminate or significantly reduce my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>The actual non-sample packaging was frustrating because I am sure I threw away eye cream when it was all said and done.</li>
            <li>It claims to help with dark circles as well, which I don&#x27;t really have.</li>
            <li>and when I pushed the pump, instead of getting nothing for the first few pumps I got a crusty squirt of lotion.</li>

            <li> and when I pushed the pump, instead of getting nothing for the first few pumps I got a crusty squirt of lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is thick, goes right in and does not cause my shadow to crease even after 12 hrs of wear.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to use less concealer, therefore worry less about it about clumping thickly into my lines.</li>
            <li> A little bit really does go a long way with this product</li>
            <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t use it long enough because of the puffiness.</li>
            <li> This made my eyes a little puffy, but eyes are very sensitive to eye creams.  </li>
            <li> I noticed from the first day that the consistency/formula was not the same of the other two pumps I had purchased in the past (both on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> Made my eyes dry and red and saw no noticeable effects.</li>
            <li> Keep going back to it after trying other products in the same price point.</li>
            <li> so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed a decrease in eye &amp;#34;crinkles&amp;#34; but one truly cannot turn back time.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles appear less visible when I use the product, which is evident when I have run out in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped my eye area with moisture and fine lines especially during these cold winter months.</li>
            <li> I went back to look at my other purchases</li>
            <li> So, immediately after the that, I started having the darkness under the eye area that I&#x27;d never had before (not sure if it was due to no hormones, or no sleep due to no hormones and hot flashes!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used during allergy season when eyes are especially puffy/itchy due to pollen.  </li>
            <li> After finishing the entire container, my dark circles are still there.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes, especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it definitely reduces the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the bottle lasts several months</li>
            <li> what I&#x27;ve noticed in the last year and a half, since I&#x27;ve been using Replenix Eye Repair is:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> After using for a while I started to get the white little bumps under my eye.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how you could truly empty the container.</li>
            <li> My deep purplish circles look lighter, possibly due to a little tightening effect.</li>
            <li> This cream lasts a very long time due to a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Used for past month, now noting white bumps and no real diminishing of puffy eyes or circles.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like the other products.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I order this product in the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that this was the other two were purchased from other stores on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about 6-9 months, I seem to stop responding to any skin care treatments that worked well for me at first.  </li>
            <li> I have no more crows feet than I had 2 years ago, actually I think less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cause irritating for my eyes , dark red skin around my eyes and burn in my upper and lower lid</li>
            <li> The product did not irritate my eyes, but other than moisturizing the eye area it did nothing to reduce under eye swelling or dark circles.</li>
            <li> Usually lasts me a little over six months--applying twice daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with hopes of minimizing my undereye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles around eyes or puffiness</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t see it making a difference when it comes to the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I was told that it would take away the dark circles</li>
            <li> Well this product emphasize on dark lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li> but this product made some dark visibility under my eyes..</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> Helps with dark circles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> Less noticeable under-eye circles,</li>
            <li> I think the product is working and will continue to use it even though it is a little expenensive.</li>
            <li> You use so little</li>
            <li> It also had very little effect on my wrinkles or dark circles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the cream wasn&#x27;t sealed, I&#x27;m not comfortable using it and will throw it away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to remember to update this review in a few months.</li>
            <li> i always get grease particles at my eyes area when i used the eye cream which are too heavy, but this one is not greasy, i can use it with no worry, results still need to wait.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have to begin the frustrating routine of trying out different products in hopes of improvement again, but I hit quite a few duds for a while.</li>
            <li> Got the same effect from less expensive products.</li>
            <li> I am 60 and every little wrinkle matters!</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> It is now too late to return this product.  </li>
            <li> This product maybe a little expensive</li>
            <li> not too thin, not too greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every product that claims to lighten dark circles and was disappointed in all of them until it found Replenix.</li>
            <li> Another complaint is that the packaging makes it impossible to tell when the product is about to run out.</li>
            <li> but I was not impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> I use very expensive skin care and this product surpasses any eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t feel too bad about the price.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this for several years now &amp; like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn.  It also minimizes any wrinkles around my eyes &amp; I&#x27;m 67.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends this eye cream.  No miracles but it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else? recommended from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for wrinkles around eye area.  I received a sample of the product with another purchase and tried it and decided I MUST have this product.  After trying many products with the same promise this product does deliver --</li>
            <li> I have used this cream in the past and loved it. However when my package arrived today the cream didn&#x27;t have a seal on it and when I pushed the pump, instead of getting nothing for the first few pumps I got a crusty squirt of lotion. This also wasn&#x27;t shipped by amazon when it clearly stated that&#x27;s who sold and shipped it,&lt;br /&gt;Since the cream wasn&#x27;t sealed, I&#x27;m not comfortable using it and will throw it away.</li>
            <li> I bought this four months ago and still have not run out. I use it every night. I am 36 years old and I didn&#x27;t have deep lines but I want to keep it that way.  I think the product is working and will continue to use it even though it is a little expenensive.</li>
            <li> Received this as a free sample in a product I ordered on line. I am a 54 yr old two time double eye lift gal who was bothered by crepe&#x27;, puffy eye lids and fine lines around my whole eye area. This product is thick, goes right in and does not cause my shadow to crease even after 12 hrs of wear. I no longer have puffy, crepe&#x27; eyes. It worked immediately. I&#x27;m using it day and night. It claims to help with dark circles as well, which I don&#x27;t really have. I could not be happier. I use very expensive skin care and this product surpasses any eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m looking more like I feel and that&#x27;s 24.</li>
            <li> no noticeable improvement</li>
            <li> I bought this product with hopes of minimizing my undereye dark circles. I have the type of circles caused by blue veins showing through the skin, not from bags and puffiness.  In general, this eye cream has a lot of positives:  it is fragrance free, non-irritating (I have very sensitive eyes and skin and had no problem), firming, and wrinkle smoothing. I gave it only 3 stars because I had high hopes that the green tea and vitamin K would eliminate or significantly reduce my dark circles.  After finishing the entire container, my dark circles are still there. Another complaint is that the packaging makes it impossible to tell when the product is about to run out. As an anti-aging eye cream, Replenix is wonderful.  Just don&#x27;t expect it to reduce the appearance of veins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cause irritating for my eyes , dark red skin around my eyes and burn in my upper and lower lid</li>
            <li> after couple of days applying in morning and at night the crepe&#x27; appearance under my eyes was gone and after 6wks the lines around my eyes was so greatly improved that even when looking closely in mirror I could hardly see them.  I will never use another eye cream, this product is fabulous.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles around eyes or puffiness so can&#x27;t say how it works on them. This cream lasts a very long time due to a little goes a long way and it absorbs nicely so my powder foundation brushed on without having cakey look around eyes.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working--I&#x27;ve only had the product for a month but it seems to be making some difference. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update this review in a few months. I use this in combination with several Obagi products and the two seem to combine well.</li>
            <li> Gloriously moisturizing, this has been my go-to eye cream for three years!</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this eye cream before purchasing it. I loved the sample because the cream was so thick. The actual non-sample packaging was frustrating because I am sure I threw away eye cream when it was all said and done. I don&#x27;t know how you could truly empty the container. I also noticed no differences from using the eye cream so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. Over the counter products work just as well or better for me.</li>
            <li> i always get grease particles at my eyes area when i used the eye cream which are too heavy, but this one is not greasy, i can use it with no worry, results still need to wait. i used it for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This is packaged PERFECTLY but the product is a bit thick!!</li>
            <li> I have the replenix  3x smoothing serum and I love it so I thought id love this too. Wrong! I used for 2 weeks and then threw it out. Made my eyes dry and red and saw no noticeable effects. Waste of money and time don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> After 3 month of use i see low resulte</li>
            <li> Great results for my eyes, diminishing fine lines and dark circles in just 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Replenix is the best eye cream I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Replenix is the BEST solution for under eye dark circles!  I&#x27;ve tried just about every product that claims to lighten dark circles and was disappointed in all of them until it found Replenix.</li>
            <li> Was hoping to solve puffiness and circles. Used for past month, now noting white bumps and no real diminishing of puffy eyes or circles.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite eye cream.  It doesn&#x27;t take much per application so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it. It makes the skin around my eyes look firmer. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like the other products.</li>
            <li> This is a rich eye cream that I have been using morning and night for years. I am 60 and every little wrinkle matters!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes, especially in the morning. I received a sample of Replenix eye repair cream along with another product that I ordered. I tried it and it definitely reduces the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. This is the first product I have tried that actually works!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I order this product in the past 3 years.  First two pumps were great.  I noticed from the first day that the consistency/formula was not the same of the other two pumps I had purchased in the past (both on Amazon).  After using for a while I started to get the white little bumps under my eye.  It is now too late to return this product.  I think it is important to buy from an authorized dealer.  I went back to look at my other purchases and I noticed that this was the other two were purchased from other stores on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the other two pumps were great.</li>
            <li> I love it! I only use it at night because I use an eye cream with spf during the day but no complaints its great on my fine lines and its great under makeup.</li>
            <li> i used for a month , no diffrent</li>
            <li> Wasted my money. Got the same effect from less expensive products.</li>
            <li> it has been a staple in my cosmetic cabinet for several years and I like it alot</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about 6-9 months, I seem to stop responding to any skin care treatments that worked well for me at first.  I have to begin the frustrating routine of trying out different products in hopes of improvement again, but I hit quite a few duds for a while. Due to great reviews at many websites, I decided to try this eye treatment and it&#x27;s a winner! I think my eyes are the most aged looking area on my face, due to lifelong allergies, freq. eye rubbing, sunbathing, neglecting sunglasses and screens, etc. It took almost 2 weeks to see really noticeable results, but my deep lines are more shallow, the fine lines and cross-hatching are faded. My deep purplish circles look lighter, possibly due to a little tightening effect. Anyway... it&#x27;s nice to use less concealer, therefore worry less about it about clumping thickly into my lines. I would be so happy if this could be the stuff that works longer than 9 months.</li>
            <li> Was excited to try this product, and willing to shell out the extra $ for something that had such glowing reviews.  Pro&#x27;s: Cream is thick and goes on smoothly, absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: did not reduce my eye puffiness one bit.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a placebo bottle or if all of these amazing ratings are bought, but this product did absoulutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Seriously?!!Seeing wonderful results after only 2 nights.  The texture is awesome, creamy but not greasy, the area under your eyes feels lifted as soon as you apply it. Didn;t get much last night and my eyes looked bright. Happy with this purchase &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Really seems to help appearance under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I received this as lagniappe with a Vivite order. What a wonderful gift. I have now ordered it. After two days it has tightened and smoothed crepey areas on my lids. Nice to have a product where the results are quickly visible. I hope it just keeps getting better. Nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for quiet a while.It works.I&#x27;d used other products  and so far this is the best.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream.  I know there are some really good ones out there, but there are some that aren&#x27;t so good.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them, both cheap and expensive, and I usually am looking for the next best thing.  I originally received a sample of this in a kit of various products.  I ordered the full size (elsewhere), then the 2nd time I ordered it, I got it from Amazon, where it was a better value for the same size product.  My skin has always been pretty good, without too many wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve always used daytime moisturizer, night cream and eye cream.  I&#x27;m 48 currently, and had a hysterectomy 2 years ago and have had no hormone replacements since then.  So, immediately after the that, I started having the darkness under the eye area that I&#x27;d never had before (not sure if it was due to no hormones, or no sleep due to no hormones and hot flashes!).&lt;br /&gt;But what I&#x27;ve noticed in the last year and a half, since I&#x27;ve been using Replenix Eye Repair is:&lt;br /&gt;- Softer lines around the eyes - I have no more crows feet than I had 2 years ago, actually I think less.&lt;br /&gt;- Less noticeable under-eye circles, many days almost none.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t burn eyes.&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on easily - it&#x27;s the perfect consistency, not too thick, not too thin, not too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way, and the bottle lasts several months (I only use it at night).&lt;br /&gt;- Smooths and evens out the eyelid area as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it and I will re-order it again.</li>
            <li> very good product I have used it for several years</li>
            <li> I am an eye cream junkie - always searching for the best.  So far, this is one of my favorites.  Feels nice, is thick and moisturing but soaks in.  I gave it 4 stars only because I think there is always room for improvement!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything magical, however the dark circles became a bit lighter after using over a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... I had dark circles since I was a child, but this is the first time I use something for them</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and doing quite a bit of research, I finally ordered this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and just don&#x27;t see any difference in my eyes. It smells nice (and I&#x27;m really picky about that) and it feels nice going on. I have very sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems with regards to that, but I just don&#x27;t see it making a difference when it comes to the dark circles.</li>
            <li> This made my eyes a little puffy, but eyes are very sensitive to eye creams.  It also had very little effect on my wrinkles or dark circles.  Maybe I just didn&#x27;t use it long enough because of the puffiness.</li>
            <li> Just ok really. I was told that it would take away the dark circles but it doesn&#x27;t. It worked on my friend better on her puffyness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and I heard some good stuff about it but I think it just did not work for me but to be honest let me just say that I&lt;br /&gt;1- Drink alot of caffeine&lt;br /&gt;2- Sleep late&lt;br /&gt;3- A toddler and newborn! :/&lt;br /&gt;4- don&#x27;t drink enough WATER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe if I undo the above I would get a satisfying results .</li>
            <li> Love it!  Keep going back to it after trying other products in the same price point. You use so little it lasts a long time and I think  the  it makes in the fine lines around my eyes are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist for a recommendation for an eye cream and this is what she suggested. I am so pleased. Goes on smooth but dries quickly so makeup doesn&#x27;t run. Erases lines and brightens under eye area.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is the best eye cream there is. I have tried many eye creams and this one lasts the longest and works incredible. I highly recommend this eye cream and will use it forever&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the price and lasts months .&lt;br /&gt;I also put in on my lips when I sleep&lt;br /&gt;It makes my eyes look so good with no wrinkles</li>
            <li> Fast shippingüëç! Item as described‚≠êÔ∏è.</li>
            <li> Well this product emphasize on dark lines and puffiness. I have problem with puffiness and ha lowness in the sides. I would say it did diminish some side lines but puffiness is kind of still there. Also I don&#x27;t think it is good for dark circle cause I don&#x27;t have but this product made some dark visibility under my eyes.. So I don&#x27;t know how to rate this but I do feel the skin little right and it&#x27;s been a month that I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I am honest with this review .</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and this one, for my age (63) and my problems, seems to be the best I have tried so far. I needed moisture, not a drying product. I has made my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product at a plastic surgeons office and really liked the product as I didn&#x27;t elect to have any work done, when the product was empty I was very pleased to see it on amazon and for less Than I originally paid. I really feel it works and bought one for my daughter as well.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. I have been searching for that perfect eye cream for almost 10 years now and I think I have found it. It goes on smooth and is not greasy at all. My laugh lines are just starting to get a bit deeper and this is really helping my eye area look smoother and me a few years younger. A little bit really does go a long way with this product so you don&#x27;t feel too bad about the price.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of great reviews I decided to try this product. The product did not irritate my eyes, but other than moisturizing the eye area it did nothing to reduce under eye swelling or dark circles. It also does not work well in conjunction with under eye concealer or makeup as it does not completely dry for a very long time and causes makeup/concealer to smudge or stick to certain areas where product was applied. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for over a year now and I love everything about it.  Even though it is a little pricey, it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> This works very well at reducing darkened circles under the eyes. I have not really noticed a decrease in eye &amp;#34;crinkles&amp;#34; but one truly cannot turn back time.  A small amount goes a long way so my advice is use a tiny bit. Usually lasts me a little over six months--applying twice daily.</li>
            <li> Very good and I see the result in 2weeks and I will order it again</li>
            <li> I had read on another site that this Eye Repair Cream was the best for eye puffiness hands down.  It did not work for me.  Shipping came like a day early and it&#x27;s packaged nicely but I was not impressed with the product.  I&#x27;ll keep my Obaji.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s helped my eye area with moisture and fine lines especially during these cold winter months.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry, aging, sensitive skin.  My wrinkles appear less visible when I use the product, which is evident when I have run out in the past.</li>
            <li> Thank you.. I will order again</li>
            <li> Works well on 40 year old plus skin around the eyes. Helps with dark circles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I&#x27;ve used during allergy season when eyes are especially puffy/itchy due to pollen.  It works quickly, with no side effects.  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.  I don&#x27;t use on regular basis, because of the price plus only really need it during allergy flare-ups.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased the Replenix Eye Repair Cream.  I use this cream every night and I am very happy with the results.  The Replenix is not greasy and I notice that the area around my eyes seems firmer and brighter.  I did go for a while without using Replenix and I noticed the improvement about a week after I restarted it..</li>
            <li> This product maybe a little expensive but it&#x27;s like they say &amp;#34;you pay for what you get&amp;#34;. It works like a charm and is easy to use.</li>
