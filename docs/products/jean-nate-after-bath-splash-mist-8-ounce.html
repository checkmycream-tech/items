            <li>The price is good, even if you want to give it a try</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good Product-Works well.</li>
            <li>Good protection when you get the hang of how to use the dispenser.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, convenient and pleasant to use, relatively free of irritants, and effective.</li>
            <li>It was kind of slimy, and I threw it away immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for an unscented antiperspirant that works effectively.</li>
            <li>Loved the ease of purchase and quick delivery too!</li>
            <li>which is the best i have found so far..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best option for really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is the best  for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, very effective.</li>
            <li>It SOUNDS to good to be true, but it sure happened.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>I love Almay products and this one</li>
            <li>However this isn&#x27;t that much better on odor.  </li>
            <li>I was sweating more than I ever had since I started wearing antipersperiant because the product didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li>Most deodorants, including Almay&#x27;s, seem to contain aluminum.</li>
            <li>After applying while wearing a tank top, I went to work.</li>
            <li>I love the Almay products.</li>
            <li>So after awhile went to purchase some more, but could not find it.</li>
            <li>Most Wal-Marts and Walgreens stores carry it, or you can get it online.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than the deodorant sticks</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and have sworn by it for years now.  </li>
            <li>This was my favorite but</li>
            <li>and this product works very well with the smell thing not as great in the area of sweating</li>
            <li>For those whose difficulties come from scent or the alcohol most roll-ons use, this may be just what you need.</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I buy a do en at a time and will surely order it again.</li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t have to switch brands.</li>
            <li>The better deodorant for women in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance free anti-persperant, goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try another deo after this, but this one will be my go-to, because it is pretty good, regardless.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to chemicals and this works great, no fragrance, no clammy armpits.</li>
            <li>I have been using this wonderful product for years for sensitive skin and when I couldn&#x27;t find it at my usual retailer, I searched Amazon and found a great deal!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>it is ok, is better if you buy in a super market.</li>
            <li>Nice, but it&#x27;s easy to dispense more than you need, and I got an irritation when I applied too much.  </li>
            <li>I found with alarm, reading the book &amp;#34;death by rubber duck&amp;#34; that most perfumes used in any products are actually pretty toxic and stay in the body for a while and disrupt the endocrine system (&amp;#34;death by rubber duck&amp;#34; is an interesting read).</li>
            <li>great to have a fragrance free no white marks deodorant.</li>
            <li>Looking for aluminum free</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth as silk using Almay.</li>
            <li>It is fragance free so it does not interfere with the cologne of your choice.</li>
            <li>I am free of irritation and allergic itching.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Almay fragrance free deodorant/antiperspirant gel for years</li>
            <li>This is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is also telling that most products that have no perfumes or dies are hypoallegenic, so people that are allergic to these substances have bodies that can tell right away that it is toxic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wherever you get it, it&#x27;s worth the investment to keep you perspiration- and odor-free!</li>
            <li>Fresh!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about trying this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit longer to dry than you&#x27;d expect, but once you get it on it works great.</li>
            <li>This anti perspirant/deodorant is a real blessing for all of us who are allergic to the ingrdedients in most deodorants.</li>
            <li>Is this true?</li>
            <li>Good product and low price.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t ask for more from a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone who gets irritation, itching, or allergic reactions from other deodrants.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously the perfect deodorant in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>but I find that it dries quickly, in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Great product without the typical perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>It made me look like I was sweaty and honestly, it was gross.</li>
            <li>This product is useful for those with skin allergies.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t wash it off), hoping that whatever got absorbed into my skin would block the sweating.</li>
            <li>I ended up sweating far more than I did WITHOUT antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Actually Almay is almost as effective at preventing wetness as the other more strong anti perspirants that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I generally reapply the product when I change clothes, just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>By the way, it&#x27;s really fragrance free and the gel formula is gentle.</li>
            <li>Clear, easy to use, no smell.  </li>
            <li>Obviously everyone&#x27;s sensitivities are different and I can&#x27;t even figure out exactly what ingredients bother me, but this is great.</li>
            <li>you very much.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I was at an outdoors festival where I was running a booth.</li>
            <li>Also, the scent mixes with my natural body odor (which is not offensive unless I&#x27;ve been working out hardcore) and creates a bizarre smell.</li>
            <li>I purchased Almay Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Clear Gel, Fragrance Free deordant for my son.</li>
            <li>but so glad I can still find it on Amazon and at one local drugstore.</li>
            <li>but then I don&#x27;t perspire a lot unless its quite hot</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly what</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>this is the only deodorant that i can use, i have tried many others and they all cause me to get knots under my arms.</li>
            <li>This was the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t irritate my underarms</li>
            <li>a little sticky so not the most comfortable</li>
            <li>It easily lasts 24hrs for me, though this will definitely vary from person to person.</li>
            <li>Like most gels, you have to let this one dry.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant because it is clear, I have noticed no stains, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with the breathing of people who are sensitive to fragrance, or annoy people who simply don&#x27;t like fragrance.  </li>
            <li>curious if the rampant allergies that most people in the US seem to be afflicted with stem from these toxins in all products.</li>
            <li>I really doubt that I will.</li>
            <li>I would have returned this if the shipping didn&#x27;t cost almost as much as the product.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it didn&#x27;t block smell very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well and does not irritate my skin or stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and does not bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>two things I do not like is: #1 there is not much product in the tube, more case than product&lt;</li>
            <li>Downside I feel like I use more than other deodorants since it&#x27;s a gel.</li>
            <li>(the legally can call any thing natural, no matter if it is, so be aware of that:</li>
            <li>A product containing High Fructose Corn Syrup that is (like pretty much all HFCS) genetically modified can be called 100% natural ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this deodorant is clear of dies and perfumes, but still contains the aluminium.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised as this was my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>so it was kind of pointless.</li>
            <li>and it was cool outside.</li>
            <li>It keeps you dry and odor-free, the product is truly fragrance free, and does not leave residue on your clothing.  </li>
            <li>but it didnt keep me dry and smell free</li>
            <li>The clear gel goes on smoothly without any white residue.</li>
            <li>While it goes on clear and dries smooth, my armpits feel sticky or coated in the shower the next day.</li>
            <li>Though we like the solid better for this reason, the solid breaks my daughter&#x27;s skin out while the gel does not, so</li>
            <li>and it also did a decent job at wetness protection.</li>
            <li>We discovered Almay when he was in high school</li>
            <li>The product is really scentless, and the clear gel even cools the skin and dries quickly, protecting from odor throughout the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to find one with a scent and hard stick rather than gel though.</li>
            <li>The delivery with is model of the brand is very efficient and applies more ealily than in the past.  </li>
            <li>I normally use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good EWG score, no smell, works well for me (middle aged female)</li>
            <li>This product does not irritate my sensitive skin as most commercial deodorants do, but still gives the same odor protection.</li>
            <li>and this is the only anti-persperant Ive tried that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, even freshly shaved.</li>
            <li>I order this from amazon, because where i normally buy it no longer had it on there shelves.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, so this anti-perspirant gets a workout.</li>
            <li>This was a cheap and decent deodorant, but after twisting the bottom for first-time use, nearly half the bottle was air to get the gel to come to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Some of the other deodorants were a slight more effective at preventing wetness but the itching and irritation is not worth it.</li>
            <li>Pretty much nothing is left natural and producers often lie through the teeth claiming &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34;, even if it is nothing you could ever call natural.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li>It is a product for sensitive skin and it works well!</li>
            <li>admit that I do not perspire very much, even though I live in muggy Southwest Florida, but I will start to smell if I don&#x27;t use a good deodorant.</li>
            <li>The only kvetch I have is that, for the size of the container, the manufacturers have only filled it half full of product.</li>
            <li>Thank you for having this product - I am allergic to so many deoderants and this one is very difficult to find - so I was extremely pleased to see that you had this product.</li>
            <li>This item was available for subscribe and save, so I tried  it once, but immediately went back to using Dry Idea, which I&#x27;ve had no problems using.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer has changed the packaging, and I prefer the old version, while still available, which is a little neater to dispense.</li>
            <li>With the crystal clear rock</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, leaving no powdery residue under my arms or on my clothes.</li>
            <li>He prefers the clear gel as it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the packaging is clear, too, so I can see how soon I need to replace it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well rated on the EWG&#x27;s site which is why I bought it initially.</li>
            <li>I ordered a pack of several of them at a time, that&#x27;s how much I sweat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Its not heavy duty.</li>
            <li>we both have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Initially I thought it was better than other antiperspirants, and it actually might be.</li>
            <li>I needed a couple of add-on items to get free shipping, and Amazon&#x27;s price is the same as my local Walmart, so now I won&#x27;t run out for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, it&#x27;s cheap enough that I don&#x27;t feel like the money was a complete waste, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>The container really should be smaller, but then maybe it wouldn&#x27;t have such presence on the shelf.</li>
            <li>on to my point, this deodorant does the job, occasionally only a very small amount of residue, it dries quickly and most importantly is not sticky like a lot of gel</li>
            <li>The only two that work are the crystal clear rock and Almay.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY antiperspirant I can use with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>need to be careful with twisting to get the gel up that not too much comes out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this because I have sensitive skin; I bought it because I have been looking for a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave white marks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, we received a DIFFERENT product (Almay SENSITIVE SKIN).</li>
            <li>ironically it made me smell much much worse AND sweat more.</li>
            <li>Three hours after applied and it still not dry yet, so it would still ruin my shirt and make it look like I sweated.</li>
            <li>Alas, it works that well because it has such a high percentage of aluminum in it, and that seems to be exactly what my skin is sensitive to.  </li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to my usual high strength deoderant</li>
            <li>have used this product for years, and, other than the container (recently updated again with a new look and a different applicator), Almay hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin due to being allergic to metal.</li>

            <li> I was sweating more than I ever had since I started wearing antipersperiant because the product didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Most deodorants, including Almay&#x27;s, seem to contain aluminum.</li>
            <li> After applying while wearing a tank top, I went to work.</li>
            <li> I love the Almay products.</li>
            <li> So after awhile went to purchase some more, but could not find it.</li>
            <li> Most Wal-Marts and Walgreens stores carry it, or you can get it online.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than the deodorant sticks</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and have sworn by it for years now.  </li>
            <li> This was my favorite but</li>
            <li> and this product works very well with the smell thing not as great in the area of sweating</li>
            <li> For those whose difficulties come from scent or the alcohol most roll-ons use, this may be just what you need.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I buy a do en at a time and will surely order it again.</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t have to switch brands.</li>
            <li> The better deodorant for women in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance free anti-persperant, goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try another deo after this, but this one will be my go-to, because it is pretty good, regardless.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to chemicals and this works great, no fragrance, no clammy armpits.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wonderful product for years for sensitive skin and when I couldn&#x27;t find it at my usual retailer, I searched Amazon and found a great deal!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it is ok, is better if you buy in a super market.</li>
            <li> Nice, but it&#x27;s easy to dispense more than you need, and I got an irritation when I applied too much.  </li>
            <li> I found with alarm, reading the book &amp;#34;death by rubber duck&amp;#34; that most perfumes used in any products are actually pretty toxic and stay in the body for a while and disrupt the endocrine system (&amp;#34;death by rubber duck&amp;#34; is an interesting read).</li>
            <li> great to have a fragrance free no white marks deodorant.</li>
            <li> Looking for aluminum free</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth as silk using Almay.</li>
            <li> It is fragance free so it does not interfere with the cologne of your choice.</li>
            <li> I am free of irritation and allergic itching.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Almay fragrance free deodorant/antiperspirant gel for years</li>
            <li> This is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is also telling that most products that have no perfumes or dies are hypoallegenic, so people that are allergic to these substances have bodies that can tell right away that it is toxic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wherever you get it, it&#x27;s worth the investment to keep you perspiration- and odor-free!</li>
            <li> Fresh!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about trying this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit longer to dry than you&#x27;d expect, but once you get it on it works great.</li>
            <li> This anti perspirant/deodorant is a real blessing for all of us who are allergic to the ingrdedients in most deodorants.</li>
            <li> Is this true?</li>
            <li> Good product and low price.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t ask for more from a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone who gets irritation, itching, or allergic reactions from other deodrants.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously the perfect deodorant in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> but I find that it dries quickly, in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Great product without the typical perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> It made me look like I was sweaty and honestly, it was gross.</li>
            <li> This product is useful for those with skin allergies.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t wash it off), hoping that whatever got absorbed into my skin would block the sweating.</li>
            <li> I ended up sweating far more than I did WITHOUT antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Actually Almay is almost as effective at preventing wetness as the other more strong anti perspirants that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I generally reapply the product when I change clothes, just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> By the way, it&#x27;s really fragrance free and the gel formula is gentle.</li>
            <li> Clear, easy to use, no smell.  </li>
            <li> Obviously everyone&#x27;s sensitivities are different and I can&#x27;t even figure out exactly what ingredients bother me, but this is great.</li>
            <li> you very much.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, I was at an outdoors festival where I was running a booth.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent mixes with my natural body odor (which is not offensive unless I&#x27;ve been working out hardcore) and creates a bizarre smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased Almay Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Clear Gel, Fragrance Free deordant for my son.</li>
            <li> but so glad I can still find it on Amazon and at one local drugstore.</li>
            <li> but then I don&#x27;t perspire a lot unless its quite hot</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly what</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> this is the only deodorant that i can use, i have tried many others and they all cause me to get knots under my arms.</li>
            <li> This was the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t irritate my underarms</li>
            <li> a little sticky so not the most comfortable</li>
            <li> It easily lasts 24hrs for me, though this will definitely vary from person to person.</li>
            <li> Like most gels, you have to let this one dry.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant because it is clear, I have noticed no stains, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with the breathing of people who are sensitive to fragrance, or annoy people who simply don&#x27;t like fragrance.  </li>
            <li> curious if the rampant allergies that most people in the US seem to be afflicted with stem from these toxins in all products.</li>
            <li> I really doubt that I will.</li>
            <li> I would have returned this if the shipping didn&#x27;t cost almost as much as the product.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it didn&#x27;t block smell very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well and does not irritate my skin or stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and does not bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> two things I do not like is: #1 there is not much product in the tube, more case than product&lt;</li>
            <li> Downside I feel like I use more than other deodorants since it&#x27;s a gel.</li>
            <li> (the legally can call any thing natural, no matter if it is, so be aware of that:</li>
            <li> A product containing High Fructose Corn Syrup that is (like pretty much all HFCS) genetically modified can be called 100% natural ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this deodorant is clear of dies and perfumes, but still contains the aluminium.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised as this was my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> so it was kind of pointless.</li>
            <li> and it was cool outside.</li>
            <li> It keeps you dry and odor-free, the product is truly fragrance free, and does not leave residue on your clothing.  </li>
            <li> but it didnt keep me dry and smell free</li>
            <li> The clear gel goes on smoothly without any white residue.</li>
            <li> While it goes on clear and dries smooth, my armpits feel sticky or coated in the shower the next day.</li>
            <li> Though we like the solid better for this reason, the solid breaks my daughter&#x27;s skin out while the gel does not, so</li>
            <li> and it also did a decent job at wetness protection.</li>
            <li> We discovered Almay when he was in high school</li>
            <li> The product is really scentless, and the clear gel even cools the skin and dries quickly, protecting from odor throughout the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to find one with a scent and hard stick rather than gel though.</li>
            <li> The delivery with is model of the brand is very efficient and applies more ealily than in the past.  </li>
            <li> I normally use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good EWG score, no smell, works well for me (middle aged female)</li>
            <li> This product does not irritate my sensitive skin as most commercial deodorants do, but still gives the same odor protection.</li>
            <li> and this is the only anti-persperant Ive tried that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, even freshly shaved.</li>
            <li> I order this from amazon, because where i normally buy it no longer had it on there shelves.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, so this anti-perspirant gets a workout.</li>
            <li> This was a cheap and decent deodorant, but after twisting the bottom for first-time use, nearly half the bottle was air to get the gel to come to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Some of the other deodorants were a slight more effective at preventing wetness but the itching and irritation is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Pretty much nothing is left natural and producers often lie through the teeth claiming &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34;, even if it is nothing you could ever call natural.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li> It is a product for sensitive skin and it works well!</li>
            <li> admit that I do not perspire very much, even though I live in muggy Southwest Florida, but I will start to smell if I don&#x27;t use a good deodorant.</li>
            <li> The only kvetch I have is that, for the size of the container, the manufacturers have only filled it half full of product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having this product - I am allergic to so many deoderants and this one is very difficult to find - so I was extremely pleased to see that you had this product.</li>
            <li> This item was available for subscribe and save, so I tried  it once, but immediately went back to using Dry Idea, which I&#x27;ve had no problems using.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer has changed the packaging, and I prefer the old version, while still available, which is a little neater to dispense.</li>
            <li> With the crystal clear rock</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, leaving no powdery residue under my arms or on my clothes.</li>
            <li> He prefers the clear gel as it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the packaging is clear, too, so I can see how soon I need to replace it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well rated on the EWG&#x27;s site which is why I bought it initially.</li>
            <li> I ordered a pack of several of them at a time, that&#x27;s how much I sweat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Its not heavy duty.</li>
            <li> we both have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought it was better than other antiperspirants, and it actually might be.</li>
            <li> I needed a couple of add-on items to get free shipping, and Amazon&#x27;s price is the same as my local Walmart, so now I won&#x27;t run out for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, it&#x27;s cheap enough that I don&#x27;t feel like the money was a complete waste, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> The container really should be smaller, but then maybe it wouldn&#x27;t have such presence on the shelf.</li>
            <li> on to my point, this deodorant does the job, occasionally only a very small amount of residue, it dries quickly and most importantly is not sticky like a lot of gel</li>
            <li> The only two that work are the crystal clear rock and Almay.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY antiperspirant I can use with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> need to be careful with twisting to get the gel up that not too much comes out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this because I have sensitive skin; I bought it because I have been looking for a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave white marks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, we received a DIFFERENT product (Almay SENSITIVE SKIN).</li>
            <li> ironically it made me smell much much worse AND sweat more.</li>
            <li> Three hours after applied and it still not dry yet, so it would still ruin my shirt and make it look like I sweated.</li>
            <li> Alas, it works that well because it has such a high percentage of aluminum in it, and that seems to be exactly what my skin is sensitive to.  </li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to my usual high strength deoderant</li>
            <li> have used this product for years, and, other than the container (recently updated again with a new look and a different applicator), Almay hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin due to being allergic to metal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it does seem to be slowly staining the underarm area of my shirts with a light pink color.</li>
            <li> clothes can get wet when freshly applied, takes a few minutes to soak in</li>
            <li> There is almost a scent vacuum, which is why I use it with Weleda&#x27;s Sage Deoderant.</li>
            <li> works, but it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for an alternative to Secret&#x27;s Sensitive Skin Antiperspirant because it is costly.  </li>
            <li> So this is not perfect, but still better then all other aluminium based deodorants.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine if my insanely long hair got stuck in it.</li>
            <li> But even that isn&#x27;t really a complaint because it does dry rather fast.  </li>
            <li> Also, it took a long time to dry after applying</li>
            <li> I could literally peel it off and it was extremely flaky and white.</li>
            <li> When I was looking for a place to buy it, I saw several remarks from people like me who always have an itchy reaction to any other deodorant.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> I tried using it for a while, and it wouldn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> Always let the gel dry thoroughly before putting clothing on.</li>
            <li> You do have to let it dry like a roll on deodorant</li>
            <li> It will keep you dry and it works.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried several (Dove, Secret, Kiehls, several all natural ones, etc.)</li>
            <li> It goes on sorta wet and needs to dry</li>
            <li> This stuff works almost alarmingly well; my underarms were bone dry for over a day, and there was no scent to speak of.  </li>
            <li> I developed a lot of chemical sensitivities in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no fragrance in it to clash with lotions or perfumes</li>
            <li> The gel stays put, but doesn&#x27;t feel wet or sticky--usually drying by the time I get my shirt on.</li>
            <li> (not just the center but out to the edge of your</li>
            <li> It goes on easier/smoother than any other deodorant I have used.</li>
            <li> I have had irritation and allergic itching from almost all other deodorants/anti-perspirants but with Almay</li>
            <li> Maybe I could try it again and only apply an extremely small amount</li>
            <li> Also tried other places.</li>
            <li> I have hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating, I even had to take the max dose of oral meds for it before I changed deodorants after this), so finally out of desperation</li>
            <li> I had to say anything negative it would be that it takes a long time to dry once applied.</li>
            <li> It also makes me sneeze and is hard to wash off the next day in the shower.</li>
            <li> Hard to find something unscented that actually works.</li>
            <li> Not sure why my skin is totally rejecting this product, but it makes me sad because it seemed so highly recommended</li>
            <li> Not worth my 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> Even under average weather conditions (75 degress F)</li>
            <li> I was tired of natural deodorants that just didn&#x27;t work for B.O.</li>
            <li> But does leave a slight sticky residue on skin.</li>
            <li> Works as well as fragranced deodorants but without scent for those allergic to fragrance or prefer scent less.</li>
            <li> I try using less, but if I use too little then I stink lol.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I did not think anything natural could help me and my severe sweating problem, but immediately I stopped sweating excessively and the  body odor decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> It lost its little bit of effectiveness within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little like bait and switch.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not found a deodorant that does not contain aluminium that actually does work and keeps you dry.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness for heavy sweating).</li>
            <li> I still have the odor after a few hours but no rash.  </li>
            <li> Ive gone back to secret unscented</li>
            <li> I tried using Green Tidings unscented.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few toiletries I take through Airport Checkpoint Security.</li>
            <li> but I am missing those two letters from my keyboard)  </li>
            <li> (but I don&#x27;t work a job where I usually get sweaty</li>
            <li> And if that wasn&#x27;t embarrassing enough, often the products failed, and the resulting body odor was overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually, when a company &amp;#34;new and improves&amp;#34; a product, it ends up not working as well as the formula they had before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My usual deodorant caused me to break out in hives within 1 hour.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a rash like i usually get from deodorants</li>
            <li> deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;I use a fairly small amount and it lasts around 24 hrs (including work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually get stinky underarms</li>
            <li> It was pulling my skin so hard while I was peeling it off.</li>
            <li> It is hard to wash off your skin</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t put deodorant on after my shower the night before, and there&#x27;s a bit of odor when I get dressed late in the morning, it&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> At least not for me.  </li>
            <li> After a few months though, I smelled worse from it.</li>
            <li> Even a small amount of this product takes about an hour to dry while I&#x27;m holding my arms out like a chicken and using a cool-set blowdryer every 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate me but the quantity(2.25 OZ) is very small.  </li>
            <li> I seriously could not believe it.</li>
            <li> This is completely useless and is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was not a good product.  </li>
            <li> I hate getting white residue on my tops</li>
            <li> By the time it dries, it turns into a thin crusty film that peels off like dandruff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tired of having sweaty underarms all day.</li>
            <li> It was wrong item, my error.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just read online that aluminum in deodorants can cause breast cancer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that Walmart and Target stopped carrying it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it still made me itch.</li>
            <li> : After using it for a while; I&#x27;ve noticed a faint odor of BO, but it helps if you apply the deo ALL over your underarm.</li>
            <li> (sorry about the spelling</li>
            <li> Roll-ons were nasty, wet or sticky.</li>
            <li> but it hurt so bad</li>
            <li> Too bad it was not the product that was  advertised.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product - I thought it did not contain aluminum.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing....</li>
            <li> Anti-perspirant with aluminum in it makes my pits really, annoyingly itchy.  </li>
            <li> Which can be very painful.</li>
            <li> The jelly substance is nasty.</li>
            <li> However, it did a terrible job with odor protection!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It did not work.  I was really hoping for an alternative to Secret&#x27;s Sensitive Skin Antiperspirant because it is costly.  However, this product did not work for me at all.  Also, it took a long time to dry after applying and I had to wait to put my shirts on otherwise it would look like I sweated through.  Very disappointing....</li>
            <li> it is ok, is better if you buy in a super market.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry. I tried using it for a while, and it wouldn&#x27;t dry. It made me look like I was sweaty and honestly, it was gross. Not worth my 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> It is a product for sensitive skin and it works well! This product is useful for those with skin allergies.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic deodorant, and thought this was perfect. Until I tried it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it has only the scent of aloe (which is as close to fragrance-free as you can get), but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Thankfully, it&#x27;s cheap enough that I don&#x27;t feel like the money was a complete waste, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. It&#x27;s very well rated on the EWG&#x27;s site which is why I bought it initially. It goes on easier/smoother than any other deodorant I have used. It also works well (but I don&#x27;t work a job where I usually get sweaty so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness for heavy sweating). Downside I feel like I use more than other deodorants since it&#x27;s a gel.</li>
            <li> It was wrong item, my error. Looking for aluminum free</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY antiperspirant I can use with my sensitive skin. My skin is smooth as silk using Almay. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant the work for me.  I started getting allergic reaction to all deodorants on the market.  I have tried everything.  The only two that work are the crystal clear rock and Almay.  With the crystal clear rock I still have the odor after a few hours but no rash.  But with Almay i have no odor and no rash.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having this product - I am allergic to so many deoderants and this one is very difficult to find - so I was extremely pleased to see that you had this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite anti-perspirant.  I buy it in bulk on Amazon.  The price is great and the product works!!  I love Almay products and this one lives up to the Almay name!</li>
            <li> I found with alarm, reading the book &amp;#34;death by rubber duck&amp;#34; that most perfumes used in any products are actually pretty toxic and stay in the body for a while and disrupt the endocrine system (&amp;#34;death by rubber duck&amp;#34; is an interesting read). It is also telling that most products that have no perfumes or dies are hypoallegenic, so people that are allergic to these substances have bodies that can tell right away that it is toxic.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m curious if the rampant allergies that most people in the US seem to be afflicted with stem from these toxins in all products. Pretty much nothing is left natural and producers often lie through the teeth claiming &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34;, even if it is nothing you could ever call natural. (the legally can call any thing natural, no matter if it is, so be aware of that: A product containing High Fructose Corn Syrup that is (like pretty much all HFCS) genetically modified can be called 100% natural ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this deodorant is clear of dies and perfumes, but still contains the aluminium. Unfortunately, I have not found a deodorant that does not contain aluminium that actually does work and keeps you dry. So this is not perfect, but still better then all other aluminium based deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it is great. No allergic reaction at all. No stains on my clothes. It is fragance free so it does not interfere with the cologne of your choice. Arrived on time as promised.</li>
            <li> This is a product I can&#x27;t do without and only brand I have used for years.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to chemicals and this works great, no fragrance, no clammy armpits. There is almost a scent vacuum, which is why I use it with Weleda&#x27;s Sage Deoderant. Perfect combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it does seem to be slowly staining the underarm area of my shirts with a light pink color.</li>
            <li> This anti perspirant/deodorant is a real blessing for all of us who are allergic to the ingrdedients in most deodorants. The clear gel goes on smoothly without any white residue. Always let the gel dry thoroughly before putting clothing on. I have had irritation and allergic itching from almost all other deodorants/anti-perspirants but with Almay I am free of irritation and allergic itching. Some of the other deodorants were a slight more effective at preventing wetness but the itching and irritation is not worth it. Actually Almay is almost as effective at preventing wetness as the other more strong anti perspirants that I have tried. This is a great product for anyone who gets irritation, itching, or allergic reactions from other deodrants.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff. Works great and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash. No Aluminum.</li>
            <li> a little sticky so not the most comfortable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and it always works for me.  Even if I skip my morning shower, I never have underarm odor, and I&#x27;m one of those self-conscious women who discreetly lifts and sniffs. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that I do not perspire very much, even though I live in muggy Southwest Florida, but I will start to smell if I don&#x27;t use a good deodorant. I needed a couple of add-on items to get free shipping, and Amazon&#x27;s price is the same as my local Walmart, so now I won&#x27;t run out for a long time.  By the way, it&#x27;s really fragrance free and the gel formula is gentle.</li>
            <li> This is good for sensitive skin. You do have to let it dry like a roll on deodorant but on e it dries you are set for the day. It will keep you dry and it works.</li>
            <li> I was tired of natural deodorants that just didn&#x27;t work for B.O. However this isn&#x27;t that much better on odor.  It stops you from sweating which I did not care about.  It also makes me sneeze and is hard to wash off the next day in the shower. While it goes on clear and dries smooth, my armpits feel sticky or coated in the shower the next day. I would not get it again.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to my usual high strength deoderant so I tried Almay&#x27;s Hypoallergenic version (since my eye doctor recommended the brand for makeup if i insisted on wearing it). The first day I used it, I was at an outdoors festival where I was running a booth. I was sweating more than I ever had since I started wearing antipersperiant because the product didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. Even under average weather conditions (75 degress F) the product seems to start to weaken after an hour or two. Also, the scent mixes with my natural body odor (which is not offensive unless I&#x27;ve been working out hardcore) and creates a bizarre smell. The price is good, even if you want to give it a try it&#x27;s not a bank breaker. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a day you have a date or a job interview if you&#x27;re going for a test run.</li>
            <li> unscented, great protection</li>
            <li> an excellent product I am satisfied is an excellent product I am satisfied is an excellent product I am satisfied is an excellent product I am satisfied is an excellent product I am satisfied is an excellent product I am satisfied is an excellent product I am satisfied is an excellent product I am satisfied is an excellent product I am satisfied with their quality and durability recommend price is excellent quality. very pleased with this product very good very good very good, superb design fabricaion realción cost and durability and quality are consistent with the product greta greta great great great great great great¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Almay fragrance free deodorant/antiperspirant gel for years and I have taken to buying two at a time, in case stores are out of them. Unfortunately, I just read online that aluminum in deodorants can cause breast cancer. Is this true? Most deodorants, including Almay&#x27;s, seem to contain aluminum.</li>
            <li> The delivery with is model of the brand is very efficient and applies more ealily than in the past.  It&#x27;s hypoalergenic quality is great.</li>
            <li> If you need hypoallergenic products this deodorant is reliable and has no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It will give you all day anti-perspirant protection.</li>
            <li> Good product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> great to have a fragrance free no white marks deodorant. need to be careful with twisting to get the gel up that not too much comes out. probably best used the night before- clothes can get wet when freshly applied, takes a few minutes to soak in</li>
            <li> For summertime heat and tank tops, Almay saved the day. I hate getting white residue on my tops but Almay didn&#x27;t leave any.&lt;br /&gt;Nor any white residue on my skin. I was pleasantly surprised as this was my first time using this product. There is absolutely no fragrance in it to clash with lotions or perfumes I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to say anything negative it would be that it takes a long time to dry once applied. But even that isn&#x27;t really a complaint because it does dry rather fast.  Definitely leaving this product in my Shopping List to purchase again. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin due to being allergic to metal. I wanted to give this deodorant a try. After applying while wearing a tank top, I went to work. As soon as I got to work and began working at my desk, I lifted my arm to get someone only to find that my arm pits were literally GLUED SHUT! I could NOT believe it! I could literally peel it off and it was extremely flaky and white. It hurt too! It was pulling my skin so hard while I was peeling it off. Maybe I could try it again and only apply an extremely small amount but it hurt so bad I really doubt that I will. I couldn&#x27;t imagine if my insanely long hair got stuck in it. Ouch!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.  But does leave a slight sticky residue on skin.</li>
            <li> I love the Almay products. One day I saw this in my local grocery shelf and bought and I loved it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue. So after awhile went to purchase some more, but could not find it. Also tried other places. No luck. So I found that Amazon carried it. Very happy I was able to find it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to deodorants before so I figured I&#x27;d try this one out. Takes a bit longer to dry than you&#x27;d expect, but once you get it on it works great. It easily lasts 24hrs for me, though this will definitely vary from person to person. Hard to find something unscented that actually works.</li>
            <li> I tried everything. For years, I kept having to switch from one deodorant to another about once every six months, because my body either became resistant or irritated by each product. Roll-ons were nasty, wet or sticky. Deodorant sticks left a white residue on my clothing. And if that wasn&#x27;t embarrassing enough, often the products failed, and the resulting body odor was overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered Almay. It doesn&#x27;t make my underarms break out. It goes on clear, leaving no powdery residue under my arms or on my clothes. The gel stays put, but doesn&#x27;t feel wet or sticky--usually drying by the time I get my shirt on. If I didn&#x27;t put deodorant on after my shower the night before, and there&#x27;s a bit of odor when I get dressed late in the morning, it&#x27;s no problem. Almay seems to kill the bacteria and neutralize the odor without me having to wash. I generally reapply the product when I change clothes, just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for years, and, other than the container (recently updated again with a new look and a different applicator), Almay hasn&#x27;t changed. Thank heaven! Usually, when a company &amp;#34;new and improves&amp;#34; a product, it ends up not working as well as the formula they had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are a guy or a gal, this is a great anti-antiperspirant. Most Wal-Marts and Walgreens stores carry it, or you can get it online. Wherever you get it, it&#x27;s worth the investment to keep you perspiration- and odor-free!</li>
            <li> I have recently learned that scented and dyed products used on my skin and clothing cause me hives!!  My usual deodorant caused me to break out in hives within 1 hour.  I ordered this and it is awesome.  Yes, it is more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than the deodorant sticks but I find that it dries quickly, in about 5 minutes.  I can recommend it to those who have sensitivities to scent or dye.</li>
            <li> I have bought the fragrance-free version, as I am scent-sensitive. The product is really scentless, and the clear gel even cools the skin and dries quickly, protecting from odor throughout the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance free anti-persperant, goes on easily.  Works as well as fragranced deodorants but without scent for those allergic to fragrance or prefer scent less.</li>
            <li> Three hours after applied and it still not dry yet, so it would still ruin my shirt and make it look like I sweated. The jelly substance is nasty. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to prevent sweat either. This is completely useless and is a waste of money. I would have returned this if the shipping didn&#x27;t cost almost as much as the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased Almay Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Clear Gel, Fragrance Free deordant for my son. It is the only deodorant he can use. His skin breaks out with anything else. We discovered Almay when he was in high school and he has used this since then. He prefers the clear gel as it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and have sworn by it for years now.  It&#x27;s seriously the perfect deodorant in my opinion.  It keeps you dry and odor-free, the product is truly fragrance free, and does not leave residue on your clothing.  I can&#x27;t think of any way to improve this product, it&#x27;s perfect.  I&#x27;m sad that Walmart and Target stopped carrying it but so glad I can still find it on Amazon and at one local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Great product without the typical perfume smell.  Fresh!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t itch or aggravate my allergies.  It goes on sorta wet and needs to dry but if hypoallergenic is what you&#x27;re looking for, give it a try.</li>
            <li> This was a cheap and decent deodorant, but after twisting the bottom for first-time use, nearly half the bottle was air to get the gel to come to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, but it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me an allergic reaction like some others.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product - I thought it did not contain aluminum.  That was why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite but almost no one is selling it anymore.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. I didn&#x27;t get a rash like i usually get from deodorants but it didnt keep me dry and smell free so it was kind of pointless. Ive gone back to secret unscented which is the best i have found so far.. But still searching..</li>
            <li> Like most gels, you have to let this one dry. Though we like the solid better for this reason, the solid breaks my daughter&#x27;s skin out while the gel does not, so it&#x27;s the best option for really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought it was better than other antiperspirants, and it actually might be. I ordered a pack of several of them at a time, that&#x27;s how much I sweat. After a few months though, I smelled worse from it. I have hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating, I even had to take the max dose of oral meds for it before I changed deodorants after this), so finally out of desperation I tried using Green Tidings unscented. It&#x27;s a natural deodorant. I did not think anything natural could help me and my severe sweating problem, but immediately I stopped sweating excessively and the  body odor decreased dramatically. I seriously could not believe it. Sometimes I just use coconut oil and baking soda. It SOUNDS to good to be true, but it sure happened.&lt;br /&gt;I think my body didn&#x27;t like the antiperspirant at all. I even stopped sweating under my breasts, which is what I think my body did to reroute the rest of the  sweat that didn&#x27;t come out of my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;So yeah...ironically it made me smell much much worse AND sweat more. It was not just this antiperspirant, but all of them that eventually caused me to have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;I do appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance because those give me headaches.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, convenient and pleasant to use, relatively free of irritants, and effective. The manufacturer has changed the packaging, and I prefer the old version, while still available, which is a little neater to dispense.</li>
            <li> Works great and has ZERO fragrance.</li>
            <li> What the point of being a &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; anti-perspirant if it leaves white residue allover your clothes? This item was available for subscribe and save, so I tried  it once, but immediately went back to using Dry Idea, which I&#x27;ve had no problems using.</li>
            <li> Good EWG score, no smell, works well for me (middle aged female) but then I don&#x27;t perspire a lot unless its quite hot or I&#x27;m exerting myself. Probably wouldn&#x27;t work well for someone who perspires alot. Its not heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Encouraged by the reviews I decided to give this a try. After two weeks of nightly usage this product didn&#x27;t have any effect.</li>
            <li> Good Product-Works well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it still made me itch.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate me but the quantity(2.25 OZ) is very small.  I also noticed it i not 100% anti-perspirant.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product does not irritate my sensitive skin as most commercial deodorants do, but still gives the same odor protection.</li>
            <li> This was not a good product.  The case was busted, and the stuff was all over everything.  It was kind of slimy, and I threw it away immediately.</li>
            <li> I developed a lot of chemical sensitivities in my late 20&#x27;s and this is the only anti-persperant Ive tried that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, even freshly shaved. Tom&#x27;s bothered me and I feel like it didn&#x27;t block smell very well. Obviously everyone&#x27;s sensitivities are different and I can&#x27;t even figure out exactly what ingredients bother me, but this is great.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a man&#x27;s antiperspirant/deodorant.  At least not for me.  It lost its little bit of effectiveness within a couple hours. I&#x27;m still looking for an unscented antiperspirant that works effectively.</li>
            <li> Good product and low price. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice, but it&#x27;s easy to dispense more than you need, and I got an irritation when I applied too much.  Good protection when you get the hang of how to use the dispenser.  I prefer the roll-on, though, and will order that the next time.</li>
            <li> I am extreamly allergic to things that smell and this product works very well with the smell thing not as great in the area of sweating but it does help..</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly what&lt;br /&gt;i wanted and couldn;t find in the stores.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and transaction!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant because it is clear, I have noticed no stains, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with the breathing of people who are sensitive to fragrance, or annoy people who simply don&#x27;t like fragrance.  I like the fact that the packaging is clear, too, so I can see how soon I need to replace it.  It is one of the few toiletries I take through Airport Checkpoint Security.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this because I have sensitive skin; I bought it because I have been looking for a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave white marks.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it is my skin texture or something else but all the &#x27;invisible solid&#x27; deodorants that claim to leave no residue always do! I have gross white bits of deodorant under my arms and on clothes. I try using less, but if I use too little then I stink lol.&lt;br /&gt;Now on to my point, this deodorant does the job, occasionally only a very small amount of residue, it dries quickly and most importantly is not sticky like a lot of gel deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;I use a fairly small amount and it lasts around 24 hrs (including work day)&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t ask for more from a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using it for a while; I&#x27;ve noticed a faint odor of BO, but it helps if you apply the deo ALL over your underarm. (not just the center but out to the edge of your arm)&lt;br /&gt;And a con is the container leaks a bit, I have it sitting on a napkin because it&#x27;s got greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try another deo after this, but this one will be my go-to, because it is pretty good, regardless.</li>
            <li> Wow,l will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff works almost alarmingly well; my underarms were bone dry for over a day, and there was no scent to speak of.  Alas, it works that well because it has such a high percentage of aluminum in it, and that seems to be exactly what my skin is sensitive to.  Even with the moisturizers, I was still itching.  For those whose difficulties come from scent or the alcohol most roll-ons use, this may be just what you need.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for many years. I can&#x27;t remember ever using a different one. When I was looking for a place to buy it, I saw several remarks from people like me who always have an itchy reaction to any other deodorant. I&#x27;m glad I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works very well and does not irritate my skin or stain my clothes. I live in Florida, so this anti-perspirant gets a workout.</li>
            <li> Regular deodorant breaks out my skin so I bought this to see if it helps. I really like this product and does not bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Only two things I do not like is: #1 there is not much product in the tube, more case than product&lt;br /&gt;#2 It is hard to wash off your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years ... I get the unscented. Very gentle, very effective. The only kvetch I have is that, for the size of the container, the manufacturers have only filled it half full of product. The container really should be smaller, but then maybe it wouldn&#x27;t have such presence on the shelf. It&#x27;s a little like bait and switch. But, the deodorant is the best.</li>
            <li> this is the only deodorant that i can use, i have tried many others and they all cause me to get knots under my arms. Which can be very painful. I order this from amazon, because where i normally buy it no longer had it on there shelves. It is the best  for sensitive skin. And the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Clear, easy to use, no smell.  None.  And it works well.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find.  I looked everywhere from Northern California  to Pheoni  Ariona.  (sorry about the spelling but I am missing those two letters from my keyboard)  I buy a do en at a time and will surely order it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wonderful product for years for sensitive skin and when I couldn&#x27;t find it at my usual retailer, I searched Amazon and found a great deal! So glad I didn&#x27;t have to switch brands. Loved the ease of purchase and quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> Very good! The better deodorant for women in my opinion. Don&#x27;t have fragrances and does not stain clothes.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about trying this deodorant. I have very sensitive underarms. This was the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t irritate my underarms and I&#x27;ve tried several (Dove, Secret, Kiehls, several all natural ones, etc.) and it also did a decent job at wetness protection. However, it did a terrible job with odor protection! I don&#x27;t usually get stinky underarms but I did with this product... Even on days that I wasn&#x27;t sweating and it was cool outside. Sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> No claiming from my wife, So this is good.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Even a small amount of this product takes about an hour to dry while I&#x27;m holding my arms out like a chicken and using a cool-set blowdryer every 10 minutes. By the time it dries, it turns into a thin crusty film that peels off like dandruff. I brushed it off (I didn&#x27;t wash it off), hoping that whatever got absorbed into my skin would block the sweating. I ended up sweating far more than I did WITHOUT antiperspirant. Not sure why my skin is totally rejecting this product, but it makes me sad because it seemed so highly recommended and I&#x27;m tired of having sweaty underarms all day.</li>
            <li> Excellent deodorant. My Mom and I both use it and have for years. It does the job and we get no reaction from it...we both have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We ordered the product as advertised in this picture.  However, we received a DIFFERENT product (Almay SENSITIVE SKIN). The faulty product was shipped in a timely manner, though. Too bad it was not the product that was  advertised.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and did not give me any allergic reaction. It would have been nice to find one with a scent and hard stick rather than gel though.</li>
            <li> Anti-perspirant with aluminum in it makes my pits really, annoyingly itchy.  Almay doesn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    </ol>
