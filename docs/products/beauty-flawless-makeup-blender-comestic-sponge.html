            <li>It blends beautifully and cleaning is very easy.</li>
            <li>It is a good item for the price.</li>
            <li>This sponge is as good as beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I cannot give it a fair comparison to the beauty blender, considering that I have not purchased one before.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>works just as good as the beauty blender..</li>
            <li>&amp; it apply my foundation really good.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking flawless and makes for a quick application.</li>
            <li>okay but not too happy with the fact</li>
            <li>I reccommend them to make up artists, or just for anyone who wears foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, and great five star product. :)</li>
            <li>In order to keep it in good shape, I have to wash it after every use (which I didn&#x27;t do), but it puts on my foundation nicely.</li>
            <li>This is a good sponge I liked it</li>
            <li>Has great bounce and is very soft, price is great, and quality is great also.</li>
            <li>I love this blending sponge!</li>
            <li>and I love the product!</li>
            <li>Love this thing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll def be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>It disperses and dilutes the product just a touch more than beauty blender does, but on a budget, this is your cosmetic sponge!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>my skin looks amazing after i finish my makeup all because of this sponge.</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It looks amazing.</li>
            <li>its amazing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own the beauty blender</li>
            <li>I honestly didnt see any difference when applying with this.</li>
            <li>Using warm water helps your foundation spread out.</li>
            <li>This is a nice blending sponge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed it with warm water and soap once</li>
            <li>The size makes it kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li>This works okay, but it&#x27;s not as good as the Blender.</li>
            <li>nice product..</li>
            <li>prefer the shape of this sponge to the Beauty Blender and, honestly, it holds up almost as well.  </li>
            <li>Everywhere else you get a nice even distribution of makeup as well.</li>
            <li>I own three of these now.  </li>
            <li>With my honest reveiw.later BABYS DOLL&#x27;S</li>
            <li>I like this product, it does what it needs to do, it did start to smell a bit funky after the 2 time of use, after a good wash it was ok again.</li>
            <li>does not blend nicely</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the FantaSea blending sponge and will be buyging more for myself and my pro kit.</li>
            <li>Perfect for such a good price</li>
            <li>The shape makes it very easy to grasp.  </li>
            <li>I love this - it is adorable!  </li>
            <li>This sponge is pretty good!</li>
            <li>Excellent been using for nearly two years!</li>
            <li>This is perfect it make my sling look so natural.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>Honestly this is more of a hype item than a practical item.</li>
            <li>Buy a few, the price is great and its probably the best Beauty Blender dupe out there</li>
            <li>but it does blend perfectly and make your highlighting and contouring more natural.</li>
            <li>This sponge does a pretty great job when you&#x27;re applying your foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li>It was very cheap</li>
            <li>I will keep my avon brush that I purchased for very cheap.</li>
            <li>It blends the makeup in so smoothly and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>Give it a try :)</li>
            <li>Brushes work better for that.  </li>
            <li>love the ergonomic shape of the sponge.</li>
            <li>I love it and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen so many MUA&#x27;s using this tool.</li>
            <li>I love using it though.</li>
            <li>More pressing and blending is required.</li>
            <li>With this sponge more arm muscle, patience, and time is needed.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t love these.</li>
            <li>Love how this beauty blender works.</li>
            <li>she really enjoyed this item</li>
            <li>I am truly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I do have to use slightly more BB cream than I did before,</li>
            <li>BUY IT!:)</li>
            <li>I was satisfied, so I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash this, because it will breed bacteria and develop a smell.</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely in love with it.</li>
            <li>Found this at a much better price on Amazon than in the stores.</li>
            <li>I love using these sponges for my clients.</li>
            <li>Much better for me than a brush for foundation and much better than your fingers in blending.</li>
            <li>And for the price I feel like I should purchase a lot more but</li>
            <li>So glad i got this sponge</li>
            <li>it is cute though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>but it works OK.</li>
            <li>and I get better coverage.</li>
            <li>better than my 32$ tarte brush better than anything i have im going to buy 10</li>
            <li>Kind of huge, though.  </li>
            <li>10x better than the original and cheaper!</li>
            <li>but this sponge works really well to blend foundation pretty much flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for medium or full coverage application on its own.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty good</li>
            <li>Durable, doesn&#x27;t tear, easy to wash, it&#x27;s everything I needed and more.</li>
            <li>Smoothes my foundation perfectly onto my dry nose.</li>
            <li>Worked well for blending and was definitely worth the price and more!</li>
            <li>A light spray with some water and it blends flawlessly, so much better than my fingers.  </li>
            <li>cheap-o Maybelline Fit foundation and love</li>
            <li>but I like the original one more</li>
            <li>other &#x27;s feel happy about themselfs with a lil makeup !</li>
            <li>Its great quality for the price, and is great for thick foundations, which I always use.</li>
            <li>its durable and easy to clean...spreads the foundation well.</li>
            <li>Even when damp they are still easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold/grip, and gets into the eye corners easily.</li>
            <li>This is a great, general make up sponge.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this based on the previous reviews to flawlessly apply foundation, and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li>It looks like a tear drop, but it works just as fine.</li>
            <li>than that goos product works fine</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss.  </li>
            <li>its cheap</li>
            <li>It blends makeup products smoothly onto my face.</li>
            <li>Even when I don&#x27;t use the sponge to apply my foundation, I&#x27;ll roll it over my face after using a brush to smooth everything.</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy having it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find a bunch of cheap beauty blender type sponges listed.</li>
            <li>It does the job great, the only problem i&#x27;d have to say about it is the smell, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Because of that, I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in how nice it looks applied to my face with my fingers vs the sponge.</li>
            <li>The sponge is designed to keep the makeup smooth on your face ; it does.</li>
            <li>Such a great thing to have</li>
            <li>Makes my skin flake and doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup addict &amp; enjoy makin</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d much rather spend more money on a better investment.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wring all the water out or it won&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>but if I really want a flawless look I&#x27;ll use a flat top first then used that to blend it out.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re just trying to find a decent makeup blending sponge, this one is nice for the price.</li>
            <li>Works just like the original one.</li>
            <li>I love the airbrush effect that a dampened blending sponge gives me, but $20 is pretty steep.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for the original blending sponge that&#x27;s out there</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a more natural look and think the Beauty Blender does a better job.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s dense, rinses clean, and has a point to get into nooks around the nose and eyes.</li>
            <li>This sponge it too hard and not bouncy to get the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my face with a really light concealer to test how much it would absorb or blend it, and to my dismay, it absorbed it more than anything.</li>
            <li>If I still used normal foundation, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d notice a difference because the coverage is heavier, but the BB cream I use has light coverage.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to the beauty blender, probably even better because of its shape.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can see is that you can use the pointed end to apply in the corners of your eyes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much out of those and it turns out that I love them.</li>
            <li>it really makes me feel confident because it helps me apply makeup</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is, but it is really good for putting powder or liquid foundation under your eyes.</li>
            <li>Neither of those concerns were true.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a good overall product.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of ordering this to save some money, but quickly realized I was better off buying the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, quality is good - won&#x27;t tear easily.</li>
            <li>Absolutely great product works the same as the real beauty blended.</li>
            <li>I didnt really see a great difference but that might be because I am not using it properly.</li>
            <li>This works great especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry, or when I want a bit more sheer coverage.</li>
            <li>If you need more control and a professional edge, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than the real beauty blender, though.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean (I just use warm water and soap once/week) and doesn&#x27;t break down when you clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love the way this sponge feels on my skin, no complaints so far!</li>
            <li>but it was fun using this to blend my make up.</li>
            <li>That was absorbed quite a bit as well by the Fantasea sponge.</li>
            <li>It does create a nice finish and has held up to numerous washings.</li>
            <li>it took awhile to get here but for the price it was worth the wait</li>
            <li>I even use it to apply under eye concealer and it makes sure everything is blended and seamless.</li>
            <li>, nonetheless they are worth every dime.</li>
            <li>, hopefully it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Bought these for my wife and she is a makeup fanatic she likes high quality items and these were perfect</li>
            <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t use it right.</li>
            <li>Amazing price works exactly the same as the $20 ones</li>
            <li>, the sponge needs to be rinse fairly though ought as it does release some of its pink color on the first</li>
            <li>What I liked about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t do that it actually worked pretty well for me</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend the full amount for the real product</li>
            <li>The wide part is good for large areas like the cheeks, jawline, and forehead.</li>
            <li>I definitely found this sponge to be more effective at applying makeup than flat sponges I have tried out from drugstores.</li>
            <li>its incredibly soft and easy to wash.</li>
            <li>Like this product very much.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to be, if you&#x27;ve ever seen a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying this sponge</li>
            <li>and I think it works a lot better than a regular foundation brush.</li>
            <li>Smelled like chemicals/rubber when I first got it</li>
            <li>So Im ordering more soon get for back up.</li>
            <li>Made of cheaper material, I brought more from a different maker</li>
            <li>but this was my first beauty blender type sponge</li>
            <li>It is exactly like the one I paid $10 for.  </li>
            <li>It is of the same quality of my much more pricey Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li>Some people say its &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; but if you watch any makeup tutorial that uses this, they will say to dampen it first.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay $20 or more for a beauty blender when you can buy the exact same thing for a couple bucks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t interested in spending the money.</li>
            <li>I first saw this on youtubes gossmakeupartist.</li>
            <li>overall this is an ok sponge.</li>
            <li>Arrived when said it will and looks exactly like pictured.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Really like this product!</li>
            <li>As a makeup sponge this works well, but mine fell apart during the first time I washed it.</li>
            <li>For the price I didn&#x27;t have super high hopes for this sponge</li>
            <li>but luckily it was cheap so no big loss.</li>
            <li>I rate this a three star because is not as soft as the original</li>
            <li>and it works just as good as the more expensive one.</li>
            <li>Its amazing.. its so soft and makes the foundation feel like second skin.. it doesnt absorb much foundation..</li>
            <li>Im better off with a long hair makeup brush.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s okay, I love it</li>
            <li>I have no clue what the real-deal-expensive one feels like; reviewers said it was super soft.</li>
            <li>He constantly raved about the beauty blender so was very pleased when I found the same for me.</li>
            <li>Good dupe for the beauty blender, this one is just more firm, which I find gives heavier coverage, still without weighting down the skin.</li>
            <li>its smaller than i thought but works just fine.</li>
            <li>I like this handy , little makeup tool...</li>
            <li>This sponge really makes my foundation blend into my skin as in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the real Beauty Blender</li>
            <li>really?</li>
            <li>These do not blend very well</li>
            <li>Let me tell you the material doesn&#x27;t feel generic or cheap.</li>
            <li>blends makeup very well</li>
            <li>nice, blends makeup very well, works just as well as the ones more expensive.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be something I could hold in my whole hand rather than between two fingers.</li>
            <li>it works really well ...</li>
            <li>I actually really like these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dense and somehow doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li>This product was stated as it really is.</li>
            <li>and it really does make all the difference.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li>Felt like I was wasting so much make up in it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest gently cleaning it with water and soap and rinsing it out after every use so the sponge lasts longer and you get rid of bacteria that could cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this thing for my eyes.</li>
            <li>but I must add a Word of Caution: When rinsing after washing your blending sponge, squeeze out as much water as you can without twisting/wringing the blending sponge.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t accidentally put too much makeup on.</li>
            <li>(I use Dawn as a gentle cleaner for this AND my makeup brushes.)</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really expand either.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li>The texture is much smoother</li>
            <li>Good deal if you use this for applying foundation, but that sucks up a lot of makeup.  </li>
            <li>but it applies the foundation on clearly and perfectly better than an actual brush.</li>
            <li>I ecpesicailly loved how it didn&#x27;t soak up a lot of your makeup and waste it!!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this sponge</li>
            <li>and it works better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Even if you have to buy 2-3 of these sponges to last as long as one Beauty Blender, you still more than get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it compares to the actual beauty blender as I&#x27;ve never used one, but I like it and it works for what I need it to do at a great price.</li>
            <li>To clean it, I use water and regular Dawn dish liquid.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, and I had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find this one to be extra special except perhaps</li>
            <li>I jumped on the bandwagon and bought one to see what the big deal was but the blending sponges in a bag are just as good, is same material,and works the same as this one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also softer and squishier than the ebay ones, which in contrast have a smooth texture and feel dense when dry.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more for my personal use as well as my kit.</li>
            <li>My 10 cent sponge was a yellow one, since yellow isn&#x27;t a preferable color to most people (</li>
            <li>This sponge is super tiny and it does nothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These sponges bleed pink a little bit at first, but a good rinsing seems to have stopped it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of a high quality material.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the high end beauty blender</li>
            <li>The tiny package arrived nicely sealed in bubble wrap and the delivery was fast , I received the item way before the actual delivery date indicated , would definitely buy again !</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use the pointed end for the corners of my eyes, for make up or high lighter application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little bit more dense and not as \\&quot;soft\\&quot; for bouncing off the face.</li>
            <li>but I find that when it&#x27;s damp it works a little better.</li>
            <li>Not bad pretty cool a little smaller</li>
            <li>Really gives an even, soft finish.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase a few more.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t soft enough, even wet, to allow nice blending.</li>
            <li>My make up goes on looking more natural, without any brush strokes and without the mess of using my fingers to apply.</li>
            <li>for now ill see how my first one will hold up so far so good</li>
            <li>This is my second FantaSea cosmetic blending sponge because I&#x27;m afraid that they will hike up the $5 price once people realize how awesome it is!</li>
            <li>but when I use those foundations with this sponge, it makes my skin look very natural and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Will definitely get another once my first one is used up.</li>
            <li>It is soft, not hard like some reviews claim.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going back and forth about spending the $20 on a new beauty blender because mine was pretty old.</li>
            <li>Okay..I personally am not too crazy about these type of sponges because first of all, I&#x27;m used to using my brushes, fingers and the wedge sponges in application--which I am happy with already.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s similar to a firm rubbery bouncy ball which isn&#x27;t very comfortable trying to apply foundation to to the face.</li>
            <li>I like to spray mine with a little moisturizing mist or even water lightly and blend my foundation in.</li>
            <li>It smooths and blends foundation nicely -- much better than the little sponges you can buy in bags in larger quantities.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this little sponge!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a light pink and smaller than appeared</li>
            <li>THIS WAS SUPPOSE TO BE SOFT?</li>
            <li>seamlessly blending in my sunscreen-foundation combo - no streaks , no fuss.</li>
            <li>I dab a bit of foundation in different sections in my face and blend it out well with this product I really do like it</li>
            <li>This was purchased by my 15 year old daughter who saw it on a tutorial.  </li>
            <li>I have used the old style makeup sponges, but I have been using a brush to apply foundation for years now.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering a few more.</li>
            <li>this is good, it means less foundation is wasted and gets all gunky inside your sponge!  </li>
            <li>The only downside to this sponge is that I noticed I need to use more foundation than usual to build up to my desired coverage.</li>
            <li>My first one did tear after it&#x27;s third washing, but the same thing happens to the Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li>Not easy to find a place to store and keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Smaller than normal.</li>
            <li>If &amp;#34;aqua&amp;#34; is one of the first ingredients, don&#x27;t use this as a wet sponge.  </li>
            <li>My only concern it that the sponge takes up too much of the makeup and is hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and some foundations really emphasize my dry spots when I use a brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s definitely not as good as the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Not only make it easier to apply but the end result is a very natural and even foundation</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works exactly how I expected it to!</li>
            <li>It split in half while I was running warm water over it, not pleased.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing make up sponge, they can be kinda expensive</li>
            <li>I purchased this item in the hopes of finding a cheaper alternative to the sephora beauty blender i have (although it works amazingly well its just too expensive).</li>
            <li>apparently because it&#x27;s water-based.</li>
            <li>Each one was to be sent to a different address since we live in different states.</li>
            <li>At less than $1 a piece it cost exactly what a sponge should.</li>
            <li>Also, it dries back to it&#x27;s original small size.</li>
            <li>It does bleed a little the first couple of time you wash it</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first</li>
            <li>IT WAS CHEAP BUT NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li>Great product, but took a bit longer that I would have wanted :(</li>
            <li>Ive washed it a few times and it seems to be holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li>The sponge is soft and can be used both damped and dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a bit smaller than your average beauty blender, but for the price ot doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>It is to be used wet, but I have a Professional Make-up Tip for you!  </li>
            <li>I really like this little thing</li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> works just as good as the beauty blender..</li>
            <li> &amp; it apply my foundation really good.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin looking flawless and makes for a quick application.</li>
            <li> okay but not too happy with the fact</li>
            <li> I reccommend them to make up artists, or just for anyone who wears foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, and great five star product. :)</li>
            <li> In order to keep it in good shape, I have to wash it after every use (which I didn&#x27;t do), but it puts on my foundation nicely.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll def be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> It disperses and dilutes the product just a touch more than beauty blender does, but on a budget, this is your cosmetic sponge!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> my skin looks amazing after i finish my makeup all because of this sponge.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It looks amazing.</li>
            <li> its amazing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own the beauty blender</li>
            <li> I honestly didnt see any difference when applying with this.</li>
            <li> Using warm water helps your foundation spread out.</li>
            <li> This is a nice blending sponge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it with warm water and soap once</li>
            <li> The size makes it kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li> This works okay, but it&#x27;s not as good as the Blender.</li>
            <li> nice product..</li>
            <li> prefer the shape of this sponge to the Beauty Blender and, honestly, it holds up almost as well.  </li>
            <li> Everywhere else you get a nice even distribution of makeup as well.</li>
            <li> I own three of these now.  </li>
            <li> With my honest reveiw.later BABYS DOLL&#x27;S</li>
            <li> I like this product, it does what it needs to do, it did start to smell a bit funky after the 2 time of use, after a good wash it was ok again.</li>
            <li> does not blend nicely</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the FantaSea blending sponge and will be buyging more for myself and my pro kit.</li>
            <li> Perfect for such a good price</li>
            <li> The shape makes it very easy to grasp.  </li>
            <li> I love this - it is adorable!  </li>
            <li> This sponge is pretty good!</li>
            <li> Excellent been using for nearly two years!</li>
            <li> This is perfect it make my sling look so natural.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> Honestly this is more of a hype item than a practical item.</li>
            <li> Buy a few, the price is great and its probably the best Beauty Blender dupe out there</li>
            <li> but it does blend perfectly and make your highlighting and contouring more natural.</li>
            <li> This sponge does a pretty great job when you&#x27;re applying your foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li> It was very cheap</li>
            <li> I will keep my avon brush that I purchased for very cheap.</li>
            <li> It blends the makeup in so smoothly and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> Give it a try :)</li>
            <li> Brushes work better for that.  </li>
            <li> love the ergonomic shape of the sponge.</li>
            <li> I love it and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen so many MUA&#x27;s using this tool.</li>
            <li> I love using it though.</li>
            <li> More pressing and blending is required.</li>
            <li> With this sponge more arm muscle, patience, and time is needed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love these.</li>
            <li> Love how this beauty blender works.</li>
            <li> she really enjoyed this item</li>
            <li> I am truly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I do have to use slightly more BB cream than I did before,</li>
            <li> BUY IT!:)</li>
            <li> I was satisfied, so I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash this, because it will breed bacteria and develop a smell.</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely in love with it.</li>
            <li> Found this at a much better price on Amazon than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I love using these sponges for my clients.</li>
            <li> Much better for me than a brush for foundation and much better than your fingers in blending.</li>
            <li> And for the price I feel like I should purchase a lot more but</li>
            <li> So glad i got this sponge</li>
            <li> it is cute though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> but it works OK.</li>
            <li> and I get better coverage.</li>
            <li> better than my 32$ tarte brush better than anything i have im going to buy 10</li>
            <li> Kind of huge, though.  </li>
            <li> 10x better than the original and cheaper!</li>
            <li> but this sponge works really well to blend foundation pretty much flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for medium or full coverage application on its own.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty good</li>
            <li> Durable, doesn&#x27;t tear, easy to wash, it&#x27;s everything I needed and more.</li>
            <li> Smoothes my foundation perfectly onto my dry nose.</li>
            <li> Worked well for blending and was definitely worth the price and more!</li>
            <li> A light spray with some water and it blends flawlessly, so much better than my fingers.  </li>
            <li> cheap-o Maybelline Fit foundation and love</li>
            <li> but I like the original one more</li>
            <li> other &#x27;s feel happy about themselfs with a lil makeup !</li>
            <li> Its great quality for the price, and is great for thick foundations, which I always use.</li>
            <li> its durable and easy to clean...spreads the foundation well.</li>
            <li> Even when damp they are still easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold/grip, and gets into the eye corners easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great, general make up sponge.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the previous reviews to flawlessly apply foundation, and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> It looks like a tear drop, but it works just as fine.</li>
            <li> than that goos product works fine</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss.  </li>
            <li> its cheap</li>
            <li> It blends makeup products smoothly onto my face.</li>
            <li> Even when I don&#x27;t use the sponge to apply my foundation, I&#x27;ll roll it over my face after using a brush to smooth everything.</li>
            <li> but I do enjoy having it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find a bunch of cheap beauty blender type sponges listed.</li>
            <li> It does the job great, the only problem i&#x27;d have to say about it is the smell, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Because of that, I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in how nice it looks applied to my face with my fingers vs the sponge.</li>
            <li> The sponge is designed to keep the makeup smooth on your face ; it does.</li>
            <li> Such a great thing to have</li>
            <li> Makes my skin flake and doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup addict &amp; enjoy makin</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d much rather spend more money on a better investment.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wring all the water out or it won&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li> but if I really want a flawless look I&#x27;ll use a flat top first then used that to blend it out.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re just trying to find a decent makeup blending sponge, this one is nice for the price.</li>
            <li> Works just like the original one.</li>
            <li> I love the airbrush effect that a dampened blending sponge gives me, but $20 is pretty steep.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for the original blending sponge that&#x27;s out there</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a more natural look and think the Beauty Blender does a better job.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s dense, rinses clean, and has a point to get into nooks around the nose and eyes.</li>
            <li> This sponge it too hard and not bouncy to get the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face with a really light concealer to test how much it would absorb or blend it, and to my dismay, it absorbed it more than anything.</li>
            <li> If I still used normal foundation, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d notice a difference because the coverage is heavier, but the BB cream I use has light coverage.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to the beauty blender, probably even better because of its shape.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can see is that you can use the pointed end to apply in the corners of your eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much out of those and it turns out that I love them.</li>
            <li> it really makes me feel confident because it helps me apply makeup</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is, but it is really good for putting powder or liquid foundation under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Neither of those concerns were true.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a good overall product.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering this to save some money, but quickly realized I was better off buying the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, quality is good - won&#x27;t tear easily.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product works the same as the real beauty blended.</li>
            <li> I didnt really see a great difference but that might be because I am not using it properly.</li>
            <li> This works great especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry, or when I want a bit more sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> If you need more control and a professional edge, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than the real beauty blender, though.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean (I just use warm water and soap once/week) and doesn&#x27;t break down when you clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love the way this sponge feels on my skin, no complaints so far!</li>
            <li> but it was fun using this to blend my make up.</li>
            <li> That was absorbed quite a bit as well by the Fantasea sponge.</li>
            <li> It does create a nice finish and has held up to numerous washings.</li>
            <li> it took awhile to get here but for the price it was worth the wait</li>
            <li> I even use it to apply under eye concealer and it makes sure everything is blended and seamless.</li>
            <li> , nonetheless they are worth every dime.</li>
            <li> , hopefully it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and she is a makeup fanatic she likes high quality items and these were perfect</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t use it right.</li>
            <li> Amazing price works exactly the same as the $20 ones</li>
            <li> , the sponge needs to be rinse fairly though ought as it does release some of its pink color on the first</li>
            <li> What I liked about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t do that it actually worked pretty well for me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend the full amount for the real product</li>
            <li> The wide part is good for large areas like the cheeks, jawline, and forehead.</li>
            <li> I definitely found this sponge to be more effective at applying makeup than flat sponges I have tried out from drugstores.</li>
            <li> its incredibly soft and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to be, if you&#x27;ve ever seen a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying this sponge</li>
            <li> and I think it works a lot better than a regular foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Smelled like chemicals/rubber when I first got it</li>
            <li> So Im ordering more soon get for back up.</li>
            <li> Made of cheaper material, I brought more from a different maker</li>
            <li> but this was my first beauty blender type sponge</li>
            <li> It is exactly like the one I paid $10 for.  </li>
            <li> It is of the same quality of my much more pricey Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li> Some people say its &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; but if you watch any makeup tutorial that uses this, they will say to dampen it first.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay $20 or more for a beauty blender when you can buy the exact same thing for a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t interested in spending the money.</li>
            <li> I first saw this on youtubes gossmakeupartist.</li>
            <li> overall this is an ok sponge.</li>
            <li> Arrived when said it will and looks exactly like pictured.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Really like this product!</li>
            <li> As a makeup sponge this works well, but mine fell apart during the first time I washed it.</li>
            <li> For the price I didn&#x27;t have super high hopes for this sponge</li>
            <li> but luckily it was cheap so no big loss.</li>
            <li> I rate this a three star because is not as soft as the original</li>
            <li> and it works just as good as the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Its amazing.. its so soft and makes the foundation feel like second skin.. it doesnt absorb much foundation..</li>
            <li> Im better off with a long hair makeup brush.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s okay, I love it</li>
            <li> I have no clue what the real-deal-expensive one feels like; reviewers said it was super soft.</li>
            <li> He constantly raved about the beauty blender so was very pleased when I found the same for me.</li>
            <li> Good dupe for the beauty blender, this one is just more firm, which I find gives heavier coverage, still without weighting down the skin.</li>
            <li> its smaller than i thought but works just fine.</li>
            <li> I like this handy , little makeup tool...</li>
            <li> This sponge really makes my foundation blend into my skin as in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the real Beauty Blender</li>
            <li> really?</li>
            <li> These do not blend very well</li>
            <li> Let me tell you the material doesn&#x27;t feel generic or cheap.</li>
            <li> blends makeup very well</li>
            <li> nice, blends makeup very well, works just as well as the ones more expensive.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;d be something I could hold in my whole hand rather than between two fingers.</li>
            <li> it works really well ...</li>
            <li> I actually really like these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dense and somehow doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> This product was stated as it really is.</li>
            <li> and it really does make all the difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li> Felt like I was wasting so much make up in it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest gently cleaning it with water and soap and rinsing it out after every use so the sponge lasts longer and you get rid of bacteria that could cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this thing for my eyes.</li>
            <li> but I must add a Word of Caution: When rinsing after washing your blending sponge, squeeze out as much water as you can without twisting/wringing the blending sponge.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t accidentally put too much makeup on.</li>
            <li> (I use Dawn as a gentle cleaner for this AND my makeup brushes.)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really expand either.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> The texture is much smoother</li>
            <li> Good deal if you use this for applying foundation, but that sucks up a lot of makeup.  </li>
            <li> but it applies the foundation on clearly and perfectly better than an actual brush.</li>
            <li> I ecpesicailly loved how it didn&#x27;t soak up a lot of your makeup and waste it!!  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I love this sponge</li>
            <li> and it works better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Even if you have to buy 2-3 of these sponges to last as long as one Beauty Blender, you still more than get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it compares to the actual beauty blender as I&#x27;ve never used one, but I like it and it works for what I need it to do at a great price.</li>
            <li> To clean it, I use water and regular Dawn dish liquid.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, and I had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find this one to be extra special except perhaps</li>
            <li> I jumped on the bandwagon and bought one to see what the big deal was but the blending sponges in a bag are just as good, is same material,and works the same as this one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also softer and squishier than the ebay ones, which in contrast have a smooth texture and feel dense when dry.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more for my personal use as well as my kit.</li>
            <li> My 10 cent sponge was a yellow one, since yellow isn&#x27;t a preferable color to most people (</li>
            <li> This sponge is super tiny and it does nothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These sponges bleed pink a little bit at first, but a good rinsing seems to have stopped it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of a high quality material.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the high end beauty blender</li>
            <li> The tiny package arrived nicely sealed in bubble wrap and the delivery was fast , I received the item way before the actual delivery date indicated , would definitely buy again !</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use the pointed end for the corners of my eyes, for make up or high lighter application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little bit more dense and not as \\&quot;soft\\&quot; for bouncing off the face.</li>
            <li> but I find that when it&#x27;s damp it works a little better.</li>
            <li> Not bad pretty cool a little smaller</li>
            <li> Really gives an even, soft finish.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase a few more.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t soft enough, even wet, to allow nice blending.</li>
            <li> My make up goes on looking more natural, without any brush strokes and without the mess of using my fingers to apply.</li>
            <li> for now ill see how my first one will hold up so far so good</li>
            <li> This is my second FantaSea cosmetic blending sponge because I&#x27;m afraid that they will hike up the $5 price once people realize how awesome it is!</li>
            <li> but when I use those foundations with this sponge, it makes my skin look very natural and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Will definitely get another once my first one is used up.</li>
            <li> It is soft, not hard like some reviews claim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going back and forth about spending the $20 on a new beauty blender because mine was pretty old.</li>
            <li> Okay..I personally am not too crazy about these type of sponges because first of all, I&#x27;m used to using my brushes, fingers and the wedge sponges in application--which I am happy with already.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s similar to a firm rubbery bouncy ball which isn&#x27;t very comfortable trying to apply foundation to to the face.</li>
            <li> I like to spray mine with a little moisturizing mist or even water lightly and blend my foundation in.</li>
            <li> It smooths and blends foundation nicely -- much better than the little sponges you can buy in bags in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little sponge!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a light pink and smaller than appeared</li>
            <li> THIS WAS SUPPOSE TO BE SOFT?</li>
            <li> seamlessly blending in my sunscreen-foundation combo - no streaks , no fuss.</li>
            <li> I dab a bit of foundation in different sections in my face and blend it out well with this product I really do like it</li>
            <li> This was purchased by my 15 year old daughter who saw it on a tutorial.  </li>
            <li> I have used the old style makeup sponges, but I have been using a brush to apply foundation for years now.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering a few more.</li>
            <li> this is good, it means less foundation is wasted and gets all gunky inside your sponge!  </li>
            <li> The only downside to this sponge is that I noticed I need to use more foundation than usual to build up to my desired coverage.</li>
            <li> My first one did tear after it&#x27;s third washing, but the same thing happens to the Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li> Not easy to find a place to store and keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than normal.</li>
            <li> If &amp;#34;aqua&amp;#34; is one of the first ingredients, don&#x27;t use this as a wet sponge.  </li>
            <li> My only concern it that the sponge takes up too much of the makeup and is hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and some foundations really emphasize my dry spots when I use a brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s definitely not as good as the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Not only make it easier to apply but the end result is a very natural and even foundation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works exactly how I expected it to!</li>
            <li> It split in half while I was running warm water over it, not pleased.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing make up sponge, they can be kinda expensive</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in the hopes of finding a cheaper alternative to the sephora beauty blender i have (although it works amazingly well its just too expensive).</li>
            <li> apparently because it&#x27;s water-based.</li>
            <li> Each one was to be sent to a different address since we live in different states.</li>
            <li> At less than $1 a piece it cost exactly what a sponge should.</li>
            <li> Also, it dries back to it&#x27;s original small size.</li>
            <li> It does bleed a little the first couple of time you wash it</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first</li>
            <li> IT WAS CHEAP BUT NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li> Great product, but took a bit longer that I would have wanted :(</li>
            <li> Ive washed it a few times and it seems to be holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li> The sponge is soft and can be used both damped and dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bit smaller than your average beauty blender, but for the price ot doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> It is to be used wet, but I have a Professional Make-up Tip for you!  </li>
            <li> I really like this little thing</li>
            <li> The sponge did flake a bit after I dug my thumb in too hard while cleaning it, but other than that, it does make my foundation application go so smoothly.</li>
            <li> The FantaSea Blending Sponges is harder to clean because of its hard texture.</li>
            <li> If you want to use this for water-based foundation/concealer, do not wet the sponge, wait until your foundation/concealer is almost dry and THEN use it to blend.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of other blending sponges shaped like this one or like the tear drop beauty blender, and this is by far the softest blending sponge I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what an actual beauty blender sponge is like to compare this to, but this sponge is pretty dense and hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it while soaking it first, so I am not sure how it works dry.</li>
            <li> and it barely got any bigger, which my eBay ones triple in size when they get wet.</li>
            <li> so its all a little new to me, i occasionally still use my finger</li>
            <li> It just sucked up my liquid makeup, and when I finally got enough on the sponge where it would actually go onto my face, it was too thick and didn&#x27;t blend it very well at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it, or I&#x27;d be really upset!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty small and when you wet it it stays the same size .</li>
            <li> If it holds up for a very long time I&#x27;ll come back and edit this review and change my star rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for such a cheap purchase.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad because that means it&#x27;s working better than a brush did, but I&#x27;ll probably either look for a larger sponge or just go back to using my fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time makeup sponge user</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a bit upset that it&#x27;s taking rather a long time for it to get here.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Seems similar to other sponges.</li>
            <li> it ring it out, did it dry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money this sponge is tiny and when I saw tiny</li>
            <li> Its your average beauty blender but all 3 sizes are all of the same.</li>
            <li> I tried using makeup cleanser liquid soap, I tried several other soaps and makeup removers but nothing got all the foundation out of it!</li>
            <li> This sponge has a similar texture to Sephora&#x27;s, but feels a bit denser and maybe absorbs even less product...</li>
            <li> I never thought that this little and inexpensive sponge was going to make such a difference on how your foundation looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I anticipated</li>
            <li> This sponge is in between hard and soft, but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I expected</li>
            <li> but i did receive it within the expected delivery date range.</li>
            <li> Only problem was that it started tearing/ falling apart after a few months.</li>
            <li> I received 4 in my order and it came faster then expected.</li>
            <li> money well spent</li>
            <li> I wet the sponge</li>
            <li> When the Fantasea sponge is wet it feels denser.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amour the lenght of one and 1/1 inches and about 5 cm wide .</li>
            <li> Choose carefully women/men .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it considering I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t puff up when wet.</li>
            <li> I wet</li>
            <li> , I never really got the result i wanted with makeup</li>
            <li> I wet it and squeeze out the excess water.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if I should have expected anything else from a piece of foam, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again nor recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> Very hard to clean, and a little stiff.</li>
            <li> not a hot pink like in the picture, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll eventually buy a new BB &amp; throw this sucker in the trash!  </li>
            <li> One for me and the other two for my sisters.</li>
            <li> I paid $.10 for one and $.85 for the other, so I got 2 sponges for $1.05.</li>
            <li> So small can actually use .</li>
            <li> But other than that, I have no complaints about the quality, or price.</li>
            <li> Other than that it does it job</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare the two since I&#x27;ve never owned the other, but I can say this one works alright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the big deal is about these type makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> It does not grow when wet!</li>
            <li> I havent mastered it yet, but i would recommend it verses paying 20.00 plus for the other one..</li>
            <li> Based on other review I did dampen the sponge when using and have not any any issues.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous that this product would have an odd odor, or not be pink, based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit hard</li>
            <li> So tiny and hard.</li>
            <li> Not worth my time</li>
            <li> If felt too small for my hand and it took a long time to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average for the prices I paid.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t bother me but the color of my sponge was a pale pink</li>
            <li> I mean tiny !!!</li>
            <li> i just recieved this and being a crazy makeup addict i tryed it right away</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always tough because if not applied properly or with the proper makeup tools it can look uneven and leave streaks an lines on your face!</li>
            <li> I noticed that I have less problems with my foundation transferring off my face onto tissues or something.</li>
            <li> I soaked it and a bunch of black spots appeared.  </li>
            <li> NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stiffer too .</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t wash it after every use, it starts shedding and little bits of the sponge come off every once in awhile when I use it.</li>
            <li> but it does work for small areas on face but other</li>
            <li> This little sponge blends my foundation to perfection.</li>
            <li> I get it damp with water before putting a little foundation on it and this thing allows me to apply my makeup a little at a time so that I don&#x27;t look splotchy or uneven</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bay hard and a little bit rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> sponges, I think, waste the products.</li>
            <li> Seems like a waste of product to me.</li>
            <li> The sponge if firm without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> However, some days I feel like the layer is just too heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Too hard and stiff even when wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firmer than the beauty blender but for less than 2 bucks I&#x27;m not sure you can expect a lot.</li>
            <li> Worked well, kinda stiff almost like a nerf ball, but looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and usually putting foundation on is a chore</li>
            <li> too dense, harsh and small</li>
            <li> I read the reviews saying this was soft and conforms to your skin, but I was mislead as it&#x27;s quite hard and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> However it is a little hard to wash.</li>
            <li> It arrive a little late</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sponge, not magic.  </li>
            <li> usually takes a while.</li>
            <li> It was a total fail.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite small-</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the sponge or my makeup</li>
            <li> but there was a small problem sponge</li>
            <li> But the quality is not very good (I suppose as compared to the beauty blender) since some of the material has began to drop from the bottom.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too small and hard...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not soft because that was the number one thing I was looking for and the beauty blender is way too expensive in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This makeup sponge is ridiculously hard and dense, and doesn&#x27;t expand at all when damp... if you&#x27;re looking for a Beauty Blender dupe, this is not the thing for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too hard and doesn&#x27;t soften at all even when ran under water like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Hard to cleanse.</li>
            <li> Was hard to get my foundation and concealer to blend with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use and I hardly use it , I rather use my fingers</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to compare.  </li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t spend money on the name brand.</li>
            <li> In one wash its got broken pieces out won&#x27;t waste Ur money</li>
            <li> In the mean time I&#x27;ll keep this one for traveling.</li>
            <li> It was sooo small and very hard to blend , it wasnt even spongy</li>
            <li> but i hate the fact you can&#x27;t  wash the makeup  off of it so that all bad for me i tried  so many  times</li>
            <li> Hard and tough to work with.</li>
            <li> but that is the only bad thing.</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock!</li>
            <li> It SUCKS!  </li>
            <li> One caveat-I have brown skin, and my foundation has stained the sponge which is ugly looking, but to be expected.</li>
            <li> It gets the makeup out of the sponge without leaving a residue or irritating my face.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I hate the uneven caked &amp;#34;girl</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Im not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> The sponge is very tough feeling on my skin and seems to soak up the makeup instead of blending it on my face.</li>
            <li> its too small and blends horribly dont buy this</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the bad news.</li>
            <li> Ultimately I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I tried it as soon as I got it and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This sponge does a pretty great job when you&#x27;re applying your foundation or concealer. I don&#x27;t own the beauty blender but I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of other blending sponges shaped like this one or like the tear drop beauty blender, and this is by far the softest blending sponge I&#x27;ve used. I have combination skin and some foundations really emphasize my dry spots when I use a brush but when I use those foundations with this sponge, it makes my skin look very natural and hydrated. This sponge really makes my foundation blend into my skin as in I noticed that I have less problems with my foundation transferring off my face onto tissues or something. The only downside to this sponge is that I noticed I need to use more foundation than usual to build up to my desired coverage. Other than that, I love this sponge and I would repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I learned about this sponge on a beauty blog I read and decided to try it. I&#x27;m really glad I did because this sponge is the best. It blends the makeup in so smoothly and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I gave it a 2 for the reason  its cheap but i hate the fact you can&#x27;t  wash the makeup  off of it so that all bad for me i tried  so many  times but i just  couldn&#x27;t  but aye you get for what you pay</li>
            <li> In one wash its got broken pieces out won&#x27;t waste Ur money</li>
            <li> Very hard to clean, and a little stiff. It was okay.</li>
            <li> Not bad pretty cool a little smaller then I expected</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the previous reviews to flawlessly apply foundation, and it works like a dream. When wet It is extremely soft and expands to twice. It doesn&#x27;t soak up too much water &amp; become heavy. Also, it dries back to it&#x27;s original small size. It blends makeup products smoothly onto my face. Even when I don&#x27;t use the sponge to apply my foundation, I&#x27;ll roll it over my face after using a brush to smooth everything. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for medium or full coverage application on its own. One caveat-I have brown skin, and my foundation has stained the sponge which is ugly looking, but to be expected. At less than $1 a piece it cost exactly what a sponge should. I plan to purchase a few more.</li>
            <li> I love this blending sponge! Perfect for concealer! Tip: dampen before use!</li>
            <li> its too small and blends horribly dont buy this</li>
            <li> It arrive a little late but it&#x27;s a great product. This is perfect it make my sling look so natural.</li>
            <li> Good dupe for the beauty blender, this one is just more firm, which I find gives heavier coverage, still without weighting down the skin. Get this product damp before use and you can sheer out your makeup, but be forewarned, the sponge needs to be rinse fairly though ought as it does release some of its pink color on the first uses otherwise.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to the beauty blender, probably even better because of its shape. Has great bounce and is very soft, price is great, and quality is great also. Ive washed it a few times and it seems to be holding up pretty well. I will definitely be ordering more for my personal use as well as my kit.It took a while for the company to actually ship the product but i did receive it within the expected delivery date range. Buy a few, the price is great and its probably the best Beauty Blender dupe out there</li>
            <li> This makeup sponge is ridiculously hard and dense, and doesn&#x27;t expand at all when damp... if you&#x27;re looking for a Beauty Blender dupe, this is not the thing for you. Shipping also took forever.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to be, if you&#x27;ve ever seen a makeup sponge. Its great quality for the price, and is great for thick foundations, which I always use. Easy to clean (I just use warm water and soap once/week) and doesn&#x27;t break down when you clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No negatives to report. Give it a try :)</li>
            <li> It was very cheap and I love the product! It was my first time trying this sponge and I think it works a lot better than a regular foundation brush. Definitely purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the real Beauty Blender so I can&#x27;t compare, but this product wasn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li> Works well, not as squishy and bouncing as I&#x27;d like. But very good dupe for the $20 beauty blender!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sponge, not magic.  Good deal if you use this for applying foundation, but that sucks up a lot of makeup.  Brushes work better for that.  I do like the pointy part for getting in corners.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy one of these sponges to find out what the big hoopla was about. The seller sent it on time and that was great. Now, after using it once to blend in my foundation, I decided to wash it out. Wrong. I tried using makeup cleanser liquid soap, I tried several other soaps and makeup removers but nothing got all the foundation out of it! I honestly didnt see any difference when applying with this. The only good thing I can see is that you can use the pointed end to apply in the corners of your eyes. It is soft, not hard like some reviews claim.</li>
            <li> This sponge does the job. But the quality is not very good (I suppose as compared to the beauty blender) since some of the material has began to drop from the bottom.</li>
            <li> love the ergonomic shape of the sponge. its durable and easy to clean...spreads the foundation well. its a must have beauty tool</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 beauty blenders. One for me and the other two for my sisters. Each one was to be sent to a different address since we live in different states. Neither of us has recieved our blender. I contacted the seller and they said they must have gotten lost.... really? All three of them. They keep arguing with me. Not worth my time I want my money back.</li>
            <li> This so called blending sponge cracked and split 3 days after I used it. I just ran water from the faucet on it  By running water on the sponge you apply your foundation with a thinner application. I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It works just as a regular blender, the only difference is that it&#x27;s way cheaper. I love it and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I personally am not a fan of these blender sponges. It&#x27;s way too hard and doesn&#x27;t soften at all even when ran under water like others I have tried. I feel like it&#x27;s similar to a firm rubbery bouncy ball which isn&#x27;t very comfortable trying to apply foundation to to the face. These do not blend very well but luckily it was cheap so no big loss. Onto the next sponge to try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on instagram and I&#x27;ve seen so many MUA&#x27;s using this tool. I hate the uneven caked &amp;#34;girl you have a line&amp;#34; showing where your make up starts and stops look. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the full amount for the real product therefore I bought a generic one online. Let me tell you the material doesn&#x27;t feel generic or cheap. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and usually putting foundation on is a chore ha! I love using it though. Even though it took a month to get here from China to California I won&#x27;t dock any stars. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Smelled like chemicals/rubber when I first got it but it was fun using this to blend my make up. I have also purchased the Beauty Blender and the Sonia Kashuk make up sponge. The FantaSea Blending Sponges is harder to clean because of its hard texture. More pressing and blending is required. However, when using this sponge to apply foundation it leaves me without streaks if well blended. I always get compliments on my makeup when I use a blending sponge. With this sponge more arm muscle, patience, and time is needed. I cant say its a must have but I do enjoy having it. Best of luck.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Great product works well</li>
            <li> Hard to cleanse. If felt too small for my hand and it took a long time to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Worked well for blending and was definitely worth the price and more! Only problem was that it started tearing/ falling apart after a few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works exactly how I expected it to! Durable, doesn&#x27;t tear, easy to wash, it&#x27;s everything I needed and more.</li>
            <li> It is a good item for the price. I received 4 in my order and it came faster then expected. I would recommend this item to a friend. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper then a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Crappy. It doesn&#x27;t work in the slightest. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> blends makeup very well</li>
            <li> I was going to use it for my foundation but it&#x27;s too small and hard...so I use it for my liquid blush instead but that&#x27;s all I use it for.</li>
            <li> nice, blends makeup very well, works just as well as the ones more expensive. money well spent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s definitely not as good as the real beauty blender. It&#x27;s pretty small and when you wet it it stays the same size . It&#x27;s a little stiffer too . It does the job but I like the original one more</li>
            <li> I havent used the brand name beauty blender so i cant compare the two. However this dupe is amazing, it blends the foundation perfect in my opinion, gives a flawless finish and the price is awesome. So Im ordering more soon get for back up.</li>
            <li> This blending sponge is fantastic!!!  Everything was great about this!!  I ecpesicailly loved how it didn&#x27;t soak up a lot of your makeup and waste it!!  This didn&#x27;t bother me but the color of my sponge was a pale pink not a hot pink like in the picture, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, and I had high hopes for it. Before I heard of this sponge, I ordered 2 very similar sponges from eBay. I paid $.10 for one and $.85 for the other, so I got 2 sponges for $1.05. I didn&#x27;t expect much out of those and it turns out that I love them. If you don&#x27;t like this sponge, do yourself a favor and go on eBay and search &amp;#34;makeup sponge&amp;#34; and set the filter lowest price to highest price. You&#x27;ll find a bunch of cheap beauty blender type sponges listed. My 10 cent sponge was a yellow one, since yellow isn&#x27;t a preferable color to most people (just a tip.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to this product. Upon getting this and opening my envelope it came in, I noticed that this sponge is quite porous. It&#x27;s also softer and squishier than the ebay ones, which in contrast have a smooth texture and feel dense when dry. I wet the sponge and it barely got any bigger, which my eBay ones triple in size when they get wet. When the Fantasea sponge is wet it feels denser. I tried it on my face with a really light concealer to test how much it would absorb or blend it, and to my dismay, it absorbed it more than anything. I also tried my foundation which the eBay sponges blend beautifully. That was absorbed quite a bit as well by the Fantasea sponge. So, save your money and try out an Ebay sponge before dropping a buck extra on this one. Ultimately I&#x27;m disappointed. Also, the shipping took quite a while, but I realize anything you order that ships from Singapore, China.. etc. usually takes a while.</li>
            <li> I use this every day to apply my foundation.  A light spray with some water and it blends flawlessly, so much better than my fingers.  I&#x27;m very happy I bought this instead of the more expensive beauty blender.  Would definitely recommend, and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought this was suppose to last after washing the makeup off it two times it started to fall apart. It&#x27;s in the garbage. Made of cheaper material, I brought more from a different maker</li>
            <li> This sponge is as good as beauty blender. Really gives an even, soft finish. It&#x27;s made of a high quality material.</li>
            <li> Sucked up all my makeup. Was hard to get my foundation and concealer to blend with this. Very disappointed. Will not be using or purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wring all the water out or it won&#x27;t work right. Using warm water helps your foundation spread out. Bouncing it is key!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love these. They aren&#x27;t soft enough, even wet, to allow nice blending. Other than that, quality is good - won&#x27;t tear easily. Shipping was s l o w.</li>
            <li> Love how this beauty blender works. Works just like the original one. The only thing it took a while to get to me because of where it was coming from.</li>
            <li> Must buy! Beautifully blended my makeup!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for the price. It works just as well as the expensive ones. However it is a little hard to wash.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and she is a makeup fanatic she likes high quality items and these were perfect she really enjoyed this item</li>
            <li> I THIUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSE TO BE SOFT? NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. IT WAS CHEAP BUT NOT GOOD. DO NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and it was in perfect conditions. I am truly satisfied with it. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a nice blending sponge. Not sure if it compares to the actual beauty blender as I&#x27;ve never used one, but I like it and it works for what I need it to do at a great price.</li>
            <li> Okay..I personally am not too crazy about these type of sponges because first of all, I&#x27;m used to using my brushes, fingers and the wedge sponges in application--which I am happy with already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges, I think, waste the products.</li>
            <li> It does the job great, the only problem i&#x27;d have to say about it is the smell, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> So small can actually use . It&#x27;s hard to use and I hardly use it , I rather use my fingers it&#x27;s amour the lenght of one and 1/1 inches and about 5 cm wide . Choose carefully women/men .</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering this to save some money, but quickly realized I was better off buying the real thing.  This sponge is in no way a dupe for the beauty blender.  It didn&#x27;t even change sizes when I soaked it in water.  It was a total fail.  And bear in mind I waited over two weeks for this to arrive in the mail.</li>
            <li> Smoothes my foundation perfectly onto my dry nose.</li>
            <li> Too hard and stiff even when wet. Best use is to buff not apply makeup like beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Absorbent but not bouncy. Great deal for its price but I&#x27;d much rather spend more money on a better investment.</li>
            <li> Love this thing!  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it considering I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person but it was recommended by a friend.  I use it to blend shadows, blush, foundation, etc. and it&#x27;s really easy to clean. The foam is a dense material and holds it shape well.  I&#x27;ve washed it with warm water and soap once and it didn&#x27;t crack, flake or fall apart.  Will definitely get another once my first one is used up.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the high end beauty blender but this was my first beauty blender type sponge and it works better than I expected! It leaves my skin looking flawless and makes for a quick application. The price is amazing!</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a bit bigger but it applies the foundation on clearly and perfectly better than an actual brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect for such a good price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what an actual beauty blender sponge is like to compare this to, but this sponge is pretty dense and hard. It does create a nice finish and has held up to numerous washings. My only concern is the amount of liquid foundation the sponge actually is soaking up instead of transferring onto my face. Seems like a waste of product to me.</li>
            <li> Great product, but took a bit longer that I would have wanted :( But other than that, I have no complaints about the quality, or price.</li>
            <li> GREAT product. It is exactly like the one I paid $10 for.  Blends great. I WILL BE GETTING MORE.thank you.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews saying this was soft and conforms to your skin, but I was mislead as it&#x27;s quite hard and uncomfortable to use. Other than that it does it job okay but not too happy with the fact it&#x27;s not soft because that was the number one thing I was looking for and the beauty blender is way too expensive in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try using a blending sponge because I use my fingers to apply my BB cream, but let&#x27;s face it- I&#x27;m a cheapskate and didn&#x27;t want to shell out the big bucks for a Beauty Blender. I can&#x27;t compare the two since I&#x27;ve never owned the other, but I can say this one works alright. I do have to use slightly more BB cream than I did before, though- apparently because it&#x27;s water-based. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting but it&#x27;s quite small- maybe the length of my pinky. I thought it&#x27;d be something I could hold in my whole hand rather than between two fingers. The size makes it kind of flimsy. If I still used normal foundation, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d notice a difference because the coverage is heavier, but the BB cream I use has light coverage. Because of that, I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in how nice it looks applied to my face with my fingers vs the sponge. This isn&#x27;t bad because that means it&#x27;s working better than a brush did, but I&#x27;ll probably either look for a larger sponge or just go back to using my fingers.</li>
            <li> I like this handy , little makeup tool...it works really well ...seamlessly blending in my sunscreen-foundation combo - no streaks , no fuss. The tiny package arrived nicely sealed in bubble wrap and the delivery was fast , I received the item way before the actual delivery date indicated , would definitely buy again !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average for the prices I paid. In order to keep it in good shape, I have to wash it after every use (which I didn&#x27;t do), but it puts on my foundation nicely. Since I didn&#x27;t wash it after every use, it starts shedding and little bits of the sponge come off every once in awhile when I use it. I plan to keep.</li>
            <li> It is of the same quality of my much more pricey Beauty Blender.  Works wonderfully but it did take a while to get but for the price I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty good it took awhile to get here but for the price it was worth the wait</li>
            <li> Its your average beauty blender but all 3 sizes are all of the same. They are sooooo tiny but it does blend perfectly and make your highlighting and contouring more natural. 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a dollar so it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss.  I soaked it and a bunch of black spots appeared.  I threw it away because I wasn&#x27;t going to risk putting it on my face, don&#x27;t know what the spots were.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Hard and tough to work with. I would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> The sponge is designed to keep the makeup smooth on your face ; it does. My only concern it that the sponge takes up too much of the makeup and is hard to clean. The sponge if firm without being abrasive. Good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful! I like to experiment a lot with what I use on my face and what works best and this is really great! Some people say its &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; but if you watch any makeup tutorial that uses this, they will say to dampen it first. Don&#x27;t pay $20 or more for a beauty blender when you can buy the exact same thing for a couple bucks. BUY IT!:)</li>
            <li> I never thought that this little and inexpensive sponge was going to make such a difference on how your foundation looks. Not only make it easier to apply but the end result is a very natural and even foundation</li>
            <li> I actually really like these. I cannot give it a fair comparison to the beauty blender, considering that I have not purchased one before. The sponge did flake a bit after I dug my thumb in too hard while cleaning it, but other than that, it does make my foundation application go so smoothly. Fast shipping! I was satisfied, so I ordered 2 more. Can&#x27;t go wrong for such a cheap purchase.</li>
            <li> Smaller than normal. Doesn&#x27;t puff up when wet.</li>
            <li> its smaller than i thought but works just fine. i hadnt used one ever so its all a little new to me, i occasionally still use my finger lol</li>
            <li> too dense, harsh and small</li>
            <li> I love this - it is adorable!  The shape makes it very easy to grasp.  It smooths and blends foundation nicely -- much better than the little sponges you can buy in bags in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> It was sooo small and very hard to blend , it wasnt even spongy</li>
            <li> Blends nicely!! I use it to blend my bb cream and it does a flawless job. It&#x27;s great, try it!!</li>
            <li> Ehh, I prefer the Beauty Blender. This works okay, but it&#x27;s not as good as the Blender. It&#x27;s very dense and somehow doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. I prefer a more natural look and think the Beauty Blender does a better job.</li>
            <li> Today i received the product. .. Its amazing.. its so soft and makes the foundation feel like second skin.. it doesnt absorb much foundation.. nice product.. ive never seen my make up being so flawless before...</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is what is on description. I enjoyed it. Good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no Beauty Blender, but it does it&#x27;s job! It leaves me with an airbrushed look to my foundation. The pointy end is great for getting around your nose and eyes. Make sure to wash this, because it will breed bacteria and develop a smell.</li>
            <li> Good product. Just not for me</li>
            <li> I like to consider myself a makeup guru and I&#x27;ve used all sorts of brushes and application techniques so of course I wanted to try the glorious Beauty Blender. I just wasn&#x27;t interested in spending the money. After finding the FantaSea sponge I decided to give it a try and I am absolutely in love with it. It blends absolutely flawlessly and I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my makeup. The only the I don&#x27;t like is the constant bouncing motion you have to do in order to blend but that&#x27;s neither here nor there. I&#x27;ll def be ordering more!</li>
            <li> The sponge is starting to tear apart just 2 months after purchasing it. I have no clue what the real-deal-expensive one feels like; reviewers said it was super soft. This sponge is in between hard and soft, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping took FOREVER!!! Almost 3 weeks from the time I ordered it, but what can I expect when I buy something from China?</li>
            <li> Good price and a great addition to your makeup supplies! Found this at a much better price on Amazon than in the stores. I would definitely recommend this to others out there. I definitely found this sponge to be more effective at applying makeup than flat sponges I have tried out from drugstores.</li>
            <li> This is a great, general make up sponge.  It is to be used wet, but I have a Professional Make-up Tip for you!  If you are wearing a water-based foundation or concealer, do NOT use a sponge blender!  If &amp;#34;aqua&amp;#34; is one of the first ingredients, don&#x27;t use this as a wet sponge.  It will soak up your product with it.  This is perfect for oil or silicone-based foundations, perfect for blending, gives and air-brushed finish.  If you want to use this for water-based foundation/concealer, do not wet the sponge, wait until your foundation/concealer is almost dry and THEN use it to blend.  Works wonders.  I love using these sponges for my clients.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much. Use daily of course for makeup application. This product was stated as it really is. Thank you</li>
            <li> I first saw this on youtubes gossmakeupartist. He constantly raved about the beauty blender so was very pleased when I found the same for me. Much better for me than a brush for foundation and much better than your fingers in blending. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I rate this a three star because is not as soft as the original it&#x27;s a little bay hard and a little bit rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product works the same as the real beauty blended. Such a great thing to have And for the price I feel like I should purchase a lot more but for now ill see how my first one will hold up so far so good and I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Makes my skin flake and doesn&#x27;t go on smooth. I will keep my avon brush that I purchased for very cheap.</li>
            <li> These give flawless foundation finish. I even use it to apply under eye concealer and it makes sure everything is blended and seamless. Even when damp they are still easy to handle. I love them!</li>
            <li> best dupe for a beauty blender. save yourself $15 and get this one instead. its incredibly soft and easy to wash. im on my 2nd sponge.</li>
            <li> This works great especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry, or when I want a bit more sheer coverage. It&#x27;s easy to hold/grip, and gets into the eye corners easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going back and forth about spending the $20 on a new beauty blender because mine was pretty old. I love the airbrush effect that a dampened blending sponge gives me, but $20 is pretty steep. This is my second FantaSea cosmetic blending sponge because I&#x27;m afraid that they will hike up the $5 price once people realize how awesome it is! I use it damp to blend my liquid foundation and it really does make all the difference. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing make up sponge, they can be kinda expensive though.&lt;br /&gt;But, nonetheless they are worth every dime. I reccommend them to make up artists, or just for anyone who wears foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, and great five star product. :)</li>
            <li> This sponge is pretty good! It&#x27;s just a little bit more dense and not as \\&quot;soft\\&quot; for bouncing off the face. It disperses and dilutes the product just a touch more than beauty blender does, but on a budget, this is your cosmetic sponge! If you need more control and a professional edge, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than the real beauty blender, though.</li>
            <li> MEH! Im not impressed at all. The sponge is very tough feeling on my skin and seems to soak up the makeup instead of blending it on my face. Im better off with a long hair makeup brush. I wet it ring it out, did it dry, nothing made it work to my expectations.</li>
            <li> This sponge it too hard and not bouncy to get the job done perfectly. Did not blend my foundation but smudged it!! I utterly don&#x27;t recommend this for any one!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me though.  Felt like I was wasting so much make up in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the big deal is about these type makeup sponges. People on the internet act like they are the best thing since sliced bread. I&#x27;m a long time makeup sponge user and I don&#x27;t find this one to be extra special except perhaps that it&#x27;s dense, rinses clean, and has a point to get into nooks around the nose and eyes. If it holds up for a very long time I&#x27;ll come back and edit this review and change my star rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> So glad i got this sponge, I never really got the result i wanted with makeup so i ended up just not wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;But when i used this sponge the coverage i got was flawless and perfect, It gives an all around even coverage without looking cakey. I also love the way this sponge feels on my skin, no complaints so far! it really makes me feel confident because it helps me apply makeup better.&lt;br /&gt;you can use it as a blush, highlighter, coverup, powder, bronzer and it all works great. I would suggest gently cleaning it with water and soap and rinsing it out after every use so the sponge lasts longer and you get rid of bacteria that could cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you probably wont regret buying this, i cant do my makeup without it and my skin looks amazing after i finish my makeup all because of this sponge.</li>
            <li> Beauty Blender: $20&lt;br /&gt;This sponge: &amp;#62;$2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the shape of this sponge to the Beauty Blender and, honestly, it holds up almost as well.  My first one did tear after it&#x27;s third washing, but the same thing happens to the Beauty Blender.  Even if you have to buy 2-3 of these sponges to last as long as one Beauty Blender, you still more than get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This sponge is super tiny and it does nothing. Don&#x27;t spend your $ on this just buy the actual beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Amazing price works exactly the same as the $20 ones</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup addict &amp; enjoy makin other &#x27;s feel happy about themselfs with a lil makeup ! (:&lt;br /&gt;With foundation it&#x27;s always tough because if not applied properly or with the proper makeup tools it can look uneven and leave streaks an lines on your face! What I liked about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t do that it actually worked pretty well for me I dab a bit of foundation in different sections in my face and blend it out well with this product I really do like it and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase !</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the shape of the sponge is different. It looks like a tear drop, but it works just as fine.</li>
            <li> I really like this thing for my eyes. Everywhere else you get a nice even distribution of makeup as well. However, some days I feel like the layer is just too heavy. I&#x27;ve only used it while soaking it first, so I am not sure how it works dry. Anyway, around the eyes, awesome.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in the hopes of finding a cheaper alternative to the sephora beauty blender i have (although it works amazingly well its just too expensive). overall this is an ok sponge. if you are trying to compare it with the sephora bb ill let you know this sponge is not as bouncy and soaks up more water. if you&#x27;re just trying to find a decent makeup blending sponge, this one is nice for the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived when said it will and looks exactly like pictured. However, after I am done &amp;#34;Blending&amp;#34; it looks like the sponge took all of my coverup and didn&#x27;t blend it at all. Not sure if it is the sponge or my makeup (I use the &#x27;BB cream) it is cute though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a bit upset that it&#x27;s taking rather a long time for it to get here.&lt;br /&gt;But then, I guess it&#x27;s understandable if it&#x27;s from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need to wait for it to get here, once it does I will definitely try it out!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this when I receive and try the sponge out.&lt;br /&gt;So, hopefully it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;The rating will still be set at a 2 stars for now.</li>
            <li> I like it but it seems to rub the makeup off instead of blend it. Maybe I don&#x27;t use it right.</li>
            <li> I really like this little thing but I must add a Word of Caution: When rinsing after washing your blending sponge, squeeze out as much water as you can without twisting/wringing the blending sponge. I just broke mine. :-( That&#x27;s the bad news. The oh-so-very-good news is that this sponge applies my foundation flawlessly. I get it damp with water before putting a little foundation on it and this thing allows me to apply my makeup a little at a time so that I don&#x27;t look splotchy or uneven and I don&#x27;t accidentally put too much makeup on. My makeup goes on nice and smooth! The wide part is good for large areas like the cheeks, jawline, and forehead. The pointed end is for under the eyes and around the nose. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for the original blending sponge that&#x27;s out there and this knock-off works wonders. I own three of these now.  To clean it, I use water and regular Dawn dish liquid. (I use Dawn as a gentle cleaner for this AND my makeup brushes.) It gets the makeup out of the sponge without leaving a residue or irritating my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and it&#x27;s amazing. I have a beauty blender for my pro kit and it fell apart after only the second cleaning. I am very pleased with the FantaSea blending sponge and will be buyging more for myself and my pro kit.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for foundation and blending your concealer. I like to spray mine with a little moisturizing mist or even water lightly and blend my foundation in. If you have not tried this, you need to!!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing like the beauty blender.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is a good sponge I liked it but there was a small problem sponge is different from picture it&#x27;s a light pink and smaller than appeared but it does work for small areas on face but other than that goos product works fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit hard but if I really want a flawless look I&#x27;ll use a flat top first then used that to blend it out. It looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This little sponge blends my foundation to perfection. It does bleed a little the first couple of time you wash it but that is the only bad thing. The sponge is soft and can be used both damped and dry but I find that when it&#x27;s damp it works a little better. I can not wait to compare it to my beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money this sponge is tiny and when I saw tiny I mean tiny !!!</li>
            <li> No stars if i could!!! Idk how this has any good ratings at all!!!!! So tiny and hard. It does not grow when wet!</li>
            <li> It seems like everyone in the makeup world has these. I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is, but it is really good for putting powder or liquid foundation under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Well I lke to rub my foundation inn with my fingers yea Ino dats soo RATCHECT BUT not no more this is my first time buying it I hope it do me sum gud. Lets see I will hit yall back upp. With my honest reveiw.later BABYS DOLL&#x27;S</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the beauty blender sponge so I can&#x27;t compare them but this sponge works really well to blend foundation pretty much flawlessly. I will definitely be ordering a few more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little sponge!! i have a bunch of foundation brushes that i have used and nothing gives me look like this does. I was a little worried at first and I tried it the min i got it in the mail its amazing i wont use anything else!</li>
            <li> I jumped on the bandwagon and bought one to see what the big deal was but the blending sponges in a bag are just as good, is same material,and works the same as this one. I guess you need to be a make up artist to see the difference?</li>
            <li> Worked well, kinda stiff almost like a nerf ball, but looks nothing like the picture. Didn&#x27;t really expand either.  It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of Sephora&#x27;s red makeup sponges, but wanted to find an Amazon sponge source because I can&#x27;t get out of Sephora without spending $100.  This sponge has a similar texture to Sephora&#x27;s, but feels a bit denser and maybe absorbs even less product...this is good, it means less foundation is wasted and gets all gunky inside your sponge!  I use it with cheap-o Maybelline Fit foundation and love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges bleed pink a little bit at first, but a good rinsing seems to have stopped it.</li>
            <li> For the price I didn&#x27;t have super high hopes for this sponge but it works OK. It&#x27;s no beauty blender dupe but it&#x27;s pretty soft. I ran it under water and squeezed it a bunch of times and it didn&#x27;t get any bigger. It&#x27;s firmer than the beauty blender but for less than 2 bucks I&#x27;m not sure you can expect a lot. I have found the bliss sponges are a great dupe for the BB. In the mean time I&#x27;ll keep this one for traveling.</li>
            <li> Excellent been using for nearly two years!</li>
            <li> I was nervous that this product would have an odd odor, or not be pink, based on other reviews.  Neither of those concerns were true.  The sponge works well for applying foundation, although I haven&#x27;t tried the name brand Beauty Blender so it&#x27;s hard to compare.  It&#x27;s a little smaller than I anticipated but it&#x27;s still a good overall product.</li>
            <li> I saw a make up artist recommend this product so I had to try it.  I love it!  I wet it and squeeze out the excess water.  Then I dab my make up on with the fat end of the sponge.  I use the pointed end for the corners of my eyes, for make up or high lighter application.  My make up goes on looking more natural, without any brush strokes and without the mess of using my fingers to apply.</li>
            <li> works just as good as the beauty blender..I havent mastered it yet, but i would recommend it verses paying 20.00 plus for the other one..</li>
            <li> This was purchased by my 15 year old daughter who saw it on a tutorial.  She gets it damp and it works great for applying make-up evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that I went with this one because of the great price attached and it works just as good as the more expensive one. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it does what it needs to do, it did start to smell a bit funky after the 2 time of use, after a good wash it was ok again.</li>
            <li> I got my order earlier then it saud which i was really happy bout &amp; it apply my foundation really good. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I have a Beauty Blender &amp; it was starting to rip, that&#x27;s why I bought this one.  It SUCKS!  In fact, I have gone back to using my cracking Beauty Blender.  I&#x27;ll eventually buy a new BB &amp; throw this sucker in the trash!  At least I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it, or I&#x27;d be really upset!  Spend the extra money and get a Beauty Blender!!!</li>
            <li> Love this I use it damp with my foundation and it seems flawless</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Nothing like the real beauty blender. Hard as a rock!</li>
            <li> Really like this product! It blends beautifully and cleaning is very easy. It&#x27;s just a bit smaller than your average beauty blender, but for the price ot doesn&#x27;t really matter. Shipping took forever...</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s okay, I love it</li>
            <li> I have used the old style makeup sponges, but I have been using a brush to apply foundation for years now. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because of all the hype. I still prefer my brush. The texture is much smoother and I get better coverage. At least I didn&#x27;t spend money on the name brand.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is more of a hype item than a practical item. I tried it as soon as I got it and was disappointed. It just sucked up my liquid makeup, and when I finally got enough on the sponge where it would actually go onto my face, it was too thick and didn&#x27;t blend it very well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I should have expected anything else from a piece of foam, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again nor recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> i just recieved this and being a crazy makeup addict i tryed it right away and i cant belive how amazing this is! 10x better than the original and cheaper! better than my 32$ tarte brush better than anything i have im going to buy 10 more lol!</li>
            <li> The best makeup sponge ever.  Kind of huge, though.  Not easy to find a place to store and keep clean.  But I do love it!!!</li>
            <li> This sponge has met all my expectations.  It blends perfectly.  Based on other review I did dampen the sponge when using and have not any any issues.  I had been searching around for a sponge and went with this one based on price and reviews and I am not disappointed.  Love it!! v</li>
            <li> does not blend nicely</li>
            <li> Seems similar to other sponges. I didnt really see a great difference but that might be because I am not using it properly.</li>
            <li> As a makeup sponge this works well, but mine fell apart during the first time I washed it. It split in half while I was running warm water over it, not pleased.</li>
