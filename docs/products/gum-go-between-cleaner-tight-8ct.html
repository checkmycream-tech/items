            <li>Gets in between your teeth better than floss.</li>
            <li>Way better than a toothpick for discrete cleaning of teeth.</li>
            <li>so you can reach all teeth easily.  </li>
            <li>but they break easy.</li>
            <li>I really like the GUM Go Between cleaners a lot better than the plastic pics that I&#x27;ve been using  for years!</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite dental product!  </li>
            <li>This product is great especially with braces.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that they have their own covers and are reusable.</li>
            <li>I like having the cap fit on the bottom</li>
            <li>I still floss but these brushes help me keep my teeth free of all debris.</li>
            <li>I now alternate between using these great Go-Between cleaners and using the threader and floss to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>and I love them very much.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact they have different widths and that they have their own caps to cover the bristles.</li>
            <li>so you cannot clean between teeth - do not buy it</li>
            <li>I love these so much,</li>
            <li>four times a year instead of the normal two times for most people.  </li>
            <li>These are really great for making sure tight interdental spaces are extra clean.</li>
            <li>These are also able to be used more than once, unlike a toothpick or other type of plastic pick product.  </li>
            <li>These are just right.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>I love that I can choose from different sizes to accommodate the spacing between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I much prefer my Go-Between days!</li>
            <li>Now, my grandkids can say, &amp;#34;Grandma, what pretty teeth you have!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The tight style works best for me and my teeth, but they do make other sizes.  </li>
            <li>So much easier than flossing</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery would order again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold on these proxabrushes--they get to places where neither a sonic toothbrush nor floss can and really help my gums.  </li>
            <li>My evening routine is not complete without them, and purchasing them on Amazon makes it really easy to have them always on hand.</li>
            <li>I like the new longer handles better than the previous version.</li>
            <li>Worth it, especially if you can get them on sale.  </li>
            <li>Several years ago, I began looking for something I could use on the go to help me keep my teeth much cleaner between hygienist visits.  </li>
            <li>These bend much too easily and do not really get into tight spaces.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very tightly packed, and these tiny brushes can fit into all but one space in my mouth.</li>

            <li> Great dental aid. I like the new longer handles better than the previous version. Gets particles out from between teeth even after brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> So much easier than flossing</li>
            <li> These are the best brand of Between Teeth Cleaners our there.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great. Have been using Gum for years now. Fast delivery would order again.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for cleaning in between teeth.  Use them every night.  Love the fact they have different widths and that they have their own caps to cover the bristles.</li>
            <li> These bend much too easily and do not really get into tight spaces.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I got along without them!!!</li>
            <li> These are great for your teeth.  Their easier and a lot quicker than dental floss.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the GUM go between. It has a flexible tip so you cannot clean between teeth - do not buy it</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop making these. I&#x27;ve used GUM products for many years. These are really great for making sure tight interdental spaces are extra clean.</li>
            <li> This product is great especially with braces.</li>
            <li> These little gems are sometimes not available at my grocer&#x27;s, and I don&#x27;t relish the idea of driving around from store to store to find them; but I do believe they are key to dental hygiene and overall health. My teeth are very tightly packed, and these tiny brushes can fit into all but one space in my mouth. Even after using dental floss nightly, I still manage to remove additional debris with the GUM Go Betweens. My dental hygienist said they give my gums a good massage as well as a cleaning. My evening routine is not complete without them, and purchasing them on Amazon makes it really easy to have them always on hand.</li>
            <li> I really like the GUM Go Between cleaners a lot better than the plastic pics that I&#x27;ve been using  for years! I got the tight ones. I really like the fact that they have their own covers and are reusable. Yes-- I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> Excellent price. Better than floss for cleaning in between teeth. Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> These teeth cleaners are excellent and fit between most of my teeth.  This was a great recommendation by my dentist and I love them very much.  A wonderful investment as they are in their own containers and I can take them anywhere with me.</li>
            <li> I love these. They are much better than floss.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite dental product!  I have an issue with plaque and have to visit my dental hygienist four times a year instead of the normal two times for most people.  Several years ago, I began looking for something I could use on the go to help me keep my teeth much cleaner between hygienist visits.  After trying several kinds, I found this product.  I love these so much, I keep one in my purse, one in my car, one in my bathroom, one by my recliner, and sometimes carry one in my pants pocket!  The tight style works best for me and my teeth, but they do make other sizes.  These are also able to be used more than once, unlike a toothpick or other type of plastic pick product.  I like having the cap fit on the bottom so you can reach all teeth easily.  Plus, the head can be bent at an angle if needed.  I am extremely pleased with this product and hope they never stop making them!</li>
            <li> Better than flossing. I still floss but these brushes help me keep my teeth free of all debris.</li>
            <li> I like them but they break easy.</li>
            <li> best tool for cleaning teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on these proxabrushes--they get to places where neither a sonic toothbrush nor floss can and really help my gums.  Worth it, especially if you can get them on sale.  I had to try the different widths before finding what works for me.</li>
            <li> Gets in between your teeth better than floss. Recommended by my dentist. If you have tight teeth, get the extra strength because they will bend out of shape.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist.  A great product.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these!!! These are great to remove food debris from between teeth and around crowns. I love that I can choose from different sizes to accommodate the spacing between my teeth. Yay!</li>
            <li> Great product, Recommended by my dentist. Way better than a toothpick for discrete cleaning of teeth. Especially if brushing isn&#x27;t possible.</li>
            <li> I decided when I was in my 50&#x27;s to do something I should have done in my teens --- I got braces! Following the removal of my braces, I had a permanent retainer placed behind my bottom front teeth. Flossing between those teeth then became an exercise in patience and frustration. I now alternate between using these great Go-Between cleaners and using the threader and floss to clean my teeth. I much prefer my Go-Between days! As for the size, I tried the larger ones. (Too big.) I tried the small ones. (Too small.) These are just right. Now, my grandkids can say, &amp;#34;Grandma, what pretty teeth you have!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These work great and catch what floss sometimes misses.</li>
