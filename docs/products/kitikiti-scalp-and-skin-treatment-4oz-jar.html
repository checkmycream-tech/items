            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and it works great. I have dry hair and it moisturizes it perfectly. Also any scalp conditions that I had, it cleared them up. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t fairly evaluate this product due to the fact that it was the wrong product. I was hoping for the kitikiti that is a facial product. This product was for hair....</li>
            <li> If you have issues with dry scalp or dandruff and you want rock that bald look. I would encourage you to buy this product.</li>
            <li> i am an african american male, 24years old, and i suffered from an extreme case of hair bumps underneath my chin and neck area. my facial hair is very curly causing me to have hair bumps and razor burn. my barber came to me and told me about this product and what it does. AFTER THE FIRST HAIRCUT I APPLOED THIS UNDER MY CHIN AND NECK AREA....TWO DAYS LATER I COULD TELL THAT THE PRODUCT DEFINITELY WORKS!!!! NOW I HAVE NO HAIRBUMPS!!!!!! I USE THIS AFTER EACH HAIRCUT AND TRIM!!!!I EVEN ...APPLY IT TO MY BALD HEAD!!!!!! I will recommend anyone  this product!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing which has proven to be effective against my seborrheic dermatitis. Using it on a daily basis will show results within couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> If you want a healthy scalp, this is a great scalp treatment.  My whole family uses this whenever there is flair up of any sort with their scalp.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I&#x27;m not sure about it yet, but I will be able to add a better review soon.</li>
            <li> Great product it speaks for itself I have had bumps on my skin big ones and it takes them all away.I will keep using this product they should make a commercial</li>
            <li> I went to get my regular wash and set and my stylist told me \\&quot;Rika your scalp is a mess!\\&quot; It&#x27;s dry and very flaky!\\&quot; She started scratching my scalp. I had on s black shirt I looked at my tee shirt it looked like it was snowing. I&#x27;ve already had my hair washed so it was to late for a hot oil treatment. I went to the hair store read the back of several jars of grease in hopes to find the right one for my scalp as I&#x27;ve done so many times before only difference in today I actually read the back of the jar for KITIKITI !! My LUCKY DAY!\\&quot; Everything I was experiencing was on the jar. As soon as I greased my scalp I knew I would be 4ever a LOYAL CUSTOMER !! MY SCALP LOVES THIS PRODUCT! &amp; SO DO I! I&#x27;LL NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE ON MY SCALP EVER AGAIN!! KITIKITI 4LIFE!\\&quot; LOL</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 8 years and don&#x27;t even know how I discovered it.  Let me say I&#x27;m just glad I did!  It not only clears up razor bumps from ingrown hairs, it also dries up pimples all over the body while moisturizing and healing the skin.  It even retards hair loss!    I was so impressed that I attempted to contact the manufacturer to be a distributor.  (There are at least 10 barber shops in my immediate area with clients that could benefit from this.)  The manufacturer either have enough distributors or are not trying to promote this as much because they don&#x27;t get back to me.</li>
            <li> I had tried everything...my feet were dry and peeling all the time...tried expensive moisturizers, athletes feet cream, fungal sprays, but my problems was extremely dry feet due to a thyroid issue...I was so frustrated...I ran out of a moisturizer one day and saw I had kitikiti in my hair product drawer...put it on my feet...thought nothing of it until I got up the next morning and my feet were still moist...I used it again the next day...no dry feet...next day used again...this stuff works on my feet...they look beautiful! Wow!</li>
            <li> Great product. Been looking for it. Finally found it. Also at a great price thanx Kiti Kiti. One satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It works very eell for me and my daughter clear everything right on up and don&#x27;t take long as soon as u apply it starts working</li>
            <li> It works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as I read it would be.  I haven&#x27;t used the product consistently, so I can&#x27;t tell if there is growth or not.</li>
            <li> Started with this because I did not know about the non-oily version. This product works great for my scalp still, I use the non oily version for the razor bumps/rash on the back of my neck, and it has shown amazing results. Recommend either, just discover which version you need for your specific skin type.</li>
            <li> This product is FANTASTIC!! I could tell a difference after 2 days. This is now my new scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> I use it after I finish shaving, it protects my face against razor burns and bumps. Also,  I use it after I get my hair trimmed and edged to prevent bumping. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE  always heard great things about kiti kiti and that goes to show that word of mouth is great advertisement. I have been using the whole line of products for quite some time and they work well.</li>
            <li> exactly as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my husbands head. He just resently went bald and in the process of trying different razors and the everyday irriation of his work shirt it produced razor bumps. We reached out to a local barber for advice and were told about Kiti Kiti. Within two days we saw a difference. And now his head is smooth as a babies butt.</li>
