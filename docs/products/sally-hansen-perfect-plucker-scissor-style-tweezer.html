    <ol>
            <li>Am very very happy with these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Very good!</li>
            <li>Works great!!  </li>
            <li>Great for picking out ticks from your dog!!!</li>
            <li>A very good buy.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are the best at their job that I&#x27;ve ever tried, &amp; at a really attractive price point.</li>
            <li>Perfect, cost efficient and very easy to use!</li>
            <li>So happy I bought them.</li>
            <li>And the materials feels like great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought these to replace a great pair of inexpensive but American-made tweezers from around 1995.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Happy trails, everybody.</li>
            <li>The satin finsh is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Good product, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the skinny non scissor tweezers and they don&#x27;t work as good.  </li>
            <li>Good value and reliable functionality.</li>
            <li>This Sally Hanson Scissor Style Tweezer is not as good as it was explained.  </li>
            <li>I bought some for both of my daughters after trying my own.</li>
            <li>I had the straight scissor tweezer before and they were awesome.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold  &#x3D;:^)</li>
            <li>and they were wonderful but the ridges in the tweezers were dulling so I need a new pair.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle tweezers, received in good condition</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace a worn out scissors type tweezers I have had for many years.</li>
            <li>Love these scissor style tweezers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much more you can say about a pair of tweezers except they are well made and do the job.</li>
            <li>nothing more to say, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>realy:)</li>
            <li>I love this set of tweezers.</li>
            <li>I love this tweezer.  </li>
            <li>these are flat and square (not pointy) which makes for a seriously great grip!</li>
            <li>These are easy to hold and allow better precision.</li>
            <li>These feel very cheap, and they do not grab hair securely, if at all.</li>
            <li>make sure you wipe it clean after plucks</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold/easy grip even with fine hair.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t &#x27;pluck&#x27; fine hairs</li>
            <li>Work fine, as described.</li>
            <li>these are fine</li>
            <li>let alone a fine eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend the Revlon Perfectweeze Slant Tip because it is far superior at grabbing hair.</li>
            <li>It has made my plucking so much easier as it has an awesome grip for short unwanted hairs.</li>
            <li>Solid feel and very nice satin finish.</li>
            <li>These are more comfortable to use &amp;work really well.</li>
            <li>The finger holes are super comfortable.</li>
            <li>They work, they are better than the other brand that screwed up their good product</li>
            <li>These are slighty better than the straight ones I had.  </li>
            <li>till I  get it  my old that I lost works pretty good.</li>
            <li>it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Most tweezers are nominal at best at what they are designed to do - pull tiny little things out of places they should&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li>I got these hoping that they would be my new favorite tweezer.</li>
            <li>I prefer a straight edge on a tweezer rather than a slanted edge, and these fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Although it feels a bit heavy for its size, it is well constructed and is very effective to remove all hairs.</li>
            <li>I had a splinter &amp; it came right out with these tweezers.</li>
            <li>It will get the big hairs, but not the very, very fine ones.</li>
            <li>I was expecting these to be like regular tweezers except for the scissor style, but instead they are more like tongs.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have a good grip on the small hairs</li>
            <li>easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>Strong, simple and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>and they are definitely not made to tweeze fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this for a relative who wasn&#x27;t having good luck with regular tweezers and they&#x27;ve been a success.</li>
            <li>Very bulky</li>
            <li>The straight edge makes it easier to grasp finer hair than the slant tip.</li>
            <li>overall these are fabulous and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>This thing doesn&#x27;t want to grab hairs too well, and when it does, it wants to lose grip of it.  </li>
            <li>These work very well</li>
            <li>They make it  real easy to pluck those hard to tweeze eyebrows</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of these, I found a better scissors-tweezers choice called &#x27;Beaute&#x27; brand &amp;#34;Tweeze To Please&amp;#34; at my local SALLY cosmetics supply at the local mall.</li>
            <li>Very smooth to use, and firmly grabs as it should.  </li>
            <li>This kind of tweezer its hard to find.</li>
            <li>They look good in the photo, but they are poorly designed.</li>
            <li>This tweezer is very easy to hold and use at the same time when your hands are not real strong.</li>
            <li>Workmanship has really fallen off since the entire stainless steel industry was shipped to China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so much easier than the traditional squeeze style.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully, I saved my old pair</li>
            <li>a have hade old this scissor from germany, and i &#x27; ve dicided to order.....</li>
            <li>a pair from RiteAid that are just about the same cost but are much thinner, easier to use and work</li>
            <li>even the tiny eyebrow hairs you can hardly see come out easily!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I liked the scissor aspect of it, but the tweezers on their own are terrible.</li>
            <li>At less than 5 bucks, even the price is right.</li>
            <li>These are a bit too fat (thick) for fine use.  </li>
            <li>so I may just try to find a metal filer to rough up new ridges.</li>

            <li> so I may just try to find a metal filer to rough up new ridges.</li>
            <li> but it performs well and feels it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> They feel strange in my hand (a little thick) but that may be due to the fact that I have been using the other kind for over 40 years.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and affordable - you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> The tip is too dull to do much of anything.</li>
            <li> Just got these, and these tweezers actually pull the hairs out with the root instead of the other tweezers I had that would always just break the hair.</li>
            <li> Well made, and each jaw aligns properly with the other.  </li>
            <li> Would not grab a single hair at all.  </li>
            <li> The tip should be ground down perfectly flat to grab the lowest part of the hair where it is thickest.</li>
            <li> on swollen days they are a tight fit and can be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> ALso, the finger grips on these do not cut your fingertips off like the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; other brand which I will not name who decided to fix what was not broken, now its broken.</li>
            <li> and I recommend these over other scissor type tweezers.</li>
            <li> I like it and it does well to do the job, but I still find that I need my other tweezers as well.</li>
            <li> ends barely meet, they look like they were ground down by a monkey, they are uneven and you&#x27;d have to be a miracle worker to catch a thick whisker on a man between them</li>
            <li> and how hard can it be for China to copy a long-established design with only one moving part?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not effective for facial hair removal.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are one of those love hate kinds of implements.</li>
            <li> My other ones pinch my hand!</li>
            <li> the only thing is the holes to put your fingers through are a little too small (the item is shaped like small scissors).  </li>
            <li> You hate them for what you need them for, but you love it when they work, &amp; there&#x27;s where things usually go awry.</li>
            <li> I recommend these little buggers without any reservation.</li>
            <li> High disappointed in these tweezers, I had some similar to these</li>
            <li> A little stiff.</li>
            <li> Cute Look - Terrible Quality</li>
            <li> Other tweezers make my hands sore and tired.</li>
            <li> Not very good at grabbing hairs.</li>
            <li> It hardly catches any hair that needs to be plucked.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy but tip is too thick, makes it hard to grab the hair and pull it out.</li>
            <li> Then ends are so thick you can&#x27;t grab on to anything.</li>
            <li> I mean, It doesn&#x27;t bother me, I guess it might make the process easier.</li>
            <li> Not sure!</li>
            <li> Not a very good tweezer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to grasp a hair, and when you do, the poor tip design either lets the hair slip away, or breaks it off halfway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it very clumsy to use,</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this tweezer does not grip small hairs well.  </li>
            <li> They are blunt and imprecise -- totally useless.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t grab well, and the shape of the tweezer tips is all wrong.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, the jaws do not line up, therefore they do not grip hairs.</li>
            <li> These are a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Another bad product--</li>
            <li> /&gt;VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these because I have never tried tweezers of this style, and I hate it.  </li>
            <li> I found these to be worthless tweezers.  </li>
            <li> the worst tweezer i have ever used as it doesn&#x27;t pick up one hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought these to replace a worn out scissors type tweezers I have had for many years. These are more comfortable to use &amp;work really well. I had a splinter &amp; it came right out with these tweezers. So happy I bought them.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for a relative who wasn&#x27;t having good luck with regular tweezers and they&#x27;ve been a success. Easy to hold/easy grip even with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Am very very happy with these tweezers.  They make it  real easy to pluck those hard to tweeze eyebrows and I have never had a pair of tweezers for doing eyebrows that I like.</li>
            <li> Every tweezer should be made this way.  It is so much easier than the traditional squeeze style.  Easy to use, and affordable - you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I bought some for both of my daughters after trying my own.</li>

            <li> I found it very clumsy to use,</li>
            <li> They work, they are better than the other brand that screwed up their good product so I am now a Sally customer from here on.  They feel strange in my hand (a little thick) but that may be due to the fact that I have been using the other kind for over 40 years. It&#x27;s a change but they do work and I recommend these over other scissor type tweezers. ALso, the finger grips on these do not cut your fingertips off like the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; other brand which I will not name who decided to fix what was not broken, now its broken.</li>
            <li> Sturdy but tip is too thick, makes it hard to grab the hair and pull it out. Will not buy another one.</li>

            <li> I had the straight scissor tweezer before and they were awesome.  I&#x27;ve tried the skinny non scissor tweezers and they don&#x27;t work as good.  These are slighty better than the straight ones I had.  Good product, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Work fine, as described. I don&#x27;t know how much more you can say about a pair of tweezers except they are well made and do the job.</li>
            <li> Strong, simple and works as advertised. Good value and reliable functionality. I would recommend for purchase to anyone looking for such a product.</li>
            <li> The tip is too dull to do much of anything.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work---at all.  the worst tweezer i have ever used as it doesn&#x27;t pick up one hair.  nothing more to say, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I liked the scissor aspect of it, but the tweezers on their own are terrible. Then ends are so thick you can&#x27;t grab on to anything. I was expecting these to be like regular tweezers except for the scissor style, but instead they are more like tongs. Very bulky and they are definitely not made to tweeze fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this tweezer does not grip small hairs well.  It looks and feels well made but needs to be a bit sharper...otherwise, what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> Very good! Although it feels a bit heavy for its size, it is well constructed and is very effective to remove all hairs.</li>
            <li> I prefer a straight edge on a tweezer rather than a slanted edge, and these fit the bill.  The straight edge makes it easier to grasp finer hair than the slant tip.</li>
            <li> these are flat and square (not pointy) which makes for a seriously great grip! even the tiny eyebrow hairs you can hardly see come out easily! and no poking yourself! the only thing is the holes to put your fingers through are a little too small (the item is shaped like small scissors).  on swollen days they are a tight fit and can be uncomfortable.  overall these are fabulous and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have a good grip on the small hairs</li>
            <li> High disappointed in these tweezers, I had some similar to these and they were wonderful but the ridges in the tweezers were dulling so I need a new pair. Being that I can&#x27;t find scissor style tweezers in a store anywhere I thought I would buy a couple online so that I would have one on backup. These don&#x27;t grasp anything! Highly disappointed and a waste of money. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I saved my old pair so I may just try to find a metal filer to rough up new ridges.</li>
            <li> This Sally Hanson Scissor Style Tweezer is not as good as it was explained.  It hardly catches any hair that needs to be plucked.  I do no recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t pull out hair because of the grind on the blade why bother to sell them</li>
            <li> Works great!!  And the materials feels like great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you wipe it clean after plucks and it works fantastically.</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t want to grab hairs too well, and when it does, it wants to lose grip of it.  I wanted to try these because I have never tried tweezers of this style, and I hate it.  I am way too used to the regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> sturdy made, since I am a guy my thumb did hurt using it after a while but I think all of the scissor type tweezers are made for women.  it plucks well but FYI, it is smaller than it seems but it performs well and feels it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, the jaws do not line up, therefore they do not grip hairs.</li>
            <li> Not a very good tweezer!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  know yet till I  get it  my old that I lost works pretty good. This kind of tweezer its hard to find. Sounds like they stop making this tool. Not sure!</li>
            <li> A little stiff. Had to put oil on it but does the job.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle tweezers, received in good condition</li>
            <li> Great for picking out ticks from your dog!!!</li>
            <li> This tweezer is very easy to hold and use at the same time when your hands are not real strong.</li>
            <li> Well made, and each jaw aligns properly with the other.  Comfortable to hold  &#x3D;:^)</li>
            <li> Very smooth to use, and firmly grabs as it should.  The satin finsh is very nice.  A very good buy.</li>
            <li> I found these to be worthless tweezers.  They are blunt and imprecise -- totally useless.  I threw them in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I Like them because the thumb and finger hole is solid.  My other ones pinch my hand! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Solid feel and very nice satin finish. The rounded edges imparts a sense of quality too. The finger holes are super comfortable. The bent angle is ergonomic. At less than 5 bucks, even the price is right. The only reason doesn&#x27;t 5 stars is because the tip of the tweezer head is rounded like the rest of the edges. The tip should be ground down perfectly flat to grab the lowest part of the hair where it is thickest.</li>
            <li> They dont work well for finite tweezing.  Dull/blunt tips.</li>
            <li> These are a disappointment. They look good in the photo, but they are poorly designed. Another bad product-- and how hard can it be for China to copy a long-established design with only one moving part?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t grab well, and the shape of the tweezer tips is all wrong. It&#x27;s hard to grasp a hair, and when you do, the poor tip design either lets the hair slip away, or breaks it off halfway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought these to replace a great pair of inexpensive but American-made tweezers from around 1995. Workmanship has really fallen off since the entire stainless steel industry was shipped to China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of these, I found a better scissors-tweezers choice called &#x27;Beaute&#x27; brand &amp;#34;Tweeze To Please&amp;#34; at my local SALLY cosmetics supply at the local mall. $5.99 and it works great. The maker is Universal Razor Co, also Chinese, but this one works. So I would recommend the &#x27;Beaute&#x27; model instead. So now I&#x27;m set for another 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful. Happy trails, everybody.</li>
            <li> It will get the big hairs, but not the very, very fine ones.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are one of those love hate kinds of implements. You hate them for what you need them for, but you love it when they work, &amp; there&#x27;s where things usually go awry. Most tweezers are nominal at best at what they are designed to do - pull tiny little things out of places they should&#x27;t be. These tweezers are the best at their job that I&#x27;ve ever tried, &amp; at a really attractive price point. I recommend these little buggers without any reservation. So go, push the buy button, now!</li>
            <li> Do not buy.  I literally could not get the tips to even come close to contact.  Would not grab a single hair at all.  GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> these are fine but I was looking for the scissor type tweezers that have a pointed end. They do work though.</li>
            <li> Not effective for facial hair removal. These feel very cheap, and they do not grab hair securely, if at all. Take note of the 1-star reviews and save your time &amp; money. I strongly recommend the Revlon Perfectweeze Slant Tip because it is far superior at grabbing hair.</li>
            <li> a have hade old this scissor from germany, and i &#x27; ve dicided to order..... and it is goood... realy:)</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t grab the hairs well</li>
            <li> Other tweezers make my hands sore and tired. These are easy to hold and allow better precision. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> easy to open and close. works well</li>
            <li> These are a bit too fat (thick) for fine use.  I h ave a pair from RiteAid that are just about the same cost but are much thinner, easier to use and work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not going to be used but we&#x27;ll keep them as a spare pair.</li>
            <li> I love this set of tweezers. Easy to hold and use. it was delivered quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect, cost efficient and very easy to use! I love this tweezer.  It has made my plucking so much easier as it has an awesome grip for short unwanted hairs.</li>
            <li> I pluck a LOT. I got these hoping that they would be my new favorite tweezer. They are NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ends barely meet, they look like they were ground down by a monkey, they are uneven and you&#x27;d have to be a miracle worker to catch a thick whisker on a man between them let alone a fine eyebrow hair. The definitely fall short of the mark and I would NOT recommend them to anyone for any reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> These work very well and I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Verydifficult angle. Not very good at grabbing hairs.</li>
            <li> Like this plucker scissor.</li>
