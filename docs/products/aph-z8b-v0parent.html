            <li>Makes my hands feel so smooth and</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for a winter hand preparation, because then my hands can get so dry they hurt, but I will use it as well as my winter one.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much to my rough hands but some chemicals in this cream made my dry skin worse.</li>
            <li> this hand cream keeps my hands for getting to harsh and chapped, wife suggested I use it</li>
            <li> I could not fine anyplace to buy it here.</li>
            <li> Living in a cold climate makes skin dry.</li>

            <li> I initially bought this cream from a little  specialty shop that was going out of business.My hands were so cracked , my knuckles were actually bleeding!  I&#x27;d tried Eucerin, Aquaphor and many other expensive and supposedly strong moisturizers, Aphrodite&#x27;s olive oil cream was the only cream I tried that immediately softened my very dry hands and more importantly, lasted longer than a few minutes.

            <li> ...and not greasy! My chapped hands are doing much better since I started using it. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who has to wash their hands a lot during the day!</li>
            <li> Good but somewhat thick for hand cream!</li>
            <li> Makes your hands smooooooooth!&lt;br /&gt;The olive oil in this works wonders on&lt;br /&gt;your hands. Use it elsewhere too for&lt;br /&gt;smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I have started using the whole line of Aphrodite products. Natural ingredients and great product. Living in a cold climate makes skin dry. These products are excellent for moisturizing and tge smells of summer.</li>
            <li> Love the body lotion more than the hand cream and thought that was what I ordered.  This is good too but I prefer the body lotion.</li>
            <li> Soapy smell. Didn&#x27;t do much to my rough hands but some chemicals in this cream made my dry skin worse. It suppose to have no parabans but it does have tons of chemicals. It is not all natural.</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion while in Greece and I LOVE IT. It leave hands feeling silky and the Pomegranate smells amazing! I have bad allergies so any strong smell will keep me sneezing all day. This is the only lotion besides unscented lotion that I am able to wear on my hands and have no issues.
