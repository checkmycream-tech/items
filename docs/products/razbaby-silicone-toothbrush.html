            <li>LOL!</li>
            <li>Again, dang this is a good teether!</li>
            <li>I tell him what a good boy he is to brush his teeth, but it is a excellent teether!</li>
            <li>This is a great brush because it cannot scratch your infant or toddler&#x27;s mouth.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still in great condition.</li>
            <li>The mouth guard on it lets her try it herself and gain a sense of independence which is nice!</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this toothbrush is that my daughter lets me brush her teeth!  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is a really nice learning tool.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure the sellers are probably nice.</li>
            <li>Planning to buy more as gifts for friends&#x27; babies.</li>
            <li>My kids favorite.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about buying a silicone toothbrush for my son.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s had more use as a teether than a toothbrush, but it was well worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when this item arrived</li>
            <li>but it did not work to clean my kid&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>Was going to buy the giraffe teether, but this is so much cheaper and better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>A big toy giraffe doesn&#x27;t travel as well as this either, and when you find a good teether, you take it EVERYWHERE with you.</li>
            <li>It is also very soft and seems more comfortable to use according to my son&#x27;s response.</li>
            <li>He does a good job munching down on the brush and we are working on real brushing but he does not destroy it, he holds it easily and it really is a good training tool.</li>
            <li>Everyone writing good reviews must not have had this for long.</li>
            <li>I have sent several of these to friends who are new mothers and always get great feedback.  </li>
            <li>Try this first, I think it will surprise you.</li>
            <li>I managed his tooth brushing every day and tried to make sure he was brushing and not just chewing on it, but over a short amount of time it was chewed through anyway.</li>
            <li>In the beginning of my brushing I tell him that it is my turn to brush first</li>
            <li>I really like the stopper</li>
            <li>The choking stop really works too.  </li>
            <li>He loves to chomp on this and it seems to really help his pain and give him some relief.</li>
            <li>I only took my 19 month old son a couple of months to chew off most of the bristles and then another one month for him to chew through to the core.</li>
            <li>Also, as they get a little older and more independent you don&#x27;t have to worry that they&#x27;ll push it too far into their mouths because of the handy guard just under the brush.  </li>
            <li>I could not see any place where moisture could have gotten in, and there is no way to open it to clean it and air it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft to hold, soft on the teeth and gums, and makes for a fun brushing experience.  </li>
            <li>I have a 14 month old son and he absolutely loves this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My 8 month old loves this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>My second favorite thing is the ring around it that alleviates my fear that she will jam it down her throat.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 if you could move the guard down more to the middle of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 8 month old son loves to chew on with this soft silicone toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My 15mo old loves to use this brush.  </li>
            <li>my 1 year old daughter enjoys using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a tootth brush with soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I hope to find a similar product for the older toddler.</li>
            <li>My 5 1/2 month old loves this toothbrush/teether, so far it&#x27;s the only thing he reaches for.  </li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for a brush that would have super soft bristles like the little finger brushes and this is it!</li>
            <li>The first one fell apart after several days of usage, while this one obviously will last longer.</li>
            <li>This is the only brush my 18 month old will let me use on her teeth.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s the only teething item she likes.</li>

            <li> However, if she grabs it and puts the wrong end in her mouth, I find she can gag herself quickly because that end can go really far into her mouth.</li>
            <li> My 7-month-old LOVES this and will chew on it for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it will last for a very long time!!</li>
            <li> of course, he flipped it around and jammed the handle down his throat instead.</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really worth the time</li>
            <li> I had to throw ours away after a few weeks due to black mold forming on the inside.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the round guard that prevents him from sticking it down his throat....</li>
            <li> And BONUS, it brushes their little gums while your at it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s flexible/chewable and we use it with a little baby toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s time for me to upgrade though because I&#x27;ve noticed a few missing bristles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and designed to be difficult to choke on.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 8 month old who has 6 teeth coming in and is miserable.</li>
            <li> This item was useless.  </li>
            <li> It is therefore useless, and dangerous.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>

            <li> My favorite thing about this toothbrush is that my daughter lets me brush her teeth!  She doesn&#x27;t like regular toothbrushes.  My second favorite thing is the ring around it that alleviates my fear that she will jam it down her throat.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> Everyone writing good reviews must not have had this for long. I had to throw ours away after a few weeks due to black mold forming on the inside. I could not see any place where moisture could have gotten in, and there is no way to open it to clean it and air it out. It is therefore useless, and dangerous.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush my 18 month old will let me use on her teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush because it cannot scratch your infant or toddler&#x27;s mouth.

I have sent several of these to friends who are new mothers and always get great feedback.  I think it&#x27;s time for me to upgrade though because I&#x27;ve noticed a few missing bristles and I don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;ve gone.  I hope to find a similar product for the older toddler.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for a brush that would have super soft bristles like the little finger brushes and this is it! My baby has almost all of her teeth and we have been using it for a month now and have NO problem with bristles falling off or being chewed off. Just supervise your child and know it is not meant as a chewing toy but as a toothbrush and it will last for a very long time!! The mouth guard on it lets her try it herself and gain a sense of independence which is nice!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when this item arrived but it did not work to clean my kid&#x27;s teeth.  This item was useless.  I&#x27;ll probably throw it away soon.</li>
            <li> My 8 month old son loves to chew on with this soft silicone toothbrush. I bought it because of the round guard that prevents him from sticking it down his throat....of course, he flipped it around and jammed the handle down his throat instead. He only did it once, though. Learned his lesson, I guess, and now just chews on it. I only gave it 4 stars...I would have given it 5 if you could move the guard down more to the middle of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 4/30/12: We&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about 7 months now and it&#x27;s still in great condition. I think it&#x27;s had more use as a teether than a toothbrush, but it was well worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> My 16-month-old loves this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s soft to hold, soft on the teeth and gums, and makes for a fun brushing experience.  Planning to buy more as gifts for friends&#x27; babies.</li>
            <li> My 7-month-old LOVES this and will chew on it for a long time. I really like the stopper so she can&#x27;t gag on it. However, if she grabs it and puts the wrong end in her mouth, I find she can gag herself quickly because that end can go really far into her mouth. I have to watch her CONSTANTLY while she&#x27;s chewing on this or she&#x27;ll have it turned around and gagging on it in no time.</li>
            <li> Again, dang this is a good teether! My kids favorite. And BONUS, it brushes their little gums while your at it.  The choking stop really works too.  Was going to buy the giraffe teether, but this is so much cheaper and better in my opinion.  A big toy giraffe doesn&#x27;t travel as well as this either, and when you find a good teether, you take it EVERYWHERE with you. Try this first, I think it will surprise you.</li>
            <li> My 15mo old loves to use this brush.  Whenever he sees his brother brushing his teeth, he points and says \\&quot;brush\\&quot; until we give him his.  He used to try chewing on both ends, but now only puts the end with bristles in his mouth.  The guard helps to keep him from choking. I don&#x27;t have any complaints, I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> my 1 year old daughter enjoys using this toothbrush. it&#x27;s flexible/chewable and we use it with a little baby toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My 8 month old loves this toothbrush! I let her play with it and so far it&#x27;s the only teething item she likes. (No visible teeth yet)</li>
            <li> I was very excited about buying a silicone toothbrush for my son. I only took my 19 month old son a couple of months to chew off most of the bristles and then another one month for him to chew through to the core. I managed his tooth brushing every day and tried to make sure he was brushing and not just chewing on it, but over a short amount of time it was chewed through anyway. Not worth it I don&#x27;t think.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a tootth brush with soft bristles. In the description it does not say anything about the bristles. Well anyway when I received the toothbrush I took it out of the box and it practically fell out of the packaging it was in (as if it had been opened already before) I have not bothered the seller with this problem because the item was already so cheep it&#x27;s not really worth the time but I&#x27;m sure the sellers are probably nice.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 8 month old who has 6 teeth coming in and is miserable. He loves to chomp on this and it seems to really help his pain and give him some relief. I know it is a tooth brush and while he is using it I tell him what a good boy he is to brush his teeth, but it is a excellent teether! He can gnaw on both ends and loves it. Would definetly recommend and would definetly buy again.</li>
            <li> My 5 1/2 month old loves this toothbrush/teether, so far it&#x27;s the only thing he reaches for.  He has plenty of choices (Sophie, Razzberry teether, Mam teether, wooden rings, etc) but only likes this one.  It&#x27;s soft and designed to be difficult to choke on.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a really nice learning tool. Only thing is, baby loves to chew on the handle instead of the brush end. LOL!</li>
            <li> This is the second toothbrush I got for my son. The first one fell apart after several days of usage, while this one obviously will last longer. It is also very soft and seems more comfortable to use according to my son&#x27;s response.</li>
            <li> I have a 14 month old son and he absolutely loves this toothbrush.  In the beginning of my brushing I tell him that it is my turn to brush first and then I give it over to him.  He does a good job munching down on the brush and we are working on real brushing but he does not destroy it, he holds it easily and it really is a good training tool.</li>
