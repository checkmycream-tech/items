            <li>It has a refreshing feel, but as for clearing up break outs</li>
            <li>it was just okay.</li>

            <li>If you will try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>and I just feel in love with it.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t be sure what is helping the most.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for three years and my skin has never looked so healthy.  </li>

            <li>My face has never been this clean!</li>
            <li>Works great on my sensitive skin to take care of my hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena oil free cleanser works so much better</li>
            <li>According to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best AHA product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best weapon against acne I have encountered in my over 10 year war!</li>
            <li>this has help my breakouts tremendously!</li>
            <li>I use this every morning in the shower and, with the Colorado Acne Pumice Scrub I get from my facial girl, I&#x27;m really happy with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>This cleans well, makes your face smooth after using.  </li>
            <li>This has a refreshing tingle that leaves my face feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>Both are also SLS free.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it combined with the toner and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I receive compliments all the time on the smooth texture of my skin, even without make-up.  </li>
            <li>I like how this product smells...very light.  </li>
            <li>It was only after my skin was used to it that I was able to increase it--with the help of a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>Also good to try for acne prone adult skin is Murad.</li>
            <li>The product also feels good on the skin, doesn&#x27;t sting, and makes skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and feels so good when you massage your face.</li>
            <li>Has helped minimize my pores and feels great to wash with - definitely get a wonderfully clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I break out easily, but I&#x27;m always open to try a good cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This facial wash is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Love the Amazon price and the seller was fast with shipping!</li>
            <li>I have used Estee Lauder and Qlinque products for years and never found a cleanser that made my face feel clean without a film on it.</li>
            <li>And the mint  clean</li>
            <li>It is a great face wash that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.  </li>
            <li>Your face just feels clean after you use it.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser helps fight pimples and keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li>that takes most of it off then when I&#x27;m ready to use this gel</li>
            <li>This cleanser is part of my arsenal for keeping my skin nice and clear.</li>
            <li>so I do expect it to last a good while.</li>
            <li>I got a good sized sample of this cleanser after a facial.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe Skinceuticals is able to charge this much for a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t even remove make-up.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use twice a day, but does a great job of making my skin feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li>I usually remove my makeup first and then use this in an attempt to get the best benefit of the LHAs.</li>
            <li>You can really feel it cleansing your skin!!</li>
            <li>If you have problematic skin then you should really try this!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>Great cleanser, does the job without harsh scrubbing, irritation.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser, but it can be drying if used everyday.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Works great on my sensitive, occasional breakout skin.</li>
            <li>but if it keeps working like it is, It is well worth it</li>
            <li>I rarely have a blemish now &amp; if this product goes away</li>
            <li>So far love it.</li>
            <li>are better natural products</li>
            <li>The original white top seal on the bottle was broken/opened and had splits and torn edges.</li>
            <li>The item was shipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for 1 week, but it seems to keep my face clean and refreshing,</li>
            <li>right  </li>
            <li>and my face really does feel extremely clean after I use these.</li>
            <li>Very very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>This LHA cleansing gel cleanses deeply with a minty, fresh scent, but is not harsh and leaves my skin feeling more &#x27;balanced&#x27; and smooth.</li>
            <li>washes off everything and keeps acne free most of the time compared to other products I have used</li>
            <li>I find it a little drying, so good for problem skin.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely luv it!</li>
            <li>I love this product but my bottle arrived open and the cleaning gel had leaked everywhere.  </li>
            <li>using for 2 weeks now, and saw immediate improvement to my oily, clogged, acne prone skin after the first use.  </li>
            <li>My esthetician recommended this product to me and I instantly fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take off waterproof mascara on the first try</li>
            <li>but I use a disposable makeup pad first</li>
            <li>I immediately saw improvements and now after a week my face is clear and acne free.  </li>
            <li>I started using this in March and am still on my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>Take off your mascara first, it shouldn&#x27;t be used in that regard.</li>
            <li>Today was my first time using the product</li>
            <li>This facial wash is great even for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through three other brands of cleansers targeted at acne skin in the last 1.5 years but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>New in box, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I had been using Cetaphil with my Clarisonic brush and still had visibly large pores.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>A new seal was placed on top of the original(clear with blue writing).</li>
            <li>Bought this one before, it&#x27;s great, just be careful not to over use as it can dry out your skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many issues with pimples or acne at all, but the small areas on my chin and chest have cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li>The other products clean but they don&#x27;t make my face feel as clean as this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Gentle but cleans well.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>I am using it with the phytocorrect gel, and my skin finally feels smooth.</li>
            <li>It became much drier and I had a sense that it was working.  </li>
            <li>but my cleanser was delivered so fast.</li>
            <li>Of course, I rely mainly on my other products for skin problems or wrinkles, but this is a good solid face cleanser.</li>
            <li>I did not break out, the product left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Im over thirty and still get pimples pretty frequently.  </li>
            <li>As an adult that does not suffer from acne, I found that it was hard to find good face washes for this problem.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin feel clean without feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I am currently pregnant so this is the only product I am using on my face.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the product; I just can&#x27;t recommend buying it from an unauthorized dealer.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product by skin has never look</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old male  soon to be 36) and my skin still has its moments when it wants to get real real oily...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and leaves the skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I am prone to adult acne breakouts, but this product has really kept that problem under control.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased LHA cleansing gel first from a local spa, the next one from this dealer on Amazon, then this most recent one I got from my spa again.</li>
            <li>The maturing process along with a thyroid condition has changed my facial skin from somewhat oily to now most times dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Only a little is needed and suds up nicely.</li>
            <li>I WORKED AT BARNEYS NEW YORK FOR 9 YEARS)</li>
            <li>Skinceuticals LHA Cleansing Gel has proven to be the best cleanser I have found so far for my &#x27;troubled&#x27; sometimes dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product was just very old, if the contents were changed or what might be the issue.</li>
            <li>My skin has come alive!</li>
            <li>It takes very little (I found out after the first use) to clean off all makeup.</li>
            <li>I was using Arbonne RE9 for a couple years and my face was breaking out, so I added Clean &amp; Clear to my 2x daily facial washing.  </li>
            <li>After a few days of morning and night use I noticed a huge improvement in my skin texture and in breakout intensity.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful this wash was going to help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I have always had adult acne and since I have started using LHA Cleansing Gel</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve gone the natural way like Anne marie Bjorland and Dr. haushka, jurlique...</li>
            <li>Then, I went on a weekend trip and bought a travel size of my old face wash.</li>
            <li>I got the kit for this for my adult acne.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son that has acne prone skin uses it as well and loves it.</li>
            <li>I am 53 and have the skin of a 40 year old.  </li>
            <li>so  far.  </li>
            <li>This has changed my skin completely.</li>
            <li>As someone who has suffered with acne and sensitive, oily skin for over 25 years I have tried everything on the market to keep blemishes at bay, from over-the counter products, to Proactive, to Accutane and Retin-A.</li>
            <li>Personally, I like Neutrogena&#x27;s One-Step Gentle Make-up Remover cleanser and GloProfessional&#x27;s Clarifying Cleanser with salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and have tried numerous products over the years trying to combat this issue.</li>
            <li>I have always heard it gets worse before it gets better, so I decided to be patient and give it a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money, plus you only need a tiny bit when you use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just really upset about the fact that I wasted so much money on it and that I have new scars that will take months to heal.</li>
            <li>I will most likely cry everyday forever!</li>
            <li>Previously, I used pretty normal cleansers.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, be cautious using this wash because it is very</li>
            <li>(otherwise it would dry me out too much) which this company also has</li>
            <li>This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found in my 24years of acne that has helped completely!</li>
            <li>(Neither one of us had major acne....</li>
            <li>It also broke me out completely and have red hive</li>
            <li>I have had acne for over 13 years and this is the only product to completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li>Not happy with this product, even though I like most products from Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was some minor peeling in the beginning, but I feel like that was just making way for new skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin at all</li>
            <li>I am Asian, have oily skin, and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>After using it, my skin feels incredibly dry, and my T zone becomes very oily, just minutes after using it while my cheeks stay dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>Has a slight tingling feeling which I don&#x27;t mind much.  </li>
            <li>I have moderate to oily skin and have been battling minor adult acne.  </li>
            <li>It also does not dry my face out, which is a big plus!</li>

            <li> In the morning I wash with a very light cream cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing feel, but as for clearing up break outs</li>
            <li> it was just okay.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that I can just get it by ordering it online.</li>

            <li> If you will try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> and I just feel in love with it.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t be sure what is helping the most.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three years and my skin has never looked so healthy.  </li>

            <li> My face has never been this clean!</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive skin to take care of my hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena oil free cleanser works so much better</li>
            <li> According to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best AHA product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best weapon against acne I have encountered in my over 10 year war!</li>
            <li> this has help my breakouts tremendously!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning in the shower and, with the Colorado Acne Pumice Scrub I get from my facial girl, I&#x27;m really happy with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> This cleans well, makes your face smooth after using.  </li>
            <li> This has a refreshing tingle that leaves my face feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> Both are also SLS free.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it combined with the toner and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I receive compliments all the time on the smooth texture of my skin, even without make-up.  </li>
            <li> I like how this product smells...very light.  </li>
            <li> It was only after my skin was used to it that I was able to increase it--with the help of a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> Also good to try for acne prone adult skin is Murad.</li>
            <li> The product also feels good on the skin, doesn&#x27;t sting, and makes skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and feels so good when you massage your face.</li>
            <li> Has helped minimize my pores and feels great to wash with - definitely get a wonderfully clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I break out easily, but I&#x27;m always open to try a good cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This facial wash is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Love the Amazon price and the seller was fast with shipping!</li>
            <li> I have used Estee Lauder and Qlinque products for years and never found a cleanser that made my face feel clean without a film on it.</li>
            <li> And the mint  clean</li>
            <li> It is a great face wash that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> Your face just feels clean after you use it.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser helps fight pimples and keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li> that takes most of it off then when I&#x27;m ready to use this gel</li>
            <li> This cleanser is part of my arsenal for keeping my skin nice and clear.</li>
            <li> so I do expect it to last a good while.</li>
            <li> I got a good sized sample of this cleanser after a facial.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Skinceuticals is able to charge this much for a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t even remove make-up.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use twice a day, but does a great job of making my skin feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> I usually remove my makeup first and then use this in an attempt to get the best benefit of the LHAs.</li>
            <li> You can really feel it cleansing your skin!!</li>
            <li> If you have problematic skin then you should really try this!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, does the job without harsh scrubbing, irritation.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser, but it can be drying if used everyday.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive, occasional breakout skin.</li>
            <li> but if it keeps working like it is, It is well worth it</li>
            <li> I rarely have a blemish now &amp; if this product goes away</li>
            <li> So far love it.</li>
            <li> are better natural products</li>
            <li> The original white top seal on the bottle was broken/opened and had splits and torn edges.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 1 week, but it seems to keep my face clean and refreshing,</li>
            <li> right  </li>
            <li> and my face really does feel extremely clean after I use these.</li>
            <li> Very very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This LHA cleansing gel cleanses deeply with a minty, fresh scent, but is not harsh and leaves my skin feeling more &#x27;balanced&#x27; and smooth.</li>
            <li> washes off everything and keeps acne free most of the time compared to other products I have used</li>
            <li> I find it a little drying, so good for problem skin.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely luv it!</li>
            <li> I love this product but my bottle arrived open and the cleaning gel had leaked everywhere.  </li>
            <li> using for 2 weeks now, and saw immediate improvement to my oily, clogged, acne prone skin after the first use.  </li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended this product to me and I instantly fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take off waterproof mascara on the first try</li>
            <li> but I use a disposable makeup pad first</li>
            <li> I immediately saw improvements and now after a week my face is clear and acne free.  </li>
            <li> I started using this in March and am still on my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> Take off your mascara first, it shouldn&#x27;t be used in that regard.</li>
            <li> Today was my first time using the product</li>
            <li> This facial wash is great even for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through three other brands of cleansers targeted at acne skin in the last 1.5 years but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> New in box, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I had been using Cetaphil with my Clarisonic brush and still had visibly large pores.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> A new seal was placed on top of the original(clear with blue writing).</li>
            <li> Bought this one before, it&#x27;s great, just be careful not to over use as it can dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many issues with pimples or acne at all, but the small areas on my chin and chest have cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li> The other products clean but they don&#x27;t make my face feel as clean as this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Gentle but cleans well.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li> I am using it with the phytocorrect gel, and my skin finally feels smooth.</li>
            <li> It became much drier and I had a sense that it was working.  </li>
            <li> but my cleanser was delivered so fast.</li>
            <li> Of course, I rely mainly on my other products for skin problems or wrinkles, but this is a good solid face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I did not break out, the product left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Im over thirty and still get pimples pretty frequently.  </li>
            <li> As an adult that does not suffer from acne, I found that it was hard to find good face washes for this problem.</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin feel clean without feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I am currently pregnant so this is the only product I am using on my face.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the product; I just can&#x27;t recommend buying it from an unauthorized dealer.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product by skin has never look</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old male  soon to be 36) and my skin still has its moments when it wants to get real real oily...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and leaves the skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I am prone to adult acne breakouts, but this product has really kept that problem under control.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased LHA cleansing gel first from a local spa, the next one from this dealer on Amazon, then this most recent one I got from my spa again.</li>
            <li> The maturing process along with a thyroid condition has changed my facial skin from somewhat oily to now most times dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Only a little is needed and suds up nicely.</li>
            <li> I WORKED AT BARNEYS NEW YORK FOR 9 YEARS)</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals LHA Cleansing Gel has proven to be the best cleanser I have found so far for my &#x27;troubled&#x27; sometimes dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product was just very old, if the contents were changed or what might be the issue.</li>
            <li> My skin has come alive!</li>
            <li> It takes very little (I found out after the first use) to clean off all makeup.</li>
            <li> I was using Arbonne RE9 for a couple years and my face was breaking out, so I added Clean &amp; Clear to my 2x daily facial washing.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of morning and night use I noticed a huge improvement in my skin texture and in breakout intensity.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful this wash was going to help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I have always had adult acne and since I have started using LHA Cleansing Gel</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve gone the natural way like Anne marie Bjorland and Dr. haushka, jurlique...</li>
            <li> Then, I went on a weekend trip and bought a travel size of my old face wash.</li>
            <li> I got the kit for this for my adult acne.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son that has acne prone skin uses it as well and loves it.</li>
            <li> I am 53 and have the skin of a 40 year old.  </li>
            <li> so  far.  </li>
            <li> This has changed my skin completely.</li>
            <li> As someone who has suffered with acne and sensitive, oily skin for over 25 years I have tried everything on the market to keep blemishes at bay, from over-the counter products, to Proactive, to Accutane and Retin-A.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like Neutrogena&#x27;s One-Step Gentle Make-up Remover cleanser and GloProfessional&#x27;s Clarifying Cleanser with salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and have tried numerous products over the years trying to combat this issue.</li>
            <li> I have always heard it gets worse before it gets better, so I decided to be patient and give it a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money, plus you only need a tiny bit when you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just really upset about the fact that I wasted so much money on it and that I have new scars that will take months to heal.</li>
            <li> I will most likely cry everyday forever!</li>
            <li> Previously, I used pretty normal cleansers.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, be cautious using this wash because it is very</li>
            <li> (otherwise it would dry me out too much) which this company also has</li>
            <li> This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found in my 24years of acne that has helped completely!</li>
            <li> (Neither one of us had major acne....</li>
            <li> It also broke me out completely and have red hive</li>
            <li> I have had acne for over 13 years and this is the only product to completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product, even though I like most products from Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was some minor peeling in the beginning, but I feel like that was just making way for new skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin at all</li>
            <li> I am Asian, have oily skin, and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> After using it, my skin feels incredibly dry, and my T zone becomes very oily, just minutes after using it while my cheeks stay dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Has a slight tingling feeling which I don&#x27;t mind much.  </li>
            <li> I have moderate to oily skin and have been battling minor adult acne.  </li>
            <li> It also does not dry my face out, which is a big plus!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years; this particular bottle was ver y watered down.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended using LHA Facial Cleanser in addition to some other products to help my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> This with the combo of other products by them it has given me clear skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Skinceuticals products before, but have to say that as far as balancing and controlling oil I noticed the biggest impact from this product.  </li>
            <li> put only a small amount of the cleanser in the palm of my hand and dip my Clairisonic brush in it and gently move it all around my face.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular cleasing gel for a few years now and it is &amp;#34;CLEAR&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It was a complete and total mess and returns are such a pain.</li>
            <li> Usually I go where the deals are, but in this case.....not so much.</li>
            <li> The contents have a very strange coloring to them almost yellow.</li>
            <li> Works well with the clarisonic Mia and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, even when used daily!</li>
            <li> I also buy their clay mask as well, This seller delivered everything quickly and nothing is ever broken or leaking.</li>
            <li> having a  little  bit  of a  flare and  developed a  couple  of  scars  on  </li>
            <li> In actuality compared to all the thousands of products i&#x27;ve wasted my time and money on... this is by far the one that kills &amp;#34;bacteria&amp;#34; with out drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> This is going to be a life long product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, but wished it was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> This has tightened up my skin without it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Smells divine and it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it does not make it dry or oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually get super oily a few hours after I put on my makeup, but within a week of using this, I noticed my face was much less oily.  </li>
            <li> I thought why not put this pump from a different Skinceuticals product in to make myself have one less step in my shower, well</li>
            <li> It also lasts forever because you only need to use a little dime size when you wash your face.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little pricey, until I realized you only use about a dime sized amount.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be shocked by the price this bottle will last for a long time and it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Has a thicker texture than expected, performs as designed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve certainly had cleansers that smelled worse and did less.</li>
            <li> LHA Cleansing Gel  - only use a small amount (dime size) to get started - goes along way.</li>
            <li> I have tried over 20 other brands and this one blows those out of the water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with other things</li>
            <li> I got this product after seeing my roommates face improve dramatically after using it and then reading the other reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and I find this product extremely drying.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand, it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my adult hormonal skin in balance.</li>
            <li> Long story short, my cleanser was broken during a plane ride on vacation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strong, but nothing too bad.  </li>
            <li> runny consistency almost watered down.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt in my mind that the bottle purchased here was watered down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but totally worth it if you have tried other solutions but still have acne in your late 20s.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my face has been considerably less greasy</li>
            <li> (it is not as oily as it previously was).</li>
            <li> My skin looks calmer, feels cleaner and is less congested.</li>
            <li> waste your money on an expensive cleanser that is on your face for less than 60 seconds and you wash down the drain - especially THIS cleanser that doesn&#x27;t properly cleanse skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser isnt bad, and lasts a long time, but it doesnt cleanse very well.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> A little goes a looong way</li>
            <li> Just takes a little and lasts a few months.</li>
            <li> I have an oily face and this has kept the acne/black heads down to a minimum!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone and if used with the other Skinceutical acne products, you will notice your pores will shrink and blemishes gone!!</li>
            <li> Lots of toxic chemicals&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li> After about a year and a half my sun damage was gone and almost all of my freckles were as well!</li>
            <li> the LHA or whatever is in there has caused the spring in the pump to rust so now my $40 face soap is a pale purple, I don&#x27;t want to add that chemical reaction to my face.</li>
            <li> I am trying to compare the contents to ones sold at the stores and hoping to find similar and a less expensive price.</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have struggled with hard acne under my skin for a few years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I fell into the latter category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using for past 6 months and sticking with it.</li>
            <li> Because it is expensive, occasionally I will try something else.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even tell it was working because I didn&#x27;t have any of the usual side effects of acne products (agitation, dryness, etc).</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans my face thoroughly (no make-up left) without drying or any other unpleasant side effects.  </li>
            <li> They are no longer angry red flares but small hard nodes</li>
            <li> It is recommended for oily or difficult skin, but if you have dry problematic skin it also works.</li>
            <li> I have not encounter any negative reactions or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> As time went on, it got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> to cause worse breakouts&lt;br</li>
            <li> After being off of this product for just two days, I saw a dramatic improvement in my skin, so I know this was the culprit.</li>
            <li> I  was  using  were  expensive  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about Skinceauticals products.</li>
            <li> the  price  is  that  bad,  the  drug  store  </li>
            <li> Makes me sick.</li>
            <li> YOU&#x27;RE STUPID IF U DONT TRY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> My skin had not looked that bad in years!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This skin line caused a terrible reaction which included welts on my face and chest area for 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I used to tan a lot (terrible, I know)</li>
            <li> It also smells horrible, like medicine, which doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin has never looked so wonderful, EVER!</li>
            <li> My skin is looking good using this product.</li>
            <li> I have always had adult acne and since I have started using LHA Cleansing Gel I have cleared up works wonders for me</li>
            <li> This did well for cleaning the skin. It has a refreshing feel, but as for clearing up break outs it was just okay.</li>
            <li> I use this soap daily.  I also love the fact that I can just get it by ordering it online.</li>
            <li> I absolutely luv it! I&#x27;m African American and I have oily skin,  this has help my breakouts tremendously! I have found my skin regime.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped pretty quickly. i couldn&#x27;t wait to use it but all my excitement came to a halt after using it . This product made my skin too dry. Even after using moisturizer . So now it&#x27;s just sitting in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> It is excellent for adult acne</li>
            <li> I will not cleanse my face with anything else!!  I LOVE this stuff!!! You can really feel it cleansing your skin!! My face is 100 times better since I started using Skinceuticals. If you have problematic skin then you should really try this!!</li>
            <li> No this cleansing gel is very strong and stings my skin. I would like to return it.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old male  soon to be 36) and my skin still has its moments when it wants to get real real oily... THIS IS THE BEST CLEANSER I HAVE TRIED AND LOVED.. I have used EVERYTHING.... from mario badecu, to anything in a dept store  I WORKED AT BARNEYS NEW YORK FOR 9 YEARS) - I&#x27;ve gone the natural way like Anne marie Bjorland and Dr. haushka, jurlique... I CAN GO ON.... SKIN CEUTICALS  SAVED MY FACE..... PERIOD... YOU&#x27;RE STUPID IF U DONT TRY THIS PRODUCT AND THIS SKIN CARE LINE..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKINCEUTICALS U ROCK... THANK U</li>
            <li> I use this every morning in the shower and, with the Colorado Acne Pumice Scrub I get from my facial girl, I&#x27;m really happy with the outcome.  I have an oily face and this has kept the acne/black heads down to a minimum!</li>
            <li> I love this product but my bottle arrived open and the cleaning gel had leaked everywhere.  It was a complete and total mess and returns are such a pain.</li>
            <li> I heard about Skinceuticals from a friend who works in a spa. I am in my mid twenties and still suffer from moderate acne, so she thought I should give this product a try. After doing extensive research, I found the reviews to be polarizing - this was either the miracle cure for acne sufferers worldwide, or it would send you into a deep state of depression every time you caught a glance of yourself in the mirror. Unfortunately, I fell into the latter category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after starting this product, my acne flared up. I have always heard it gets worse before it gets better, so I decided to be patient and give it a few more weeks. As time went on, it got worse and worse. My skin had not looked that bad in years! Then, I went on a weekend trip and bought a travel size of my old face wash. After being off of this product for just two days, I saw a dramatic improvement in my skin, so I know this was the culprit. I am glad I&#x27;ve stopped using this product, and I will never recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;m just really upset about the fact that I wasted so much money on it and that I have new scars that will take months to heal.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Gets my face squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand, it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my adult hormonal skin in balance.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cleanser for my face several years ago.I have used Estee Lauder and Qlinque products for years and never found a cleanser that made my face feel clean without a film on it. The other products clean but they don&#x27;t make my face feel as clean as this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put only a small amount of the cleanser in the palm of my hand and dip my Clairisonic brush in it and gently move it all around my face. You can also use it on your shoulders, etc. It will last about eight months for me.</li>
            <li> According to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and I had no problems with my skin after one week using it.</li>
            <li> Good Product good price</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, be cautious using this wash because it is very drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I however, have oily skin and I LOVE this face wash. I only use it at night and apply a Cetaphil facial moisturizer about 30min after washing before bed.  In the morning I wash with a very light cream cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some minor peeling in the beginning, but I feel like that was just making way for new skin.  My blemishes and acne scarring have reduced dramatically.  When people compliment me on how great my skin looks I recommend this LHA Cleansing Gel to them.</li>
            <li> The gel texture is fabulous! And the mint  clean feeling afterward is something I look forward to each day!</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Been using for 2 weeks now, and saw immediate improvement to my oily, clogged, acne prone skin after the first use.  I have been using this cleanser along with my ClairSonic Mia facial brush and SkinCeuticals Age + Blemish Defense, and my skin has never been clearer.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> New in box, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stubborn acne since I was a teenager. I still have issues even now (I&#x27;m 33--don&#x27;t you just love genetics?!) but since using this twice a day along with my acne treatment, it&#x27;s gotten so much better. My skin is very sensitive so I had to work up to twice a day over a period of six months. It was only after my skin was used to it that I was able to increase it--with the help of a good moisturizer (otherwise it would dry me out too much) which this company also has (although somewhat spendy it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to work). This bottle lasts me about 6-8 months with only needing about a nickel-sized amount each time. I also use a Clarisonic Mia brush (this is only once a day) which I can use with this soap rather than Clarisonic&#x27;s, which has &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; results.</li>
            <li> This with the combo of other products by them it has given me clear skin. Very very satisfactory. #1 product for me.</li>
            <li> This cleanser isnt bad, and lasts a long time, but it doesnt cleanse very well. Ive switched back to neutrogena antiaging antiblemish cleanser. I will continue to use skinceuticals toner and sunscreen but not the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.  I have very oily, acne prone skin and since I have started using this I&#x27;ve noticed my face has been considerably less greasy and I am having fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Works great on my sensitive skin to take care of my hormonal acne. In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but wished it was less expensive.  I am trying to compare the contents to ones sold at the stores and hoping to find similar and a less expensive price.</li>
            <li> I am 38 and have had acne since I was 12. This is by far the best cleanser on the market! I would recommend this to anyone and if used with the other Skinceutical acne products, you will notice your pores will shrink and blemishes gone!!</li>
            <li> I got the kit for this for my adult acne. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING! Long story short, my cleanser was broken during a plane ride on vacation. My face seemed good, so decided I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money. Bought another brand and REGRET it. I broke out immediately! Bought the cleanser again and all is better. it&#x27;s worth the money, plus you only need a tiny bit when you use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My face has never been this clean! It also does not dry my face out, which is a big plus!</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended this product to me and I instantly fell in love with it.  It is a great face wash that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.  It also lasts forever because you only need to use a little dime size when you wash your face.</li>
            <li> This Product is simply one of the best things that I have ever used on my face. Skinceuticals is amazing. I will be using this for a very long time.</li>
            <li> So far this is a great product, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Im over thirty and still get pimples pretty frequently.  I think this stuff has helped.  Give it a try.  Also good to try for acne prone adult skin is Murad.</li>
            <li> Again another product... i swear i was such a product whore. Im glad that i listen to my self more than the doctors who prescribe it. In actuality compared to all the thousands of products i&#x27;ve wasted my time and money on... this is by far the one that kills &amp;#34;bacteria&amp;#34; with out drying out my skin. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Works great on my sensitive, occasional breakout skin. Gentle but cleans well. Been using for past 6 months and sticking with it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 1 week, but it seems to keep my face clean and refreshing, A little pricey but if it keeps working like it is, It is well worth it</li>
            <li> Amazing!! So glad I found this product again it&#x27;s the best!! Defiantly saved my skin . Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> runny consistency almost watered down. Not what im used to seeing/ordering.  Dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Has helped minimize my pores and feels great to wash with - definitely get a wonderfully clean feeling.  I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash! I have combo skin and it clears my clogged T-zone with out over drying the rest of my face.. Nice cooling sensation and a DAB WILL DO YA! Just need a teeny bit and I use my clarisonic (but not required!) My teenage son loves it too!</li>
            <li> Works well for me. I use it with a Clairsonic face washer</li>
            <li> Switched to this product after using MD Forte Glycare Cleansng Gel (now discontinued). Can feel it stimulating skin daily. Pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It takes very little (I found out after the first use) to clean off all makeup. It doesn&#x27;t take off waterproof mascara on the first try but I use a disposable makeup pad first that takes most of it off then when I&#x27;m ready to use this gel, it all comes off with everything else. It really makes your skin feel clean without feeling dry. I will definitely continue with this product.</li>
            <li> This skin line caused a terrible reaction which included welts on my face and chest area for 2 days.  When I approached the company  about this situation they refused a refund. I finally received my refund a couple of months later but not by them. This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
            <li> LHA Cleansing Gel  - only use a small amount (dime size) to get started - goes along way. Has a thicker texture than expected, performs as designed.</li>
            <li> This is not the correct product. I have been using this for over a year and have replenished multiple times. Although it was sealed, the consistency and smell are very different. It also broke me out completely and have red hive/splotches all over my face. However i do recommend this product, just not from here</li>
            <li> I have moderate to oily skin and have been battling minor adult acne.  I was using Arbonne RE9 for a couple years and my face was breaking out, so I added Clean &amp; Clear to my 2x daily facial washing.  It was a pain to have to wash my face 2 times (2 different products) twice a day and the acne was still there a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started the Skinceuticals LHA Cleansing Gel about a week ago.  I immediately saw improvements and now after a week my face is clear and acne free.  It does not dry out my skin at all (note: I do use Skinceuticals moisturizers and products with it and I have been very happy with them too).  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Although the package was sealed, this product did not seem to be an &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; Skinceutical&amp;#34; product. The contents have a very strange coloring to them almost yellow. I have used this particular cleasing gel for a few years now and it is &amp;#34;CLEAR&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know if this product was just very old, if the contents were changed or what might be the issue. I can&#x27;t bring myself to use it for fear I might break out or something. I&#x27;ll chalk it up to a loss and not use this vendor anymore.</li>
            <li> I have oily, sun damaged skin and am 42 years old, this is an excellent product. My 16 year old son that has acne prone skin uses it as well and loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  Because it is expensive, occasionally I will try something else.  But I always come back to this one.  I am 53 and have the skin of a 40 year old.  This cleanser is part of my arsenal for keeping my skin nice and clear.</li>
            <li> I love skinceuticals and have used a lot of their products. this cleanser really does clean my face and help remove blemishes and keeps my skin looking flawless</li>
            <li> This cleans well, makes your face smooth after using.  Has a slight tingling feeling which I don&#x27;t mind much.  I have been using Skinceutical products for over a year now and am very pleased with their results.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff from my dermotologist (significantly cheaper on amazon) and let me tell you, it is the best face wash I have ever had!</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinceuticals products for a couple of years now, and my skin has never been healthier and better looking! I love this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;One thing though : I have purchased LHA cleansing gel first from a local spa, the next one from this dealer on Amazon, then this most recent one I got from my spa again. There is no doubt in my mind that the bottle purchased here was watered down. There is a very obvious difference.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product; I just can&#x27;t recommend buying it from an unauthorized dealer. Usually I go where the deals are, but in this case.....not so much. I won&#x27;t order this here again.</li>
            <li> I had been using Cetaphil with my Clarisonic brush and still had visibly large pores.  This has tightened up my skin without it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Five Stars In Every Way*****</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, does the job without harsh scrubbing, irritation. Changed my skin routine forever! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I  was  on  Accutane  as a  teen.  Acne  was  mostly  gone  but I  had  the  occasional  pimple  during  my  period.  That  is  until I  hit  my  mid  thirties.  I&#x27;ve  been  having a  little  bit  of a  flare and  developed a  couple  of  scars  on  my  right  cheek.  I  bought  this  product  after  reading  reviews  and  have  been  very  impressed  so  far.  I  haven&#x27;t  had a  pimple  since I  started  using  it  and  the  scars  are  starting  to  fade.  I  personally  don&#x27;t  think  the  price  is  that  bad,  the  drug  store  products I  was  using  were  expensive  and  left  my  skin  irritated.  I  was  worried  it  would  be  too  drying  but, it  hasn&#x27;t  been.</li>
            <li> This has a refreshing tingle that leaves my face feeling fresh.  DO NOT put a pump in the bottle.  I thought why not put this pump from a different Skinceuticals product in to make myself have one less step in my shower, well the LHA or whatever is in there has caused the spring in the pump to rust so now my $40 face soap is a pale purple, I don&#x27;t want to add that chemical reaction to my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best line I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have had acne for over 13 years and this is the only product to completely get rid of it. It took about a month. It did not overdry, breakout or agitate my skin. I couldn&#x27;t even tell it was working because I didn&#x27;t have any of the usual side effects of acne products (agitation, dryness, etc). I could tell it was effective at cleansing so I kept using it and the acne simply disappeared. Buy it in the kit with the toner, and blemish+age defense. This has changed my skin completely. I love it and recommend it to everyone. I have tried everything and this is the best.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended using LHA Facial Cleanser in addition to some other products to help my adult acne.  I thought it was a little pricey, until I realized you only use about a dime sized amount.  I started using this in March and am still on my first bottle.  I am currently pregnant so this is the only product I am using on my face.  Your face just feels clean after you use it.  It works well and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful this wash was going to help keep my skin clear. I have oily skin and tend to break out. But, this stuff did not do the job, at all. I am very disappointed. Neutrogena oil free cleanser works so much better and it is 4 times cheaper! I will not be buying this again. In fact, this is the third Skinceuticals item I have purchased that did not do what it says it does. I wont be buying thier brand anymore.</li>
            <li> I like the wash.  It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.  Nice minty smell and clean feel.  The reason I gave it a 4 is because I don&#x27;t believe its over the top outstanding.  it is a quality wash with a nice smell and clean feel.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser, but it can be drying if used everyday. I will purchase this cleanser again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found in my 24years of acne that has helped completely! I rarely have a blemish now &amp; if this product goes away I will most likely cry everyday forever! I love love this product.</li>
            <li> My stepdaughter purchased this product and insist that I try it, I did and purchased my own quickly.  I am 37 and realized that I can&#x27;t use the $5 drug store face washes anymore.  I find just a pea size amount is enough to wash my face and get all the makeup off.  Don&#x27;t be shocked by the price this bottle will last for a long time and it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The package was damaged and obviously opened prior to sale. The original white top seal on the bottle was broken/opened and had splits and torn edges. A new seal was placed on top of the original(clear with blue writing). I don&#x27;t know if the product inside was affected or replaced  but I would have to assume so.</li>
            <li> As someone who has suffered with acne and sensitive, oily skin for over 25 years I have tried everything on the market to keep blemishes at bay, from over-the counter products, to Proactive, to Accutane and Retin-A. I can honestly say this is the best cleanser I have ever used. After a few days of morning and night use I noticed a huge improvement in my skin texture and in breakout intensity.The blemishes I had cleared faster. The product also feels good on the skin, doesn&#x27;t sting, and makes skin baby soft. Anyone who has tried everything out there for acne should give this product a try. I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best AHA product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and as described.  I heard about this product because it came as a sample with another product I purchased.  I find it a little drying, so good for problem skin.  Take off your mascara first, it shouldn&#x27;t be used in that regard. A little goes a looong way so I do expect it to last a good while.</li>
            <li> A bit drying but with a moisturizer it may be tolerable.  Supposed to be very good for acne prone skin and cell turnover.  I&#x27;m going to try it with the Blemish + Age acne treatment gel.  Love the Amazon price and the seller was fast with shipping!</li>
            <li> I have an oily complexion and find that the product with LHA is much better for me. This is the best cleanser that I have used and I have used a lot of different ones.....</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used. I have tried over 20 other brands and this one blows those out of the water. I use this cleanser with my Clarisonic. It has unclogged my pores and cleared them up. My pores look smaller now and my skin glows from this product (it is not as oily as it previously was). I will not use anything else again! The anti-aging properties of this cleanser are a bonus also, my skin looks younger. My husband has been using this with me and his skin looks amazing as well. (Neither one of us had major acne....just the occasional breakout and we both have oily skin) This cleanser is great and does all it advertises. Definitely try this out!</li>
            <li> Works well with the clarisonic Mia and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, even when used daily! Was introduced to it at the Ritz in Maui during a facial.</li>
            <li> Perfect cleanser for my combo skin. Only a little is needed and suds up nicely. Also has a cooling feeling after wash.</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans my face thoroughly (no make-up left) without drying or any other unpleasant side effects.  I have combination, blemish prone skin (especially in the t-zone area) and this cleanser doesn&#x27;t aggravate it.  Of course, I rely mainly on my other products for skin problems or wrinkles, but this is a good solid face cleanser.</li>
            <li> i enjoin this product,</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals LHA Cleansing Gel has proven to be the best cleanser I have found so far for my &#x27;troubled&#x27; sometimes dry skin.  The maturing process along with a thyroid condition has changed my facial skin from somewhat oily to now most times dry skin.  This LHA cleansing gel cleanses deeply with a minty, fresh scent, but is not harsh and leaves my skin feeling more &#x27;balanced&#x27; and smooth. I use it morning and night.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this cleanser! It&#x27;s gentle and leaves the skin so soft. I have been using it on my chest and neck as well. I don&#x27;t have many issues with pimples or acne at all, but the small areas on my chin and chest have cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li> washes off everything and keeps acne free most of the time compared to other products I have used</li>
            <li> I got a good sized sample of this cleanser after a facial. I can&#x27;t believe Skinceuticals is able to charge this much for a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t even remove make-up. After using this, I had to wash my face with another cleanser to get my make-up off ... and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m using water-proof, industrial strength mascara and make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on an expensive cleanser that is on your face for less than 60 seconds and you wash down the drain - especially THIS cleanser that doesn&#x27;t properly cleanse skin. Personally, I like Neutrogena&#x27;s One-Step Gentle Make-up Remover cleanser and GloProfessional&#x27;s Clarifying Cleanser with salicylic acid. Both are also SLS free.</li>
            <li> Nice feeling of clean, refreshness.</li>
            <li> great for my sons acne</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have struggled with hard acne under my skin for a few years. I am Asian, have oily skin, and live in a dry climate. This product is amazing! I am using it with the phytocorrect gel, and my skin finally feels smooth. It&#x27;s only been two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for over a year and love it. The cleanser helps fight pimples and keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing.  Smells divine and it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.  I really enjoy it combined with the toner and moisturizer.  I dont use anything else.  My skin has come alive!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash! Great price and fast shipment also!</li>
            <li> All the Skinceutical products are wonderful and cheaper on Amazon than at most Salons/Spas.  Great service - at your door step in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash and toner combo for about 3 years now; it seems pricy but you only need the size of a dime to do the work. I used to tan a lot (terrible, I know) so I had a ton of sun damage. After about a year and a half my sun damage was gone and almost all of my freckles were as well! I always get compliments on my skin and this is all I use. I also buy their clay mask as well, This seller delivered everything quickly and nothing is ever broken or leaking. I hope they will continue to carry this product forever.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years; this particular bottle was ver y watered down. I am not usre if the company has changed the ingredients but it has a different consistency.</li>
            <li> Good face wash.  Can use daily without drying.  Best results use a daily moisturizer afterwards.  Just takes a little and lasts a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinceuticals for over 6 years and have tried most of their products.  This LHA Cleansing Gel is one I always go back to.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about Skinceauticals products. Today was my first time using the product and i love it! It&#x27;s soft and feels so good when you massage your face. My face feels SO good and looks radiant</li>
            <li> This is the best. Don&#x27;t miss out on this great product. If you will try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product by skin has never look so good aging skin also blackheads used retinae many products from dermatologist this by far has worked the best</li>
            <li> This facial wash is amazing!  I have large pores and oily skin.  As an adult that does not suffer from acne, I found that it was hard to find good face washes for this problem. This one does the trick.  It is gentle enough to use twice a day, but does a great job of making my skin feel extremely clean.  I have a noticeable difference in pore size.  I will buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li> very good product and quality</li>
            <li> OMG!!! This cleansing gel is AMAZING. I got a facial at Skin Spirit in Palo Alto, Ca and she used this product on me and I just feel in love with it. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else ever again on my face. I never break out anymore and my face really does feel extremely clean after I use these.</li>
            <li> So far love it. Removes leftover makeup well. I usually remove my makeup first and then use this in an attempt to get the best benefit of the LHAs. I&#x27;m using it with other things so I can&#x27;t be sure what is helping the most.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and have tried numerous products over the years trying to combat this issue. I have been using this product for three years and my skin has never looked so healthy.  I receive compliments all the time on the smooth texture of my skin, even without make-up.  I am prone to adult acne breakouts, but this product has really kept that problem under control.  I am definitely a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I got this product after seeing my roommates face improve dramatically after using it and then reading the other reviews on Amazon.  Almost immediately after starting using it, my skin began to change.  It became much drier and I had a sense that it was working.  Within two weeks, I had fewer pimples.  After 8 weeks, I now have basically none.  Instead of having 5-10 pimples on my face at any given time, I now have 0-1.  My pores are smaller, blackheads are smaller and fewer in number, and I am hooked on this face wash.  It&#x27;s expensive, but totally worth it if you have tried other solutions but still have acne in your late 20s.  Hands down, the best weapon against acne I have encountered in my over 10 year war!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have suffered from pimples and imperfect skin my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;In my 30s now, pimples have become more resilient and &amp;#34;matured&amp;#34;. They are no longer angry red flares but small hard nodes&lt;br /&gt;that refuse to give up residency. I have gone through three other brands of cleansers targeted at acne skin in the last 1.5 years but this is the best so far. Previously, I used pretty normal cleansers. I have been using this for a month now and some of those nodes are gone. My skin looks calmer, feels cleaner and is less congested. This is going to be a life long product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products I recommend to try for problem skin:&lt;br /&gt;Sothy&#x27;s purifying lotion as a toner and spot treatment&lt;br /&gt;SkinCeuticals AOX serum ( 10 or 15+)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser! I break out easily, but I&#x27;m always open to try a good cleanser.  Since I&#x27;ve heard a lot a good reviews on this product, and was willing to give it a try.  I did not break out, the product left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.  There was no residue left over and It smells minty.  Not only was this product beyond my expectations but my cleanser was delivered so fast. I am definitely getting this one again!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Lots of toxic chemicals&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money&lt;br /&gt;there are better natural products&lt;br /&gt;seems to cause worse breakouts&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Skinceuticals products before, but have to say that as far as balancing and controlling oil I noticed the biggest impact from this product.  I usually get super oily a few hours after I put on my makeup, but within a week of using this, I noticed my face was much less oily.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the smell.  It&#x27;s a little strong, but nothing too bad.  I&#x27;ve certainly had cleansers that smelled worse and did less.</li>
            <li> I continue to use this, not too strong and not too mild either just perfect for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;it does not make it dry or oily.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of cleansers, to me this is the best.</li>
            <li> This facial wash is great even for dry skin.  It is recommended for oily or difficult skin, but if you have dry problematic skin it also works.</li>
            <li> Great and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Bought this one before, it&#x27;s great, just be careful not to over use as it can dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and I find this product extremely drying. After using it, my skin feels incredibly dry, and my T zone becomes very oily, just minutes after using it while my cheeks stay dry and itchy. It also smells horrible, like medicine, which doesn&#x27;t go away. Makes me sick. Not happy with this product, even though I like most products from Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> I like how this product smells...very light.  It&#x27;s very refreshing, leaves my skin feeling wonderful and really keeps it clear!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing.  I use a facial wipe to remove all my make-up and then I apply the cleanser to my clarisonic brush to break up and deep cleanse my skin.  I have not encounter any negative reactions or breakouts.  I like the fact that you only need a dime size your face.  I would definitely recommend this cleansing gel.</li>
