            <li> I got this because I didn&#x27;t wanna spend all my money on crustin dweeber but I loved the smell of his girl perfume. So! I got the impression! And it smells great! I wish it would last a bittttt longer but I shouldn&#x27;t even complain cause it was a great price! I&#x27;d recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Item came in secured nicely, no damage, everything was good and I def enjoyed the product, the perfume is a nice fruity smell and lasts for AGES. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This item smells better than the real thing. When you spray it you are blasted with sweetness - so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of sweet this isn&#x27;t for you. I was in the mall today and compared it to the real thing, and in my opinion its much better -real someday smells like alcohol initially and this doesn&#x27;t... It&#x27;s just not quite as long lasting. It is also sweeter, almost like a cotton candy type of smell mixed with fruits and then florals. For the price point you can&#x27;t beat it. Wish they made a lotion so it could be layered.</li>
            <li> Really like that this perfume smells just like the actual Bieber perfume....  the bottle is very cute!! The price is wonderful and the fragrance is awesome.</li>
            <li> I did a side by side comparison of the original \\&quot;SOMEDAY\\&quot; fragrance by Justin Bieber and this \\&quot;ENJOY IT! TODAY!\\&quot; fragrance by Preferred Fragrances and I was pleasantly surprised by the result. On first spray, the impression fragrance did not smell anything like the original but as it dried down to the sweet and playful scent of \\&quot;SOMEDAY\\&quot;, it did smell like it and it had a staying power, too.&lt;br /&gt;This scent is wonderful and I do smell the notes of red berries and pear and not too much of its floral notes. It&#x27;s a beautiful combination of sweet and fruity notes with a dry down scent of vanilla and slight hint of musk, very youthful!  It&#x27;s a superb value!</li>
            <li> I love this bottle unfortunately, this triggered my allergies.Major sneeze fest and an instant migraine.I am sure others will love it unfortunately, I was gifted with a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a Christmas present, and I have been told that they really love it. It smells just like, Justin Bieber&#x27;s Someday. I am so glad that&lt;br /&gt;I gave this perfume a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You, Amazon</li>
            <li> love love love this scent ... for the price it a great buy,, mild and stays on u for a considerable amount of time</li>
            <li> I found this at the dollar store for 3 $ dollars , its not a big deal I wear it for gym the smell goes fast</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars only because I received it on time. I got my package with a big hole in the box! I also received this package with perfume leaking out... The outside of the perfume bottle was slimy and the flower on top was scratched up. Other reviews made it sound like this perfume would smell like cotton candy and I can honestly say I&#x27;m disappointed. This is the worst smelling perfume I have ever received. It smells lmusky and like mildew.</li>
            <li> This fragrance was fantastic, it smells great. Exactly like the real thing and maybe even better. The seller is good to buy from and work with. Definitialy a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> I got if for a present and the person who got it was totally happy with it, the smell is sweet,but not too sweet, just great, I really liked it and so my friend, over all I like the way it smells..</li>
            <li> The perfume was just what I expected.  The girl I gave it to was quite happy with it.  I would recommend it.</li>

            <li> I got sick when I first sprayed it!! The bottle looks ugly and the scent is very cheap</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. It&#x27;s light and feminine. Also, I like the price. You get a pretty big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 7 year old neice who has been asking for the JB perfume forever, she was sooo excited and didn&#x27;t even realize it wasnt the real thing. it smells just as good and the packaging was adorable!</li>
            <li> When one of my friends told me she loved the Justin Bieber perfume i wanted to get her it but it was very expensive. This was much cheaper and just as good.</li>

            <li> I ran across this when my niece had it on one day. I couldn&#x27;t believe it wasn&#x27;t the actual brand! It smells fresh and clean and lasts long. I just got mine early this morning (as of 8/26/13) and It is currently early afternoon. I have not had to reapply of refreshen the scent and it still smells great!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells wonderful and is surprisingly long lasting. Very fast shipping, too, I might add. My boyfriend loves the light smell of this perfume, which is a major plus! Definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This knock off smells good, it shipped extremely fast, and its in a cute bottle. The only downside was that it doesn&#x27;t last long at all, which is understandable. Great price.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas, and she loves it. I would definitely recommend this to all mothers and fathers who are looking to buy their daughters perfume.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like the much more expense name brand. Highly recommended. At a fraction of the name brand cost, it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Got this for my little sister who LOVES Justin Bieber.&lt;br /&gt;Was worried about it not smelling good, but I think it smells AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;I actually wanna get one for myself because of how good it smells. :)</li>
