            <li>I researched another product and a rating service rated this product as the best available.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was done to ensure a good delivery outcome.  </li>

            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Glad I could find it at Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love this product..!  </li>
            <li>Works great on my fine, thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I have always liked living proof mousse</li>
            <li>, I decided to try Living Proof mousse on the enthusiastic recommendation of the saleswoman at Nordstrom.  </li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t plastered to my face after using it, but I can&#x27;t get the kind of body I am used to.</li>
            <li>Smells great and adds significant volume</li>
            <li>My best friend is a professional hair stylist and so I have tried all the products in her salon and</li>
            <li>When I did shake it thoroughly, it applied much more nicely</li>
            <li>Love this product, it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It applies easily with a great dispenser head and both holds and adds fabulous volume.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this mousse gives it body and shape which lasts between hair washes.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and need all the help I can get to keep my style in shape.</li>
            <li>I have the wimpiest, baby fine hair!  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic!</li>
            <li>the only caviat is that one must experiment to find what ammount of mousse is best so that it doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy ...</li>
            <li>I felt like I kept needing more and more.</li>
            <li>it does appear that I have better hair.  </li>
            <li>Greatest volumizing/thickening cream I&#x27;ve found in the last 10 years!!  </li>
            <li>Will buy again and maybe try more products from this line.</li>
            <li>The Mousse was not any better than mousses I have used that cost $7.00.  </li>
            <li>But I will continue to use it and experiment with ways to get the top of my head to look like it&#x27;s got more hair than it does.  </li>
            <li>Using this product gives me volume and I am able to hold a style.  </li>
            <li>Love this mousse.  </li>
            <li>Gives my hair texture and does thicken the hair at the top of my head where it is thinning.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say for sure that I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I love it and so does she.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;We were able to purchase from you cheaper than from a store in town.</li>
            <li>Works even better if you use all 3 products together (the shampoo, conditioner and mousse)</li>
            <li>Love this product my hair feels thicker</li>
            <li>However, this mousse is the one that made the most difference.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>This is an OK product.</li>
            <li>first I didn&#x27;t think I liked it because it didn&#x27;t dispense into a nice \\&quot;pile\\&quot; in my hand and seemed sort of sticky in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it made my hear fabulous, but it does make it better.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t really seem to have any &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; properties.  </li>
            <li>I really do think it may be the most effective product I have tried in all these years for added fullness to my hairdo.</li>
            <li>I just love all of Living Proof&#x27;s Full products, haven&#x27;t tried one yet</li>
            <li>This mousse is hands down the best mousse.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that always lost body even after setting ...</li>
            <li>Thickens fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it does help.</li>
            <li>My thinning fine hair needs a boost.  </li>
            <li>Fine hair, medium thickness.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It makes my fine hair have body and helps it look full.</li>
            <li>I still need to use strong hairspray to keep it in place, but at least I am off to the best start I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine and straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair looking good the next day also.</li>
            <li>At minimum, I was seeking the Living Proof Full Thickening Mousse.</li>
            <li>B004I27M48 Living Proof Full Thickening Mousse 5 oz]]</li>
            <li>and I really like a lot of lift on top.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and it works great without making it sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li>I used to be a loyal fan of Kerastase mousee, but this has replaced them in the styling product spot.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the mousse blended quickly in and I could actually feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have loads of fine and straight hair that needs a mousse for volume.  </li>
            <li>I gently touch my hands together and then lightly touch my hair all over.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product when all others seem really heavy or gummy</li>
            <li>I had a friend work for Living Proof for many years, at their lab and just expected more.</li>
            <li>Rarely use it.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is kind of gross.</li>
            <li>, I have five salon mousses under my sink right now.</li>
            <li>not sure it works all that great</li>
            <li>My wife loves this product, She wishes she had found out about this product years ago, It gives great volume without being too  heavy!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is unusual but not bad.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, short hair</li>
            <li>for me, I have blow dry and tease to get kind of volume.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is average at best and has a tendency to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>Once I discovered this product, nobody would think I had such fine hair!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, flat hair.  </li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>It really helps!  </li>
            <li>I have had FINE, THIN hair my whole life and have tried many, many products over the years that claim to add volume and fullness to hair - and this mousse works.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li>After using it in the morning, I am always surprised how full it still feels at night.</li>
            <li>I had low expectations as I have tried a zillion products to boost my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This helps my thinning hair feel much thicker...</li>
            <li>If it cost the same or only slightly more than drug store brands I would buy it again, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much.  </li>
            <li>Living Proof thickening mousse really worked well for my hair.  </li>
            <li>But this product really makes my hair look and feel much thicker and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>My hair is much fuller.</li>
            <li>This really helps your hair look thicker.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and like to blow it out.</li>
            <li>I Like this product &amp; will absolutely be reordering this again.</li>
            <li>It actually makes ur hair feel and look thicker and gives great volume, but it is not sticky or stiff at all.  </li>
            <li>Adds more fullness than other styling products that I have used.</li>
            <li>I find that most of the Living Proof products are drying, I think due to the fact they are trying to \\&quot;fatten\\&quot; the hair up.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, too -- not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Gives more volume, without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I found this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>This is another great Hair product from Living Proof,I have thin Hair and with this i can see how full my Hair looks ,this is not sticky or crunchy feeling and has not weighed my Hair down.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing fantastic for my hair, i felt like it weighed it down.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair that goes flat with any kind of &amp;</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>This mousse is fabulous, had to experiment with amount to use, only need a little, I love it and will try other products in the line, also!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product as far as helping my hair thicken and stay in place in a humid climate, but I absolutely hate the nozzle that delivers the foam.  </li>
            <li>It is not too heavy or too light and it makes my hair curl without even using a curling brush or iron.</li>
            <li>I can use it twice before I shampoo again and that keeps my color alive longer.</li>
            <li>This light mouse did not weigh too heavily on my hair.  </li>
            <li>My 90yr old mothers hairdresser told us about it.</li>
            <li>i was surprised</li>
            <li>This is quite pricey for mousse, however you need much less and it does not make my hair dry like most of them do.</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, I do find this is the only mousse that doesn&#x27;t make my hair flatter than normal.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, I decided I had to get the full size....</li>
            <li>In case this is helpful to anyone else with my hair type: I have thin, fine, straight, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>This product really does the trick for my fine, thin and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>you need to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>I have gray, naturally curly, fairly short hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having lived with and fought against a lifetime of thin, challenging hair, I set about on a relentless quest to find these products.</li>
            <li>Nice product, not too expensive.</li>
            <li>was approximately 50% more than in retail stores</li>
            <li>Not cheap - but worth the price.</li>
            <li>used twice it definetly creates more volume would recommend if you have thin hair with no body</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin blonde hair</li>
            <li>I think this mousse gave my thin wavy hair an 20% increase in volume, which isn&#x27;t much, but most give much less than that.</li>
            <li>and I find this product gives my hair alot of body and makes it very manageable without  weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder-length, color treated, fine, and thin.</li>
            <li>I still have fine, thin hair, but this product definitely helps when I style it.  </li>

            <li> This is an OK product.</li>
            <li> first I didn&#x27;t think I liked it because it didn&#x27;t dispense into a nice \\&quot;pile\\&quot; in my hand and seemed sort of sticky in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it made my hear fabulous, but it does make it better.  </li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t really seem to have any &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; properties.  </li>
            <li> I really do think it may be the most effective product I have tried in all these years for added fullness to my hairdo.</li>
            <li> I just love all of Living Proof&#x27;s Full products, haven&#x27;t tried one yet</li>
            <li> This mousse is hands down the best mousse.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that always lost body even after setting ...</li>
            <li> Thickens fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it does help.</li>
            <li> My thinning fine hair needs a boost.  </li>
            <li> Fine hair, medium thickness.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It makes my fine hair have body and helps it look full.</li>
            <li> I still need to use strong hairspray to keep it in place, but at least I am off to the best start I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine and straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair looking good the next day also.</li>
            <li> At minimum, I was seeking the Living Proof Full Thickening Mousse.</li>
            <li> B004I27M48 Living Proof Full Thickening Mousse 5 oz]]</li>
            <li> and I really like a lot of lift on top.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and it works great without making it sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a loyal fan of Kerastase mousee, but this has replaced them in the styling product spot.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the mousse blended quickly in and I could actually feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have loads of fine and straight hair that needs a mousse for volume.  </li>
            <li> I gently touch my hands together and then lightly touch my hair all over.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product when all others seem really heavy or gummy</li>
            <li> I had a friend work for Living Proof for many years, at their lab and just expected more.</li>
            <li> Rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is kind of gross.</li>
            <li> , I have five salon mousses under my sink right now.</li>
            <li> not sure it works all that great</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product, She wishes she had found out about this product years ago, It gives great volume without being too  heavy!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is unusual but not bad.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, short hair</li>
            <li> for me, I have blow dry and tease to get kind of volume.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is average at best and has a tendency to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Once I discovered this product, nobody would think I had such fine hair!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, flat hair.  </li>
            <li> Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> It really helps!  </li>
            <li> I have had FINE, THIN hair my whole life and have tried many, many products over the years that claim to add volume and fullness to hair - and this mousse works.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> After using it in the morning, I am always surprised how full it still feels at night.</li>
            <li> I had low expectations as I have tried a zillion products to boost my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This helps my thinning hair feel much thicker...</li>
            <li> If it cost the same or only slightly more than drug store brands I would buy it again, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much.  </li>
            <li> Living Proof thickening mousse really worked well for my hair.  </li>
            <li> But this product really makes my hair look and feel much thicker and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My hair is much fuller.</li>
            <li> This really helps your hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and like to blow it out.</li>
            <li> I Like this product &amp; will absolutely be reordering this again.</li>
            <li> It actually makes ur hair feel and look thicker and gives great volume, but it is not sticky or stiff at all.  </li>
            <li> Adds more fullness than other styling products that I have used.</li>
            <li> I find that most of the Living Proof products are drying, I think due to the fact they are trying to \\&quot;fatten\\&quot; the hair up.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, too -- not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Gives more volume, without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I found this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This is another great Hair product from Living Proof,I have thin Hair and with this i can see how full my Hair looks ,this is not sticky or crunchy feeling and has not weighed my Hair down.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing fantastic for my hair, i felt like it weighed it down.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair that goes flat with any kind of &amp;</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> This mousse is fabulous, had to experiment with amount to use, only need a little, I love it and will try other products in the line, also!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product as far as helping my hair thicken and stay in place in a humid climate, but I absolutely hate the nozzle that delivers the foam.  </li>
            <li> It is not too heavy or too light and it makes my hair curl without even using a curling brush or iron.</li>
            <li> I can use it twice before I shampoo again and that keeps my color alive longer.</li>
            <li> This light mouse did not weigh too heavily on my hair.  </li>
            <li> My 90yr old mothers hairdresser told us about it.</li>
            <li> i was surprised</li>
            <li> This is quite pricey for mousse, however you need much less and it does not make my hair dry like most of them do.</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, I do find this is the only mousse that doesn&#x27;t make my hair flatter than normal.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I decided I had to get the full size....</li>
            <li> In case this is helpful to anyone else with my hair type: I have thin, fine, straight, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> This product really does the trick for my fine, thin and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li> you need to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> I have gray, naturally curly, fairly short hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having lived with and fought against a lifetime of thin, challenging hair, I set about on a relentless quest to find these products.</li>
            <li> Nice product, not too expensive.</li>
            <li> was approximately 50% more than in retail stores</li>
            <li> Not cheap - but worth the price.</li>
            <li> used twice it definetly creates more volume would recommend if you have thin hair with no body</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin blonde hair</li>
            <li> I think this mousse gave my thin wavy hair an 20% increase in volume, which isn&#x27;t much, but most give much less than that.</li>
            <li> and I find this product gives my hair alot of body and makes it very manageable without  weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder-length, color treated, fine, and thin.</li>
            <li> I still have fine, thin hair, but this product definitely helps when I style it.  </li>
            <li> I eventually ordered the entire line of \\&quot;Full\\&quot; products (I have a few other reviews) and jumped right into trying the mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not blow dry my hair and have used this as a natural dry - it rocks</li>
            <li> I have short, layered hair, and as I blow dry the volume is instantly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> No more than a golf ball sized spray does a whole head of medium length hair.</li>
            <li> This helps with the volume, because my hair is so flat otherwise</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair straight and this keeps it that way without making it stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> I got some for each of my daughters, who sadly inherited my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The mousse picks up where the back combing left off and also gives the back comb a little something to hold with.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s texture has changed as I aged, also gets colored and highlighted regularly</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing it more from amazon, it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> This mousse doesn&#x27;t seem very much different from any other mousse I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> My hair is short and I like it that way due to out door activities and with this,  </li>
            <li> I have begun using several other Living Proof thickening products and like them as well.  </li>
            <li> I think I prefer though the cream version of this product for blow dry hair instead, it prolongs it.</li>
            <li> If you go a day between hair washings, you might feel the need for a touch of dry shampoo to freshen up the volume a bit.</li>
            <li> Either wet or dry and helps hold in my style.</li>
            <li> Very little thickening is apparent ...pleasant scent</li>
            <li> I like it, and was careful to use it just as directed.  </li>
            <li> It did not give the lift I expected at my roots</li>
            <li> About halfway empty, the container ran out of pressure.  </li>
            <li> Another product I use along with the mousse is Jason Thin to Thick Shampoo which is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fine hair just looks lousy!</li>
            <li> I have used other types of thickening mousse</li>
            <li> I have tried other salon products but none do what this one does with the results I get.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different products in the past, and Living Proof&#x27;s products are keepers.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, but even when you use a small amount, weighs heavier  on your hair than  my Aveda Phomollient which is my preferred mousse (lighter, less expensive, etc).</li>
            <li> I can go every other day without washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair as usual and it actually felt and looked thicker.</li>
            <li> Just remember when you use this have to spray this up,not down.</li>
            <li> I noticed a SLIGHTLY thicker feel and look to my hair.</li>
            <li> And I use way less hair spray to keep it in place</li>
            <li> Previously, I had been using Got2B Fat-Tastic mousse, which I also recommend.</li>
            <li> It thickened it up without making it a goopy mess.</li>
            <li> I use only a bit, as I notice if I use too much, my hair loses it&#x27;s shine and can look dirty, even though I just washed it.  </li>
            <li> Then I toussle a little in at my roots and rub the remainder wherever I feel the need</li>
            <li> /&gt;After blowdrying (while working with a hair brush), I do back-comb just a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Way too sticky, even with a little.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair greasy and heavy</li>
            <li> What a waste.  </li>
            <li> I buy this every few months.</li>
            <li> Due to the cost for this small can, I am not sure I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Worth the price for my crazy Hair Days!</li>
            <li> use a very small amount or it will tend to weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I have previously used this product and found it to be somewhat helpful in providing volume to thin hair.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;m disappointed and probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I applaud the effort and think it does work to an extent, but it is at a cost to thin hair (at least mine) that I cannot afford on a long-term basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I found the price on Amazon by a third party vendor</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but this mousse both made my hair look thicker and also weighed it down.</li>
            <li> no lif did not noptice any change in my thin hair</li>
            <li> (wind is the enemy of thin hair</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic and not noticeable to anyone but myself.</li>
            <li> I am unlikely to purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Very expensive product at $26.00, but being obsessed with the look of hair throughout my life</li>
            <li> or it makes your hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> it works too expensive !</li>
            <li> and I were so disappointed to find it sticky and flattening to the hair.</li>

            <li> Best thickening mousse ever</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!!  I do not blow dry my hair and have used this as a natural dry - it rocks</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the buzz around it.  I have used other types of thickening mousse but this one is amazing!! It actually makes ur hair feel and look thicker and gives great volume, but it is not sticky or stiff at all.  It also smells great !! I will def be using this from now on!! I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This helps my thinning hair feel much thicker...you need to be careful not to use too much or it makes your hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I have gray, naturally curly, fairly short hair. (I am her Mother) It is not too heavy or too light and it makes my hair curl without even using a curling brush or iron. It is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I noticed a SLIGHTLY thicker feel and look to my hair. Nothing dramatic and not noticeable to anyone but myself. This mousse doesn&#x27;t seem very much different from any other mousse I&#x27;ve ever tried.

            <li> I have fine hair that always lost body even after setting ... now my hair is fuller and feels way thicker ... the only caviat is that one must experiment to find what ammount of mousse is best so that it doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy ... otherwise this is a great product ... kudos to whomever created it!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Best mousse I have used for adding volume to hair.  It has a nice scent, too -- not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Adds more fullness than other styling products that I have used. Leaves my hair looking good the next day also.</li>
            <li> This mousse is great. I blow dry my hair straight and this keeps it that way without making it stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the line of Living Proof hair-care products through a blurb on Yahoo News - it was all about how technology is advancing hair care through a mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having lived with and fought against a lifetime of thin, challenging hair, I set about on a relentless quest to find these products. At minimum, I was seeking the Living Proof Full Thickening Mousse. I eventually ordered the entire line of \\&quot;Full\\&quot; products (I have a few other reviews) and jumped right into trying the mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is average at best and has a tendency to dry out my hair. I find that most of the Living Proof products are drying, I think due to the fact they are trying to \\&quot;fatten\\&quot; the hair up. I applaud the effort and think it does work to an extent, but it is at a cost to thin hair (at least mine) that I cannot afford on a long-term basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, please try it for yourself. If you do not like it, you can always pass along to a friend, which is what I did. The verdict is still out for her, but she seems to like it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wishing you thicker hair!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I have tried other salon products but none do what this one does with the results I get.  Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> not sure it works all that great but I just started using it</li>
            <li> Love this product!  My hair is fine and it works great without making it sticky or heavy.  I have used it for 3 years!</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Just like regular, run in the mill mousse. I see no different in thickening. It did in fact make some hairs &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;. Also the mousse starts dissolving as soon as you put your two hands together to even out the product. I felt like I kept needing more and more. I had a friend work for Living Proof for many years, at their lab and just expected more. Their shampoos are great!</li>
            <li> Thickens fine hair. Gives more volume, without weighing hair down. It does, what it says it will do. Great for thinning hair too.</li>
            <li> It does appear to make you hair fuller and thicker.  My hair is short and I like it that way due to out door activities and with this,  it does appear that I have better hair.  That is what I was looking for and I do have the rest of the Living Proof line - works great</li>
            <li> Greatest volumizing/thickening cream I&#x27;ve found in the last 10 years!!  use a very small amount or it will tend to weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I prefer the cream over mousse.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would be great but it is. I like the way it makes my hair feel and style. Will buy again and maybe try more products from this line.</li>
            <li> This product really does the trick for my fine, thin and wavy hair.  It thickened it up without making it a goopy mess.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, short hair and I find this product gives my hair alot of body and makes it very manageable without  weighing down my hair. I use this product daily.</li>
            <li> did nothing for my hair I will not reorder</li>
            <li> I just love all of Living Proof&#x27;s Full products, haven&#x27;t tried one yet that isn&#x27;t a good product including this one.  I have tried a lot of different products in the past, and Living Proof&#x27;s products are keepers.  I use the entire bottle of all of my LP&#x27;s products.  That in itself is a testimony to a good hair product.  Because believe me when I say, I have thrown out a lot of hair product that didn&#x27;t do anything that it claimed.</li>
            <li> Works great for my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like this product, then you aren&#x27;t applying it correctly. This mousse is hands down the best mousse. And I should know- as a mousse junkie, I have five salon mousses under my sink right now. This is the only one I will ever buy again. And the smell is simply divine.</li>
            <li> The best stuff on the market for hair thickening.  I have used this for several years now and use to buy it from QVC.  Glad I could find it at Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have always liked living proof mousse I have fine hair and it does help. I did not like the looks of it when I got it a bit beat up but I needed it so I kept it.</li>
            <li> The Mousse was not any better than mousses I have used that cost $7.00.  I have purchased it a second time to see if I feel the same about it.  No change in my  opinion about  this product.</li>
            <li> Not too happy with product....no lif did not noptice any change in my thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s texture has changed as I aged, also gets colored and highlighted regularly so I was looking for something to thicken appearance, make it feel good!  This mousse is fabulous, had to experiment with amount to use, only need a little, I love it and will try other products in the line, also!</li>
            <li> Nice product, not too expensive. I have fine, straight hair. It did absolutely nothing fantastic for my hair, i felt like it weighed it down. I won&#x27;t be getting any of the Living Proof products</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and can&#x27;t be without it. It thickens my curly hair and running my damp hands through my hair the day after I shampoo restores it. I can use it twice before I shampoo again and that keeps my color alive longer.</li>
            <li> I had great expectations for this mousse, my hairdresser and I were so disappointed to find it sticky and flattening to the hair. Looking forward to trying the heat styling product but now have lowered my excitement for the products of this line....</li>
            <li> My thinning fine hair needs a boost.  This was recommended by a trusted source so I tried it.  I like it, and was careful to use it just as directed.  I think it&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.  But I will continue to use it and experiment with ways to get the top of my head to look like it&#x27;s got more hair than it does.  I really do think it may be the most effective product I have tried in all these years for added fullness to my hairdo.</li>
            <li> This light mouse did not weigh too heavily on my hair.  However, don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much.  No more than a golf ball sized spray does a whole head of medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product! I have NEVER had such body to my hair with any product before (and I&#x27;ve tried them all). It thickened my hair and feels really good. No stickiness!!&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with this mousse that I just ordered the shampoo, conditioner and hair spray!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t really seem to have any &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; properties.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  Rarely use it.</li>
            <li> I have had FINE, THIN hair my whole life and have tried many, many products over the years that claim to add volume and fullness to hair - and this mousse works.  I use only a bit, as I notice if I use too much, my hair loses it&#x27;s shine and can look dirty, even though I just washed it.  I still have fine, thin hair, but this product definitely helps when I style it.  Another product I use along with the mousse is Jason Thin to Thick Shampoo which is fantastic.  Without these two products, I would probably look bald!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have previously used this product and found it to be somewhat helpful in providing volume to thin hair.  I was shocked when I found the price on Amazon by a third party vendor was approximately 50% more than in retail stores I have since seen it in.  I think that vendors should have to be price competitive and I felt I was gouged on this one. Will not order it again</li>
            <li> Fine hair, medium thickness.  Sticky.  Does nothing.</li>
            <li> Great hold and makes hair fuller</li>
            <li> Living Proof thickening mousse really worked well for my hair.  I have very fine hair and this mousse gives it body and shape which lasts between hair washes.  I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this to see if it worked as well as the styling cr&amp;egrave;me by the same manufacturer.  So far, I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;m disappointed and probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is quite pricey for mousse, however you need much less and it does not make my hair dry like most of them do.</li>
            <li> Very little thickening is apparent ...pleasant scent</li>
            <li> It did not give the lift I expected at my roots and I probably will not buy again but I do like the thickening cream.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product for when my hair became &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34; just  before hair cut.  It works fine, but even when you use a small amount, weighs heavier  on your hair than  my Aveda Phomollient which is my preferred mousse (lighter, less expensive, etc).</li>
            <li> I researched another product and a rating service rated this product as the best available.  I was hesitate to buy because of price, but it is an excellent product, I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims.  I have very fine and straight hair.  Using this product gives me volume and I am able to hold a style.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think this mousse gave my thin wavy hair an 20% increase in volume, which isn&#x27;t much, but most give much less than that. I think I prefer though the cream version of this product for blow dry hair instead, it prolongs it.</li>
            <li> Love this mousse.  A little pricey but worth it.  Gives my hair texture and does thicken the hair at the top of my head where it is thinning.  The fragrance is unusual but not bad.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fine hair just looks lousy! But this product really makes my hair look and feel much thicker and it lasts all day. After using it in the morning, I am always surprised how full it still feels at night. And I use way less hair spray to keep it in place (wind is the enemy of thin hair - blows everywhere). Great product! Not cheap - but worth the price.</li>
            <li> My best friend is a professional hair stylist and so I have tried all the products in her salon and not one of them can give me the lift, volume, and styling capability of this product. I have very fine hair and need all the help I can get to keep my style in shape. The fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong and the results are fantastic. I have tried the shampoos, conditioners and my daughter is hooked on their styling products as well. This is the only product I am going to use from now on!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product, She wishes she had found out about this product years ago, It gives great volume without being too  heavy!</li>
            <li> Very expensive product at $26.00, but being obsessed with the look of hair throughout my life, I decided to try Living Proof mousse on the enthusiastic recommendation of the saleswoman at Nordstrom.  I had low expectations as I have tried a zillion products to boost my fine hair.  Happy to report Living Proof is the best thickener I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I have short, layered hair, and as I blow dry the volume is instantly noticeable.  I still need to use strong hairspray to keep it in place, but at least I am off to the best start I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;m on my second can, and will continue to buy this mousse in spite of the price.</li>
            <li> Have been using this mousse for over a year. Works great on my fine, thinning hair. Best price I have found.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product as far as helping my hair thicken and stay in place in a humid climate, but I absolutely hate the nozzle that delivers the foam.  Nonetheless, I purchased a second bottle.[[ASIN:B004I27M48 Living Proof Full Thickening Mousse 5 oz]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been a big mousse user but I tried this for the hair thickening feature.  The reason I haven&#x27;t used mousses because they often leave white flakes or feel like they add weight to my hair.  I&#x27;ve noticed neither of these effects with Living Proof.  Does it make my hair look thicker?  Sort of, but I can&#x27;t say for sure that I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but this mousse both made my hair look thicker and also weighed it down. My hair isn&#x27;t plastered to my face after using it, but I can&#x27;t get the kind of body I am used to. That sort of defeats the purpose if you ask me. Also, the smell is kind of gross. I will keep trying, but probably will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder-length, color treated, fine, and thin. Previously, I had been using Got2B Fat-Tastic mousse, which I also recommend. [[ASIN:B001S46QIM Got2b Fat-tastic Thickening Plumping Mousse, 8.5-Ounce]] I received a sample of Living Proof in my QVC Test Tube and decided to see if it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t think I liked it because it didn&#x27;t dispense into a nice \\&quot;pile\\&quot; in my hand and seemed sort of sticky in my hair.  But after reading the application instructions I realized that I had not shaken it vigerously as instructed.  When I did shake it thoroughly, it applied much more nicely and I didn&#x27;t think it felt sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a golf ball-sized amount, applied in one hand.  I gently touch my hands together and then lightly touch my hair all over.  Then I toussle a little in at my roots and rub the remainder wherever I feel the need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After blowdrying (while working with a hair brush), I do back-comb just a little bit.  This helps with the volume, because my hair is so flat otherwise and I really like a lot of lift on top.  The mousse picks up where the back combing left off and also gives the back comb a little something to hold with. If you go a day between hair washings, you might feel the need for a touch of dry shampoo to freshen up the volume a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is amazing.  Your hair does not feel gummy after you use it.  I can go every other day without washing my hair.  Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> this is a great product when all others seem really heavy or gummy</li>
            <li> Lives up to its name.  My hair is much fuller.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. Helps keep the curls and the body for days. My 90yr old mothers hairdresser told us about it. I love it and so does she.&lt;br /&gt;We were able to purchase from you cheaper than from a store in town.</li>
            <li> very good . it works too expensive !</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has fine/thin hair.  Gives an incredible amount of volume!!!! Works even better if you use all 3 products together (the shampoo, conditioner and mousse)</li>
            <li> Love this product my hair feels thicker and I have a lot of body.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, flat hair.  While this isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, I do find this is the only mousse that doesn&#x27;t make my hair flatter than normal.</li>
            <li> This really helps your hair look thicker. I have very curly hair and like to blow it out. This product works great!</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time &amp; in Great condition as was described.  The packaging was done to ensure a good delivery outcome.  I have used this product several times &amp; it does make your hair look and feel thicker.  I Like this product &amp; will absolutely be reordering this again.</li>
            <li> Made my hair greasy and heavy</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair that goes flat with any kind of &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; product...except with this one. I had received a sample sized can in a Beauty Test Tube, so I gave this a try on a day I wasn&#x27;t going to leave the house...just in case it...Surprisingly, the mousse blended quickly in and I could actually feel the difference right away. I blow dried my hair as usual and it actually felt and looked thicker. After a few uses, I decided I had to get the full size....I would recommend giving this a try...everyone&#x27;s hair is different...for me, I have blow dry and tease to get kind of volume.  This product helps keep the &amp;#34;height&amp;#34; while still looking like I didn&#x27;t have to do anything...</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome mousse!  It makes my fine hair have body and helps it look full.</li>
            <li> About halfway empty, the container ran out of pressure.  Now nothing foams out.  What a waste.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have the wimpiest, baby fine hair!  I found this product and recommend it highly. It really helps!  I got some for each of my daughters, who sadly inherited my fine hair.  They both loved it, too.  I can&#x27;t say that it made my hear fabulous, but it does make it better.  I have begun using several other Living Proof thickening products and like them as well.  However, this mousse is the one that made the most difference.</li>
            <li> Way too sticky, even with a little.  I prefer the creme.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works on my fine hair,  the best of the best</li>
            <li> Love this product..!  The only one I use.</li>
            <li> This is another great Hair product from Living Proof,I have thin Hair and with this i can see how full my Hair looks ,this is not sticky or crunchy feeling and has not weighed my Hair down.Just remember when you use this have to spray this up,not down.Worth the price for my crazy Hair Days!</li>
            <li> I buy this every few months. I absolutely LOVE this product. I have very fine thin blonde hair and this gives it a great lift. Either wet or dry and helps hold in my style. Love the feel of my hair after I apy this product it looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> I just started using this line of products and have found it to be a great treatment for my hair. I will be purchasing it more from amazon, it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff. Smells great and adds significant volume</li>
            <li> What a wonderful mousse!  I have loads of fine and straight hair that needs a mousse for volume.  Once I discovered this product, nobody would think I had such fine hair!  It applies easily with a great dispenser head and both holds and adds fabulous volume. It never leaves my hair feeling sticky. I used to be a loyal fan of Kerastase mousee, but this has replaced them in the styling product spot.  I follow up blow-drying with my Sultra Bombshell curling want and I am set for hair that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is an OK product. Due to the cost for this small can, I am not sure I would order it again.</li>
            <li> used twice it definetly creates more volume would recommend if you have thin hair with no body i was surprised</li>
