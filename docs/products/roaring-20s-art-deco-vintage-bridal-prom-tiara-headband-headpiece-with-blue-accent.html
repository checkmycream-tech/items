            <li>I kept it and wore it anyway and was able to use the ribbon ties to get the desired look, but amazing that I paid as much money as I did and got a faulty product.</li>

            <li>and I am super</li>
            <li>Very pretty headband.</li>
            <li>Very pretty on my sister - purchased for her bachelorette party.  </li>
            <li>Received this quickly and it was beautiful but as soon as I gently removed it from the package it broke in half.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The metal part of the head band is very large, it didn&#x27;t suit well</li>

            <li>I loved the headband I received it quickly by standard shipping only problem is the middle leaf fell off in shipping</li>

            <li>Stunning headpiece - you will need some bobby pins to hold it up because it is heavy.</li>
            <li>Beautiful but obviously disappointing.</li>
            <li>It does have some blue rhinestones, but they don&#x27;t stand out at all so it is really neutral and should go with a lot of outfits.</li>
            <li>Disappointed the beautiful headpiece broke the very first time I tried it on - it actually snapped in half - and was never worn.</li>
            <li>its beautiful however  piece broke off when i tried to put it on.  :(</li>
            <li>The metal headband is very stiff and despite the fabric ties it was far too big to fit my average size head.</li>

            <li> It was a bit heavy but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didnt make it to prom because I was broken up with 2 days before.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid I was going to break it.</li>

            <li> Beautiful! Just like the movie!!! Great buy! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Although this is a beautiful headpiece, it broke on me after a day of having it and broke when I was trying to put it on my head. Thankfully I hot glued it back together and was able to wear it for halloween.</li>
            <li> cute but sooo cheaply made!</li>
            <li> It is SO big, I don&#x27;t know whose head it is supposed to fit!!! If you try to bend it even the smallest bit, it snaps apart. While it is beautiful, I have to wonder if any of those 5-star reviews ever tried to wear it, or if they are just going on looks alone.</li>
            <li> Beautiful headpiece and Great customer service</li>
            <li> The item was exactly like the picture it is gorgeous. The headpiece is made of quality materials and looks just like Daisy&#x27;s. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very very easy to work with!!!</li>
            <li> I got this the day of the prom (I ordered it 3 days before, with 2-day shipping). It was a beautiful headpiece that tied by the ribbons attached. Unfortunately, I didnt make it to prom because I was broken up with 2 days before. But I kept the headpiece anyways because its beautiful and I&#x27;ll find somewhere else to where it</li>
            <li> Very pretty and was a great piece to my costume! However the headband piece was a little stiff and I was afraid I was going to break it.</li>
            <li> HV Stearling Co. is hands down the most reliable vendor I have ever dealt with. I purchased a lovely headpiece , that due to its delicate nature arrived broken. I Emailed the company explaining what happened and they replaced it immediately. They obviously care about their customers; I’m extremely satisfied with the product and with the customer service I received throughout the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the service of the company and the head price is very lovely. Hope to get my years of use!</li>
            <li> Love love love this headband.  It&#x27;s sexy....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just toooo prefect, i LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I ordered this tiara for my daughters senior prom which is Great Gatsby themed. I was a little worried about the quality for the price. I received the item literally next business day (I chose standard shipping) and I am super impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ties are interchangeable so I may change to blue to match her prom dress. I&#x27;m thinking about using this at a vintage themed 1920s weeeding I will be in later this year.</li>
            <li> Very pretty headband. Will be great for my gatsby theme bridal shower.  The taupe color ribbon matches my dress exactly. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, and exactly as described. I wore this to a roaring 20&#x27;s party. It looked great, and I got a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Did not fit to head properly.</li>
            <li> Headband is beautiful, but came broke. Emailed HV Sterling (who promises response within a day) and no response after a couple days already. I purchased this for a 1920&#x27;s themed wedding. Now I am back to the drawing board. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, but it broke as I was putting it on the first time.</li>
            <li> I wore this for a 20&#x27;s themed dinner. It was a bit heavy but not too bad. It looked good and everyone loved it.</li>
            <li> It looks beautiful on.  The metal part is not very good quality, but it will really help pull together an outfit I&#x27;m wearing to an Art Deco event on the Queen Mary.  It does have some blue rhinestones, but they don&#x27;t stand out at all so it is really neutral and should go with a lot of outfits. I had ordered a hat to go with my outfit too and it was too overpowering on my little head, so I returned that and kept this.</li>
            <li> The item broke as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li> the tip leave broke off, but by the way it broke off no one would even notice it. This Tiara is very beautiful, I love it! Plus the delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> The headband broke the day I received and is not made for the average size of a person&#x27;s head. Extremely wide and materials that the tierra is made with is obviously cheap because it broke as soon as I tried to bend it and make an adjustment. I kept it and wore it anyway and was able to use the ribbon ties to get the desired look, but amazing that I paid as much money as I did and got a faulty product. If it wasn&#x27;t for me being innovative and resourceful, my purchase would have been a total waste. Extremely dissapointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Stunning headpiece - you will need some bobby pins to hold it up because it is heavy.</li>
            <li> its beautiful however  piece broke off when i tried to put it on.  :(</li>
            <li> This broke while I was trying it on before the party. Beautiful but obviously disappointing. The metal part of the head band is very large, it didn&#x27;t suit well and I have a very big head lol.</li>
            <li> Very pretty on my sister - purchased for her bachelorette party.  But headband is stiff so it does not conform to different head sizes, and before we left the house a little piece of the side jewelry broke off.</li>
            <li> it was in perfect condition arrived very very soon and I love it!  i got it for my wedding.  Can not WAIT to wear it down the isle!  Thank you so much!</li>

            <li> Beautiful piece, looks just like the photo. Even if I don&#x27;t end up using it, I like having it on display just to look at!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wedding, great quality and so pretty.</li>
            <li> It is cute but it broke the first (and only) time I used it. :(&lt;br /&gt;Can I ask for a refund/replacement?</li>
            <li> simply beautiful! amazing quality</li>
            <li> love this headpiece, wore it to an engagement party and got tons of compliments, it looked gorgeous with my flapper dress</li>
            <li> Completely amazing! This arrived and I couldn&#x27;t get over the weight, and quality of this product! Highly recommend this to anyone looking for that special addition to their collection!!!</li>
            <li> I loved the headband I received it quickly by standard shipping only problem is the middle leaf fell off in shipping I did not have time to replace it but it still looked good would have liked the leaf to be taller was dissapointed but still a great price by far this company stood by their product and replaced it at no extra charge great customer service!!!</li>
