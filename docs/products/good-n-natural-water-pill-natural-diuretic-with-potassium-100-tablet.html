    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>&amp; it is excellent.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for handling the swelling in my ankles because of retaining water.  </li>
            <li>No side effects and wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The best attribute of this product may be its mildness.</li>
            <li>Also, great transaction ... Thank you!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price for what you get!</li>
            <li>Not the best results from a water control pills.  </li>
            <li>For me it is a Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Good diuretic but the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>This product is great no caffeine and has potassium thats a plus.</li>
            <li>It works great for me.</li>
            <li>I take them whenever I feel bloated and they work great.</li>
            <li>Great product,great price plus</li>
            <li>they work - how great is that?</li>
            <li>Thiazides decrease blood pressure (an item in the product description here) effectively.</li>
            <li>I do have to take this morning and night (as recommended two caplets each time) to be completely effective.  </li>
            <li>It seemed OK but wasn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>My first revue was to soon for a coment, now I can say these are a great pill;;</li>
            <li>I will surely purchase this product again &amp; I have over &amp; over again because I have been using it for about 2 years now</li>
            <li>did nothing for me, maybe you will have more luck as I have edema</li>
            <li>More exercise and better eating all but eliminated the need for a diuretic</li>
            <li>I appreciate that potassium is included in this formula as most classes of diuretics eliminate electrolytes with the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so there was no need to keep taking any more.</li>
            <li>this product works ok -</li>
            <li>After having taken most of the bottle, I can say it is not.</li>
            <li>I loved the price and the fast prompt service!</li>
            <li>She said it works just fine and has not mentioned any side effects, she had no complaints.</li>
            <li>This Good N Natural Water Pill did bring some relief.</li>
            <li>But it does not act anywhere near as quickly or effectively (of course) as the prescription diuretic.</li>
            <li>The pamabron-based products have a mild effect but are no substitute for a prescription diuretic.</li>
            <li>I thought I could save some money buy buying this product because the review were so great, but I don&#x27;t think it really worked, going back to diurex</li>
            <li>It appears to be working better than my doctor’s prescription in addressing moderately high blood pressure.</li>
            <li>It was great to see my legs, ankles and feet back to normal.</li>
            <li>and wow, I feel so much better</li>
            <li>The pills are very large.</li>
            <li>These seem to work better than the product I&#x27;m reviewing and produce a greater diuretic response after a few hours--again, nothing like the prescription diuretic, though.</li>
            <li>While the ingredients may seem to be an effective natural diuretic, it was no more effective then Lemon with me.  </li>
            <li>so glad I finally tried these.</li>
            <li>I have tried many over the counter water pills and in recent years had no effect.</li>
            <li>My shipment caem REALLY fast!</li>
            <li>Easy to take and, generally, won&#x27;t make you have to \\&quot;run\\&quot; to the restroom for emergency measures!  </li>
            <li>good product but not outstanding in it&#x27;s field.</li>
            <li>it was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be alittle bit better on the diuretic part, but it did help,</li>
            <li>When there is severe bloating and the puffiness is quite visible, I go for the much stronger and chemical based diurex.</li>
            <li>They really are much needed and helpful addition to the medicine closet.</li>
            <li>These pills had absolutely zero effect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything tremendous but then again I didn&#x27;t have a major issue with water retention to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other Diuertics with better results.</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying these, they are inexpensive so you haven&#x27;t wasted a small fortune if they do not work for you, but the benefit if they do is excellent.</li>
            <li>I use this water pill when there is slight swelling and pain in my legs, arms and hands because its much more gentle on the body.</li>
            <li>While my wife touts the value of products that help with monthly water retention, and this product meets her need well enough, I looked to diuretics to relieve mild edema--which can be aggravating.</li>
            <li>but my roommate has and said that it has made her go more but not significantly.</li>
            <li>My ankles are as normal as can be.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an OTC product that uses the diuretic effect to reduce blood pressure or if you are looking for quick or more dramatic results, you may want to look at the pamabron-based products.</li>
            <li>I have trouble swallowing large pills.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth returning</li>
            <li>So far, it is helping.</li>
            <li>I tend to retain fluid and my hands swell, this is just normal for me.</li>
            <li>After unsuccessfully trying various natural sources of foods that are supposed to have diuretic effects, I had hoped this product would be the answer.</li>
            <li>This is the first water pill I&#x27;ve tried, personally I&#x27;ve noticed less bloating and even some weight loss.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just tried it today.  So far, it is helping.</li>
            <li> Works except. I have been using it for years &amp; it works every time that I use it. I will surely purchase this product again &amp; I have over &amp; over again because I have been using it for about 2 years now &amp; it is excellent.</li>
            <li> My first revue was to soon for a coment, now I can say these are a great pill;;</li>
            <li> did nothing for me, maybe you will have more luck as I have edema</li>
            <li> This is the best product for handling the swelling in my ankles because of retaining water.  No side effects and wonderful results.  My ankles are as normal as can be.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave about this product but I can&#x27;t beat it up either.  It does what it is supposed to do.  Shipping was a bit slow.</li>
            <li> While my wife touts the value of products that help with monthly water retention, and this product meets her need well enough, I looked to diuretics to relieve mild edema--which can be aggravating. Edema often presents with itchy irritation as the skin is being stretched by the fluid buildup. I took a thiazide (HCTZ) diuretic occasionally for a couple of years. More exercise and better eating all but eliminated the need for a diuretic but, occasionally, I would get the itchy feeling again. This Good N Natural Water Pill did bring some relief. But it does not act anywhere near as quickly or effectively (of course) as the prescription diuretic. I also tried pamabron-based diuretics (Aqua-Ban with Pamabron and Diurex). These seem to work better than the product I&#x27;m reviewing and produce a greater diuretic response after a few hours--again, nothing like the prescription diuretic, though. Caffeine works about as well as these pills but produces the unpleasant \\&quot;speeding\\&quot; side effects. I appreciate that potassium is included in this formula as most classes of diuretics eliminate electrolytes with the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best attribute of this product may be its mildness. If you are looking for an OTC product that uses the diuretic effect to reduce blood pressure or if you are looking for quick or more dramatic results, you may want to look at the pamabron-based products. Thiazides decrease blood pressure (an item in the product description here) effectively. I have monitored my blood pressure and found that this product does not affect it at all. The pamabron-based products have a mild effect but are no substitute for a prescription diuretic.</li>
            <li> I got it for my mom. She said it works just fine and has not mentioned any side effects, she had no complaints.</li>
            <li> Easy to take and, generally, won&#x27;t make you have to \\&quot;run\\&quot; to the restroom for emergency measures!  I recommend this product, works for me! Also, great transaction ... Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am now taking this in place of the prescription I was taking (costs less).  I do have to take this morning and night (as recommended two caplets each time) to be completely effective.  It appears to be working better than my doctor’s prescription in addressing moderately high blood pressure.</li>
            <li> I tend to retain fluid and my hands swell, this is just normal for me. This product is great no caffeine and has potassium thats a plus. It works great for me.</li>
            <li> I order this about a month ago, only took the firs 4 pills and had to stop. Not because of side effects, but because the water build up i wanted to get rid of was gone all in two days. so there was no need to keep taking any more.</li>
            <li> This is the first water pill I&#x27;ve tried, personally I&#x27;ve noticed less bloating and even some weight loss. It&#x27;s a great price for what you get!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything tremendous but then again I didn&#x27;t have a major issue with water retention to begin with.  I think if used as recommended the product will work as advertised.</li>
            <li> While the ingredients may seem to be an effective natural diuretic, it was no more effective then Lemon with me.  I might just as well have been a placebo</li>
            <li> I loved the price and the fast prompt service! I received it w/ in Two days!! I&#x27;m not sure if the product works. I took it for a cpl of days. Didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Yet.....</li>
            <li> good product but not outstanding in it&#x27;s field.</li>
            <li> this product works ok - it was a reasonable price. I expected it to be alittle bit better on the diuretic part, but it did help,</li>
            <li> It seemed OK but wasn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> These are terrific. I take them whenever I feel bloated and they work great. I&#x27;be been using these for several months and there are no noticeable side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several over the counter products and nothing works as well as these. Great product,great price plus they work - how great is that?</li>
            <li> I use this water pill when there is slight swelling and pain in my legs, arms and hands because its much more gentle on the body. When there is severe bloating and the puffiness is quite visible, I go for the much stronger and chemical based diurex. But sometimes there are side affects with that, especially when used a few days in a row. There are absolutely no side affects with these, so sometimes, when things are very bad, I alternate to give my system a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I finally tried these. They really are much needed and helpful addition to the medicine closet.</li>
            <li> Not the best results from a water control pills.  Good diuretic but the best on the market.  I have tried other Diuertics with better results.</li>
            <li> I thought I could save some money buy buying this product because the review were so great, but I don&#x27;t think it really worked, going back to diurex</li>
            <li> Never tried. The pills are very large. I have trouble swallowing large pills.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth returning</li>
            <li> After unsuccessfully trying various natural sources of foods that are supposed to have diuretic effects, I had hoped this product would be the answer. After having taken most of the bottle, I can say it is not. These pills had absolutely zero effect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have finally found something that does work for me - parsley. A couple hours after munching a handful of Italian flat leaf parsley, I was making multiple trips to the bathroom to relieve myself. It was great to see my legs, ankles and feet back to normal. Now parsley is a daily staple in my diet, and all swelling has disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have tried many over the counter water pills and in recent years had no effect. I used prescription pills, but did not like the side effects or long term effects. I started taking these a few months ago and wow, I feel so much better, I can see my ankles again, and my wrists etc. I would recommend trying these, they are inexpensive so you haven&#x27;t wasted a small fortune if they do not work for you, but the benefit if they do is excellent. I&#x27;ve ordered extra so I don&#x27;t run out. For me it is a Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My shipment caem REALLY fast! I havent tried them yet but my roommate has and said that it has made her go more but not significantly. I will start mine this weekend.</li>
