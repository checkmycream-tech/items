            <li>I have been using this product since 1972 and even though I am in my 60&#x27;s my skin looks as good as a 35 year old.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>But that said, I continue to order it when I can find it at a good price.</li>
            <li>Has a good smell.</li>
            <li>Apart from being good for your skin it has the added benefit of not clogging bath and shower drains.&lt;br /&gt;Redken</li>
            <li>Smells great and not drying at all...just clean!</li>
            <li>Used it for 34 years and love it!</li>
            <li>so nice</li>

            <li>Good to know that it is still available.</li>
            <li>love this soap been using it for years</li>
            <li>We were so happy to finally be able to purchase the redken blue bars.  </li>
            <li>The body washes all are too strong for my skin as well.  </li>
            <li>Since the Redken Amino Pon Beauty Bar is no longer available, I now use the Men&#x27;s Cleansing Bar.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic, just buy it</li>
            <li>Precisely the product I need.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this soap and is willing to pay for it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Men&#x27;s Bar for more than 30 years with complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Delivery from the US source to a US address was no problem and the product condition is first class.</li>
            <li>(it was once pink, and was for women, but the French men are more gorgeous than the women, and the pink &amp;#34;beauty bar&amp;#34; is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels fine afterwards, not dry.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since the 1970&#x27;s, ever since a woman with beautiful skin told me that her secret was to never put soap on her face.  </li>
            <li>My Dad and brothers use the bars and really like them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched a few times but always come back to it for its ease of use, pleasant scent, and the way it leaves my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(although I&#x27;m female) because I love the scent but that I never have tight or itchy skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be the same, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I want the old  Redken Strawberry scented soap of the 70&#x27;s.!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Please consider bringing it</li>
            <li>This soap gets used up fast, that is the only downside.</li>
            <li>and I am having to resort to buying in the US which has worked well so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, and if left in water will dissolve.</li>
            <li>shippped fast and lasts a long long time ...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Hubby used this product way back in the 70&#x27;s and loves it.  He uses it as a shampoo and it seems to help with keeping his hair in place after it dries.</li>
            <li> Useing for 30 plus years as shampoo.  I still. Have hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 1972 and even though I am in my 60&#x27;s my skin looks as good as a 35 year old.&lt;br /&gt;When you have a product that works you keep on using it. Great cleansing bar and I hope they never stop producing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 40 years.  I&#x27;ve switched a few times but always come back to it for its ease of use, pleasant scent, and the way it leaves my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, just buy it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the 1970&#x27;s, ever since a woman with beautiful skin told me that her secret was to never put soap on her face.  Redken&#x27;s bar is not soap.  I have used it ever since, (it was once pink, and was for women, but the French men are more gorgeous than the women, and the pink &amp;#34;beauty bar&amp;#34; is no longer available.  I used to have post-adolescent acne, but this ph-balanced product banished it forever.  No matter where I am, in America or in Europe, people comment on my beautiful skin.  PS  I bathed my babies with this bar, and never used soap on my children.  Wonderful results.  My four kids looked the cleanest on the block.</li>
            <li> We were so happy to finally be able to purchase the redken blue bars.  My Dad and brothers use the bars and really like them</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, on my face and for showering. I can feel a weird coating on my skin when I use regular soap. The body washes all are too strong for my skin as well.  (note: I use a different liquid soap for hand washing) I wish it were not so strongly scented, and not so expensive. But that said, I continue to order it when I can find it at a good price. I stock up, and I&#x27;ve found that if I open the boxes and cellophane covering the soap and let it air for a few months it gets harder and will last longer.  It&#x27;s very soft, and if left in water will dissolve. It&#x27;s way too expensive for that to happen.</li>
            <li> Has a good smell. Skin feels fine afterwards, not dry. This soap gets used up fast, that is the only downside.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years...it&#x27;s terrific. Smells great and not drying at all...just clean!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap and is willing to pay for it!  Admittedly, it makes the shower smell so nice I&#x27;m tempted to use it myself!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and find there is nothing to equal it.  Apart from being good for your skin it has the added benefit of not clogging bath and shower drains.&lt;br /&gt;Redken discontinued it some years ago but responded to demand and reintroduced it in a larger bar size which is probably better.&lt;br /&gt;It looks as though Redken may be discontinuing it again as there is no stock in the UK and I am having to resort to buying in the US which has worked well so far.  Delivery from the US source to a US address was no problem and the product condition is first class.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman over the age of 30, I began getting acne after my child and was told to use this soap for my face, I use once a day with a moisturizer. I have been using this product for about 15 days now and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> Precisely the product I need.  Almost impossible to find the product at brick and mortar stores.  Am very happy.  No shipping problems.</li>
            <li> My order arrived ahead of schedule and, as always, the cleansing bar is an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve used the Men&#x27;s Bar for more than 30 years with complete satisfaction.</li>
