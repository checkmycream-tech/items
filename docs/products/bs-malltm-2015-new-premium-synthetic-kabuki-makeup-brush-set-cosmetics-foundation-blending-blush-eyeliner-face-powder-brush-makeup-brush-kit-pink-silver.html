            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the silver part of the handle that holds the bristles is not very durable.</li>
            <li> Little shedding, but that is to be expected with any brand new brush.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I give four stars is that the product comes with a little smell, which I believe is the paint of the handle.</li>
            <li> I thought I got pink</li>
            <li> Although I feel like the small Brushes were way too similar too each other</li>
            <li> I would not purchase these again due to the over all quality.</li>
            <li> After a few washes I can see the brush falling apart.</li>
            <li> None of them broke as I saw a few reports here</li>
            <li> This is not good at all brushes as we see in the images very very small brushes this shows very big in images but not in reality not seticfied at all...</li>
            <li> but they kinda smell weird?</li>
            <li> I have a couple of very expensive make up brushes in my bag....</li>
            <li> I use them every day and feel they work just as well as very expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> Although they smell terrible when I opened the package, the smell goes away after I washed them with my shampoo.</li>

            <li> Honestly its the best make up brushes I&#x27;ve ever used LOL! Must buy. :)</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes!!! I cannot believe the quality for the price, plus they&#x27;re adorable! Super soft, I love these.</li>
            <li> The quality is what&#x27;s it&#x27;s worth. People do buy bargain stuff thinking that they would get a good quality for a better price...but this product did not meet my expectation at all...it seems like the brushes are the same...same shape, same size...why would I need 3 of the same brush...kept it co&#x27;z I used it already when I tried it but I would have returned it otherwise.</li>
            <li> It does have a weird smell though, but it&#x27;s great! :)</li>
            <li> Good quality super fast delivery I&#x27;m in love with my new brushes thanks so much</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft. I love them. Although they smell terrible when I opened the package, the smell goes away after I washed them with my shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product, as well as the professionalism and customer service of this seller. A user manual for the brushes was not included by accident, and I was emailed a downloadable copy. I find that these brushes do a wonderful job of blending my foundation and eye shadows. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing for the low price. The bristles are super smooth and don&#x27;t cake on the make up. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the silver part of the handle that holds the bristles is not very durable. After a few washes I can see the brush falling apart. Overall a great product especially for beginners.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! They&#x27;re super soft and I have had any trouble with shedding! I have found these to be better than the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brushes I have and they&#x27;re not nearly as expensive! Great quality, great value, and gorgeous results! If you&#x27;re considering these, definitely go for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus points: it was supposed to be a set of 10, but I got an additional eyeliner brush which is just as fantastic as the rest of the set!</li>
            <li> The brushes are beautiful and they arrived on time. I love them very much and they even come with a little bag to carry them in</li>

            <li> I ordered the pink one and they are pretty! I haven&#x27;t used them yet but the brushes feel soft and look good quality. Customer service is nice. After I received the product, a lady emailed me that they forgot to include the user guide in the package so she sent me the electronic version which is very helpful. The only reason that I give four stars is that the product comes with a little smell, which I believe is the paint of the handle.</li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again. Fast shipping</li>

            <li> Other than the smell these brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> love it price and quality</li>
            <li> This is not good at all brushes as we see in the images very very small brushes this shows very big in images but not in reality not seticfied at all...</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes for an even better price.</li>
            <li> just got them in mail, i love these! but they kinda smell weird? but obviously the scent does not effect the actual product quality itself ^-^</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, although I didn&#x27;t get one of the gift ones, they&#x27;re good for starters like me. Very satisfied :)</li>
            <li> I was assaulted by a overpowering chemical fumes upon opening the package and had to close it back up and put it in a ziploc bag.  These were meant to be a birthday gift for my daughter but had to be returned.  No amount of airing out would make these ok to use.  Think something like jet fuel combined with model airplane paint or glue.  Sickeningly strong.  Inexcusable.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of very expensive make up brushes in my bag....but these brushes are even better.  I only use these now and cannot believe how inexpensive they were.  My foundation application has never been easier or looked better.  Same for blush and contouring.  Wish I would have known about this brush set sooner!</li>
            <li> Love love love ... I got them as a gift ... Gifts are always nice</li>
            <li> Best makeup brushes ever they are the best in love in only took 2 days to get here in love</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than predicted. Great price, nicely packaged. A must buy for anyone who&#x27;s into make up or want to try. Each brush is individually wrapped along with being packaged in the plastic bag it came. All and all, great purchase I made.</li>
            <li> Although the brush heads themselves are nice, the smell of the paint is almost too unbearable. They smell like they have been painted with cheap paint which make me worry what kind of paint was used on them. Although I like the heads I would not purchase these again due to the over all quality.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes - especially for the price.  They are sturdy and very nice shapes.  I use them every day and feel they work just as well as very expensive brands.  Brushes do not shed.</li>
            <li> Came early, brushes are soft and a good size and I love the pink handles!</li>
            <li> I thought I got pink but when I got them it was like a redish color</li>
