            <li>DON&#x27;T TASTE SWEET AND SOUR.  </li>
            <li>I remember an opaque, colorful, square wrapper that was just \\&quot;twisted\\&quot; on, instead of the clear, sealed, somewhat less tamper proof plastic.  </li>
            <li>They taste just like I remember but so many of the pops were broken.  </li>

            <li> They taste just like I remember but so many of the pops were broken.  </li>
            <li> it appears as if these were stored in a hot area, as some of the suckers seem to have melted and mis-formed.</li>
            <li> I love these lollipops, helps with the dry mouth and nausea during my treatment, however several in the pack arrived crushed due to poor shipping or handling.</li>
            <li> Really like these suckers.</li>
            <li> In fact I have a heck of a time opening them, but at least I won&#x27;t be inhaling the whole box anytime soon.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM, IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND THESE SUCKERS IN ANY STORES.  </li>
            <li> They were just as I remember them I got 18 blue and 8 red and green,</li>
            <li> Many of the suckers were broken.</li>
            <li> They stain your tongue blue and green.</li>
            <li> NOT REALLY FLAVORFUL.</li>
            <li> , 14 pink</li>
            <li> These suckers are my favourite because they are truly tart and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I remember eating Charms suckers as a kid at the local pool.  </li>
            <li> Oh the memories the suckers bring back!  </li>
            <li> I grew up in Denver during the 80&#x27;s but spent my summers in Michigan, where I could buy single suckers for $.10 at the corner store.</li>
            <li> Plus much less fattening than chocolate.</li>
            <li> Love the pop but all but 4 weren&#x27;t broken so mad</li>
            <li> I can remember when I was a kid and going to the gas station down the street and getting a few on the weekends with my neighborhood friends.</li>
            <li> 5 green.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product itself, but what I received was disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is like a blast from the past.  </li>
            <li> but they are sucker size versus being small lollipop size.</li>
            <li> I ordered another box with a sucker stand for a party and being shipped together that box had no breakage</li>
            <li> 10 of the suckers were crumbled</li>
            <li> There were some broken ones but not many</li>
            <li> THEY ARE LESS EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU BUY THEM THIS WAY.</li>
            <li> A  number were cracked or broken</li>
            <li> Just as I remember from my childhood, though about a quarter of the box was broken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they were all broken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they&#x27;re not quite as I remembered, in look or taste.  </li>
            <li> (hey, I was a weird kid.)  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the wrapper may just be a sign of the times.</li>
            <li> You can still eat the pieces but it was disappointing.</li>
            <li> All lollipops were broken,  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would rate them 5 stars but the packaging was terrible.  </li>

            <li> Not as I remember from when I was a kid. They stain your tongue blue and green.</li>
            <li> These were great as a kid when I had some allowance money and was able to ride my bike to the local White Hen in the Chicago area.  It was great to find these again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One comment - it appears as if these were stored in a hot area, as some of the suckers seem to have melted and mis-formed.</li>
            <li> These suckers are my favourite because they are truly tart and last a long time. They can be hard to find,so I was thrilled to buy them in bulk and will definitely do so again. A  number were cracked or broken or I&#x27;d have given them five stars.</li>
            <li> A taste from my childhood memories. As good as ever!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T TASTE SWEET AND SOUR.  NOT REALLY FLAVORFUL.</li>
            <li> I received these March 24, 2011 and it was not what is pictured. I got sweet pops. If I had wanted this kind I would have ordered them. In the box there was 19 cherry, 12 stawberry, 5 orange, 11 grape and 1 blue razz berry...some assortment of flavors Huh. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just as I remember from my childhood, though about a quarter of the box was broken.</li>
            <li> My coworkers were buying these pops at a local gas station and they sold out. They were a great price, delivered fast and lots of fun</li>
            <li> Love it, love it.. love it... I now have my own supply!!! Will reorder when they are gone!!!</li>
            <li> I really Love this lollipops they were delicious as soon as I opened the box I went back to my childhood I used to buy this.They were just as I remember them I got 18 blue and 8 red and green, 5 green. 6 red, 14 pink so I got 51 instead of 48 yay! so I got 3 free.</li>
            <li> I grew up in Denver during the 80&#x27;s but spent my summers in Michigan, where I could buy single suckers for $.10 at the corner store. I would spend most of my days eating Charms Sweet and Sour Pops, which for some reason I have never been able to find in Denver. Thank you Amazon for providing me with one of the best parts of my childhood.</li>
            <li> I remember eating Charms suckers as a kid at the local pool.  I was very happy to find these on Amazon (after searching around at local shops with no luck).

            <li> Fast shipping &amp; love the candy&#x27;s !</li>
            <li> Really like these suckers. They taste good and I only has one that was broken in the whole box. Very happy with the product. I only gave it 4 stars because they weren&#x27;t as big as I thought they would be but they are sucker size versus being small lollipop size.</li>
            <li> On a nostalgic whim, I wanted to see if my favorite lollipops from my childhood in the mid-70&#x27;s were on Amazon.  The answer was: of course they are!  Unfortunately they&#x27;re not quite as I remembered, in look or taste.  Not as much sour to contrast with the sweet, which was was the main thing I really liked about them (hey, I was a weird kid.)  Granted my tastebuds were much younger and more sensitive then, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.  Different packaging, too.  I remember an opaque, colorful, square wrapper that was just \\&quot;twisted\\&quot; on, instead of the clear, sealed, somewhat less tamper proof plastic.  In fact I have a heck of a time opening them, but at least I won&#x27;t be inhaling the whole box anytime soon.  Sadly, the wrapper may just be a sign of the times. All in all it&#x27;s still a good product but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> All lollipops were broken,  I&#x27;m very disappointed. I was looking forward to giving these as a gift to my Grand kids.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM, IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND THESE SUCKERS IN ANY STORES.  THEY ARE LESS EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU BUY THEM THIS WAY.</li>
            <li> Love the pop but all but 4 weren&#x27;t broken so mad I was going to use them for my candy buffet for my wedding but guess not know</li>
            <li> 10 of the suckers were crumbled</li>
            <li> I love these they were perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Oh the memories the suckers bring back!  Just as good as I remember them!</li>
            <li> They taste just like I remember but so many of the pops were broken.  You can still eat the pieces but it was disappointing.</li>

            <li> We love these suckers.  Surprised they are not in the store, more.  Plus much less fattening than chocolate.</li>
            <li> I think i&#x27;ll just give-up on charms.... Every time i get them there broke. when there broke they cut my mouth.</li>
            <li> I love these lollipops, helps with the dry mouth and nausea during my treatment, however several in the pack arrived crushed due to poor shipping or handling. It is the second time this has occurred.</li>
            <li> Great lollipops with great taste and flavor. Just try them and you will love them.</li>
            <li> They are just as I had remembered them. Excellent condition.</li>
