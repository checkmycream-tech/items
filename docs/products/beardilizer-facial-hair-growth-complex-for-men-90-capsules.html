    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Against my best judgement, I tool a pill with breakfast, because I&#x27;m just done with this patchy beard.</li>
            <li>Beardilizer has been great for me... and my beard!!</li>
            <li>That is for intensive care purposes to see the best results.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just a scam your best bet would be to use biotin pills</li>
            <li>beardlilizer was probably one of the best companies i ordered from.</li>
            <li>My family and friends were impressed when they saw me I was growing beard</li>
            <li>I opened this in my 700sq foot bedroom and the odor from this stuff filled the room in a matter seconds!!!!</li>
            <li>it’s a very good</li>
            <li>Now I found it here on Amazon with a great price too.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Biotin over the years and haven&#x27;t experienced the weirdness</li>
            <li>Of course, I wish it was cheaper, because I am already at 4 months, but in order to be successful, you have to go all the way until you get where you want to be.</li>
            <li>followed the instructions from the bottle and did not see any results...waste of my money all i got from the company was congratulations and good luck with your purchase of our product........</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>I love having a beard!</li>
            <li>ordering more !</li>
            <li>I can say I’ve noticed nice beard growth results from taking beardilizer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It would probably have been just as effective to spread manure on my face and fight through my gag reflex.</li>
            <li>so I can see how effective it was</li>
            <li>I guess this is the price to have a nice beard…</li>
            <li>I will continue taking it until I believe it is no longer effective for me.</li>
            <li>I haven seen any mejor changes to be honest</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using it and have seen a significant improvement with it!!</li>
            <li>It  leaves hair,beard and mustache  soft and gives a good sheen!!</li>
            <li>Overall very good and surprising.</li>
            <li>Great product within first week saw a difference .</li>
            <li>I am satisfied for making this purchase.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products before but this is the one that I will keep on using for years to come.</li>
            <li>Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This is why I&#x27;ve decided to take some time to go into more details about this product.</li>
            <li>The thing with this product is that you have to play it by hear, which means that once you feel you reach a growth level that is satisfying, you reduce the treatment to 3 capsules per day.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 4 months already, and the I love the result.</li>
            <li>However, Vitabeard includes a proprietary blend--not sure what&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li>I Was hoping for better results since i was taken so many a day .</li>
            <li>However the hair that i already had on my face looked/felt MUCH better while taking these .</li>
            <li>but I was able to get through the day.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am risking great long-term health by taking products that aren&#x27;t really FDA approved.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;d give it more stars if he could</li>
            <li>I like beardilizer better than vitabeard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying one more bottle to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever been able to grow.</li>
            <li>for sure recommend getting it!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Overall a very interesting product with great results – 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li>Happy with it completely.</li>
            <li>Took it for a month twice a day it gives you energy and really works don&#x27;t take a night or you want sleep but definitely good product</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying first: I Love this Product!</li>
            <li>No you wont magically have a full grown beard in a month if you&#x27;ve never had one before, but you will see improvements in beard fullness and growth speed.</li>
            <li>Everything was just fine</li>
            <li>Thanks for a fantastic product!!</li>
            <li>But after this time, I could already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Everything went smooth up until I used this &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It smells like a used diaper filled with Indian food or bigfoot&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>I hope you will enjoy it to.</li>
            <li>but I just thought I&#x27;d shed some light in comparison to Vitabeard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing product that really works.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s extremely happy since he thought he would never grow facial hair.</li>
            <li>I am overall really happy with</li>
            <li>Like WEILL, I agree totally – This product works great for me.</li>
            <li>I have been taking Vita Beard for several months with great results.</li>
            <li>I feel it is important to share my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to buy the last one with Amazon and the service was great, so I will continue with them.</li>
            <li>i do not recommend to take with just water lol, overall</li>
            <li>Overall a good product, thank you. :)</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Also, this was the first time I ordered it through Amazon and service was perfect as expected.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to take product but did nothing for me</li>
            <li>I Just ordered this product , I&#x27;m excited about it</li>
            <li>pretty sure they made my blood pressure go up</li>
            <li>Best product for young men trying to grow facial hair.</li>
            <li>I chose this to try it out and also I wanted to grow my beard out and let it all connect and be full</li>
            <li>They know there are people that really would love to have an beard.</li>
            <li>May have some good vitimins but it definitely won&#x27;t make you grow a beard.</li>
            <li>Not bad of a product.</li>
            <li>I have no really bad side effects from taking it.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product at all, but my search continues.</li>
            <li>it grew quickly...</li>
            <li>Comparing the ingredients to a normal multivitamin, these have more of everything</li>
            <li>I still have pretty good amount left to finish, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again after I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li>It works, for real!!</li>
            <li>But this one really works!!</li>
            <li>Aside of the good Amazon service, the second bottle is the one that really kicked in for me.</li>
            <li>The product will do what it says but its a matter of your own patience and followthrough with its daily doses.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was worth the $40.</li>
            <li>So many products make promises but never delivers, this one does like no other product before it!!</li>
            <li>great produce will be using it again in the near future, it really works!</li>
            <li>had a problem with my order and they helped me right away and than some!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it gives you the initial boost to get from scarce hair to something that&#x27;s looking more like a full beard.</li>
            <li>and I can enjoy a steady growth.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t really bother me that much, because I swallow very quickly .</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any head symptons like in the past</li>
            <li>the most noticeable, sideburns and jawline had some increase in hair and grew a little bit more hair on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It seems a bit more thick too which is always nice.</li>
            <li>No more unwanted beard trim&#x27;s, Im able to style it however I choose!!</li>
            <li>I took it upon myself to stop taking them for a while (as of the week that I am typing this review) and so far I am midway through the week and have been feeling perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>So, within 10 days, you will have finished your first bottle of beardilizer.</li>
            <li>However, I am sure for anyone else that can, this product would work well for invigorating their facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nothing dad!</li>
            <li>First used intensive treatment to build up in my system.</li>
            <li>Since my last update, I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t been able to grow ANY facial hair (before this treatment), then this product will probably not work for you.    </li>
            <li>So I re-ordered these supplements after the first go around.</li>
            <li>there was an unsual striking pain on the left side of my head</li>
            <li>The first 2 weeks werent showing&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait a while before I wrote this review, so I took Beardilizer consistently for about 6 weeks now</li>
            <li>I have to say I was not  crazy about taking that much pills per day, but it is really making a difference</li>
            <li>I feel that if I had kept taking them religiously for 6 months I&#x27;d notice a good difference, but I just can&#x27;t afford $30 a bottle when it only lasts 10 days.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really make my facial hair look any thicker or better.</li>
            <li>First I decided to go with the intense treatment, which means 9 capsules per day.</li>
            <li>The first go around, I really didn&#x27;t follow that method.</li>
            <li>and at first I didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much just a multivitamin..</li>
            <li>long till I see more beard hair growing ?</li>
            <li>It is now full, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I will certainly re-order this product soon</li>
            <li>The pills are large though, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a typo on the bottle</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s purely dependent on genetics and if your genes did not put hair follicles on your face, you can buy any product you want</li>
            <li>The first go around a few months back, I experienced headaches often and that was after taking 3-a-day.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty decent growth to begin with</li>
            <li>, so I really was expecting to see additional growth/length in my Beard.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>I expected much more of this product.</li>
            <li>Doesnt work but fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is not convenient and I don&#x27;t like to swallow that much capsules per day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really consider that a money saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so much bang for the</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well, even over an extended period of time, and they smell absolutely rancid.</li>
            <li>(3 morn/3 lunch/ 3 dinner) for 10 days straight.  </li>
            <li>When doing the 10 day treatment, I really didn&#x27;t notice a drastic change.</li>
            <li>My beard was noticeable b4 even taking the supplements, but still very spotty on one side.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I thought this would really work.</li>
            <li>If you do decided to try it 1 thing I do give this product is that it does come fast</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really work for me, either I have to keep buying a monthly supply or they are just a scam.</li>
            <li>it really works for me.</li>
            <li>For my part, it really took 6 weeks to get to see results, but after that, it just delivered.</li>
            <li>I really thought it was gonna work....</li>
            <li>No growth absolutely at all.</li>
            <li>I took the whole bottle using the &amp;#34;Intense treatment&amp;#34; (3 pills a day) and saw no results.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really know if it is working or not</li>
            <li>Either way, it’s really</li>
            <li>hope this gets me laid thanks</li>
            <li>i did the intense program and ran out immediately.</li>
            <li>I used 2 whole bottles</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing....</li>
            <li>and I told them there&#x27;s no secret I been using beardlizer</li>
            <li>As other guys have posted these have a pretty strong odor.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, back to the part when I talk about the beard, I can&#x27;t say that uv gotten a bigger fuller beard, and I still have some bright hair at some places, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve gotten hair in places when I usually got bald spots, and that was a huge positive result for me, so</li>
            <li>I understand some people are not totally satisfied with it, but I think it’s an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It took me three months to go from to go from a 10 days patchy beard to a full beard ½ inch beard, which is a total of 4 bottles.</li>
            <li>As I see it, you have to be consistent with the treatment, as it will not be obviously working the first month.</li>
            <li>With all that i defineately see more results with further use mixed in with biotin.</li>
            <li>I am very determined to grow a full beard as I am approaching my mid 30s.</li>
            <li>I did see some thickness in hair that I already had and noticed some other areas where the really light hair got darker.</li>
            <li>Into the fifth week Ive started seeing new hair on my patches, while the rest of my beard was getting thicker.</li>
            <li>Well I have to say that I am very pleasantly surprised by this Beardilizer!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been taking these pretty regularly and had noticeable results.</li>
            <li>At first I was using it religiously.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, and my first one ordered on Amazon.</li>
            <li>other than that they really aren&#x27;t worth it if you ask me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really gauge beardilizer yet, but I can tell you that taking 9 pills a day is pretty rough.</li>
            <li>Still waiting on some more hair had it for a month only a little bit of hair grew</li>
            <li>Maybe just a little more hair sprouting in my cheek/neck area, but my overall beard was still somewhat spotty.</li>
            <li>It kinda worked but it gave me a lot of acne, so fuller beard but lots of acne or not so fulled bear and clear skin, make your choice.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve only been taking it for 2 days, and I really can&#x27;t comment on the progress yet,</li>
            <li>I am surprised with the results so far.</li>
            <li>Remember, you sort of need some type of facial hair to begin with in order to really see results.</li>
            <li>Naturally, once I completed the 10 day treatment, I ran out of vitamins (there&#x27;s 90 all together).  </li>
            <li>But over the course of the last few weeks, the headaches have been more frequent.</li>
            <li>I have a bit of facial hair and was really eagar to try this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to see what the next batch will do for me.</li>
            <li>It help my beard growth progress slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>and I can see significant growth in my facial hair only a week later!</li>
            <li>I just want to say it works, but I might have to buy more bottles cause the two bottles I bought didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected.</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle, fourth month, and first time I purchase it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Unless it really starts to make a difference in the next week, I&#x27;ll probably just stick to Vitabeard---or just give up in general.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t itch terribly anymore, which is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Yes it does work, but only because I never had problem growing facial hair in the first place, this was just to speed it up</li>
            <li>Take as instructed but dont expect a full blown beard in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>, these pills smell like a dead rotten whale carcass pulled out of a sewer, and the taste is pretty vulgar, the best way is just to get it down as fast as you possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from all that, these pills really do work, they get 5 starz in my book.</li>
            <li>Once the bottle is done and if I don&#x27;t see any MAJOR results, that will be THE END of being a guinea pig.</li>
            <li>I think the trick is to be consistent, like in any other hair treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: I&#x27;ve already taken 1 full bottle of Vitabeard, and have noticed slight changes to my facial hair.</li>
            <li>or if it&#x27;s a complete lie about what is actually in the pills.</li>
            <li>I hope that in a near future my beard will be as majestic as I always wanted!</li>
            <li>I have been taking these for about a week or so, though I haven&#x27;t to much in the way of a growth change just yet, I&#x27;ve noticed a few new seedlings in places there wasn&#x27;t any before, and</li>
            <li>My facial hair does grow faster than it had in the past, but I hadn&#x27;t noticed a huge difference that would make me want to spend $40 for a third bottle.</li>
            <li>I did see some new growth but not much while and after taking this .</li>
            <li>Apparently the initial phase can go from 1 to 6 weeks, depending on your facial hair.</li>
            <li>The Beardilizer pills smell really strong, much worse than Vitabeard.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Against my best judgement, I tool a pill with breakfast, because I&#x27;m just done with this patchy beard.</li>
            <li> Beardilizer has been great for me... and my beard!!</li>
            <li> That is for intensive care purposes to see the best results.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a scam your best bet would be to use biotin pills</li>
            <li> beardlilizer was probably one of the best companies i ordered from.</li>
            <li> My family and friends were impressed when they saw me I was growing beard</li>
            <li> I opened this in my 700sq foot bedroom and the odor from this stuff filled the room in a matter seconds!!!!</li>
            <li> it’s a very good</li>
            <li> Now I found it here on Amazon with a great price too.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Biotin over the years and haven&#x27;t experienced the weirdness</li>
            <li> Of course, I wish it was cheaper, because I am already at 4 months, but in order to be successful, you have to go all the way until you get where you want to be.</li>
            <li> followed the instructions from the bottle and did not see any results...waste of my money all i got from the company was congratulations and good luck with your purchase of our product........</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I love having a beard!</li>
            <li> ordering more !</li>
            <li> I can say I’ve noticed nice beard growth results from taking beardilizer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It would probably have been just as effective to spread manure on my face and fight through my gag reflex.</li>
            <li> so I can see how effective it was</li>
            <li> I guess this is the price to have a nice beard…</li>
            <li> I will continue taking it until I believe it is no longer effective for me.</li>
            <li> I haven seen any mejor changes to be honest</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it and have seen a significant improvement with it!!</li>
            <li> It  leaves hair,beard and mustache  soft and gives a good sheen!!</li>
            <li> Overall very good and surprising.</li>
            <li> Great product within first week saw a difference .</li>
            <li> I am satisfied for making this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products before but this is the one that I will keep on using for years to come.</li>
            <li> Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is why I&#x27;ve decided to take some time to go into more details about this product.</li>
            <li> The thing with this product is that you have to play it by hear, which means that once you feel you reach a growth level that is satisfying, you reduce the treatment to 3 capsules per day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 months already, and the I love the result.</li>
            <li> However, Vitabeard includes a proprietary blend--not sure what&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li> I Was hoping for better results since i was taken so many a day .</li>
            <li> However the hair that i already had on my face looked/felt MUCH better while taking these .</li>
            <li> but I was able to get through the day.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am risking great long-term health by taking products that aren&#x27;t really FDA approved.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d give it more stars if he could</li>
            <li> I like beardilizer better than vitabeard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying one more bottle to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever been able to grow.</li>
            <li> for sure recommend getting it!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Overall a very interesting product with great results – 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> Happy with it completely.</li>
            <li> Took it for a month twice a day it gives you energy and really works don&#x27;t take a night or you want sleep but definitely good product</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying first: I Love this Product!</li>
            <li> No you wont magically have a full grown beard in a month if you&#x27;ve never had one before, but you will see improvements in beard fullness and growth speed.</li>
            <li> Everything was just fine</li>
            <li> Thanks for a fantastic product!!</li>
            <li> But after this time, I could already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Everything went smooth up until I used this &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It smells like a used diaper filled with Indian food or bigfoot&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I hope you will enjoy it to.</li>
            <li> but I just thought I&#x27;d shed some light in comparison to Vitabeard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing product that really works.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s extremely happy since he thought he would never grow facial hair.</li>
            <li> I am overall really happy with</li>
            <li> Like WEILL, I agree totally – This product works great for me.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Vita Beard for several months with great results.</li>
            <li> I feel it is important to share my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the last one with Amazon and the service was great, so I will continue with them.</li>
            <li> i do not recommend to take with just water lol, overall</li>
            <li> Overall a good product, thank you. :)</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Also, this was the first time I ordered it through Amazon and service was perfect as expected.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to take product but did nothing for me</li>
            <li> I Just ordered this product , I&#x27;m excited about it</li>
            <li> pretty sure they made my blood pressure go up</li>
            <li> Best product for young men trying to grow facial hair.</li>
            <li> I chose this to try it out and also I wanted to grow my beard out and let it all connect and be full</li>
            <li> They know there are people that really would love to have an beard.</li>
            <li> May have some good vitimins but it definitely won&#x27;t make you grow a beard.</li>
            <li> Not bad of a product.</li>
            <li> I have no really bad side effects from taking it.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product at all, but my search continues.</li>
            <li> it grew quickly...</li>
            <li> Comparing the ingredients to a normal multivitamin, these have more of everything</li>
            <li> I still have pretty good amount left to finish, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again after I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> It works, for real!!</li>
            <li> But this one really works!!</li>
            <li> Aside of the good Amazon service, the second bottle is the one that really kicked in for me.</li>
            <li> The product will do what it says but its a matter of your own patience and followthrough with its daily doses.</li>
            <li> so I thought it was worth the $40.</li>
            <li> So many products make promises but never delivers, this one does like no other product before it!!</li>
            <li> great produce will be using it again in the near future, it really works!</li>
            <li> had a problem with my order and they helped me right away and than some!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it gives you the initial boost to get from scarce hair to something that&#x27;s looking more like a full beard.</li>
            <li> and I can enjoy a steady growth.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t really bother me that much, because I swallow very quickly .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any head symptons like in the past</li>
            <li> the most noticeable, sideburns and jawline had some increase in hair and grew a little bit more hair on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit more thick too which is always nice.</li>
            <li> No more unwanted beard trim&#x27;s, Im able to style it however I choose!!</li>
            <li> I took it upon myself to stop taking them for a while (as of the week that I am typing this review) and so far I am midway through the week and have been feeling perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> So, within 10 days, you will have finished your first bottle of beardilizer.</li>
            <li> However, I am sure for anyone else that can, this product would work well for invigorating their facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nothing dad!</li>
            <li> First used intensive treatment to build up in my system.</li>
            <li> Since my last update, I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t been able to grow ANY facial hair (before this treatment), then this product will probably not work for you.    </li>
            <li> So I re-ordered these supplements after the first go around.</li>
            <li> there was an unsual striking pain on the left side of my head</li>
            <li> The first 2 weeks werent showing&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a while before I wrote this review, so I took Beardilizer consistently for about 6 weeks now</li>
            <li> I have to say I was not  crazy about taking that much pills per day, but it is really making a difference</li>
            <li> I feel that if I had kept taking them religiously for 6 months I&#x27;d notice a good difference, but I just can&#x27;t afford $30 a bottle when it only lasts 10 days.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really make my facial hair look any thicker or better.</li>
            <li> First I decided to go with the intense treatment, which means 9 capsules per day.</li>
            <li> The first go around, I really didn&#x27;t follow that method.</li>
            <li> and at first I didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much just a multivitamin..</li>
            <li> long till I see more beard hair growing ?</li>
            <li> It is now full, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I will certainly re-order this product soon</li>
            <li> The pills are large though, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a typo on the bottle</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s purely dependent on genetics and if your genes did not put hair follicles on your face, you can buy any product you want</li>
            <li> The first go around a few months back, I experienced headaches often and that was after taking 3-a-day.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty decent growth to begin with</li>
            <li> , so I really was expecting to see additional growth/length in my Beard.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> I expected much more of this product.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work but fast shipping</li>
            <li> It is not convenient and I don&#x27;t like to swallow that much capsules per day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really consider that a money saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not so much bang for the</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well, even over an extended period of time, and they smell absolutely rancid.</li>
            <li> (3 morn/3 lunch/ 3 dinner) for 10 days straight.  </li>
            <li> When doing the 10 day treatment, I really didn&#x27;t notice a drastic change.</li>
            <li> My beard was noticeable b4 even taking the supplements, but still very spotty on one side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because I thought this would really work.</li>
            <li> If you do decided to try it 1 thing I do give this product is that it does come fast</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really work for me, either I have to keep buying a monthly supply or they are just a scam.</li>
            <li> it really works for me.</li>
            <li> For my part, it really took 6 weeks to get to see results, but after that, it just delivered.</li>
            <li> I really thought it was gonna work....</li>
            <li> No growth absolutely at all.</li>
            <li> I took the whole bottle using the &amp;#34;Intense treatment&amp;#34; (3 pills a day) and saw no results.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really know if it is working or not</li>
            <li> Either way, it’s really</li>
            <li> hope this gets me laid thanks</li>
            <li> i did the intense program and ran out immediately.</li>
            <li> I used 2 whole bottles</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing....</li>
            <li> and I told them there&#x27;s no secret I been using beardlizer</li>
            <li> As other guys have posted these have a pretty strong odor.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, back to the part when I talk about the beard, I can&#x27;t say that uv gotten a bigger fuller beard, and I still have some bright hair at some places, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve gotten hair in places when I usually got bald spots, and that was a huge positive result for me, so</li>
            <li> I understand some people are not totally satisfied with it, but I think it’s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It took me three months to go from to go from a 10 days patchy beard to a full beard ½ inch beard, which is a total of 4 bottles.</li>
            <li> As I see it, you have to be consistent with the treatment, as it will not be obviously working the first month.</li>
            <li> With all that i defineately see more results with further use mixed in with biotin.</li>
            <li> I am very determined to grow a full beard as I am approaching my mid 30s.</li>
            <li> I did see some thickness in hair that I already had and noticed some other areas where the really light hair got darker.</li>
            <li> Into the fifth week Ive started seeing new hair on my patches, while the rest of my beard was getting thicker.</li>
            <li> Well I have to say that I am very pleasantly surprised by this Beardilizer!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking these pretty regularly and had noticeable results.</li>
            <li> At first I was using it religiously.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, and my first one ordered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> other than that they really aren&#x27;t worth it if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really gauge beardilizer yet, but I can tell you that taking 9 pills a day is pretty rough.</li>
            <li> Still waiting on some more hair had it for a month only a little bit of hair grew</li>
            <li> Maybe just a little more hair sprouting in my cheek/neck area, but my overall beard was still somewhat spotty.</li>
            <li> It kinda worked but it gave me a lot of acne, so fuller beard but lots of acne or not so fulled bear and clear skin, make your choice.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve only been taking it for 2 days, and I really can&#x27;t comment on the progress yet,</li>
            <li> I am surprised with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Remember, you sort of need some type of facial hair to begin with in order to really see results.</li>
            <li> Naturally, once I completed the 10 day treatment, I ran out of vitamins (there&#x27;s 90 all together).  </li>
            <li> But over the course of the last few weeks, the headaches have been more frequent.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of facial hair and was really eagar to try this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to see what the next batch will do for me.</li>
            <li> It help my beard growth progress slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> and I can see significant growth in my facial hair only a week later!</li>
            <li> I just want to say it works, but I might have to buy more bottles cause the two bottles I bought didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle, fourth month, and first time I purchase it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Unless it really starts to make a difference in the next week, I&#x27;ll probably just stick to Vitabeard---or just give up in general.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t itch terribly anymore, which is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Yes it does work, but only because I never had problem growing facial hair in the first place, this was just to speed it up</li>
            <li> Take as instructed but dont expect a full blown beard in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> , these pills smell like a dead rotten whale carcass pulled out of a sewer, and the taste is pretty vulgar, the best way is just to get it down as fast as you possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from all that, these pills really do work, they get 5 starz in my book.</li>
            <li> Once the bottle is done and if I don&#x27;t see any MAJOR results, that will be THE END of being a guinea pig.</li>
            <li> I think the trick is to be consistent, like in any other hair treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: I&#x27;ve already taken 1 full bottle of Vitabeard, and have noticed slight changes to my facial hair.</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s a complete lie about what is actually in the pills.</li>
            <li> I hope that in a near future my beard will be as majestic as I always wanted!</li>
            <li> I have been taking these for about a week or so, though I haven&#x27;t to much in the way of a growth change just yet, I&#x27;ve noticed a few new seedlings in places there wasn&#x27;t any before, and</li>
            <li> My facial hair does grow faster than it had in the past, but I hadn&#x27;t noticed a huge difference that would make me want to spend $40 for a third bottle.</li>
            <li> I did see some new growth but not much while and after taking this .</li>
            <li> Apparently the initial phase can go from 1 to 6 weeks, depending on your facial hair.</li>
            <li> The Beardilizer pills smell really strong, much worse than Vitabeard.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve decided to try it out, at least hoping to fulfill my lifelong dream of having a full beard.</li>
            <li> I have a few new hairs after starting this a week ago, I don&#x27;t have any itching sensations, and my hair feels a lot softer even after a week of use.</li>
            <li> So far I have notice a slight change in my beard growth,as of today it&#x27;s my fourth week using  it,  </li>
            <li> Not a healthy thing to be taking as much as the bottle recommends either.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough yet</li>
            <li> I saw no major change in hair growth using this product.</li>
            <li> Read the directions at beard-growth.com people who made this decent product didn&#x27;t spend months or yrs developing some bull crap ,Just to take people money , i think this deserve more credit,and it works you have to give it time .</li>
            <li> it is a complete waste of your time and your money.</li>
            <li> I see absolutely no change in my facial hair growth.</li>
            <li> Just started using it not to long ago</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how long...</li>
            <li> I can barely stomach these down without gagging.</li>
            <li> other company i dealed with actually talked to me (which they did)</li>
            <li> Within a month of using this product I&#x27;ve developed a small soul patch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, not really worth it, especially at this price</li>
            <li> A VERY LONG TIME!</li>
            <li> I wish the company could provide the same treatment with less capsules.</li>
            <li> nothing then I started reading reviews to use a second bottle and the hair will start growing half ways trough the 2 nf bottle and NADA</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it DOES work, as I have been using it for roughly a month and have noticed a slight increase in the growth of my beard</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little extra growth in my problem spots.</li>
            <li> (started w/ 6 a day then dropped to 3) and the results have been a little mixed.</li>
            <li> I could smell it on my breath for the next few hours.</li>
            <li> Not really any difference</li>
            <li> but there is NO WAY I can continue this 9-a-day stuff for the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I order the Beardalizer to help with facial hair growth I was expecting hair grow in areas in which I had trouble growing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected.</li>
            <li> The other pills I&#x27;ve tried do to</li>
            <li> All I can say is THIS BETTER work because it SMELLS horrid and TASTES even worse !!!</li>
            <li> Goooooodl luck getting them down</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been taking it the hair on my chin has began to fill in and spread down my neck.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it less than one star.</li>
            <li> I was taking the 3 doses every day for about 2 months and then started to take it less.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve seen SLIGHT improvement,(I&#x27;m using this product along w/ a beard oil)</li>
            <li> I did have less problem with the ends of the hair breaking off though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little on the fence about this product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been taking this for a little while now</li>
            <li> cuz I felt horrible only after taking them and when I stopped I felt fine</li>
            <li> a multi-vitamin too, but if you look at the product label, it’s rather heavy on the B Vitamins - B Vitamins are noted to aid in hair growth and health.</li>
            <li> and i used it everyday and nothing happened</li>
            <li> Waste of my money</li>
            <li> This is a sympton that I&#x27;ve never experienced on a DAILY basis before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Beardilizer for a few weeks now, and it just doesn’t work the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it anymore</li>
            <li> I started out with just a few chin hairs before I tried beardilizer.</li>
            <li> its a waste.</li>
            <li> so I thought the recommended dose was a little overboard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian dude that had really bad facial hair.</li>
            <li> It makes it hard to swallow the pills due to the odor !!</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I am currently on Day 2 of the 9-a-day and my head is once again experiencing a &#x27;weird feeling.&#x27;</li>
            <li> It just drives me insane that I haven&#x27;t been able to.    </li>
            <li> I took this for a month with no noticeable change to facial hair...which is sad since I could grow virtually NONE</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is possible or am I just seeing things wrong</li>
            <li> Gave me the worst headache the first and second day.</li>
            <li> Since there is only one review for Beardilzer at this time (which I&#x27;m convinced is fake)</li>
            <li> I would have rated it better but the smell and taste are horrible.</li>
            <li> I will continue with treatment,I have no doubts about this product ,it seems to work ,my thing is to people who have negative comments,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt complied to write I review, you order a product, you get it, you use it, end of process. Everything went smooth up until I used this &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;. I picked it up at the mailbox and I could instantly smell it. Opened the product and threw up from the smell. It smells like a used diaper filled with Indian food or bigfoot&#x27;s...you know. Against my best judgement, I tool a pill with breakfast, because I&#x27;m just done with this patchy beard. I could smell it on my breath for the next few hours. Don&#x27;t do it. Don&#x27;t even try. This product is absolutely disgusting. I&#x27;m suprises the workers in their facility haven&#x27;t died from the oder. I wish I could give it less than one star. I&#x27;m not going to even return it, as I would not want to subject the mailman with this foul, inhumane product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Just one of those things that works for some and not for others so you&#x27;ll have to try it yourself to find out your result.</li>
            <li> Not bad of a product. I am satisfied for making this purchase. Overall a good product, thank you. :)</li>
            <li> I’ve started taking a mutli-vitamin since I turned 34 and had just ran out when I read about this product, a vitamin, called Beardilizer. Now I found it here on Amazon with a great price too. it’s a very good a multi-vitamin too, but if you look at the product label, it’s rather heavy on the B Vitamins - B Vitamins are noted to aid in hair growth and health. I can say I’ve noticed nice beard growth results from taking beardilizer.  I believe my beard is at it’s medium Length, so I really was expecting to see additional growth/length in my Beard.  It seems a bit more thick too which is always nice. I will certainly re-order this product soon: it delivered: 5 stars in my book</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying it.</li>
            <li> does this work for teens</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. I expected much more of this product. There should be a warning on the bottles that states you will get diarrhea. Sorry to say. Also smell horrible. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying these pills again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any type of change from 1 bottle.</li>
            <li> I seen no difference when i used this product. Maybe this works for people who already has a beard. But this did not work for me at all. I started using this 4 weeks ago and i used it everyday and nothing happened</li>
            <li> Took it for a month twice a day it gives you energy and really works don&#x27;t take a night or you want sleep but definitely good product</li>
            <li> Doesnt work but fast shipping</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough yet</li>
            <li> They smell horrendous.</li>
            <li> Everything was just fine</li>
            <li> I have tried many products before but this is the one that I will keep on using for years to come. It  leaves hair,beard and mustache  soft and gives a good sheen!! Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me at all I don&#x27;t recommend to anyone. Waste of my money I was really excited to take product but did nothing for me</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying first: I Love this Product! Beardilizer has been great for me... and my beard!! It is now full, soft and shiny. This is why I&#x27;ve decided to take some time to go into more details about this product. First I decided to go with the intense treatment, which means 9 capsules per day. It is not convenient and I don&#x27;t like to swallow that much capsules per day. I wish the company could provide the same treatment with less capsules. But this is the initial phase only, and I did it for 3 weeks. But after this time, I could already see a huge difference. The thing with this product is that you have to play it by hear, which means that once you feel you reach a growth level that is satisfying, you reduce the treatment to 3 capsules per day. Apparently the initial phase can go from 1 to 6 weeks, depending on your facial hair. I have used this product for 4 months already, and the I love the result. I think a beard needs to be taken care of like hair, and I keep telling the people around me to use this product. I hope you will enjoy it to.</li>
            <li> I have to say that when my friend told me about a beard growth vitamin out there, I was skeptical ... but I&#x27;ve decided to try it out, at least hoping to fulfill my lifelong dream of having a full beard. Well I have to say that I am very pleasantly surprised by this Beardilizer! It works, for real!! I decide to go at the beginning with the regular treatment of 3 caps per day, and after a week, I increased to 9 caps per day. I have to say I was not  crazy about taking that much pills per day, but it is really making a difference and it gives you the initial boost to get from scarce hair to something that&#x27;s looking more like a full beard. Now I am back on the regular 3 pills per day and I can enjoy a steady growth. God I love having a beard! This is my third bottle, fourth month, and first time I purchase it on Amazon. Looooove it!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve only been taking it for 2 days, and I really can&#x27;t comment on the progress yet, but I just thought I&#x27;d shed some light in comparison to Vitabeard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Cost: Beardilizer is like 2 or 3 dollars cheaper than Vitabeard. I don&#x27;t really consider that a money saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Pill count: Both bottles provide 90 pills. However, you will only take 3 Vitabeard pills a day, compared to 9 with beardilizer. So, within 10 days, you will have finished your first bottle of beardilizer. Not so much bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Vitamin components: Both products contain essentially the same ingredients at the same measurements. However, Vitabeard includes a proprietary blend--not sure what&#x27;s in there. And of course the serving size is different. You will get the same amount of supplementation from 1 vitabeard pill as you will 3 beardilizer pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I&#x27;ve already taken 1 full bottle of Vitabeard, and have noticed slight changes to my facial hair. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s like this crazy miracle drug, but I think it works to some extent. I can&#x27;t really gauge beardilizer yet, but I can tell you that taking 9 pills a day is pretty rough. Unless it really starts to make a difference in the next week, I&#x27;ll probably just stick to Vitabeard---or just give up in general.</li>
            <li> I did see some new growth but not much while and after taking this . I Was hoping for better results since i was taken so many a day . However the hair that i already had on my face looked/felt MUCH better while taking these .</li>
            <li> Doest NOT work! But then again, I couldn&#x27;t grow much facial hair to begin with. However, I am sure for anyone else that can, this product would work well for invigorating their facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nothing dad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past.. But this one really works!! So many products make promises but never delivers, this one does like no other product before it!! I was so frustrated for years because I could not get my beard to grow the way I wanted it to. But with this product my worries are over!! No more unwanted beard trim&#x27;s, Im able to style it however I choose!! Not to mention the Mrs loves it!!! Thanks for a fantastic product!!</li>
            <li> Taking it every day. Happy with it completely.</li>
            <li> Not really any difference</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work , I took all 60 pills and nothing happened. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that really works. Saw results in two weeks , plan to use this product again. Another 30 day supply atleast.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well, even over an extended period of time, and they smell absolutely rancid.</li>
            <li> Dosent do anything. Smells and tastes awful</li>
            <li> Great product within first week saw a difference . First used intensive treatment to build up in my system. Then care treatment . Now just ordered second bottle . Great product.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for almost a month now i see not result.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these for about a week or so, though I haven&#x27;t to much in the way of a growth change just yet, I&#x27;ve noticed a few new seedlings in places there wasn&#x27;t any before, and I don&#x27;t itch terribly anymore, which is pretty awesome. Let me warn you!, these pills smell like a dead rotten whale carcass pulled out of a sewer, and the taste is pretty vulgar, the best way is just to get it down as fast as you possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from all that, these pills really do work, they get 5 starz in my book.</li>
            <li> not working !!!  after a two month treatment....the pills are big and smelly !!!! i hate it !!!!!  run away from this s*** !!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking these pretty regularly and had noticeable results. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a night and day difference by any means, but I have noticed some fill in. I have pretty decent growth to begin with and I was just looking for something to help fill in the lighter, thinner sections. I have noticed a little extra growth in my problem spots. At first I was using it religiously. I was taking the 3 doses every day for about 2 months and then started to take it less. I feel that if I had kept taking them religiously for 6 months I&#x27;d notice a good difference, but I just can&#x27;t afford $30 a bottle when it only lasts 10 days.</li>
            <li> I have a few new hairs after starting this a week ago, I don&#x27;t have any itching sensations, and my hair feels a lot softer even after a week of use. I am surprised with the results so far. I took Vitabeard for a month and it did nothing for me. I definitely would recommend this product who is struggling to have a beard!!!!</li>
            <li> Still waiting on some more hair had it for a month only a little bit of hair grew</li>
            <li> I should start by saying that I was quite skeptical about that one. It was a friend of mine that convinced me to purchase this product. This is my second bottle, and my first one ordered on Amazon. Aside of the good Amazon service, the second bottle is the one that really kicked in for me. Into the fifth week Ive started seeing new hair on my patches, while the rest of my beard was getting thicker. As I see it, you have to be consistent with the treatment, as it will not be obviously working the first month. But now I can say it works: I will be continuing until I get my beard. Overall very good and surprising.</li>
            <li> ************* NOVEMBER 22 2014 ****************    Just wanted to update my review for anyone still fetching for info.  Since my last update, I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more bottles.  The last bottle, I did what the instructions on Beardilzer&#x27;s website advised, which is 9 capsules a day (3 morn/3 lunch/ 3 dinner) for 10 days straight.  That is for intensive care purposes to see the best results. Remember, you sort of need some type of facial hair to begin with in order to really see results. If you haven&#x27;t been able to grow ANY facial hair (before this treatment), then this product will probably not work for you.    When doing the 10 day treatment, I really didn&#x27;t notice a drastic change. Maybe just a little more hair sprouting in my cheek/neck area, but my overall beard was still somewhat spotty. Naturally, once I completed the 10 day treatment, I ran out of vitamins (there&#x27;s 90 all together).  I took a break for about a month and just recently ordered ANOTHER bottle, where I will now only do 3 a day. I haven&#x27;t experienced any head symptons like in the past and I&#x27;m guessing at this point that I&#x27;m ONLY buying it bc subconsciously I&#x27;m thinking that if I stopped, I won&#x27;t see any  results. Since I&#x27;ve seen SLIGHT improvement,(I&#x27;m using this product along w/ a beard oil) I suppose Beardilizer will be included every now and then. But I definitely don&#x27;t plan on going broke by re-upping every time I run out when the results aren&#x27;t adding up.     *************SEPT 15TH 2014 UPDATE***************    So I re-ordered these supplements after the first go around. My plan this time is to take them AS instructed... which is 9 pills a day! Beardilizer claims that this is for \\&quot;intensive care\\&quot; purposes. The first go around a few months back, I experienced headaches often and that was after taking 3-a-day.  Let me just say that I am currently on Day 2 of the 9-a-day and my head is once again experiencing a &#x27;weird feeling.&#x27; It isn&#x27;t quite a headache, but something along the lines of dizziness. .On Day 1 there was an unsual striking pain on the left side of my head but I was able to get through the day. My plan is to do the 9-a-day for 7 days (hopefully I won&#x27;t DIE as a result) and put these pills to the test. I&#x27;ve taken them w/ food and have been drinking SOLEY water. The first go around, I really didn&#x27;t follow that method. So let&#x27;s see what these supplements are made out of. My beard was noticeable b4 even taking the supplements, but still very spotty on one side. I&#x27;ll try and commit 7 days... but there is NO WAY I can continue this 9-a-day stuff for the next few weeks. Once the bottle is done and if I don&#x27;t see any MAJOR results, that will be THE END of being a guinea pig. I feel like I am risking great long-term health by taking products that aren&#x27;t really FDA approved. That goes for Beardilizer AND Vita-Beard. I&#x27;ve taken multi-vitamins (which they claim that this is) AND Biotin over the years and haven&#x27;t experienced the weirdness w/ my head b4. I will keep everyone posted.  ____________________________________________________________________________________    ***JUNE 24 2014***    I&#x27;m a little on the fence about this product. Personally, I think it DOES work, as I have been using it for roughly a month and have noticed a slight increase in the growth of my beard (although still somewhat spotty) but w/ this result also came an occasional headache. This is a sympton that I&#x27;ve never experienced on a DAILY basis before. Let me just say that I do NOT take this pill as instructed. I felt that 3x&#x27;s a day was sufficient; Morning, noon, night/Bkfast, lunch, dinner.  But over the course of the last few weeks, the headaches have been more frequent. I took it upon myself to stop taking them for a while (as of the week that I am typing this review) and so far I am midway through the week and have been feeling perfectly fine. I plan to resume taking them once this week completes (to see if the headaches reoccur) but if I continue to go through having headaches, Iwill trash them.    Also, I took Vitabeard b4 and can&#x27;t recall experiencing constant headaches, but I also can&#x27;t recall my beard growing the way it has w/ Beardilizer... so pick your poison I guess.  My beard is still thin (genetics) so my plan is to continue the on again/off again intake of Beardilizer and avoid shaving off my beard (just an occasional grooming of it) for the remainder of the year. I am very determined to grow a full beard as I am approaching my mid 30s. It just drives me insane that I haven&#x27;t been able to.    PS: Sorry for the long drawn out review, but I just get tired of reading ppl writing one or two sentences. I like to read in-depth reviews, so hopefully this can help someone out.</li>
            <li> I took this for a month with no noticeable change to facial hair...which is sad since I could grow virtually NONE beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would probably have been just as effective to spread manure on my face and fight through my gag reflex.</li>
            <li> My husband has the Joe dirt going on and this had made hair pop up all over he&#x27;s extremely happy since he thought he would never grow facial hair. He&#x27;d give it more stars if he could</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using beardilizer for 2 months religiously and still haven&#x27;t seen any results from it. It&#x27;s a shame because I thought this would really work. IT DID NOT! If you do decided to try it 1 thing I do give this product is that it does come fast so I have it 2 stars</li>
            <li> great produce will be using it again in the near future, it really works!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really work for me, either I have to keep buying a monthly supply or they are just a scam. I bought two in advance and nothing really changed, a grew a few patches here and there where I didn&#x27;t have any hair but other than that they really aren&#x27;t worth it if you ask me. But who knows, it could work for you.</li>
            <li> I dont know what to think, reading mix reviews for that product,&lt;br /&gt;because it really works for me. It is probably delivering different results&lt;br /&gt;from one person to another, but I can say that my beard just got thicker,&lt;br /&gt;and patchy areas are diminishing rapidly. The first 2 weeks werent showing&lt;br /&gt;results, but after that it just kicked in. I am overall really happy with&lt;br /&gt;that product.</li>
            <li> Taste alone is enough said .</li>
            <li> I order the Beardalizer to help with facial hair growth I was expecting hair grow in areas in which I had trouble growing. I saw no major change in hair growth using this product. I was hoping that it would but it did not for me.. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I went on a 2 month supply and didnt notice results til about 5 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;My chin and neck hairs were the most noticeable, sideburns and jawline had some increase in hair and grew a little bit more hair on my cheeks. With all that i defineately see more results with further use mixed in with biotin. Take as instructed but dont expect a full blown beard in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Like WEILL, I agree totally – This product works great for me. I understand some people are not totally satisfied with it, but I think it’s an amazing product. Of course, I wish it was cheaper, because I am already at 4 months, but in order to be successful, you have to go all the way until you get where you want to be. For my part, it really took 6 weeks to get to see results, but after that, it just delivered. I would compare it to Minoxidil, but cheaper. Overall A+. Also, this was the first time I ordered it through Amazon and service was perfect as expected.</li>
            <li> Im using 3rd pack of beardilizer and I havent notice any difference...I dont know if I should continue or not?</li>
            <li> it is a complete waste of your time and your money. Do not buy into this. Try Rogaine. i&#x27;ve been using it and have seen a significant improvement with it!!</li>
            <li> Is not working at all for me.  I see absolutely no change in my facial hair growth.</li>
            <li> still waiting... but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me at all. I have a bit of facial hair and was really eagar to try this product becasue I really thought it was gonna work.... but nothing..I don&#x27;t know if this is possible or am I just seeing things wrong but my facial hair actually looked like it was growing slower. I had shaved when I got the product so I can see how effective it was but I was back to square one, same amount before I got the bottle...No growth absolutely at all.</li>
            <li> Gave me the worst headache the first and second day. Will update if it actually works.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is efficient, in that it will improve your facial hair growth. No you wont magically have a full grown beard in a month if you&#x27;ve never had one before, but you will see improvements in beard fullness and growth speed. I personally saw results around the one month mark. The product will do what it says but its a matter of your own patience and followthrough with its daily doses.</li>
            <li> I took the whole bottle using the &amp;#34;Intense treatment&amp;#34; (3 pills a day) and saw no results.</li>
            <li> Farce of a product. Not a healthy thing to be taking as much as the bottle recommends either. Will probably just make you a bit sick with a patchy beard.</li>
            <li> I chose this to try it out and also I wanted to grow my beard out and let it all connect and be full but I stop using it for a while so I don&#x27;t really know if it is working or not</li>
            <li> I have been taking Vita Beard for several months with great results. I bought these because they appear to have the same ingredients as Vita Beard, but at a cheaper price. I thought I could save some money. Since there is only one review for Beardilzer at this time (which I&#x27;m convinced is fake) I feel it is important to share my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. These pills have 1/3 the amount of the ingredients that Vitabeard does. Look at the supplement facts: these have the same amounts in 3 pills as Vitabeard does in 1 pill - that’s only ⅓. The pills are large though, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a typo on the bottle or if it&#x27;s a complete lie about what is actually in the pills. Either way, it’s really sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Beardilizer pills smell really strong, much worse than Vitabeard. I can barely stomach these down without gagging. They stink up the entire kitchen when I open the bottle and you can taste them for hours afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. VitaBeard works, I know this because I&#x27;ve been using it. I&#x27;ve tried Beardilizer for a few weeks now, and it just doesn’t work the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Beardilizer is probably a “snake oil” scam. It doesn&#x27;t work, it smells horrible, and the label is really fishy.</li>
            <li> Was the biggest skeptic, now 3 bottles later I will be a life time user.... saw thicker fuller facial hair an it grew quickly... patches went away... hope this gets me laid thanks</li>
            <li> If I could give it 0 stars I would. I used this product 3 times a day every day for 2 months and not the slightest results. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Well all I can say is it works for me. If you expect to grow a beard in a week, that’s not the product you are looking for. It needs time to kick in, but it fills up the patchy area and strengthen existing facial hair. I think the trick is to be consistent, like in any other hair treatment. I had read before about the taste, well it does not taste bad, but it smells bad. I guess this is the price to have a nice beard… It took me three months to go from to go from a 10 days patchy beard to a full beard ½ inch beard, which is a total of 4 bottles. I decided to buy the last one with Amazon and the service was great, so I will continue with them. Overall a very interesting product with great results – 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> I like beardilizer better than vitabeard. It seem to make my beard growth thicker. I take it 3 times per day. I have no really bad side effects from taking it. It help my beard growth progress slowly but surely. I don&#x27;t understand why all the negative reviews, except the bad odor in the pill. It don&#x27;t really bother me that much, because I swallow very quickly . I will continue taking it until I believe it is no longer effective for me.</li>
            <li> Not enough in bottle to tell if it worked. i did the intense program and ran out immediately.I will try it again to see if it works</li>
            <li> All I can say is THIS BETTER work because it SMELLS horrid and TASTES even worse !!! I opened this in my 700sq foot bedroom and the odor from this stuff filled the room in a matter seconds!!!! It makes it hard to swallow the pills due to the odor !! Goooooodl luck getting them down</li>
            <li> I did see some thickness in hair that I already had and noticed some other areas where the really light hair got darker. I&#x27;m trying one more bottle to see if I get better results. I would have rated it better but the smell and taste are horrible.</li>
            <li> Just started using it not to long ago and I already see a difference. I will definitely purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Bought the bottle used it all for a month and nothing then I started reading reviews to use a second bottle and the hair will start growing half ways trough the 2 nf bottle and NADA I used 2 whole bottles and it&#x27;s just a scam your best bet would be to use biotin pills</li>
            <li> As other guys have posted these have a pretty strong odor.  The other pills I&#x27;ve tried do to so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Comparing the ingredients to a normal multivitamin, these have more of everything so I thought the recommended dose was a little overboard.  I took one in the morning and one at night every day for a month.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference in growth and the patchy spots stayed patchy.  I did have less problem with the ends of the hair breaking off though.  Not a bad product at all, but my search continues.</li>
            <li> followed the instructions from the bottle and did not see any results...waste of my money all i got from the company was congratulations and good luck with your purchase of our product........ you&#x27;ve been warned</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a while before I wrote this review, so I took Beardilizer consistently for about 6 weeks now (started w/ 6 a day then dropped to 3) and the results have been a little mixed. I&#x27;ve never had a problem growing a beard, but I have an area where hair doesn&#x27;t grow (hence me trying Beardilizer) so I thought it was worth the $40. My facial hair does grow faster than it had in the past, but I hadn&#x27;t noticed a huge difference that would make me want to spend $40 for a third bottle. The silver lining for me is that I&#x27;ve gotten over my obsession w/ growing a beard and giving up and letting nature run its course. It smells bad (like a lot of vitamins do), but it isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I didn&#x27;t see the results I had initially hoped for it doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you. A lot of reviews state that you&#x27;ll begin to see a difference around the 5-10 wk mark. I still have pretty good amount left to finish, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again after I finish this bottle. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> It kinda worked but it gave me a lot of acne, so fuller beard but lots of acne or not so fulled bear and clear skin, make your choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product since November I&#x27;m on my second bottle and still no results. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it anymore this is a scam. They know there are people that really would love to have an beard. I&#x27;m from Cincinnati</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been taking this for a little while now and at first I didn&#x27;t see much improvement. Now, I look like wooly willy! My beard hasn&#x27;t grow any faster, but my eyebrows look like trained guinea pigs!</li>
            <li> I started out with just a few chin hairs before I tried beardilizer. Within a month of using this product I&#x27;ve developed a small soul patch. I&#x27;m ready to see what the next batch will do for me.</li>
            <li> Best product for young men trying to grow facial hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy made my ex very angry over any little thing... wouldn&#x27;t recommend it again</li>
            <li> I haven seen any mejor changes to be honest</li>
            <li> Took this stuff for... I don&#x27;t even know how long... A VERY LONG TIME! Probably about a year. It does nothing. May have some good vitimins but it definitely won&#x27;t make you grow a beard. I&#x27;m 28, I have a goatee but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever been able to grow. Tried this stuff for about a year and... nothing. Absolutely nothing.... I don&#x27;t know what I expected.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really make my facial hair look any thicker or better. It&#x27;s pretty much just a multivitamin.. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> got horrible chest acne from the product. had to stop using.</li>
            <li> no good everything is lie</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian dude that had really bad facial hair. I could only grow a moustache, soul patch and a couple chin hairs. I&#x27;ve been taking Beardilizer for about 3 weeks. Since I&#x27;ve been taking it the hair on my chin has began to fill in and spread down my neck. My sideburns are starting to thicken as well. I will be buying Beardilizer again.</li>
            <li> So far I have notice a slight change in my beard growth,as of today it&#x27;s my fourth week using  it,  I will continue with treatment,I have no doubts about this product ,it seems to work ,my thing is to people who have negative comments, Read the directions at beard-growth.com people who made this decent product didn&#x27;t spend months or yrs developing some bull crap ,Just to take people money , i think this deserve more credit,and it works you have to give it time .</li>
            <li> beardlilizer was probably one of the best companies i ordered from. EVER!&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem with my order and they helped me right away and than some!&lt;br /&gt;No other company i dealed with actually talked to me (which they did) they helped me with like when and how any and how often i should take it. and just talked to me period! for sure recommend getting it!&lt;br /&gt;and the beard part. its been 8 days and my beard is coming in thicker and starting to feel in the spots that couldnt get any. and i been growing it for a year and one week of this BAM its coming in! ordering more !&lt;br /&gt;EASYm 5 stars</li>
            <li> I Just ordered this product , I&#x27;m excited about it but I&#x27;m nervous if it&#x27;ll work or not ..&lt;br /&gt;Who has used this product ?&lt;br /&gt;How long till I see more beard hair growing ?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work i tried it for 30 days and nothing happen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically a multivitamin. Yes it does work, but only because I never had problem growing facial hair in the first place, this was just to speed it up but the smell and size of the pills is just awful and I feel like vomiting every time I take one. It will not help you if you can&#x27;t grow a beard to begin with. That&#x27;s purely dependent on genetics and if your genes did not put hair follicles on your face, you can buy any product you want but it ain&#x27;t going to make you grow a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not really worth it, especially at this price</li>
            <li> My family and friends were impressed when they saw me I was growing beard they asked me what was my secret and I told them there&#x27;s no secret I been using beardlizer and they couldn&#x27;t believe it</li>
            <li> I just want to say it works, but I might have to buy more bottles cause the two bottles I bought didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected. Anyway, back to the part when I talk about the beard, I can&#x27;t say that uv gotten a bigger fuller beard, and I still have some bright hair at some places, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve gotten hair in places when I usually got bald spots, and that was a huge positive result for me, so I hope that in a near future my beard will be as majestic as I always wanted!</li>
            <li> Bought it for a guy who says it didnt work for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking this for about a week and I already notice a difference. I used to shave all my peach fuzz once a week on Mondays. It&#x27;s only Wednesday and I can see significant growth in my facial hair only a week later!</li>
            <li> I wish I never bought these....</li>
            <li> Giving this a 4-star because i don&#x27;t see any difference yet. Seems to be a good product. Smells worse than words can say. waiting for results.</li>
            <li> Taste &amp; smells horrible but seems to work can tell a difference in less than a month</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all and by the way , this product increase the transformation of testosterone int estrogen (aromatization ) and it does not effect on the hair at all&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s completely horrible</li>
            <li> 1st day with the product,arrived on time with the amazon prime service, BUT man dose this stuff smell horrible, not to mention it make you burp constantly and the aftertaste is back i do not recommend to take with just water lol, overall i cant make a solid review over the performance of the product i will be make another in a week or so.</li>
            <li> took 3 pills a day. didnt work at all for me. terrible smell horrible product dont buy it. its a waste.</li>
            <li> horrible smell and pretty sure they made my blood pressure go up cuz I felt horrible only after taking them and when I stopped I felt fine</li>
