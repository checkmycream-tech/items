            <li>And having the 6.8 ounce it means I will smell great for awhile.</li>

            <li>Smells good and came in a huge bottle</li>
            <li>I bought the CK1 and the CKb and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Purchasing at Amazon was an even better deal than a buy-one-get-one, and at a Super Price, plus I got free shipping to too!!!  </li>
            <li>It is mild, pleasant and I had use this one before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, soft scent that I LOVE on him!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a classic !!!!!</li>
            <li>smells great with fair lasting smell</li>
            <li>Ck got this valued good-quality/good-volume proposition in most of his perfumes.</li>
            <li>Have received many compliments on the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li>had this perfume before (well, not from Amazon) and I never knew it could happen, it is more like a water gun</li>
            <li>I really love this perfume...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the item is not longer produced, there must be many counterfeits.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and always get compliments from it.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied as this is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>I got the CK BE thinking that Amazon was the seller and trusted most feedback.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have worn this for many years.  </li>
            <li>I order one or two bottles at a time and then order more when I run out.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>More than 15 years of released....</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;There are better parfurms....</li>
            <li>but I am sure I did.  </li>
            <li>Have always enjoyed CK Be.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to find it.</li>
            <li>Better than ck one</li>
            <li>Love Calvin Klein, been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li>My absolutely favorite CK and has been for quite a while.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love &amp; trust this product.</li>
            <li>It smells &#x27;ok&#x27; in the bottle but</li>
            <li>The product is amazing and the price no comments (too cheap).</li>
            <li>This is why I love Amazon</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this unisex perfume for years, and I really love it.</li>
            <li>my husband loves it! :)</li>
            <li>This was his perfect X-mas present</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting in that&#x27;s unapoligetically synthetic.  </li>
            <li>Ck Be has been out for many years now</li>
            <li>but I still love the scent.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne, with the exception of the sprayer.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be able to buy any again until I was browsing through Amazon and found it.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>and I received this smells more like alcohol and the fragrance stays for 15 min in body or clothing.</li>
            <li>Love it, one of my favorites</li>
            <li>but is a very clean and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>I Have loved this smell since it first came out in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>With that said, I enjoy the refreshing smell of Ck Be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a strong perfume, and that&#x27;s one of the reasons I like it so well.</li>
            <li>If it had a smell, I&#x27;m sure it would be nice, as most of CK stuff  has a natural, not over-powering, citrusy-green scent.</li>
            <li>I heard no bad comments although CK one is my favorite fragrance of the CK line.</li>
            <li>CK Be by Calvin Klein is an extraordinary fragrance!</li>
            <li>Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>He liked the price and the smell is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping(2days) and nice scent.</li>
            <li>It does not jump in your face like most scents, but instead hides back and defends with a potent fragrance that is both warm and seductive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The packing was great and this is the second bottle that I have brought from here.  </li>
            <li>I love to use every day, it is fresh, durable and smells like when you get out off the shower.</li>
            <li>But I got it in cheap price</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic fragrance.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a soft, gentle, clean, kind of soapy scent, THIS fragrance is for you my good fellow.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Great on all skins, refreshing, soft, sort of new laundry scent.</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT,  I HAVE BEEN USING CK BE FOR OVER 10 YEARS AT THIS</li>
            <li>The box and bottle looked OK not fake</li>
            <li>I purchased this colon from this company because I like CK smell however this perfume does not smell like the the original at all.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know whether the concentration of aroma meets the original standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>day.it reminds me of when it originally came out.</li>
            <li>i want to make sure if it not a fake one.</li>
            <li>It is a refreshing kind of smell that doesn&#x27;t make want to back away from hubs when he gets too close.</li>
            <li>It has that sort of synthetic character, like clean laundry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li>Its such a clean and appealing scent - good for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This product is a great quality, the only thing i didn&#x27;t like it was that the bottle was a little scratched, but over all great product.</li>
            <li>Fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>Most of the guys want to know where I got it, and how much it was.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and when you sell junk it really upsets me.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>and I only have good things to say about it.</li>
            <li>It is a different smell from that of Shock, but if you are like me and want to smell good all day, you will go for the CK Shock.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the full smell like when you buy it in the stores.</li>
            <li>It feels good to have it back</li>
            <li>Many stores in the area I live in do not have this available to purchase anymore.  </li>
            <li>When applied right (as in not too much) CK Be is a very nice, light, fresh scent that lasts a long time on clothing.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This has always been one of my favorites for my husband - happy to get it at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>To be CK Be is to be a fresh, modern, safe scent that is versatile in how it can be worn.  </li>
            <li>Very durable and light.</li>
            <li>Great year round.  </li>
            <li>but so worth the it.</li>
            <li>Can be worn by either women or men, as it changes when absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>I wish that I would have read the reviews first as they are all true.  </li>
            <li>I also think its more feminine than masculine.</li>
            <li>Great smell but not as strong or long lasting as CK Shock for Him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a pleasant scent, however it&#x27;s a bit of a let down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but not for long time ok no matter I have started using it next time I&#x27;ll order !</li>
            <li>The product was delivered right to my door</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s right for any occasion because it smells like it belongs on you.  </li>
            <li>Gentle and mysterious, an utterly sexy scent!</li>
            <li>one complaint is that it wears off quite quickly, shedding a great deal of its scent within the first hour or so.</li>
            <li>i feel that the smell is a little more feminine or refreshing, so</li>
            <li>really super fast - beats the crowd in the store anyday.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong and not too soft.</li>
            <li>i can see why it is a unisex fragrance, but its more of a very clean scent with a hint of alcohol that gives it a sweet smell, also a tiny tiny bit powdery.</li>
            <li>He got it really fast too!</li>
            <li>I have paid the retail price several times at more that twice the cost.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for the whole family!</li>
            <li>if your a guy thinking about buying this then u might want to test it at a store first.</li>
            <li>I think most people confuse CK BE with a variety of different colognes.</li>
            <li>Reminds me out a lovely that recently person that has passed away!</li>
            <li>So, I bought it, but where as i could spray myself with 2 sprays of the small bottle and be good, you need to hit yourself with about 10 from this bottle to even register.</li>
            <li>Not too strong that people would complain but just enough that if someone get close to you they can smell it.</li>
            <li>brings me back to middle school when i use to where it and its not to strong its a light cologne</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Comes highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it is very  annoing</li>
            <li>..smell like alcohol.not real perfume..</li>
            <li>I very like it sue for sport activity.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The scent was same as the one i smelled in airport duty free</li>
            <li>Amazon offered the product so much cheaper than Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The product came unsealed and the bottle was very scratched.</li>
            <li>This was a reasonable buy</li>
            <li>Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li>Fast delivered...</li>
            <li>that much..</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this cologne is the real CK be.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Classic CK scent ...</li>
            <li>It a unisex smell that isn&#x27;t either a prominent female or male fragrance.</li>
            <li>is a classic.</li>
            <li>like CK Be, even though it smells sort of like what a high class dryer sheet might be like.  </li>
            <li>I normally wear CK</li>
            <li>love the amount you get for less than $30!  </li>
            <li>I know that sounds strange, but it smells natural, really good - but not like you dumped half a bottle of perfume on yourself.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 3.4 from amazon and mine came new.</li>
            <li>Has a nice subtle smell to it.</li>
            <li>The formula for this scent seems to have changed since I first started wearing it several years ago.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice smell but the scent would not last that long , you have to spray again and again if you want a long duration of the scent</li>
            <li>like to use CK BE for most occasions, due to its subtle scent and smooth flavor.</li>
            <li>If you wonder why it comes in such a large bottle</li>
            <li>my opinion,  it&#x27;s kind of hard for me to imagine someone actually HATING this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is an old and well known essence in the market.</li>
            <li>so I got him one too, and shipped directly to his front door</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last too much.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that Amazon is selling this knock-off.</li>
            <li>Not too light and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>A subtle fragrance that says more about you than you think.</li>
            <li>not the same (true CK Be users will recognize) and there is absolutely no longevity.  </li>
            <li>overall i highly recommend you to&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>(we live in different states).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smile like black paint.</li>
            <li>I know black can&#x27;t smile, but this one is closest</li>
            <li>the typeface on the bottle is very sharp but CK be, this one I ordered has very bold and wide font..</li>
            <li>I got this directly from amazon.com at the end of March, and then it turned out that this is different from what I used to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently, there is no scent.</li>
            <li>It arrived just as expected and is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t mean it is cheap</li>
            <li>At first sight, both boxes were a bit opened and one of the sprayer that comes with it, was outside bouncing all inside the package box, so That means that this product does not come sealed or wrapped with the plastic that some other EDT have.</li>
            <li>I have used for CK Be for years (since it was first released) and this is definitely not true CK Be.  </li>
            <li>Nice soft smell which lingers faintly for a long time.</li>
            <li>The only con I see with this cologne is that the scent typically wears off within a few hours unless 6 or more sprays are applied.</li>
            <li>As soon as I walk out of the bathroom, the scent is basically gone and I am putting on 4X what I would typically use of &#x27;real&#x27; CK Be.</li>
            <li>Only first few hours</li>
            <li>am so disappointed that the scent is too far from CK BE,&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even smell good and stay long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is not original before lei buy a purchased a comment that said that he was the smell fast and correct, I have always used this perfume</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Have received many compliments on the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li> had this perfume before (well, not from Amazon) and I never knew it could happen, it is more like a water gun</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the item is not longer produced, there must be many counterfeits.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and always get compliments from it.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied as this is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> I got the CK BE thinking that Amazon was the seller and trusted most feedback.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have worn this for many years.  </li>
            <li> I order one or two bottles at a time and then order more when I run out.  </li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> More than 15 years of released....</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;There are better parfurms....</li>
            <li> but I am sure I did.  </li>
            <li> Have always enjoyed CK Be.</li>
            <li> so I was glad to find it.</li>
            <li> Better than ck one</li>
            <li> Love Calvin Klein, been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite CK and has been for quite a while.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love &amp; trust this product.</li>
            <li> It smells &#x27;ok&#x27; in the bottle but</li>
            <li> The product is amazing and the price no comments (too cheap).</li>
            <li> This is why I love Amazon</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this unisex perfume for years, and I really love it.</li>
            <li> my husband loves it! :)</li>
            <li> This was his perfect X-mas present</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting in that&#x27;s unapoligetically synthetic.  </li>
            <li> Ck Be has been out for many years now</li>
            <li> but I still love the scent.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, with the exception of the sprayer.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be able to buy any again until I was browsing through Amazon and found it.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> and I received this smells more like alcohol and the fragrance stays for 15 min in body or clothing.</li>
            <li> Love it, one of my favorites</li>
            <li> but is a very clean and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I Have loved this smell since it first came out in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> With that said, I enjoy the refreshing smell of Ck Be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a strong perfume, and that&#x27;s one of the reasons I like it so well.</li>
            <li> If it had a smell, I&#x27;m sure it would be nice, as most of CK stuff  has a natural, not over-powering, citrusy-green scent.</li>
            <li> I heard no bad comments although CK one is my favorite fragrance of the CK line.</li>
            <li> CK Be by Calvin Klein is an extraordinary fragrance!</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> He liked the price and the smell is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping(2days) and nice scent.</li>
            <li> It does not jump in your face like most scents, but instead hides back and defends with a potent fragrance that is both warm and seductive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The packing was great and this is the second bottle that I have brought from here.  </li>
            <li> I love to use every day, it is fresh, durable and smells like when you get out off the shower.</li>
            <li> But I got it in cheap price</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic fragrance.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a soft, gentle, clean, kind of soapy scent, THIS fragrance is for you my good fellow.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Great on all skins, refreshing, soft, sort of new laundry scent.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT,  I HAVE BEEN USING CK BE FOR OVER 10 YEARS AT THIS</li>
            <li> The box and bottle looked OK not fake</li>
            <li> I purchased this colon from this company because I like CK smell however this perfume does not smell like the the original at all.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know whether the concentration of aroma meets the original standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> day.it reminds me of when it originally came out.</li>
            <li> i want to make sure if it not a fake one.</li>
            <li> It is a refreshing kind of smell that doesn&#x27;t make want to back away from hubs when he gets too close.</li>
            <li> It has that sort of synthetic character, like clean laundry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li> Its such a clean and appealing scent - good for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is a great quality, the only thing i didn&#x27;t like it was that the bottle was a little scratched, but over all great product.</li>
            <li> Fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> Most of the guys want to know where I got it, and how much it was.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and when you sell junk it really upsets me.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> and I only have good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> It is a different smell from that of Shock, but if you are like me and want to smell good all day, you will go for the CK Shock.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the full smell like when you buy it in the stores.</li>
            <li> It feels good to have it back</li>
            <li> Many stores in the area I live in do not have this available to purchase anymore.  </li>
            <li> When applied right (as in not too much) CK Be is a very nice, light, fresh scent that lasts a long time on clothing.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorites for my husband - happy to get it at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> To be CK Be is to be a fresh, modern, safe scent that is versatile in how it can be worn.  </li>
            <li> Very durable and light.</li>
            <li> Great year round.  </li>
            <li> but so worth the it.</li>
            <li> Can be worn by either women or men, as it changes when absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> I wish that I would have read the reviews first as they are all true.  </li>
            <li> I also think its more feminine than masculine.</li>
            <li> Great smell but not as strong or long lasting as CK Shock for Him.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a pleasant scent, however it&#x27;s a bit of a let down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not for long time ok no matter I have started using it next time I&#x27;ll order !</li>
            <li> The product was delivered right to my door</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s right for any occasion because it smells like it belongs on you.  </li>
            <li> Gentle and mysterious, an utterly sexy scent!</li>
            <li> one complaint is that it wears off quite quickly, shedding a great deal of its scent within the first hour or so.</li>
            <li> i feel that the smell is a little more feminine or refreshing, so</li>
            <li> really super fast - beats the crowd in the store anyday.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong and not too soft.</li>
            <li> i can see why it is a unisex fragrance, but its more of a very clean scent with a hint of alcohol that gives it a sweet smell, also a tiny tiny bit powdery.</li>
            <li> He got it really fast too!</li>
            <li> I have paid the retail price several times at more that twice the cost.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for the whole family!</li>
            <li> if your a guy thinking about buying this then u might want to test it at a store first.</li>
            <li> I think most people confuse CK BE with a variety of different colognes.</li>
            <li> Reminds me out a lovely that recently person that has passed away!</li>
            <li> So, I bought it, but where as i could spray myself with 2 sprays of the small bottle and be good, you need to hit yourself with about 10 from this bottle to even register.</li>
            <li> Not too strong that people would complain but just enough that if someone get close to you they can smell it.</li>
            <li> brings me back to middle school when i use to where it and its not to strong its a light cologne</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Comes highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it is very  annoing</li>
            <li> ..smell like alcohol.not real perfume..</li>
            <li> I very like it sue for sport activity.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The scent was same as the one i smelled in airport duty free</li>
            <li> Amazon offered the product so much cheaper than Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The product came unsealed and the bottle was very scratched.</li>
            <li> This was a reasonable buy</li>
            <li> Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> Fast delivered...</li>
            <li> that much..</li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this cologne is the real CK be.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Classic CK scent ...</li>
            <li> It a unisex smell that isn&#x27;t either a prominent female or male fragrance.</li>
            <li> is a classic.</li>
            <li> like CK Be, even though it smells sort of like what a high class dryer sheet might be like.  </li>
            <li> I normally wear CK</li>
            <li> love the amount you get for less than $30!  </li>
            <li> I know that sounds strange, but it smells natural, really good - but not like you dumped half a bottle of perfume on yourself.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 3.4 from amazon and mine came new.</li>
            <li> Has a nice subtle smell to it.</li>
            <li> The formula for this scent seems to have changed since I first started wearing it several years ago.  </li>
            <li> it has a nice smell but the scent would not last that long , you have to spray again and again if you want a long duration of the scent</li>
            <li> like to use CK BE for most occasions, due to its subtle scent and smooth flavor.</li>
            <li> If you wonder why it comes in such a large bottle</li>
            <li> my opinion,  it&#x27;s kind of hard for me to imagine someone actually HATING this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is an old and well known essence in the market.</li>
            <li> so I got him one too, and shipped directly to his front door</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last too much.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that Amazon is selling this knock-off.</li>
            <li> Not too light and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> A subtle fragrance that says more about you than you think.</li>
            <li> not the same (true CK Be users will recognize) and there is absolutely no longevity.  </li>
            <li> overall i highly recommend you to&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> (we live in different states).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smile like black paint.</li>
            <li> I know black can&#x27;t smile, but this one is closest</li>
            <li> the typeface on the bottle is very sharp but CK be, this one I ordered has very bold and wide font..</li>
            <li> I got this directly from amazon.com at the end of March, and then it turned out that this is different from what I used to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently, there is no scent.</li>
            <li> It arrived just as expected and is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t mean it is cheap</li>
            <li> At first sight, both boxes were a bit opened and one of the sprayer that comes with it, was outside bouncing all inside the package box, so That means that this product does not come sealed or wrapped with the plastic that some other EDT have.</li>
            <li> I have used for CK Be for years (since it was first released) and this is definitely not true CK Be.  </li>
            <li> Nice soft smell which lingers faintly for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only con I see with this cologne is that the scent typically wears off within a few hours unless 6 or more sprays are applied.</li>
            <li> As soon as I walk out of the bathroom, the scent is basically gone and I am putting on 4X what I would typically use of &#x27;real&#x27; CK Be.</li>
            <li> Only first few hours</li>
            <li> am so disappointed that the scent is too far from CK BE,&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even smell good and stay long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is not original before lei buy a purchased a comment that said that he was the smell fast and correct, I have always used this perfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always difficult to know what other people think of it, but I have received an occasional comment on how nice it smells.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Its scent doesn&#x27;t stay last long...</li>
            <li> /&gt;CK BE is not your usual perfume, as its fragrance is much more subtle and unannounced.</li>
            <li> I bought to my wife who use it as work-days soft (not sweet) perfume option.</li>
            <li> At first i thought it was fake but realised its just a soft scent.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> the package is just as i expected and arrives much earlier than the estimate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4/5 for Ck Be!!&lt;br /&gt;(Doesn&#x27;t hold too long on the skin and that</li>
            <li> Also season-neutral, so it can be worn all year long.</li>
            <li> Am a long time user of this cologne and order it whenever I run out.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use for a long time coming.</li>
            <li> It opens with sharp citrus note very similar to notes being  in CK One.  </li>
            <li> I always had a big bottle of this in my collection until they discontinued it a few years back.  </li>
            <li> If you have a little CK One left, pour it in a gallon jug &amp; fill it up with water.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Received expected product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So be careful when you buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fragrance is what I expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> There is liquid, but not a dose of the fragrance expected.</li>
            <li> Not that the smell is bad, because it is not, it smells really good, but it feels subtle and not as attention grabbing as the Shock is.</li>
            <li> but it is not what I expected!</li>
            <li> Not sure why the smell wont last over 30 - 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> Be and any other perfume from here.  </li>
            <li> recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot less buying it here than I ever did in the department store I used to get it at.  </li>
            <li> How ever I just feel there&#x27;s something not right about the product&#x27;s label..</li>
            <li> I used to get this in a smaller size, but the price on this one was hard to beat.</li>
            <li> As it dries down it smooths out, the citrus notes become less sharp and some of the underlying sweetness develops.  </li>
            <li> Not a watered down version.</li>
            <li> Be careful when applying though as it is extremely overpowering and unpleasant in high concentrations.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lesson, Buy at a mall near you even if it is expensive, you get to smell taste the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neutral (no overpowering flower smells or anything heavy) and it smells like &amp;#34;fresh out the shower&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> bought this few times from Amazon now</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this fragrance after not having it in a few year.</li>
            <li> The perfume came in very bad conditions, it was waiting for a better sending.</li>
            <li> No strong smell.</li>
            <li> But then your scent is going to be a little unbearable for an hour or so until it starts to even out!</li>
            <li> Delivered a little late, but no problem.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE MY HARD EARNED MONEY BEING WASTED ON SUCH&lt;br /&gt;UNWORTHY PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> but the small scratches kinda annoys me :/</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened this time</li>
            <li> I will usually reapply two to three times a day, since it is so subtle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say it is fake, but it is definitely weird for it to last this little time.</li>
            <li> LATE TO THE GABAGE</li>
            <li> The strength of the cologne though was very weak, almost watered down.</li>
            <li> It is a totally differen, and unpleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I know this is a subtle scent, but I think my product is somehow weaker than it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> everyone like me every time i use this..</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Received expected product.</li>
            <li> it has a nice smell but the scent would not last that long , you have to spray again and again if you want a long duration of the scent</li>
            <li> Pricey but so worth the it. smells great with fair lasting smell</li>
            <li> I think this CK Be Toilette Spray is fake.  I believe it smells differently from the once displayed at retail sales stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really fast delivery. That was next day at my place.</li>
            <li> This is an old and well known essence in the market. I bought to my wife who use it as work-days soft (not sweet) perfume option. Ck got this valued good-quality/good-volume proposition in most of his perfumes.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time as promised. Have received many compliments on the scent of this perfume. Comes highly recommended!</li>
            <li> CK Be by Calvin Klein is an extraordinary fragrance! It has a fresh/clean aroma that stays close to skin and lingers all day. Gentle and mysterious, an utterly sexy scent! Sprayer is also included.</li>
            <li> My husband just want to surprise me (and he did) sending me this but I NEED to complain about the  pump tube!!! it throws the cologne not \\&quot;spray\\&quot; it!!! it is very  annoing and I just got it!! so it&#x27;s NEW!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had this perfume before (well, not from Amazon) and I never knew it could happen, it is more like a water gun then a perfume spray... how can I ask for another spray (pump tube) or send it back... Amazon says is harzadous and non-returnable!!!</li>
            <li> I can never tell if anyone can smell this cologne when I put it on. When I wear ck1 people compliment me and say I smell nice. This one I can&#x27;t tell if it smells bad or just doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Excelente 100% recomendable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume...it brings back memories..the package is just as i expected and arrives much earlier than the estimate.</li>
            <li> excellent buy for this price, I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a soft, gentle, clean, kind of soapy scent, THIS fragrance is for you my good fellow.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion,  it&#x27;s kind of hard for me to imagine someone actually HATING this fragrance. Smelled it once at a party and just like that, BOOM! \\&quot;I&#x27;m getting this baby\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 for Ck Be!!&lt;br /&gt;(Doesn&#x27;t hold too long on the skin and that sucks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but overall i highly recommend you to&lt;br /&gt;Try it out , you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Great price for size ... Classic CK scent ...</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when they stop selling this in store! Everywhere I go I get comments and questions about what I am wearing. Its such a clean and appealing scent - good for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, the scent is just awesome, very clean &amp; fresh and not overpowering.  The product was delivered right to my door really super fast - beats the crowd in the store anyday.  Plus after ording this for my man,(can be used by male or female) It was almost my dads birthday so I got him one too, and shipped directly to his front door (we live in different states).  He got it really fast too! I have paid the retail price several times at more that twice the cost.  Purchasing at Amazon was an even better deal than a buy-one-get-one, and at a Super Price, plus I got free shipping to too!!!  I am very pleased and will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Fresh and smooth. This is the sense in using the day to day, we felt like we had just left the shower! I recommend it for the whole family!</li>
            <li> I got this directly from amazon.com at the end of March, and then it turned out that this is different from what I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;It does not smell the same, and it smells nothing on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the item is fake.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, even though it says it says 6.8 ounce, I got 6.7 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the item is not longer produced, there must be many counterfeits.&lt;br /&gt;Even amazon has some of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be careful when you buy.</li>
            <li> bad..smell like alcohol.not real perfume..</li>
            <li> it is very good product, and it is cheaper than stores and got quick delivery of this product.</li>
            <li> The perfume did not come with a pump tube, so that makes it difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I bought the 3.4 from amazon and mine came new. i can see why it is a unisex fragrance, but its more of a very clean scent with a hint of alcohol that gives it a sweet smell, also a tiny tiny bit powdery. but is a very clean and refreshing scent. a daily use scent, for work, and a romantic evening. great scent.</li>
            <li> I very like it sue for sport activity. It&#x27;s smile like black paint. I know black can&#x27;t smile, but this one is closest I can imagine. Just loved.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT,  I HAVE BEEN USING CK BE FOR OVER 10 YEARS AT THIS IS TOTALLY FAKE, NOT FRAGANCE AT ALL ,I WOULD LIKE TO GET MY MONEY BACK</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and always get compliments from it.  Most of the guys want to know where I got it, and how much it was.  This is a very good deal for this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product does not have any scent...u are unable to tell if its even on. A waste of money.  Buying perfume online has become a challenge</li>
            <li> Came in, well packaged, it smells good! I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied as this is one of my favorite colognes. Not too strong and not too soft. It&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li> Thie is good for day to day usage. Not too strong that people would complain but just enough that if someone get close to you they can smell it. Even though it&#x27;s unisex i feel that the smell is a little more feminine or refreshing, so if your a guy thinking about buying this then u might want to test it at a store first. This is not going to smell like the cologne that you&#x27;re used to because it&#x27;s not. With that said, I enjoy the refreshing smell of Ck Be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;important note. I bought the 6.8 ounce version  sold by Amazon. It was already opened and used so i assume it was a tester but it didnt say so on this page. i just assume it was a tester because Amazon also have another page that sold the tester version. Not that big of a deal since it&#x27;s still cheaper to buy here but the small scratches kinda annoys me :/</li>
            <li> I got the CK BE thinking that Amazon was the seller and trusted most feedback.&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed that the scent is too far from CK BE,&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even smell good and stay long.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe that you are selling FAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson, Buy at a mall near you even if it is expensive, you get to smell taste the product.</li>
            <li> this ck b is great brings me back to middle school when i use to where it and its not to strong its a light cologne</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely.  Many stores in the area I live in do not have this available to purchase anymore.  Quick &amp; easy online!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Great on all skins, refreshing, soft, sort of new laundry scent. Long lasting. Great for day or night use. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> FAKE water. goes on smelling good. wears off immediate. Dont wast your money here. I love this stuff and when you sell junk it really upsets me. I hate getting ripped off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan</li>
            <li> It is mild, pleasant and I had use this one before. My wife also likes the smell as well and any if my friends those I have recommended this, they have bought it and liked it as well.</li>
            <li> The perfume came broken. I did NOT complain because I did not know how.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for many years.  I order one or two bottles at a time and then order more when I run out.  My girlfriend loves it too!</li>
            <li> Well I bought 2 units of this EDT CK BE 200ml/6.8Ounce. At first sight, both boxes were a bit opened and one of the sprayer that comes with it, was outside bouncing all inside the package box, so That means that this product does not come sealed or wrapped with the plastic that some other EDT have. The box and bottle looked OK not fake but when I tried it, it did not smell like the one I tried from the store... very disappointing!!!  It was way softer, had not the strength I remember it used to have. When I tried it at the store, It lasted me all day, a bit penetrating this scent I said... Well I don&#x27;t want to call it a fake but it is not what I expected! No more to say :( just disappointed.</li>
            <li> and he loved it. He liked the price and the smell is the real thing. You cant beat the price for name-brand Calvin Klein!!</li>
            <li> The perfume came in very bad conditions, it was waiting for a better sending. The purchase was not of my pleasure</li>
            <li> Love this.  Amazon is the only place I can find it. Great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this colon from this company because I like CK smell however this perfume does not smell like the the original at all.  I hd CK before but I was very disappointed on this product.  I will not recommend any one to order from this place.  Bad experience!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great smell if you like citrus based fragrances it has a very clean smell goes well for all the time smell.</li>
            <li> Smells good and came in a huge bottle so should last awhile.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping(2days) and nice scent. The scent was same as the one i smelled in airport duty free shop.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think its fake like some people in the review are saying.</li>
            <li> Terrible parfumr from Calvin Klein... More than 15 years of released....&lt;br /&gt;There are better parfurms.... This one not more !!!!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t remember ordering this but I am sure I did.  I heard no bad comments although CK one is my favorite fragrance of the CK line.</li>
            <li> love the amount you get for less than $30!  This has always been one of my favorites for my husband - happy to get it at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Have always enjoyed CK Be. It&#x27;s been difficult to find on the shelves of many stores so I was glad to find it.</li>
            <li> I like CK be so much.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I use it ofen.&lt;br /&gt;No reason.&lt;br /&gt;So i choice it.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the smell wont last over 30 - 40 minutes. I don&#x27;t want to say it is fake, but it is definitely weird for it to last this little time.</li>
            <li> Smells great n is not over powering. Has a nice subtle smell to it. I would definitely recommend it. Better than ck one</li>
            <li> Very nice woodsy smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and lays nicewly on the skin without irrating it. A subtle fragrance that says more about you than you think.</li>
            <li> This scent is great, I may even order this again. Mix it up with Calvin Klein escape, smell nice, I smell nice.</li>
            <li> Love Calvin Klein, been wearing it for years. Amazon offered the product so much cheaper than Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last too much.</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite CK and has been for quite a while. It&#x27;s neutral (no overpowering flower smells or anything heavy) and it smells like &amp;#34;fresh out the shower&amp;#34;. Also season-neutral, so it can be worn all year long. Can be worn by either women or men, as it changes when absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> Great perfume as it has always been. bought this few times from Amazon now &amp; I love &amp; trust this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not for long time ok no matter I have started using it next time I&#x27;ll order !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what happened with this product. I normally wear CK Be and I love it so much. However, I just opened this one and use it. Apparently, there is no scent. I tried to spray a lot, but it liked I sprayed water on my body. So disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Love it ! It&#x27;s a classic !!!!!</li>
            <li> I think most people confuse CK BE with a variety of different colognes. While CK BE is a cologne, it is meant to stand out for its purpose- for all occasions, and those in between.&lt;br /&gt;CK BE is not your usual perfume, as its fragrance is much more subtle and unannounced. It does not jump in your face like most scents, but instead hides back and defends with a potent fragrance that is both warm and seductive.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use CK BE for most occasions, due to its subtle scent and smooth flavor. I wear it to work so as not to protrude; I brandish it at family events so as not to disturb anyone else. I sometimes even wear it to bed.&lt;br /&gt;CK Be might seem upsetting by its mildness, but this is its purpose- to guard and exhilarate upon close contact.&lt;br /&gt;MY one complaint is that it wears off quite quickly, shedding a great deal of its scent within the first hour or so. I will usually reapply two to three times a day, since it is so subtle.</li>
            <li> The smell is Amazing.</li>
            <li> I wish that I would have read the reviews first as they are all true.  I have used for CK Be for years (since it was first released) and this is definitely not true CK Be.  Huge disappointment.  It smells &#x27;ok&#x27; in the bottle but not the same (true CK Be users will recognize) and there is absolutely no longevity.  As soon as I walk out of the bathroom, the scent is basically gone and I am putting on 4X what I would typically use of &#x27;real&#x27; CK Be. So, lesson learned. I am surprised that Amazon is selling this knock-off. I would not have purchased it from another seller here but since it was Amazon, I did. Not so trusting of Amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> The product came unsealed and the bottle was very scratched.</li>
            <li> Delivered a little late, but no problem. The product is amazing and the price no comments (too cheap).</li>
            <li> I got the product In time and in great condition!&lt;br /&gt;Ready for to celebrate father day! I will be a costumer in the future!</li>
            <li> It came open with no plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is what I expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you get what you pay for. This was a reasonable buy</li>
            <li> Amazon is the cheapest place I found to buy this product.  And I don&#x27;t mean it is cheap so don&#x27;t get me wrong.  But what I found it for on Amazon is what they should charge us in the store.  This is why I love Amazon it is the best place to shop.  The packing was great and this is the second bottle that I have brought from here.  I will continue to buy my CK Be and any other perfume from here.  And it arrived when they said it would.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.- it&#x27;s right for any occasion because it smells like it belongs on you.  I know that sounds strange, but it smells natural, really good - but not like you dumped half a bottle of perfume on yourself.  I get loads of compliments on it everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this unisex perfume for years, and I really love it. I put it on and forget it. I&#x27;m told it smells nice all day. It isn&#x27;t a strong perfume, and that&#x27;s one of the reasons I like it so well.</li>
            <li> Price is good for this product would like to find this size bottle and price for the bottle that says just CK ONE</li>
            <li> A PRODUCT THAT SMELLS GOOD JUST FOR 2 MINUTES WHEN USED.&lt;br /&gt;IT TOOK ALMOST  2 YEARS FOR ME TO KEEP THAT IN THE SHELF AND THROW OUT.&lt;br /&gt;THAT LATE TO THE GABAGE BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE MY HARD EARNED MONEY BEING WASTED ON SUCH&lt;br /&gt;UNWORTHY PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I love to use every day, it is fresh, durable and smells like when you get out off the shower. Very good cost- benefit.</li>
            <li> The delivery is quick, price is good, and I love the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. Its hard to find in store around here and when you do its expensive. This is a huge bottle for the price. Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> my husband loves it! :)</li>
            <li> I bought the CK1 and the CKb and this one is the best by far. It is a refreshing kind of smell that doesn&#x27;t make want to back away from hubs when he gets too close. A total difference from the CK1. This was his perfect X-mas present and I will keep buying this one. Very happy I got it and I sometimes wear it myself. It a unisex smell that isn&#x27;t either a prominent female or male fragrance.</li>
            <li> To be CK Be is to be a fresh, modern, safe scent that is versatile in how it can be worn.  It&#x27;s interesting in that&#x27;s unapoligetically synthetic.  It opens with sharp citrus note very similar to notes being  in CK One.  As it dries down it smooths out, the citrus notes become less sharp and some of the underlying sweetness develops.  A synthetic musky-woodsy character also becomes apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like CK Be, even though it smells sort of like what a high class dryer sheet might be like.  It has that sort of synthetic character, like clean laundry.  When applied right (as in not too much) CK Be is a very nice, light, fresh scent that lasts a long time on clothing.  Be careful when applying though as it is extremely overpowering and unpleasant in high concentrations.  It&#x27;s versatile, and I find it quite &amp;#34;be&amp;#34;coming.</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> This product is a great quality, the only thing i didn&#x27;t like it was that the bottle was a little scratched, but over all great product.</li>
            <li> Nice for every day use it will hold great</li>
            <li> Love it! Reminds me out a lovely that recently person that has passed away!</li>
            <li> The bottles arrived and smelled nothing like CKbe, I feel cheated. I&#x27;ve ordered it before and everything was great. Not sure what happened this time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a month now and I only have good things to say about it. Great price, great scent(lasts long), will order again.</li>
            <li> Ck Be has been out for many years now but I still love the scent. If you wonder why it comes in such a large bottle it&#x27;s because you need to apply a generous amount if you want it to last. The only con I see with this cologne is that the scent typically wears off within a few hours unless 6 or more sprays are applied. But then your scent is going to be a little unbearable for an hour or so until it starts to even out!</li>
            <li> Enquanto estiver &amp;agrave; venda, vou comprar e usar. A entrega ocorreu em 1 dia. Excelente!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivered... No damaged... How ever I just feel there&#x27;s something not right about the product&#x27;s label.. I have CK one at home too the typeface on the bottle is very sharp but CK be, this one I ordered has very bold and wide font.. Its scent doesn&#x27;t stay last long... Only first few hours and it&#x27;s gone.. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a fake one or not.. But I got it in cheap price so I&#x27;m not going to be worry that much.. I spray just for going to work anyway..</li>
            <li> You have TO TRY IT.  Really.  It is UNISEX and I am a girl. Also, BE by Calvin Klein is a classic.</li>
            <li> I like using this product and am happy with the scent of it. It&#x27;s always difficult to know what other people think of it, but I have received an occasional comment on how nice it smells.</li>
            <li> Excelent perfum for an excelent price.</li>
            <li> I Have loved this smell since it first came out in the 90&#x27;s.A must have for any collection. And having the 6.8 ounce it means I will smell great for awhile.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, with the exception of the sprayer.  It does not spray correctly</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!  I always had a big bottle of this in my collection until they discontinued it a few years back.  I never thought I&#x27;d be able to buy any again until I was browsing through Amazon and found it.  I spent a lot less buying it here than I ever did in the department store I used to get it at.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it!!</li>
            <li> The formula for this scent seems to have changed since I first started wearing it several years ago.  It&#x27;s still a pleasant scent, however it&#x27;s a bit of a let down.</li>
            <li> Great smell but not as strong or long lasting as CK Shock for Him. It is a different smell from that of Shock, but if you are like me and want to smell good all day, you will go for the CK Shock. Not that the smell is bad, because it is not, it smells really good, but it feels subtle and not as attention grabbing as the Shock is.</li>
            <li> but not this one. It is EDT so it&#x27;s supposed to be diluted a great deal. This one? You can&#x27;t even smell it. If it had a smell, I&#x27;m sure it would be nice, as most of CK stuff  has a natural, not over-powering, citrusy-green scent. I won&#x27;t buy it again unless I get to open the bottle and smell for myself. If you have a little CK One left, pour it in a gallon jug &amp; fill it up with water. You&#x27;ll then have something similar to this CK Be.</li>
            <li> You need to spray a lot of this to get its fragrance. At first i thought it was fake but realised its just a soft scent.&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hung of it its okay. I also think its more feminine than masculine. Not to a big deal kinda like sower gel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the full smell like when you buy it in the stores. It still smells good but there is just something off about it.</li>
            <li> I know this is a subtle scent, but I think my product is somehow weaker than it&#x27;s supposed to be. I only discovered the scent recently so I don&#x27;t know whether the concentration of aroma meets the original standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, this is a great scent and I&#x27;m mystified that it was ever discontinued.</li>
            <li> never purchase was made ...</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is perfect to any time in the day. Very durable and light. No strong smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this cologne is the real CK be. The scent is not the same as my last bottle.  It is a totally differen, and unpleasant scent.  I ordered 2 bottles, one for myself and one for a friend.  She also voiced her dis-content.  I noticed the bottom of the bottle did not have, what looked like on the last bottle I purchased, a certified label.  I will not purchase from thus company again.</li>
            <li> It feels good to have it back and it does last the entire day.it reminds me of when it originally came out.</li>
            <li> This product is not original before lei buy a purchased a comment that said that he was the smell fast and correct, I have always used this perfume and I received this smells more like alcohol and the fragrance stays for 15 min in body or clothing. A total scam ... do not recommend bad perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic fragrance.  Not too light and not too heavy.  Great year round.  Bought to replenish supply in our home</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this fragrance after not having it in a few year. It&#x27;s smell is timeless just as I remembered.</li>
            <li> My husband wears this, although I sometimes steal a squirt or two! It&#x27;s a beautiful, soft scent that I LOVE on him!</li>
            <li> Love it, one of my favorites</li>
            <li> Nice soft smell which lingers faintly for a long time.</li>
            <li> The cologne came in the volume promised, nice package and bottle. The strength of the cologne though was very weak, almost watered down. I used to get this in a smaller size, but the price on this one was hard to beat. So, I bought it, but where as i could spray myself with 2 sprays of the small bottle and be good, you need to hit yourself with about 10 from this bottle to even register. It&#x27;s a shame, because I like the scent of this cologne, but I&#x27;ll have to pass on it next time.</li>
            <li> It arrived just as expected and is the real deal.  The scent has always been my favorite and the wife is so happy I&#x27;m wearing it again!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! Buy it. I was going to re-order, but it&#x27;s out of stock :(</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of this item. This is the real deal. Not a watered down version.</li>
            <li> It came without plastic seal and lock. i want to make sure if it not a fake one. thank you</li>
            <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
            <li> There is NO hint of fragrance in this bottle. There is liquid, but not a dose of the fragrance expected. Would NOT purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Am a long time user of this cologne and order it whenever I run out.  Will continue to use for a long time coming.</li>
