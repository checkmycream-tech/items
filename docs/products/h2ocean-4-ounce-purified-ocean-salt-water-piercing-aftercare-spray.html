            <li>Years ago when my best friend and I got our navels pierced, this was the product</li>
            <li>Best of all with this experience with my cartilage, I did not need to go to my doctor after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best of all with this experience with my cartilage, I did not need to go to my doctor after all!     </li>
            <li>this product helped perfectly.  </li>
            <li>But works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent product and I don&#x27;t have time to soak in salt water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product!</li>
            <li>This product is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving the seller 2 stars not because the product isn&#x27;t great but because of the seller&#x27;s $8 shipping charge.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is so great.</li>
            <li>Like the title says, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>product is great for the after care of a piercing.  </li>
            <li>H2Ocean is great.</li>
            <li>so happy</li>
            <li>my eyebrow is one happy camper.</li>
            <li>Looked in great conditions.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>After I got my piercings I used this along with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Hemp Tea Tree Oil soap (great stuff as well) and I healed very nicely and never had any problems with redness or infection.  </li>
            <li>Together they make a great \\&quot;team\\&quot;! :)</li>
            <li>but I bet in a month I&#x27;ll be good to go.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible how quickly it works.</li>
            <li>After about a month of using it two or three times a day, I am bump free and can finally enjoy my beautiful nose piercing!</li>
            <li>It is so sanitary because it is in a concealed can and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definatly be ordering more and using with all my piercings!</li>
            <li>Even though piercers say not to take off the nose piercing until after it has healed, which can be up to a year, I decided that it was best for me because the original piercing was too large</li>
            <li>I wish they would sell huge cans of this stuff or like refillable cans because I would buy it immediately!  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>&quot; again, so I bought some more H2Ocean and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap and they took care of the problem.  </li>
            <li>This product, along with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap (instead of regular body soap that can sometimes irritate piercings) create an excellent aftercare regimen.</li>
            <li>From the perspective of a very experienced piercee: My only experience with this product has been on my piercings.  </li>
            <li>It did more than that.  </li>
            <li>This is magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I just had my nose pierced yesterday and am buying some more H2Ocean to use on it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad to have ordered with them.</li>
            <li>so I ordered some more H2Ocean.</li>
            <li>: While I highly recommend this product due to its ability to heal piercings successfully, prevent/rid infections and keloids, and believe that it is the best cleaner for piercings on the market, there are couple of things people need to remember about piercings.  </li>

            <li>Other than that WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>If your infection is really advanced (please never let it get to that point), H2O Ocean may not be able to clear it up all by itself - it&#x27;s a phenomenal cleaner, not an antibiotic.</li>
            <li>so I planned on going to the doctor that Monday, but in the meantime ran out and purchased H2Ocean after remembering my great experience with my navel hoping it would make things a little better.  </li>
            <li>and this product has helped to keep my piercing clean and not infected.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it another go, and when I did the piercer told me to use antibacterial soak to clean, and h2ocean to spray after wards.</li>
            <li>so I bought this product to clean my ears inbetween cleanings.  </li>
            <li>safe and enjoy your new adornment!</li>
            <li>Sometimes no matter which cleaner you use whether it be H2Ocean or something else, sometimes your body is more prone to reject piercings more than others, especially if you have a compromised immune system.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes no matter which cleaner you use whether it be H2Ocean or something else, sometimes your body is more prone to reject piercings more than others, especially if you have a compromised immune system.  </li>
            <li>I was still sore and SUPER itchy.</li>
            <li>My ear instantly felt better!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my piercing felt so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended H2Ocean and I can only try to express how incredibly relieved I am that this is a product that actually does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>the sea salt soaks at first, but quickly found I didn&#x27;t have the time.</li>
            <li>that the tattoo parlor sold to clean our new piercings.  </li>
            <li>But like others have said, please remember not to over clean your new piercing as you can irritate it and cause</li>
            <li>Now I just spray this instead, it&#x27;s not only way more convenient and portable, but it made the piercings heal faster then when I was doing the soaks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more convenient than doing sea salt soaks several times a day.</li>
            <li>I tried it out first and would apply it 3 to 6 times a day.  </li>
            <li>I ran out to hot topic and grabbed two bottles of this (they had a buy</li>
            <li>I was using at first.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I could immediately feel the hotness and swelling start to fade.</li>
            <li>I got it about 4 days ago and the second day i used it, my piercing already looked and felt a lot better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I put on the new piercing I continued to wash the piercing in the mornings with the special soap for piercings and applied the H2Ocean 3-6 times a day and in about two days the bump was gone and the redness was gone.</li>
            <li>If your infection is really advanced (please never let it get to that point), H2O Ocean may not be able to clear it up all by itself - it&#x27;s a phenomenal cleaner, not an antibiotic.aling and loosened normal discharge (the clear, pale yellow kind) that had solidified unlike the cheaper cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty certain that I&#x27;d disfigured my face for life.  </li>
            <li>If you are not sure whether or not this cleaner is helping to clear up your infection (or you are really uncertain if you even have an infection or not), do NOT remove the jewelry (it will close up and seal in the infection, winning you a possible stay in the hospital with an IV drip) and consult an experienced piercer and a physician immediately.  </li>
            <li>If you are not sure whether or not this cleaner is helping to clear up your infection (or you are really uncertain if you even have an infection or not), do NOT remove the jewelry (it will close up and seal in the infection, winning you a possible stay in the hospital with an IV drip) and consult an experienced piercer and a physician immediately.  </li>
            <li>And since the industrial piercing is in a strange, hard to wash with soap and water place, H2Ocean worked out perfectly!</li>
            <li>Omg, right after the three times a day cleanings I wanted to scrub concrete on them to make the itching stop.</li>
            <li>The shipping for this product was just as much as it&#x27;s cost...</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how much of an impact it played on the healing process.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to this stuff</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how much it is healing my earlobes</li>
            <li>But this is much easier than salt soaks.</li>
            <li>It showed actual signs of good healing and loosened normal discharge (the clear, pale yellow kind) that had solidified unlike the cheaper cleaner.  </li>
            <li>This works better than the Dial liquid Soap or other stuff</li>
            <li>I use it on my brand new piercing and it really keeps it from getting infected.</li>
            <li>Never clean more than directed -</li>
            <li>Never clean more than directed -</li>
            <li>and after a few uses my ear felt so much better.</li>
            <li>Seeing all the good reviews I was still pretty skeptical.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to shower twice a day (which is the recommended cleaning for my new piercing)</li>
            <li>recommend H20 Ocean Sea Salt Spray to anyone with a new piercing or is getting one soon.</li>
            <li>Brand New.</li>
            <li>One ear was okay, but the other ear was not (it ended up being because the piercer did not give enough room between the backing of the earring and my ear for normal swelling).  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Works awesome, I used it for my industrial and my snake bytes, I my one problem is that it&#x27;s expensive and it doaent last long....</li>
            <li>Its really gentle but helps keep the piercing dry (b/c excess moisture in piercings hold infection) and stops the pain and makes it heal sooo much faster.</li>
            <li>After my nose piercing developed the \\&quot;dreaded bump\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what every professional piercing person</li>
            <li>and I feel like its practically completely healed already</li>
            <li>After spraying it four times a day, the redness and irritation went away completely.</li>
            <li>When first pierced and when the \\&quot;crusties\\&quot; came back, I used the product 4-6 times a day, spraying directly on the piercing and moving the piercing back and forth.  </li>
            <li>I noticed tremendous improvements with \\&quot;crustring\\&quot;, inflamation, soreness, and slight itching within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>first, I sprayed it directly on a cotton ball and placed a cotton ball in my nostril to soak into the tissue inside my nose; second, I used another cotton ball to soak the outside of the piercing; third, I \\&quot;free sprayed\\&quot; H2Ocean onto my piercing several times a day to keep my piercing from feeling tight or itchy.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone who is nursing a new piercing, or who needs to maintain a current piercing.</li>
            <li>I wish i knew about this with my other piercing but the good news is that its still not to late!</li>
            <li>I was a tad skeptical about this stuff when I bought it, but it is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got new piercings, especially surface piercings, which take a long time to heal, I  would definitely recommend this!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. If they sold it by the drum, I&#x27;d probably buy it.  After I got my piercings I used this along with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Hemp Tea Tree Oil soap (great stuff as well) and I healed very nicely and never had any problems with redness or infection.  I&#x27;ve had my piercings for over two years and recently started getting lymph secretions and \\&quot;crusties\\&quot; again, so I bought some more H2Ocean and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap and they took care of the problem.  When first pierced and when the \\&quot;crusties\\&quot; came back, I used the product 4-6 times a day, spraying directly on the piercing and moving the piercing back and forth.  After the secretions stopped, I continued to just spray once in the morning and once at night. This product, along with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap (instead of regular body soap that can sometimes irritate piercings) create an excellent aftercare regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the seller 2 stars not because the product isn&#x27;t great but because of the seller&#x27;s $8 shipping charge.  The shipping for this product was just as much as it&#x27;s cost...this is ridiculous and a rip off.</li>
            <li> From the perspective of a very experienced piercee: My only experience with this product has been on my piercings.  Years ago when my best friend and I got our navels pierced, this was the product that the tattoo parlor sold to clean our new piercings.  Neither of us had ever used it before so we were not sure what to expect.  I cannot tell you how much of an impact it played on the healing process.  Our navels were healed months earlier than the estimated healing time period (8 months - 1 year I was told when I got it done) and we have never had a problem with our navels whatsoever.  It is so sanitary because it is in a concealed can and very easy to use.  We had friends with navel piercings whose navels were red and sore for weeks, but the soreness and redness for us diminished within seven to ten days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my cartilage done on both sides of my upper ears, the place (a different one) did not have H2Ocean and I thus used a different cleanser that I had used once before with minimal problems.  One ear was okay, but the other ear was not (it ended up being because the piercer did not give enough room between the backing of the earring and my ear for normal swelling).  Days after being pierced, it was hot to the touch, extremely swollen, abnormally painful, I had a low grade fever, and the next step was for my ear to secrete infected discharge.  It was the weekend so I planned on going to the doctor that Monday, but in the meantime ran out and purchased H2Ocean after remembering my great experience with my navel hoping it would make things a little better.  It did more than that.  After one application, it immediately cooled my bad ear and by the end of the day the ear was less red, was cool to the touch, and the swelling went down almost completely.  Twenty-four hours later, there was absolutely no swelling, pain, or redness and it looked like my other non-problematic ear.  However, I even noticed a difference in that one!  It showed actual signs of good healing and loosened normal discharge (the clear, pale yellow kind) that had solidified unlike the cheaper cleaner.  Best of all with this experience with my cartilage, I did not need to go to my doctor after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: While I highly recommend this product due to its ability to heal piercings successfully, prevent/rid infections and keloids, and believe that it is the best cleaner for piercings on the market, there are couple of things people need to remember about piercings.  Never clean more than directed - your body needs to take part in the healing process as well.  Sometimes no matter which cleaner you use whether it be H2Ocean or something else, sometimes your body is more prone to reject piercings more than others, especially if you have a compromised immune system.  Also, sometimes your body rejects the piercings no matter what you use due to sensitivity/allergy to the type of metal used in your piercing.  If you are not sure whether or not this cleaner is helping to clear up your infection (or you are really uncertain if you even have an infection or not), do NOT remove the jewelry (it will close up and seal in the infection, winning you a possible stay in the hospital with an IV drip) and consult an experienced piercer and a physician immediately.  If your infection is really advanced (please never let it get to that point), H2O Ocean may not be able to clear it up all by itself - it&#x27;s a phenomenal cleaner, not an antibiotic.aling and loosened normal discharge (the clear, pale yellow kind) that had solidified unlike the cheaper cleaner.

            <li> After my nose piercing developed the \\&quot;dreaded bump\\&quot; I was pretty certain that I&#x27;d disfigured my face for life.  A friend recommended H2Ocean and I can only try to express how incredibly relieved I am that this is a product that actually does what it says it will do.  After about a month of using it two or three times a day, I am bump free and can finally enjoy my beautiful nose piercing!</li>
            <li> About a month ago I got the monroe piercing and since then it has always been red around the outside.  I could never find a product that would help with this.  Until one day, surfing the web I came acrossed this product and let me tell you.....this product helped perfectly.  After just using H2Ocean 3 time today (just got it today)the redness has almost gone away.  I wish they would sell huge cans of this stuff or like refillable cans because I would buy it immediately!  I also bought the mouthwash (taste is not too bad) but works wonders with the spray.  Together they make a great \\&quot;team\\&quot;! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great. I got my hips pierced a month ago and I was doing the sea salt soaks at first, but quickly found I didn&#x27;t have the time. Now I just spray this instead, it&#x27;s not only way more convenient and portable, but it made the piercings heal faster then when I was doing the soaks. If you&#x27;ve got new piercings, especially surface piercings, which take a long time to heal, I  would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I recently got a second ear piercing on the lope that I&#x27;ve always wanted. The one ear is healing fine, but the other hurt badly. I cleaned that ear just as instructed but the swelling, redness and Pain kept getting worse. I went back to the piecer and they suggested this product to try. My ear instantly felt better! After days of not sleeping at night because of the pain, I slept through the night with no issues. The swelling was down by morning and the redness has almost gone. I only wish I knew about this when I got my other piercings, Belly button, Cartilage, and tongue..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only tip / Issue: Don&#x27;t tilt the can it will Leak. I made that mistake and it spilled in my purse a bit. Other than that WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> Works awesome, I used it for my industrial and my snake bytes, I my one problem is that it&#x27;s expensive and it doaent last long.... But works great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my recent nose piercing.  It worked WONDERS.  It helped soften up tough \\&quot;crust\\&quot; that had formed around my piercing, and helped alleviate swelling.  I used it three ways:  first, I sprayed it directly on a cotton ball and placed a cotton ball in my nostril to soak into the tissue inside my nose; second, I used another cotton ball to soak the outside of the piercing; third, I \\&quot;free sprayed\\&quot; H2Ocean onto my piercing several times a day to keep my piercing from feeling tight or itchy.  I noticed tremendous improvements with \\&quot;crustring\\&quot;, inflamation, soreness, and slight itching within 24 hours.  I would recommend this product to everyone who is nursing a new piercing, or who needs to maintain a current piercing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of swelling issues since getting my nose pierced in February. I got this spray b/c it&#x27;s more convenient than doing sea salt soaks several times a day. It helps remove the lymph (any crusty matter surrounding piercing during healing), and it has helped w/ the swelling and irritation. I had a piercing \\&quot;bump\\&quot; before I started using this, but I don&#x27;t now. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like the title says, this is a great product. A friend reccomended it to me after I got my industrial ear piercing done and after a few uses my ear felt so much better. Sleeping on it was akward and painful at first but after using this, a lot of the tenderness went away. And since the industrial piercing is in a strange, hard to wash with soap and water place, H2Ocean worked out perfectly!</li>
            <li> My piercing kept getting infected and I finally found out about this product.  I read the reviews and decided to take a gamble and buy the product.  I tried it out first and would apply it 3 to 6 times a day.  I would use a cotton ball, spray the H2Ocean on it and put it on the piercing.  I didn&#x27;t see immediate improvement like other people did but in a couple of days the redness started to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that horrible bump didn&#x27;t seem to want to leave and stayed there.  Finally, I decided to take off the nose piercing that I got when I pierced my nose and instead put on a smaller gauge nose piercing that was 14K gold.  Even though piercers say not to take off the nose piercing until after it has healed, which can be up to a year, I decided that it was best for me because the original piercing was too large and it just didn&#x27;t want to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I put on the new piercing I continued to wash the piercing in the mornings with the special soap for piercings and applied the H2Ocean 3-6 times a day and in about two days the bump was gone and the redness was gone. So, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the H2Ocean that did the job or just changing the piercing, that is why I gave it a 4 star but I still continue to wash the piercing every morning and spray the H2Ocean on in the morning and at night and there has been no redness or bumps since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product and I don&#x27;t have time to soak in salt water so I have not done that and this product has helped to keep my piercing clean and not infected.  I&#x27;m so happy with this product!</li>
            <li> So I had my nipples pierced for a year and a half, and they never healed. I took them out, heartbroken that no matter what I did they were still irritated, leaky, crusty and sore. I decided to give it another go, and when I did the piercer told me to use antibacterial soak to clean, and h2ocean to spray after wards. I had never heard of it before, so I went online to check it out. Seeing all the good reviews I was still pretty skeptical. Not anymore. After four days of using just the antibacterial soak I was still sore and SUPER itchy. Omg, right after the three times a day cleanings I wanted to scrub concrete on them to make the itching stop. I ran out to hot topic and grabbed two bottles of this (they had a buy one get one half off sale going) and I soaked some paper towels, put them in my bra with wax paper on the outside to keep my bra dry and took a nap. When I woke up, I was so bloody shocked. The redness was gone, there were hardly any crusties, and when I cleaned just using the spray and a paper towel, the itching was VERY minimal. Over the past few days (I got them pierced on the 2nd of october) I have been using the spray only, no soap, nothing. My piercings don&#x27;t itch at ALL, there is very little crust, no keloids, NO soreness (I actually woke up sleeping on my stomach this morning), no redness...nothing. This is magic in a bottle. I will never get a piercing again without having this stuff on hand. Get it, I swear you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I don&#x27;t have time to shower twice a day (which is the recommended cleaning for my new piercing) so I bought this product to clean my ears inbetween cleanings.  I believe it helped dry up the oozing and heal my piercing faster than if I had done without.  It&#x27;s like a salt soak without the waiting and mess.  Just spray and go.  The container is even small enough you could put it in a purse or bag and take it with you just about anywhere.  I love it and will definatly be ordering more and using with all my piercings!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002B0R0U H2Ocean 4 FL OZ Purified Ocean Salt Water Piercing Aftercare Spray]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for the after care of a piercing.  It will keep it from getting infected.  After using it from a piercing, I had no problems with the piercing-no infections, no redness nor swelling.  It&#x27;s what every professional piercing person recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched out a ring, one I had worn several times, and it got infected.  Once again, I bought another bottle (my 2nd one) because I knew this product would heal it.  Of course, it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is great. I got my eyebrow pierced for the second time and its only been a week and I feel like its practically completely healed already (that may be a stretch but I bet in a month I&#x27;ll be good to go.) My last piercing caused me alot of problems  whereas I have had none whatsoever this time. Im so happy I spent the 10 bucks. I use it about every 3 hours like the directions say. I have some bruising but thats all- no redness, no infections, no pain, and its easy to get those little crusties off it without irritating your piercing. Thanks to this stuff my eyebrow is one happy camper. Its the only thing I&#x27;ve used on my eyebrow. Its really gentle but helps keep the piercing dry (b/c excess moisture in piercings hold infection) and stops the pain and makes it heal sooo much faster. I bought it at the place where I got pierced for $10. Alot of places in my area carry it so that&#x27;s what I recommend- if you can find it in a shop buy it and skip the shipping costs and the wait. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who gets a piercing. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This works better than the Dial liquid Soap or other stuff I was using at first.  It really calms down the itches, and after a few days of using this, my ears are not tender anymore and I can&#x27;t believe how much it is healing my earlobes already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend H20 Ocean Sea Salt Spray to anyone with a new piercing or is getting one soon.</li>
            <li> Two years ago I got an industrial piercing and my piercer recommended I use H2Ocean on it. The first time I used it I could immediately feel the hotness and swelling start to fade. I used it twice a day for a while then switched to once a day. My industrial is now fully healed and I had no problems with it - no infection, bumps, anything. I just had my nose pierced yesterday and am buying some more H2Ocean to use on it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for any piercing! But like others have said, please remember not to over clean your new piercing as you can irritate it and cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be safe and enjoy your new adornment!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in about 2 days. Brand New. Looked in great conditions. Glad to have ordered with them.</li>
            <li> This spray works on everything! I used this a couple of years ago for my nose piercing, but soon realized it worked on pimples and those irritating gum sores I got after eating hard cereal. I recently re-pierced my cartilage piercing and it became infected so I ordered some more H2Ocean. After spraying it four times a day, the redness and irritation went away completely. For me, it seemed like it reduced the heeling time of my piercings. Just spray it on and walk away, it&#x27;s that simple. No soaking involved.</li>
            <li> I was a tad skeptical about this stuff when I bought it, but it is truly amazing. I would suggest using it AT LEAST 5 times a day if you&#x27;re freshly pierced. But this is much easier than salt soaks.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it on my brand new piercing and it really keeps it from getting infected. I wish i knew about this with my other piercing but the good news is that its still not to late!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I got it about 4 days ago and the second day i used it, my piercing already looked and felt a lot better. I got my belly button pierced over 6 months ago and it wasn&#x27;t healing well at all. It keeps getting infected even though I followed the basic cleansing instructions. I decided to try this and WOW! It&#x27;s incredible how quickly it works. The first time I used it my piercing felt so clean and fresh. I will definitely continue using this product and I bet my piercing will heal even faster than it was supposed to!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend that got her belly button pierced and her piercing was already infected so when she started putting this spray on, it cleared up. it works!</li>
