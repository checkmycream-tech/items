            <li>I received a nice bio-ethanol tabletop fireplace as a gift but the instructions had me concerned about placing it on any of the tables in my living room.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not distracting and it&#x27;s quite nice looking for a station mat.</li>
            <li>Variety would be nice.</li>
            <li>It is a nice sturdy mat though</li>
            <li>Perfect size mat (size of a sheet of paper) and does the job keeping hot curling irons safe from wood surfaces.</li>
            <li>Otherwise for normal curling rods it works perfect.</li>
            <li>i love it holds two curling irons with plenty of room and looks nice on the vanity.</li>
            <li>Works great for your hot items.</li>
            <li>Anyway these mats are great for setting hot pots and pans on.</li>
            <li>Work great for my wife using curlers and hot iron.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to keep those hot tools off the counter.  </li>
            <li>which is very cheap compared to the Colortrak Mat.</li>
            <li>The large size is also great because I use another one to place under my chopping mat to protect the countertop too.  </li>

            <li>I have bought them for a number of friends and family who love it as well.</li>

            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>but they are ok for that purpose...</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t worry about burning my counter top.</li>
            <li>It fits underneath my coffeepot perfectly and protects the granite counter top from the constant heat.</li>
            <li>heat transfers through more than I was anticipating.</li>
            <li>I always try to triple check to make sure that I have unplugged the tools when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>More often than not, it would slip and fall to the floor.  </li>
            <li>Saved me many ones from having a house fire</li>
            <li>so I keep it :)</li>
            <li>Even my vanity was safe from any damage.</li>
            <li>so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>

            <li>and no fires to report as of yet... :)</li>
            <li>My desk that I lay this on feels as if it was on fire when I placed my straightener on top of it, just for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Should have purchased more.  </li>
            <li>I just love this.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Sure, the dresser surface was warm, but like \\&quot;a hot cup of tea just sat here\\&quot; warm and</li>
            <li>this is perfect for the flat iron because it keeps it in place and protects the table.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for flat iron, but works great under laptop to protect furniture, as well!</li>
            <li>Its a Good quality and takes away the worry of burning or damaging your surfaces with your hot tools.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, is easy to clean, etc but does not do what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li>This mat is a great size as you can fit more than one heated appliance on it and it can handle high heat.  </li>
            <li>besides it is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So far worked out great.</li>
            <li>I love how it protects my bathroom counter from all of my hot irons and looks nice and neat.  </li>
            <li>That written, this mat came as expected, undamaged and works perfectly for task.</li>
            <li>The price is good and is reasonable with the shipping date.</li>
            <li>it rolls up easily for packing on trips.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;ll collect dust easily.</li>
            <li>you can easily roll it up and store it away.</li>
            <li>It also makes a nice cushioned place to rest a hot hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I recommend and not bad for the price either :-)</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for setting my curling iron down on my sink and not worrying about burn marks.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect protector to put down so that you can use your irons and straighteners anytime and anywhere.</li>
            <li>I use it with 2 heating devices (curling iron and straightner), and both fit on it fine with no issues.  </li>
            <li>The mat is not bulky and can fit in a travel case plus protect any surface.</li>
            <li>The plastic table is well protected, and I&#x27;ve got a secure place to put the heat gun.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t had damage to the mat or counter, and it is an easy clean surface.</li>
            <li>It is so light &amp; convenient.  </li>
            <li>Nice large size, feel  safe placing hot irons on it.</li>
            <li>seems to work so far and has a pleasant texture to it - nice and soft finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can relax and not worry about getting burn marks on my new counter tops!!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and no damage to them or our table after 3 months of use with very hot pans put on them.  </li>
            <li>This mat is great product, I am not a professional</li>
            <li>Rinses clean and I take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li>Like, I feel the need to clean it every time I see it.</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;ll use it to help keep my counter clean while applying makeup instead.</li>
            <li>Also great for larger hot pans in the kitchen.</li>
            <li>Great for saving my counter top from the hair tools that heat up well past 400°.</li>
            <li>but overall it was a good buy</li>
            <li>It keeps it cool.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just a piece of silicone, but it works better than anything she was using before.</li>
            <li>She really appreciate it since she wouldn&#x27;t want to ruin the glass top.</li>
            <li>I have a really cheap, crappy, laminate vanity in my condo right now.</li>
            <li>It gives the top enough grip to hold everything on top without allowing it to slide off.</li>
            <li>This mat works well for Chi irons, curling irons, and anything that might get very hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>Function is okay once dirty good luck getting in to look good again</li>
            <li>great item for laying down press, curlers</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have one, so now I&#x27;m happy I don&#x27;t have to be concerned of burning other surfaces like a towel or the carpet!</li>
            <li>The wood of the vanity underneath doesn&#x27;t get hot, and sometimes I heat my iron up to 450 degrees!  </li>
            <li>This mat is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>this hot mat is totally cool.</li>
            <li>Success.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is it is like a magnet for dust, makeup/powder, any kind of gel, etc..</li>
            <li>Could probably fit a 3rd on it if needed without devices touching.</li>
            <li>Good for heat and slipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at protecting surfaces where you lay your hot hair tools down at.</li>
            <li>To be honest I didn&#x27;t use it with my 450F flat iron yet.</li>
            <li>These lay nIce and flat on our kitchen table rather than using trivets.  </li>
            <li>Works great and the black color looks soooo much better than my old clear one!</li>
            <li>Does exactly  what it stated.</li>
            <li>You can also use it for pots and pans that are to hot to just lay them on your table, these mats work like a charm :) wish they came in different colors and prints!</li>
            <li>Although I do have a waver and it gets pretty hot and made the silicon mat get way too hot in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I didnt realize these were for hot hair appliances like straighteners and curling irons...</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>I use this in my sewing room to set my glue gun on to prevent hot glue spills on my table.</li>
            <li>My fiancées really hot hair stick and really hot</li>
            <li>I wish I would have found this before I made several burn marks/dents in my dresser top....</li>
            <li>We use the heat resistant station mat for a hot pad on the countertop in our RV.  </li>
            <li>I use these in the kitchen to set hot things on and protect my counter tops.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get ready without it!  </li>
            <li>Fits 2 hot irons at once.</li>
            <li>This mat is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about the girls hot irons on my counter tops</li>
            <li>I drop hot solder on it all the time and it does its job</li>
            <li>it stays exactly where it belongs.</li>
            <li>But even with this mat it is still hot.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone who uses hot appliances for styling their hair.</li>
            <li>Works wonders when handling hot irons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Overall I love this mat and would recommend it if you are looking for something to protect surfaces from hot irons.</li>
            <li>Protects the furniture from the hot curling irons and straighteners.</li>
            <li>I use an iron trivet to place under my straightening iron and blow dryer, but this can be used for those too (even better than my iron trivet because this one is double the size)</li>
            <li>We use it on the counter and table to put hot pans or serving dish.</li>
            <li>It keeps my granite countertop from getting hot from my flatiron.  </li>
            <li>This mat does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have measured the dimensions first.</li>
            <li>very helpful and the right color</li>
            <li>I am using it for a large hot pad for pots and pans and also a hot plate at my table.  </li>
            <li>I have a heat protective carrying case that unzips to lie flat that I placed under my mat just to be safe.</li>
            <li>This being black seems to show a bit of lint, but other than that it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I keep my straightener on the top of the toilet tank.  </li>
            <li>who ever invented this hot mat is a pure genius.</li>
            <li>The mat is plenty big, so even if you have more than one hot iron they will fit on at the same time.  </li>
            <li>neither the mat or my table had any marks even though my iron was pretty much fried.</li>
            <li>Good value and will probably last longer than the flat iron!</li>
            <li>Large enough to fit all three of my heat styling tools.</li>
            <li>Fits neatly next to my bathroom sink and holds my chi iron and two curling wants comfortably.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how anybody manages without these if they have straight irons.</li>
            <li>brush curling iron and straight one.</li>
            <li>I can put my Iron and Instyller at the same time, they both fit on this mat.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is since the mat is that rubbery, grippy surface, it easily attracts dust and hair to it, but you only need to rinse it with water and its clean again.</li>
            <li>so it works very well on my end table.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my vanity table.</li>
            <li>I really dont even notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, but would not adhere to the dashboard in my car</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very heat resistant.</li>
            <li>smaller than expected but good.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the large size.</li>
            <li>Other thenthat I like it:)</li>
            <li>I love this mat, I can just lay my hot tools down and not have to worry about scorching my table!</li>
            <li>Very useful to hold your flat irons</li>
            <li>I received a Nume curling wand set for Christmas, and this makes it SO much easier to put the iron down and grab sections of my hair better, without having to worry about burning the tops of my furniture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a great job for that purpose, I&#x27;ve picked it up and felt the bottom of it while the iron is on it, and while it is not cool by any means, it is not too hot to touch and certainly not near hot enough to cause any damage.</li>
            <li>But, protecting my vanity and not starting a fire are more important than a little dirt</li>
            <li>not \\&quot;I left my straighter on full blast for twenty-four</li>
            <li>It is hot on the bottom of the mat when I lift it up but its not damaging my vanity and I feel comfortable leaving my hair tools on this when they are cooling down.</li>
            <li>Installed a new marble bathroom counter top and would be too worried placing my curling irons down without it.</li>
            <li>I use high heat (350-400 degree) tools.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Serves as a mat for my flat iron or curling iron and actually keeps them put while on top of a slippery counter.</li>
            <li>I do like it, but I wish I was a little more flexible.</li>
            <li>They have worked very well and held up well (6 months so far)</li>
            <li>I got this because I noticed that my counter was getting very hot when the flat iron was on.</li>
            <li>different colors would be fun.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday, I have a vintage dresser at home, I lay it on to protect the top of the dresser.</li>
            <li>Unlike the other mats I&#x27;ve seen, it isn&#x27;t huge</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it was a little bigger</li>
            <li>I absolutely live this product.</li>
            <li>Using it for a heat guard on our new granite counter tops in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li>Plus I still have an apartment to live in.</li>
            <li>Simply place your hot curling iron(s) or heated hair products and this mat and walk away.  </li>
            <li>I keep it on my vanity to protect the wood from my flat-iron, and it&#x27;s definitely a must-have for protecting your surfaces from hot tools.</li>
            <li>so far it has solved the problem!</li>
            <li>they use that is hot and would otherwise burn something if they simply left it out.</li>
            <li>And sure enough just like some other reviewers claimed, the heat transferred all the way through the mat.</li>
            <li>Though the bottom of the mat doesn&#x27;t feel quite as hot to the touch as my flat iron itself, it feels hot enough that I would be concerned to cause damage to my counters over time.</li>
            <li>The underside of the mat is never more than mildly warm and the dresser is unharmed, the mat is non sliding and won&#x27;t move around on the dresser short of you picking it up and moving it.  </li>
            <li>Keeps hot products flat and spill-proof.  </li>
            <li>The heat resistance mat is strong and big enough for my curling iron and my flat iron.</li>
            <li>So Far, it  has done</li>
            <li>So far theres no burn marks or anything on the countertops.</li>
            <li>It also protects the surface from heat damage and looks professional.</li>
            <li>Use it frequently for a couple months now and no problems.</li>
            <li>I left my straightener on for 6 hours and thanks to this heat mat.</li>
            <li>I ordered the mat for my 14 year old daughter&#x27;s dressing when she is using her flat-iron.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I accidentally left my iron on for a whole day and</li>
            <li>This mat provides convenience by allowing my appliances to cool down without damaging my table before storing them away.</li>
            <li>Can probably only fit maybe  two tools (a flat iron and curling on) on it lengthwise at the same time, but for 8 bucks you can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I can fit up to 3 curling irons (various sizes) and one flat iron on it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>We recently purchased a new countertop for our bathroom, and as my husband was taking out the old one, he pointed out to me a bunch of burn marks in it from my straightening iron &amp; then banned me from ever setting it on our new</li>
            <li>Two years later and still looks like new!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Large enough for multiple irons.  </li>
            <li>This particular one is made of a thicker silicone and protects against the highest heat settings on a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Burnt my new vanity table same day I received it because this product does not work.  </li>
            <li>It just seems to attract dust and lint or something in the air and no matter if I clean it every day with a damp cloth, it gets dirty again very quickly.</li>
            <li>Every female needs at least one or more of these.  </li>
            <li>I chose the red ones and the price jumped up a few dollars more, so i went back and got the black ones.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday to set my straightener on to protect any surfaces from damage and it works very well!</li>
            <li>This gadget will protect your surface from discolorations due to high heat from curling rods/irons.</li>

            <li> I received a nice bio-ethanol tabletop fireplace as a gift but the instructions had me concerned about placing it on any of the tables in my living room.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not distracting and it&#x27;s quite nice looking for a station mat.</li>
            <li> Variety would be nice.</li>
            <li> It is a nice sturdy mat though</li>
            <li> Perfect size mat (size of a sheet of paper) and does the job keeping hot curling irons safe from wood surfaces.</li>
            <li> Otherwise for normal curling rods it works perfect.</li>
            <li> i love it holds two curling irons with plenty of room and looks nice on the vanity.</li>
            <li> Works great for your hot items.</li>
            <li> Anyway these mats are great for setting hot pots and pans on.</li>
            <li> Work great for my wife using curlers and hot iron.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep those hot tools off the counter.  </li>
            <li> which is very cheap compared to the Colortrak Mat.</li>
            <li> The large size is also great because I use another one to place under my chopping mat to protect the countertop too.  </li>
            <li> Love this mat</li>
            <li> I have bought them for a number of friends and family who love it as well.</li>

            <li> What more can I say?</li>

            <li> but they are ok for that purpose...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t worry about burning my counter top.</li>
            <li> It fits underneath my coffeepot perfectly and protects the granite counter top from the constant heat.</li>
            <li> heat transfers through more than I was anticipating.</li>
            <li> I always try to triple check to make sure that I have unplugged the tools when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> More often than not, it would slip and fall to the floor.  </li>
            <li> Saved me many ones from having a house fire</li>
            <li> so I keep it :)</li>
            <li> Even my vanity was safe from any damage.</li>
            <li> so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>

            <li> and no fires to report as of yet... :)</li>
            <li> My desk that I lay this on feels as if it was on fire when I placed my straightener on top of it, just for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Should have purchased more.  </li>
            <li> I just love this.  </li>
            <li> So glad to fnd this for my corling irons.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Sure, the dresser surface was warm, but like \\&quot;a hot cup of tea just sat here\\&quot; warm and</li>
            <li> this is perfect for the flat iron because it keeps it in place and protects the table.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for flat iron, but works great under laptop to protect furniture, as well!</li>
            <li> Its a Good quality and takes away the worry of burning or damaging your surfaces with your hot tools.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, is easy to clean, etc but does not do what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> This mat is a great size as you can fit more than one heated appliance on it and it can handle high heat.  </li>
            <li> besides it is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So far worked out great.</li>
            <li> I love how it protects my bathroom counter from all of my hot irons and looks nice and neat.  </li>
            <li> That written, this mat came as expected, undamaged and works perfectly for task.</li>
            <li> The price is good and is reasonable with the shipping date.</li>
            <li> it rolls up easily for packing on trips.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;ll collect dust easily.</li>
            <li> you can easily roll it up and store it away.</li>
            <li> It also makes a nice cushioned place to rest a hot hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I recommend and not bad for the price either :-)</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for setting my curling iron down on my sink and not worrying about burn marks.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect protector to put down so that you can use your irons and straighteners anytime and anywhere.</li>
            <li> I use it with 2 heating devices (curling iron and straightner), and both fit on it fine with no issues.  </li>
            <li> The mat is not bulky and can fit in a travel case plus protect any surface.</li>
            <li> The plastic table is well protected, and I&#x27;ve got a secure place to put the heat gun.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t had damage to the mat or counter, and it is an easy clean surface.</li>
            <li> It is so light &amp; convenient.  </li>
            <li> Nice large size, feel  safe placing hot irons on it.</li>
            <li> seems to work so far and has a pleasant texture to it - nice and soft finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can relax and not worry about getting burn marks on my new counter tops!!!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and no damage to them or our table after 3 months of use with very hot pans put on them.  </li>
            <li> This mat is great product, I am not a professional</li>
            <li> Rinses clean and I take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> Like, I feel the need to clean it every time I see it.</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;ll use it to help keep my counter clean while applying makeup instead.</li>
            <li> Also great for larger hot pans in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> Great for saving my counter top from the hair tools that heat up well past 400°.</li>
            <li> but overall it was a good buy</li>
            <li> It keeps it cool.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just a piece of silicone, but it works better than anything she was using before.</li>
            <li> She really appreciate it since she wouldn&#x27;t want to ruin the glass top.</li>
            <li> I have a really cheap, crappy, laminate vanity in my condo right now.</li>
            <li> It gives the top enough grip to hold everything on top without allowing it to slide off.</li>
            <li> This mat works well for Chi irons, curling irons, and anything that might get very hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> Function is okay once dirty good luck getting in to look good again</li>
            <li> great item for laying down press, curlers</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have one, so now I&#x27;m happy I don&#x27;t have to be concerned of burning other surfaces like a towel or the carpet!</li>
            <li> The wood of the vanity underneath doesn&#x27;t get hot, and sometimes I heat my iron up to 450 degrees!  </li>
            <li> This mat is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> this hot mat is totally cool.</li>
            <li> Success.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is it is like a magnet for dust, makeup/powder, any kind of gel, etc..</li>
            <li> Could probably fit a 3rd on it if needed without devices touching.</li>
            <li> Good for heat and slipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at protecting surfaces where you lay your hot hair tools down at.</li>
            <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t use it with my 450F flat iron yet.</li>
            <li> These lay nIce and flat on our kitchen table rather than using trivets.  </li>
            <li> Works great and the black color looks soooo much better than my old clear one!</li>
            <li> Does exactly  what it stated.</li>
            <li> You can also use it for pots and pans that are to hot to just lay them on your table, these mats work like a charm :) wish they came in different colors and prints!</li>
            <li> Although I do have a waver and it gets pretty hot and made the silicon mat get way too hot in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I didnt realize these were for hot hair appliances like straighteners and curling irons...</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I use this in my sewing room to set my glue gun on to prevent hot glue spills on my table.</li>
            <li> My fiancées really hot hair stick and really hot</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this before I made several burn marks/dents in my dresser top....</li>
            <li> We use the heat resistant station mat for a hot pad on the countertop in our RV.  </li>
            <li> I use these in the kitchen to set hot things on and protect my counter tops.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get ready without it!  </li>
            <li> Fits 2 hot irons at once.</li>
            <li> This mat is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about the girls hot irons on my counter tops</li>
            <li> I drop hot solder on it all the time and it does its job</li>
            <li> it stays exactly where it belongs.</li>
            <li> But even with this mat it is still hot.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone who uses hot appliances for styling their hair.</li>
            <li> Works wonders when handling hot irons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Overall I love this mat and would recommend it if you are looking for something to protect surfaces from hot irons.</li>
            <li> Protects the furniture from the hot curling irons and straighteners.</li>
            <li> I use an iron trivet to place under my straightening iron and blow dryer, but this can be used for those too (even better than my iron trivet because this one is double the size)</li>
            <li> We use it on the counter and table to put hot pans or serving dish.</li>
            <li> It keeps my granite countertop from getting hot from my flatiron.  </li>
            <li> This mat does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have measured the dimensions first.</li>
            <li> very helpful and the right color</li>
            <li> I am using it for a large hot pad for pots and pans and also a hot plate at my table.  </li>
            <li> I have a heat protective carrying case that unzips to lie flat that I placed under my mat just to be safe.</li>
            <li> This being black seems to show a bit of lint, but other than that it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I keep my straightener on the top of the toilet tank.  </li>
            <li> who ever invented this hot mat is a pure genius.</li>
            <li> The mat is plenty big, so even if you have more than one hot iron they will fit on at the same time.  </li>
            <li> neither the mat or my table had any marks even though my iron was pretty much fried.</li>
            <li> Good value and will probably last longer than the flat iron!</li>
            <li> Large enough to fit all three of my heat styling tools.</li>
            <li> Fits neatly next to my bathroom sink and holds my chi iron and two curling wants comfortably.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anybody manages without these if they have straight irons.</li>
            <li> brush curling iron and straight one.</li>
            <li> I can put my Iron and Instyller at the same time, they both fit on this mat.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is since the mat is that rubbery, grippy surface, it easily attracts dust and hair to it, but you only need to rinse it with water and its clean again.</li>
            <li> so it works very well on my end table.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my vanity table.</li>
            <li> I really dont even notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, but would not adhere to the dashboard in my car</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very heat resistant.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected but good.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the large size.</li>
            <li> Other thenthat I like it:)</li>
            <li> I love this mat, I can just lay my hot tools down and not have to worry about scorching my table!</li>
            <li> Very useful to hold your flat irons</li>
            <li> I received a Nume curling wand set for Christmas, and this makes it SO much easier to put the iron down and grab sections of my hair better, without having to worry about burning the tops of my furniture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a great job for that purpose, I&#x27;ve picked it up and felt the bottom of it while the iron is on it, and while it is not cool by any means, it is not too hot to touch and certainly not near hot enough to cause any damage.</li>
            <li> But, protecting my vanity and not starting a fire are more important than a little dirt</li>
            <li> not \\&quot;I left my straighter on full blast for twenty-four</li>
            <li> It is hot on the bottom of the mat when I lift it up but its not damaging my vanity and I feel comfortable leaving my hair tools on this when they are cooling down.</li>
            <li> Installed a new marble bathroom counter top and would be too worried placing my curling irons down without it.</li>
            <li> I use high heat (350-400 degree) tools.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Serves as a mat for my flat iron or curling iron and actually keeps them put while on top of a slippery counter.</li>
            <li> I do like it, but I wish I was a little more flexible.</li>
            <li> They have worked very well and held up well (6 months so far)</li>
            <li> I got this because I noticed that my counter was getting very hot when the flat iron was on.</li>
            <li> different colors would be fun.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday, I have a vintage dresser at home, I lay it on to protect the top of the dresser.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other mats I&#x27;ve seen, it isn&#x27;t huge</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it was a little bigger</li>
            <li> I absolutely live this product.</li>
            <li> Using it for a heat guard on our new granite counter tops in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li> Plus I still have an apartment to live in.</li>
            <li> Simply place your hot curling iron(s) or heated hair products and this mat and walk away.  </li>
            <li> I keep it on my vanity to protect the wood from my flat-iron, and it&#x27;s definitely a must-have for protecting your surfaces from hot tools.</li>
            <li> so far it has solved the problem!</li>
            <li> they use that is hot and would otherwise burn something if they simply left it out.</li>
            <li> And sure enough just like some other reviewers claimed, the heat transferred all the way through the mat.</li>
            <li> Though the bottom of the mat doesn&#x27;t feel quite as hot to the touch as my flat iron itself, it feels hot enough that I would be concerned to cause damage to my counters over time.</li>
            <li> The underside of the mat is never more than mildly warm and the dresser is unharmed, the mat is non sliding and won&#x27;t move around on the dresser short of you picking it up and moving it.  </li>
            <li> Keeps hot products flat and spill-proof.  </li>
            <li> The heat resistance mat is strong and big enough for my curling iron and my flat iron.</li>
            <li> So Far, it  has done</li>
            <li> So far theres no burn marks or anything on the countertops.</li>
            <li> It also protects the surface from heat damage and looks professional.</li>
            <li> Use it frequently for a couple months now and no problems.</li>
            <li> I left my straightener on for 6 hours and thanks to this heat mat.</li>
            <li> I ordered the mat for my 14 year old daughter&#x27;s dressing when she is using her flat-iron.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I accidentally left my iron on for a whole day and</li>
            <li> This mat provides convenience by allowing my appliances to cool down without damaging my table before storing them away.</li>
            <li> Can probably only fit maybe  two tools (a flat iron and curling on) on it lengthwise at the same time, but for 8 bucks you can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I can fit up to 3 curling irons (various sizes) and one flat iron on it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> We recently purchased a new countertop for our bathroom, and as my husband was taking out the old one, he pointed out to me a bunch of burn marks in it from my straightening iron &amp; then banned me from ever setting it on our new</li>
            <li> Two years later and still looks like new!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Large enough for multiple irons.  </li>
            <li> This particular one is made of a thicker silicone and protects against the highest heat settings on a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Burnt my new vanity table same day I received it because this product does not work.  </li>
            <li> It just seems to attract dust and lint or something in the air and no matter if I clean it every day with a damp cloth, it gets dirty again very quickly.</li>
            <li> Every female needs at least one or more of these.  </li>
            <li> I chose the red ones and the price jumped up a few dollars more, so i went back and got the black ones.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to set my straightener on to protect any surfaces from damage and it works very well!</li>
            <li> This gadget will protect your surface from discolorations due to high heat from curling rods/irons.</li>
            <li> It takes a pretty long time for this thing to take its shape to a flat surface even after laying heavy objects on it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I need for doing heat set paints with a heat gun for &#x27;newborning&#x27; dolls (painting blank vinyl kits from scratch for very realistic collectible dolls).  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for her flat iron that she has repeadetly left on her desk and burnt, even after turning it off.</li>
            <li> Im a hair stylist and use my flat iron on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> but the shipping price is a little bit too high .</li>
            <li> We just remodeled our bathroom, and I have a flat iron, a waver,</li>
            <li> I went with this since its wider and I can use it for my curling iron, flat iron, clothing iron and</li>
            <li> Protects my bathroom vanity from scorch marks from my curling irons and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m using my curling wand and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Before with my flat iron or curling iron I would often get out a dinner plate to protect the surface but because it wasn&#x27;t completely flat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even long enough for the longer curling irons.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mat to use with my flat iron and curling wands.</li>
            <li> I think they should package it flat instead of folded into thirds.  </li>
            <li> Works well when using the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It  came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> so i dont know how it holds up long term</li>
            <li> I wanted to be extra careful and protect my quartz countertop.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe with this is that it gets dirty very quickly.</li>
            <li> How did I every live with out having this in my past.  </li>
            <li> Inspired other stylists to do the same.</li>
            <li> I do wish these heat mats were a little bit larger and smaller.</li>
            <li> i have not had it very long</li>
            <li> One wanted it curled and the other wanted it flat ironed.  </li>
            <li> The black ones were cheaper than the red ones</li>
            <li> but it could be a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> It works and the only downside is that every little spec of dust just gravitates towards this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did this heat-resistant mat keep my apartment from burning down, it prevented a burn mark on the dresser underneath!</li>
            <li> I am hoping that airing it out for a few days and perhaps a run through the dishwasher will make the smell go away, otherwise I am going to have to send it back.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> but it is expected with the material and</li>
            <li> It is still not laying perfectly flat after a month of use, although this is not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> Flimsy, thin, doesn&#x27;t protect from high heat.</li>
            <li> i am going to order another one for the other bath.</li>
            <li> I only a a small mat from my Instyler</li>
            <li> Also the texture of the mat and the slightly raised areas kept the curling iron and the flat iron firmly in place, neither of them slid or shifted.  </li>
            <li> No more sliding flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Maybe its helped a little bit, but not nearly as much as what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> After I unplug them I leave them on the mat and don&#x27;t give a thought to the house burning down.  </li>
            <li> I also use it to lay my blow dryer on while it cools down.</li>
            <li> My house didn&#x27;t burn down.</li>
            <li> It arrived in less time than they said it would.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s preotected from a few spill also.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s little on small side</li>
            <li> No more burn marks on the counter.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I do like this mat though I&#x27;m not sure that it does its intended purpose as well as one would hope.</li>
            <li> it can get a little bit dirty when left on a dresser.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to keepclean.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive than SB supply store.</li>
            <li> mat feels thin, but it does its job without melting or scorching.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tired of making burn marks on the furniture and counters.</li>
            <li> I was really afraid of burning it and making it worse.</li>
            <li> I work in a building built in 1886 and the brick is very dusty.</li>
            <li> worthless</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Function is okay once dirty good luck getting in to look good again</li>
            <li> great item for laying down press, curlers</li>
            <li> Works great for your hot items.</li>
            <li> I like this mat but it is hard to keepclean.  The dust clings to it.  Of course all you have to do is wash it so I shouldnt complain.  I work in a building built in 1886 and the brick is very dusty.</li>
            <li> Does exactly  what it stated. No more burn marks on the counter. Good price, good item. Would buy again. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Very nice and helpful. Inspired other stylists to do the same.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anybody manages without these if they have straight irons.</li>
            <li> Works great but it could be a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Love this mat I use it all the time</li>
            <li> I kept one in the bathroom so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about any scarring on the vanity.  This particular one is made of a thicker silicone and protects against the highest heat settings on a flat iron.  It also makes a nice cushioned place to rest a hot hair dryer.  I particularly like the large size.</li>
            <li> It takes a pretty long time for this thing to take its shape to a flat surface even after laying heavy objects on it. I do like it, but I wish I was a little more flexible.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter - works great and protects surfaces</li>
            <li> I love this mat! We just remodeled our bathroom, and I have a flat iron, a waver, brush curling iron and straight one. I&#x27;m glad I can relax and not worry about getting burn marks on my new counter tops!!! Girls gotta have this mat! You can also use it for pots and pans that are to hot to just lay them on your table, these mats work like a charm :) wish they came in different colors and prints!</li>
            <li> I absolutely live this product. It&#x27;s great for protecting surfaces from my straightener and is easy to pack when traveling. I have bought them for a number of friends and family who love it as well.</li>
            <li> This is perfect. Great for home and travel.</li>
            <li> So far worked out great. Although I do have a waver and it gets pretty hot and made the silicon mat get way too hot in my opinion. Otherwise for normal curling rods it works perfect.</li>
            <li> Flimsy, thin, doesn&#x27;t protect from high heat. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Using it for a heat guard on our new granite counter tops in the kitchen.  It looks nice and works great!</li>
            <li> Bought for daughter to protect my granite tops. She uses it and I&#x27;ve seen no damage.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected but good.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for the flat iron because it keeps it in place and protects the table.  i totally recommended it and will buy it as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for her flat iron that she has repeadetly left on her desk and burnt, even after turning it off. This should help.</li>
            <li> I does the job of keeping me from messing up my counter top by burning it but the mat also collects a lot of dust but overall it was a good buy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;tread the d emissions before I ordered it, so wassmaller then I thought. Other thenthat I like it:)</li>
            <li> Works great! Two years later and still looks like new!</li>
            <li> This heat-resistant mat works well under my double crock, crockpot.  What more can I say? Thank you, it was a great deal!</li>
            <li> I can put my Iron and Instyller at the same time, they both fit on this mat.  I&#x27;m very happy with it. I didn&#x27;t have one, so now I&#x27;m happy I don&#x27;t have to be concerned of burning other surfaces like a towel or the carpet!</li>
            <li> So Far, it  has done it&#x27;s job well, I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Its a Good quality and takes away the worry of burning or damaging your surfaces with your hot tools.</li>
            <li> I didnt realize these were for hot hair appliances like straighteners and curling irons...but they are ok for that purpose...</li>
            <li> who ever invented this hot mat is a pure genius. this hot mat is totally cool. I bought this to put my curling iron on while it heats up</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I wanted it to. Serves as a mat for my flat iron or curling iron and actually keeps them put while on top of a slippery counter. Great at preventing damage to countertops and also acts as a grip to keep your styling tools in place. Can probably only fit maybe  two tools (a flat iron and curling on) on it lengthwise at the same time, but for 8 bucks you can&#x27;t complain. Only downside is since the mat is that rubbery, grippy surface, it easily attracts dust and hair to it, but you only need to rinse it with water and its clean again.</li>
            <li> We recently purchased a new countertop for our bathroom, and as my husband was taking out the old one, he pointed out to me a bunch of burn marks in it from my straightening iron &amp; then banned me from ever setting it on our new one.&lt;br /&gt;That wasn&#x27;t gonna happen, so I agreed to use this mat in between the iron and the countertop from now on.&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job for that purpose, I&#x27;ve picked it up and felt the bottom of it while the iron is on it, and while it is not cool by any means, it is not too hot to touch and certainly not near hot enough to cause any damage. I wrap my iron in it after use and wrap the cord around it for storage. Works out perfect!</li>
            <li> Perfect to keep my curling iron and straightener on as I style my hair.  After I unplug them I leave them on the mat and don&#x27;t give a thought to the house burning down.  I also like the textured bumps for extra friction.</li>
            <li> I have a really cheap, crappy, laminate vanity in my condo right now. I was really afraid of burning it and making it worse. This works great for protection - I use high heat (350-400 degree) tools. One day I even forgot to turn one off. Came home, nothing melted, nothing damaged.</li>
            <li> Awesome station mat! I use this in my sewing room to set my glue gun on to prevent hot glue spills on my table. Also great for larger hot pans in the kitchen. I plan on ordering another one.</li>
            <li> I love this silicone mat to place my iron curling on it. It&#x27;s quit ok fr me but the shipping price is a little bit too high .</li>
            <li> Omg I can&#x27;t believe I have survived without this! lol This have made my life easier! I don&#x27;t burn or damage any surfaces anymore! BRAVO!</li>
            <li> very helpful and the right color</li>
            <li> My fiancées really hot hair stick and really hot hair squeezer thing don&#x27;t burn the vanity with this mat.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for setting my curling iron down on my sink and not worrying about burn marks.</li>
            <li> Size is ok. Timing of arrival was good. Overall it is serving its purpose.</li>
            <li> Great product for lots of appliances.  How did I every live with out having this in my past.  Oh yes</li>
            <li> I decided to get this after  looking for an iron pad holder (the ones that are shaped like an iron).&lt;br /&gt; I went with this since its wider and I can use it for my curling iron, flat iron, clothing iron and it rolls up easily for packing on trips.</li>
            <li> This mat provides convenience by allowing my appliances to cool down without damaging my table before storing them away. However, I cover it with a cloth whenever it&#x27;s not in use or it&#x27;ll collect dust easily.</li>
            <li> The girlfriend was using a pot holder for her iron. How trashy! So I got this. It is still there as well as my counters and I now have my pot holder back. Success.</li>
            <li> works like the kitchen counter mat silverwave  saves burn on counter tops thank you</li>
            <li> This literally smells like vomit.  I am hoping that airing it out for a few days and perhaps a run through the dishwasher will make the smell go away, otherwise I am going to have to send it back.  It makes me gag.</li>
            <li> This is perfect to use for my curling iron so it does not burn my bathroom counter.  no complaints at all</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this before I made several burn marks/dents in my dresser top....LOL.  Like like like...</li>
            <li> We use the heat resistant station mat for a hot pad on the countertop in our RV.  Good size and works well for the purpose of the purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this to put my hair dryer and straightening iron on a shelf under my bathroom sink. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and has held up wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This mat is a great size as you can fit more than one heated appliance on it and it can handle high heat.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This mat was perfect.  I take it with me whenever I travel and dont worry about marking counter tops. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This product was perfect size for the top of my espresso machine.  I wanted it to place my tamper, portafilter, etc... on top of my Ascaso Uno Pid.  It gives the top enough grip to hold everything on top without allowing it to slide off. My only beef is that it has a &amp;#34;tar&amp;#34; type odor.  I washed it by hand and it reduced quite a bit.  I think in time it will lose all it&#x27;s smell...</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to set my straightener on to protect any surfaces from damage and it works very well! I would recommend everyone, who uses styling tools, to have something like this for safety!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect protector to put down so that you can use your irons and straighteners anytime and anywhere.</li>
            <li> I use these in the kitchen to set hot things on and protect my counter tops. They have worked very well and held up well (6 months so far)</li>
            <li> I love this mat, I can just lay my hot tools down and not have to worry about scorching my table!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mat.  It works great and protects the counter top and I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this simple piece of silicone. It saves my counter-tops from unneeded heat from styling products. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Do not understand why I didn&#x27;t purchase this product sooner!  I can&#x27;t get ready without it!  It protects the countertop perfectly!</li>
            <li> Got 2 of these for my wife and she is real pleased with them. The black ones were cheaper than the red ones and i don&#x27;t know why. I chose the red ones and the price jumped up a few dollars more, so i went back and got the black ones. Anyway these mats are great for setting hot pots and pans on. So far theres no burn marks or anything on the countertops.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!! Totally recommend this item! Fits 2 hot irons at once. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The heat resistance mat is strong and big enough for my curling iron and my flat iron. The mat is not bulky and can fit in a travel case plus protect any surface. Love IT!</li>
            <li> I received a nice bio-ethanol tabletop fireplace as a gift but the instructions had me concerned about placing it on any of the tables in my living room. This mat was the perfect option. Unlike the other mats I&#x27;ve seen, it isn&#x27;t huge so it works very well on my end table. It&#x27;s not distracting and it&#x27;s quite nice looking for a station mat. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I can lay all three of my curling irons on this and I don&#x27;t worry about burning my counter top. It keeps it cool.</li>
            <li> This mat is exactly what I was looking for.  It fits underneath my coffeepot perfectly and protects the granite counter top from the constant heat.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my vanity table. I also use it to lay my blow dryer on while it cools down.</li>
            <li> Works great. I don&#x27;t have to worry about the girls hot irons on my counter tops</li>
            <li> Work great for my wife using curlers and hot iron. Excellent heat resistant surface.</li>
            <li> Use every day to put my straightener and curler on my bathroom counter. Perfect!</li>
            <li> heat transfers through more than I was anticipating.</li>
            <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t use it with my 450F flat iron yet. It seems to be working well protecting the counter for now as I&#x27;m using 325 F. I will update later.</li>
            <li> I drop hot solder on it all the time and it does its job</li>
            <li> This is great because it keeps my irons from sliding off the counter onto the floor. It also protects the surface from heat damage and looks professional.</li>
            <li> Great product. Protects my bathroom vanity from scorch marks from my curling irons and flat iron. Large enough to fit all three of my heat styling tools. Looks good. Rinses clean and I take it with me when I travel. It just rolls up and fits in my carry on. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mat! It&#x27;s great at protecting surfaces where you lay your hot hair tools down at. I do my hair in my bedroom floor and this protects the floor great. I use tools that heat up to 450 degrees and never once have I felt like it was going to melt through the mat. I always try to triple check to make sure that I have unplugged the tools when I&#x27;m done but this is great for safety Incase I was to miss it (because let&#x27;s face it, almost all of us have done it once unfortunelty) (I wouldn&#x27;t recommend testing it out though if you can help it lol)</li>
            <li> Protects the top of the sink countertop perfectly!  It arrived in less time than they said it would.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I keep my straightener on the top of the toilet tank.  More often than not, it would slip and fall to the floor.  Not anymore!  With this station mat it stays exactly where it belongs.</li>
            <li> Keeps you from ruining anything you put your straighteners and curling irons on. you can easily roll it up and store it away.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter who tends to leave curling irons on.  Perfect size mat (size of a sheet of paper) and does the job keeping hot curling irons safe from wood surfaces.</li>
            <li> This mat is really great to have.  Simply place your hot curling iron(s) or heated hair products and this mat and walk away.  Your furniture will thank you.</li>
            <li> Saved me many ones from having a house fire</li>
            <li> Excellent as a safety shield for a vent cap from my boiler.</li>
            <li> Bought this for flat iron, but works great under laptop to protect furniture, as well!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I need for doing heat set paints with a heat gun for &#x27;newborning&#x27; dolls (painting blank vinyl kits from scratch for very realistic collectible dolls).  The plastic table is well protected, and I&#x27;ve got a secure place to put the heat gun.</li>
            <li> In a haze of sleep deprivation and stress, I left my straightener on MAXIMUM heat (over 400 degrees Fahrenheit) for twenty four hours. I was away from home or sleeping during this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did this heat-resistant mat keep my apartment from burning down, it prevented a burn mark on the dresser underneath! Sure, the dresser surface was warm, but like \\&quot;a hot cup of tea just sat here\\&quot; warm and not \\&quot;I left my straighter on full blast for twenty-four hours\\&quot; warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mat feels thin, but it does its job without melting or scorching. Plus I still have an apartment to live in. So that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep those hot tools off the counter.  Has good grip, so it doesn&#x27;t slide around.</li>
            <li> It works well and stays in place neatly.  No more sliding flat iron.  Good value and will probably last longer than the flat iron!</li>
            <li> For me personally giving this 3 stars is generous. Im a hair stylist and use my flat iron on a daily basis. I got this because I noticed that my counter was getting very hot when the flat iron was on. But even with this mat it is still hot. Maybe its helped a little bit, but not nearly as much as what I was expecting. I really dont even notice a difference. It looks nice, is easy to clean, etc but does not do what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, but would not adhere to the dashboard in my car</li>
            <li> Has not burn up yet.  Does&amp;#34;t like grease????&lt;br /&gt;I use it under my George Foreman Grill.</li>
            <li> These lay nIce and flat on our kitchen table rather than using trivets.  Keeps hot products flat and spill-proof.  I purchased 3 and use them daily.  Easy to clean and no damage to them or our table after 3 months of use with very hot pans put on them.  Highly recommended.  Wish they came in longer size (same width) and different colors would be fun.  Even my husband likes them!</li>
            <li> I bought this mat because I left a straightener on once and ended up with a massive burn mark on my dresser.  I figured I would avoid the hazard/damage in the future and the mat allows me to do that.&lt;br /&gt;It works well and protects surfaces without spreading out the heat.  Only drawback is it is like a magnet for dust, makeup/powder, any kind of gel, etc..it can get a little bit dirty when left on a dresser.</li>
            <li> I do like this a lot! I keep it on my vanity to protect the wood from my flat-iron, and it&#x27;s definitely a must-have for protecting your surfaces from hot tools. The wood of the vanity underneath doesn&#x27;t get hot, and sometimes I heat my iron up to 450 degrees!  My only gripe with this is that it gets dirty very quickly. It just seems to attract dust and lint or something in the air and no matter if I clean it every day with a damp cloth, it gets dirty again very quickly. Like, I feel the need to clean it every time I see it. But, protecting my vanity and not starting a fire are more important than a little dirt so I keep it :)</li>
            <li> Bought it at same time and vanity table.  My iron gets 400 degrees, it has a thermostat.  Burnt my new vanity table same day I received it because this product does not work.  Beyond aggravated.</li>
            <li> I set a 430 degree curling iron on mine. Hasn&#x27;t had damage to the mat or counter, and it is an easy clean surface.</li>
            <li> This product is wonder!  I purchased this for my daughter and daughter-in-law for their Christmas stocking stuffers.  They both like it and now they will not burn the bathroom counters.  Would recommend this to anyone who uses hot appliances for styling their hair.</li>
            <li> Works wonders when handling hot irons. Use it frequently for a couple months now and no problems.</li>
            <li> I left my straightener on for 6 hours and thanks to this heat mat. My house didn&#x27;t burn down. Even my vanity was safe from any damage. Im so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  Every female needs at least one or more of these.  I purchase two of them, one for home and one for travel beacuse I use heated hair utensils constantly for my hair and I&#x27;m tired of making burn marks on the furniture and counters.This is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; girls staple item.</li>
            <li> bought to protect the bath counters from girls curling irons and straighteners....so far it has solved the problem! also doubled it&#x27;s use and put it under my sewing machine to keep it from sliding around!</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose, but it could be larger!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my curling iron and straightener.  Great size.  Protects my vanity.</li>
            <li> I think this product is real good and a good investment. The price is good and is reasonable with the shipping date. It  came earlier than I expected. the only thing is that it dose attract dust but can be simple cleaned. BUY THIS AND LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m using my curling wand and flat iron. It does what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it was a little bigger but it does what it is suppose to. Keeps my counter from getting burned!</li>
            <li> Love this. I received a Nume curling wand set for Christmas, and this makes it SO much easier to put the iron down and grab sections of my hair better, without having to worry about burning the tops of my furniture.</li>
            <li> I used these as trivets and they work great</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered this mat based on the degrees of heat that it was stated to withstand...&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t, I used a In-Styler iron on it and it burned thru the mat to the counter...worthless and I have&lt;br /&gt;a damaged counter.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is AWESOME!! I love this heat-resistant mat.  I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t get one sooner.  It is so light &amp; convenient.  I&#x27;ve already taken it with me on a couple of trips.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this i could not find anything to lay my  curling iron on at my vanity i didnt even know they made things for this until i found it on here. i was so glad i found this. i love it holds two curling irons with plenty of room and looks nice on the vanity. i am going to order another one for the other bath. i have not had it very long so i dont know how it holds up long term but so for i am realy happy with it.</li>
            <li> Before with my flat iron or curling iron I would often get out a dinner plate to protect the surface but because it wasn&#x27;t completely flat I decided to try for one of these heat resistant station mats.  Got to use it last night when I did my daughters&#x27; hair.  One wanted it curled and the other wanted it flat ironed.  The mat was indeed heat resistant and thoroughly protected my table.  Also the texture of the mat and the slightly raised areas kept the curling iron and the flat iron firmly in place, neither of them slid or shifted.  Entirely pleased!</li>
            <li> I love how it protects my bathroom counter from all of my hot irons and looks nice and neat.  It&#x27;s even long enough for the longer curling irons.  I can fit up to 3 curling irons (various sizes) and one flat iron on it at the same time.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> We just update our bathrooms and we needed something to protect the marble countertops.  This mat works well for Chi irons, curling irons, and anything that might get very hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> Another life-saver! This gadget will protect your surface from discolorations due to high heat from curling rods/irons. I works wonderful. I recommend and not bad for the price either :-)</li>
            <li> This mat is great product, I am not a professional but I use my straighter that gets to 500 degrees every day.  This product protects the wooden dresser that I use as a landing pad for my stuff.  The underside of the mat is never more than mildly warm and the dresser is unharmed, the mat is non sliding and won&#x27;t move around on the dresser short of you picking it up and moving it.  The mat is plenty big, so even if you have more than one hot iron they will fit on at the same time.  Overall I love this mat and would recommend it if you are looking for something to protect surfaces from hot irons.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girl friend. It&#x27;s really just a piece of silicone, but it works better than anything she was using before.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. I have been using  it to protect my dresser from my straightening.</li>
            <li> Best buy ever.  Protects the furniture from the hot curling irons and straighteners.</li>
            <li> This mat is exactly what I was looking for! Fits neatly next to my bathroom sink and holds my chi iron and two curling wants comfortably.</li>
            <li> I had to get 2 of these to put together to place under my toaster oven.  I wanted to be extra careful and protect my quartz countertop.  The large size is also great because I use another one to place under my chopping mat to protect the countertop too.  I use an iron trivet to place under my straightening iron and blow dryer, but this can be used for those too (even better than my iron trivet because this one is double the size)</li>
            <li> i like it but it&#x27;s little on small side but it&#x27;s good quality though</li>
            <li> Great pad to protect your countertop while getting ready in the morning. This being black seems to show a bit of lint, but other than that it works perfectly. I use it with 2 heating devices (curling iron and straightner), and both fit on it fine with no issues.  Could probably fit a 3rd on it if needed without devices touching.</li>
            <li> Nice large size, feel  safe placing hot irons on it.</li>
            <li> My teen daughters needed something to place their straightener or hair dryer or curler or whatever else they use that is hot and would otherwise burn something if they simply left it out. It seems to work well and no fires to report as of yet... :)</li>
            <li> Great for saving my counter top from the hair tools that heat up well past 400°. Happy husband. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered the mat for my 14 year old daughter&#x27;s dressing when she is using her flat-iron.  The Mat works great and will be ordering one for myself.  I only a a small mat from my Instyler which is very cheap compared to the Colortrak Mat.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this.  It looks nice and works great!  Large enough for multiple irons.  Nice quality and looks great on her desk.</li>
            <li> bought it for the fiance, so she would stop burning the counter with her straightener.  seems to work so far and has a pleasant texture to it - nice and soft finish.</li>
            <li> I use it every day.  Installed a new marble bathroom counter top and would be too worried placing my curling irons down without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this mat to use with my flat iron and curling wands. It helps protect the surface of my make up table. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use on my kitchen counter to sit my Mr. Coffee 12 cup coffee maker on.  Works great and the black color looks soooo much better than my old clear one!</li>
            <li> Does not work. My desk that I lay this on feels as if it was on fire when I placed my straightener on top of it, just for a couple of minutes. I have thrown it away. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Should have purchased more.  We use it on the counter and table to put hot pans or serving dish.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected. Less expensive than SB supply store. I do wish these heat mats were a little bit larger and smaller. Variety would be nice. That written, this mat came as expected, undamaged and works perfectly for task.</li>
            <li> It works and the only downside is that every little spec of dust just gravitates towards this but it does the job. It is hot on the bottom of the mat when I lift it up but its not damaging my vanity and I feel comfortable leaving my hair tools on this when they are cooling down.</li>
            <li> This is a great bureau saver!! I have mine on a plastic drawer and it is great!  Wonderful product!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Use this mat in the shop all,the time</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the top of my tray to keep irons from heating the tray and melting it and also to keep bowls from sliding around</li>
            <li> This is for hair I suppose,  I cut the tags off so no one in the family would know that.  I am using it for a large hot pad for pots and pans and also a hot plate at my table.  I just love this.  So versatile.</li>
            <li> This works great.  It keeps my granite countertop from getting hot from my flatiron.  I think they should package it flat instead of folded into thirds.  It is still not laying perfectly flat after a month of use, although this is not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I have a curling wand that goes to 450 degrees Fahrenheit as well as a straightener that does the same. This protects my vanity from the heat no problem. The mat does tend to catch hairs and makeup but it is expected with the material and besides it is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This mat does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Bought this in conjunction with a makeup vanity for the gf. She really appreciate it since she wouldn&#x27;t want to ruin the glass top.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I do like this mat though I&#x27;m not sure that it does its intended purpose as well as one would hope. I have a heat protective carrying case that unzips to lie flat that I placed under my mat just to be safe. And sure enough just like some other reviewers claimed, the heat transferred all the way through the mat. Though the bottom of the mat doesn&#x27;t feel quite as hot to the touch as my flat iron itself, it feels hot enough that I would be concerned to cause damage to my counters over time. It is a nice sturdy mat though and I think I&#x27;ll use it to help keep my counter clean while applying makeup instead.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, I have a vintage dresser at home, I lay it on to protect the top of the dresser. It&#x27;s preotected from a few spill also. Works great!</li>
            <li> So glad to fnd this for my corling irons. Good for heat and slipping.</li>
            <li> Very useful to hold your flat irons so you don&#x27;t burn your surfaces!!</li>
            <li> Works well when using the flat iron. Won&#x27;t burn the countertop.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have measured the dimensions first. smaller than what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It protects my sink from heat damage and is convenient to use.  Highly recommend.  Very heat resistant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I was using a towel to protect the station from the heat of the curling irons. I love this mat cause it makes the station look neater and it does an excellent job of protecting the station.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. The only disadvantage is that it can become a bit static-y and hair sticks to it a bit because of this.</li>
            <li> This mat is a life saver. I accidentally left my iron on for a whole day and neither the mat or my table had any marks even though my iron was pretty much fried.</li>
