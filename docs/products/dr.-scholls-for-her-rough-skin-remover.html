    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The unit worked great, just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>the attachments are good, and with more power it would be adequate.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>they love it</li>
            <li>you would be better off using a washcloth to try to scrub your feet</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>i wouldnt use this thing even if it was for free.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older version that had finally quit working, so was happy to be able to replace it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for the price</li>
            <li>This makes my feet so smooth and ready for flip flops</li>
            <li>This product as soon as it touches your feet pretty much comes to a stop and dont work.</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>I really purchased this for my mum</li>
            <li>You have to be very patient to use, probably take bout 7-10 mins on each foot.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you really need something that works for calluses and stuff.</li>
            <li>The motor is very weak and any more than very light pressure on the foot makes it stop.</li>
            <li>Also does not have much power to even Smooth the smallest rough areas on your feet.</li>
            <li>The pads had to be super glued back on because they fell off as soon as she opened the package.</li>
            <li>It effectively smooths rough, dry skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any pain.  </li>
            <li>The actual machine is about 3-4 inches long the grinding power isn&#x27;t strong at all.</li>
            <li>Completely unpractical.</li>
            <li>I purchased this thinking it would be worth the money due to its being a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>Waste of money that we really didn&#x27;t have!</li>

            <li> If ZERO were an option, I&#x27;d choose it. This product DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. THE SECOND YOU APPLY PRESSURE IT STOPS. seems to be a common issue. Waste of money that we really didn&#x27;t have!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  It effectively smooths rough, dry skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any pain.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This makes my feet so smooth and ready for flip flops</li>
            <li> worst callus remover ever doesn&#x27;t do anything! gave it to my kids to play with! they love it haha.  Biggest waste of money</li>
            <li> The unit worked great, just what I wanted.  One small problem the pummace bolck fell off the mount, the glue went bad.  What do I do now?, if you send me some glue I can fix it here.  OR WHAT?  Russ S</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t powerful and when i got it the parts for it was broken</li>
            <li> Came broken. Also does not have much power to even Smooth the smallest rough areas on your feet. Do not waists your money.</li>
            <li> Takes very little pressure to stop it from spinning... the attachments are good, and with more power it would be adequate. But as is it&#x27;s pretty useless</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older version that had finally quit working, so was happy to be able to replace it.</li>
            <li> Terrible broke withing 5 min of use</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it would be worth the money due to its being a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s product. After one use I could see this device is not one I would recommend to anyone. The motor is very weak and any more than very light pressure on the foot makes it stop. I was not able to get any results with it at all. One would have to sit for an hour using this thing just to get a little rough skin off.</li>
            <li> The product is so bad i threw it away. As soon as u apply the SLIGHTEST pressure it will stop. Completely unpractical. I am shocked at how inefficient a product can be given what it is SUPPOSED to do. Unbelievable rip off. I swear to god i wouldnt use this thing even if it was for free.</li>
            <li> it was broke when I got it the stone was off the backing. It can&#x27;t take any pressure none at all. I will not recommend this item to any one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> one of the foot massage inserts was broken. the one with pumice stone.  please send a replacement. i can return the broken one.</li>
            <li> I really purchased this for my mum and she has a bit of problems reaching under her feet. The actual machine is about 3-4 inches long the grinding power isn&#x27;t strong at all. You have to be very patient to use, probably take bout 7-10 mins on each foot. It&#x27;s good enough for the price but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you really need something that works for calluses and stuff.</li>
            <li> A very small device and it is not that good , Does not work required at all , Suddenly stops when use ..  :-(</li>
            <li> When I received it the attachments fell off. Then once I reglued them back on everytime I touched my foot with it just the slightest the spinning would stop. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The pads had to be super glued back on because they fell off as soon as she opened the package.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke it doesn&#x27;t work you would be better off using a washcloth to try to scrub your feet</li>
            <li> This product as soon as it touches your feet pretty much comes to a stop and dont work. The stones feel apart before i even got to use them. I just tossed in trash, Will not purchase another one.</li>
