            <li>It&#x27;s a reasonable price with shipping and works great on my combination skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many products out there to choose from these days, but can say this...</li>
            <li>My face has never looked better since I started using this cleanser and toner.</li>
            <li>Love this product for fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Well, for that I thank Aqua Glycolic and a clean lifestyle!</li>
            <li>I only read all the of great reviews after I started to shop around for another bottle of toner.</li>
            <li>from the first time i used it seemed to work better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>iT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL TINGLY AND CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I really like this toner and in fact am almost out of it and thinking that I need to order more.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the top.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because I have very oily skin, and acne problems.  </li>
            <li>If you skin is sensitive use more sparingly.</li>
            <li>Very easy and simple.</li>
            <li>Shipped VERY fast.</li>
            <li>Safe to use on face, chest and back.  </li>
            <li>I actually switched to Reviva Labs Glycolic Acid Toner and it works even better without the sting.</li>
            <li>This product is so much better than anything I&#x27;ve bought at my local Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin which is the foundation to the growth of dirt and bacteria.</li>
            <li>I found this product while in a very high end dermotologists office, in Miami.  </li>
            <li>keeps me relatively breakout free.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>along with the cleanser really helps get rid of blackheads and prevents breakouts.</li>
            <li>The cleanser and toner have done wonders for my breakouts and my face is much smoother.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and helps it to feel clean.  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find it locally in any other stores</li>
            <li>This trio which includes the cleanser, toner, and lotion is gentle enough for very sensitive skin but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years now, and my skin stays clear with it ... and gets blemishes without it.</li>
            <li>It helps me keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>It keep my face clear of any acne or blemishes.</li>
            <li>I have had adult acne since I was 20 (47 now).</li>
            <li>You can give yourself a gentle peel using this 2-3x daily.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regularly use the moisturizer as it sometimes irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But it really didn&#x27;t show down my oil production.  </li>

            <li> I swear by this product, try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it. Perfectly shipped and on time.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! IT&#x27;S A PERFECT TONER FOR MY OILY SKIN.</li>
            <li> Love this product, been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years now, and my skin stays clear with it ... and gets blemishes without it. That simple!</li>
            <li> I have had adult acne since I was 20 (47 now). I&#x27;ve been using Aqua Glycolic since recommended by a dermatologist in 1993 and don&#x27;t ever want to be without it. It combined with BenzaClin keeps me relatively breakout free.</li>
            <li> i like this product-it cleans well. and my face feels cleaned and refreshed after use.  and the packaging for shipment,was great! very innovative to prevent spills</li>
            <li> My dermatologist many years ago told me that this was the strongest over the counter \\&quot;peel\\&quot;  that you can buy.  I used it for years and had stopped for awhile.  When I decided to start using it again, the drustore I use to buy it at had been bought out and closed.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find it locally in any other stores so was happy to see Amazon had it. Shipped VERY fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  When I start to get a break out I simply apply it and next day the blemish is gone. Safe to use on face, chest and back.  Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. Not medicinal in odor.</li>
            <li> Love this product for fine lines.  You do have to use it regularly or it will not work.  Hard to find at retail drug stores so had to order through Amazon. Again......great product and good prices.</li>
            <li> I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO AND CAN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT.  IT NOT ONLY CONTROLS MY OILY COMPLEXION, BUT MY PORES HAVE BASICALLY DISAPPEARED.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> from the first time i used it seemed to work better in my opinion. i guess skin can get used to it.</li>
            <li> I use it 2x a day, morning and night.  It is amazing.  If you skin is sensitive use more sparingly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner because my dermatologist recommended it.  It works and cleans my skin so very nicely.</li>
            <li> It works! Love it! The best I&#x27;ve tried for clogged pores, cystic acne, blackheads and leaves your face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> along with the cleanser really helps get rid of blackheads and prevents breakouts. Wish I had known about it years ago.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner and in fact am almost out of it and thinking that I need to order more.  I have combination skin that has regular breakouts, despite being 40.  This one doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and helps it to feel clean.  I also really like the top.  You just flip the lid and press down on it with your cotton swab.  Very easy and simple.</li>
            <li> I have used this toner for several years after my dermatologist recommended it. It helps me keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Writing for my wife, the one who actually uses the toner.  She swears by it.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS EVERY DAY AFTER TAKING A SHOWER AND LOVE IT. iT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL TINGLY AND CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this product at any pharmacy in my state and so I went to Amazon and I found it! It&#x27;s a reasonable price with shipping and works great on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> This works well, but is very strong and burns my skin. I actually switched to Reviva Labs Glycolic Acid Toner and it works even better without the sting.</li>
            <li> This product is so much better than anything I&#x27;ve bought at my local Walgreens.  After using the same brand&#x27;s hand &amp; body lotion, I am now a dedicated user of Aqua Glycolic products!</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t  helped with oiliness at all.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this brand when it was on sale on another site. It came in a set with the face cleanser, the toner, and a moisturizer. I only read all the of great reviews after I started to shop around for another bottle of toner. I used the toner up way before the other two items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many products out there to choose from these days, but can say this... My face has never looked better since I started using this cleanser and toner. I don&#x27;t regularly use the moisturizer as it sometimes irritates my sensitive skin. The cleanser and toner have done wonders for my breakouts and my face is much smoother.</li>
            <li> Made my pores visibly smaller and cleared up my white heads-wow what a difference! I never want to run out of this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is great for people with oily skin that breaks out.  I&#x27;ve used it for years. But it really didn&#x27;t show down my oil production.  I&#x27;m using spironolactone now and that has reduced my oil by at least 50%.  Now the aqua glycolic is only for routine skin maintenance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on skin products and have tried everything known to man. I have pretty oily skin which is the foundation to the growth of dirt and bacteria. This trio which includes the cleanser, toner, and lotion is gentle enough for very sensitive skin but gets the job done. I no longer get those nasty breakouts, if I do it&#x27;ll be one small bump. I swear by this product, try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry your face out like other toners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I found this product while in a very high end dermotologists office, in Miami.  They offered a sample of this and I was hooked!  You can give yourself a gentle peel using this 2-3x daily.  It doesn&#x27;t cause your skin to become dry and flake off.  It will remove the dead, dulling layers.  I get compliments on my skin all the time.  Just recently while in the hospital for a mamogram, the nurse questioned my chart and the age on it.  Well, for that I thank Aqua Glycolic and a clean lifestyle!</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner, and it was just as described.  Truly recommend this seller!!  I love this product because I have very oily skin, and acne problems.  I cannot live without this product.  It keep my face clear of any acne or blemishes.</li>
