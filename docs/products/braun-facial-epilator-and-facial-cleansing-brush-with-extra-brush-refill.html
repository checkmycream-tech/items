            <li>mother also tried and loved it!</li>
            <li>Great for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product</li>
            <li>combination of the two tools in one unit make a great pair.</li>
            <li>It is great for getting stray hairs between threading/waxing/plucking sessions as a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; but not for defining.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great pulling the hair around my lips and chin and after one week I still see no traces of hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it was a great idea</li>
            <li>The epilator does a great job on thicker hairs, even if they have just started poking through the surface.</li>
            <li>I received mine in the mail and tried it out, I was happy and relieved.</li>
            <li>Happy I bought it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still great for putting into my travel case.    </li>
            <li>As i have already mentioned, the result was great.  </li>
            <li>but it is a great investment for your money.</li>
            <li>but he wouldn&#x27;t have it lol.</li>
            <li>The Epilator works great as well.</li>
            <li>Another great feature is that you can take it in the shower with you with the cleansing brush on.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool to have.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a great idea for the 2-in-1 feature of this product including both the epilator head and brush head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice and has a great eye appeal to it.</li>
            <li>the fact that this is a 2 in one situation makes it THAT MUCH BETTER!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>It is very effective.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!</li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t of come at a more perfect time.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m kind of a slacker and should be repeating the process at night!.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to plan, warm up wax, try not to spill wax on my face/counter/floor, then try not to remove the hair I do want to keep!</li>
            <li>And ladies, let&#x27;s be honest, ALL hair removal hurts!  </li>
            <li>Gives a great clean finish to my face..  excellent idea.....      </li>
            <li>and they loved it too.</li>
            <li>The device is battery powered which is good for traveling and being on the go.</li>
            <li>I started to tout this product to my friends and loved ones, However...</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>I loved this product, I&#x27;ve used epilators before on my face</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a good speed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe for use in the shower, which makes it incredibly convenient.</li>
            <li>I received this product through Buzzagent as a promotion campaign for Braun and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Is a good product and i recommend ..</li>
            <li>The cleansing brush head is the perfect size and makes your face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and  my faces look very cute and good .</li>
            <li>Super awesome.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have been able to try it from bzzagent!!</li>
            <li>I think I am most impressed that it even grabbed the fine hairs as I have an issue even getting tweezers to grip them.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can use it in the shower!</li>
            <li>It was even better than a shave!</li>
            <li>okay!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s safe to use in the shower, which also means it&#x27;s cordless!</li>
            <li>It took away 95% of my most troublesome hairs in a matter of minutes!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I first tried it on my arm to see how it felt, and it was indeed plucking hairs at an incredible speed!</li>
            <li>The battery life isn&#x27;t the best, but it just takes AA batteries which most everyone has in their household, and for the convince of this thing, it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>The handle and weight of the device is very comfortable and it feels durable and of good quality.</li>
            <li>It worked great even under the running water and works fine</li>
            <li>I also like that the hair removal lasts for weeks instead of days!&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to try for free as part of a promotion from Braun and am very satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li>so I have been using this amazing product for that.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, so I don&#x27;t mind replacing the battery every now</li>
            <li>gave this a 3 star rating because it was good, but not something I am in love with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>The epilator headalso spins either clockwise or counter clockwise, which is really nice, so you dont have to keep switching directions manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m ok with using a pair of tweezers, thread, and a good exfoliating facewash.</li>
            <li>so you kind of get use to it.</li>
            <li>I tested this on my lip and eye brow area and actually really liked the epilator part of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that the epilator runs on an AA battery.</li>
            <li>I love the cleansing brush because it leaves my skin feeling smooth, but what impressed me the most was the epilator.</li>
            <li>There is some kind of pain</li>
            <li>If I were to purchase this product on my own</li>
            <li>and i must say the first look of it was most impressive.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I thought it couldn&#x27;t be doing a very good job, but it was.</li>
            <li>Works really well, fairly painless and is great for those who have reactions to waxing.</li>
            <li>I love this item so much it works wonderfully</li>
            <li>Of course, the brush is very soft and is excellent for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to feel more feminine, have a fuzz-free face, and not have to worry about tweezing all those chin hairs.</li>
            <li>And I am in love it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine hair all over my face that look like peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, it is superior performance, better than thread by a margin</li>
            <li>I threw out the packaging after the first time using it since I was so happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So on to the review, the packaging was great, loved that it came with batteries, and not the generic kind.</li>
            <li>I was especially excited because the product is advertised as being good for sensitive skin, like mine.</li>
            <li>so I can’t say if it’s “strong” or not, but it is certainly effective.  </li>
            <li>The epilator bladed rotate in opposite directions catching hold and removing even fine hair which was very impressive.</li>
            <li>It is a nice size, and fits comfortably in the hand while using.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with the  performance of the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>the more you use it</li>
            <li>Until now, i have been waxing at home, but this epilator has saved the day and  does the job BETTER than the home wax kit  </li>
            <li>overall, I would recommend purchasing this product… PS-the included brush is great!!</li>
            <li>but I found it most beneficial to remove unwanted eyebrow hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll feel refreshed after using this product :]</li>
            <li>I think it just feels like the pain of tweezing, but many hairs at once.</li>
            <li>I received this free as a promotion, but the opinion is honestly mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and the top part of my eyebrow.</li>
            <li>so make sure to test it</li>
            <li>While I love how it worked on my eyebrow area, the epilator is not made for sculpting brows by any means.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have this item</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I am really glad that I was chosen for this opportunity.</li>
            <li>I can tell that it is a quality product and even more so with Braun being as the brand.</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased.</li>
            <li>So, if you want to try this epilator, be sure to keep your box and receipt for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the compact design,  </li>
            <li>It comes with a top to cover the attachment and a cleaning brush along with the interchangeable head to either use as the cleansing brush or epilator.</li>
            <li>The cleansing brush works better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I immediately inserted the AA battery (included, yay!) and used my favorite cleansing foam.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not big on Epilators, however, this one seems to work best out of any I have tried.</li>
            <li>and I love that it has an epilator attached.</li>
            <li>I am able to take it in the shower without worry of damage, or use it at the sink just as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just looking at it, I want quite sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!and I got it free to test from bzzzagent!</li>
            <li>I would say on a scale of 1-10 the pain when using this was around a 2 for me which is better then</li>
            <li>Am I glad that I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received my Braun epilator courtesy of BzzAgent as part of a promotion by Braun, and it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.</li>
            <li>All in all, the epilator and the package&#x27;s inclusions are fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I was chosen because my face has never felt better .......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for travel and only takes one AA battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then I read a suggestion to add your favorite face wash and then use that with the device.</li>
            <li>On the whole the epilator and the cleansing brush duo is a great pack</li>
            <li>After trying both ways I figured out the best way for the epilator to work so that most of my facial hair came out.</li>
            <li>love that you can have it in the shower and the water will not damage or get inside the battery area.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am estastic to have received this item to try and would gladly buy it if I had&#x27;nt and recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li>AS YOU AGE, ( SOME OF US :)  </li>
            <li>IS THE BEST THING I HAVE FOUND TO COMBAT THAT PROBLEM, TOTALLY PAINLESS ( FOR ME ) ....</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>my wife love the product and it did the job as described.</li>
            <li>I need it most</li>
            <li>I love that it has a dual head.</li>
            <li>I love the cleanser brush to it</li>
            <li>and i really Love it</li>
            <li>My boyfriend used it and said it was ok.  </li>
            <li>(I know mustaches are trendy right now, but no thank you!)</li>
            <li>absolutely LOVED the epilator the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I love that it is waterproof and how easily the heads can be switched.</li>
            <li>I love that the brush head detaches from the  brush adapter itself for easy cleaning and replacement.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and the results couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and great for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to clean and store after each use.</li>
            <li>With some practice, though, I think I will become more confident and have more success in this area.    </li>
            <li>More importantly, it can not pick up any hair from my forehead and jaws.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love it and see myself using it often as my primary method of hair removal for my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love it and see myself using it often as my primary method of hair removal for my face.</li>
            <li>If you tried a clarisonic before you will not care for the brush, plus I wouldn&#x27;t know where to buy a brush head to replace the old one.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a great products and most important, it works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far happy with the results and more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It is removing more of my makeup and leaving my skin feeling very fresh.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this!</li>
            <li>The product did great on the more coarse hairs on my face like chin and brow.</li>
            <li>The slim design of it makes it easy for me to bring it with me whenever I travel.</li>
            <li>However, it is not made to stand up and will easily tip over, so I end up setting it on it&#x27;s side on the counter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to control where you pluck.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and maneuver over my face.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s portable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with many different routines for washing and exfoliating my face, without a great deal of luck.</li>
            <li>The option to set which direction the epilator rotates makes it easy to get any where on my face easily.</li>
            <li>- so honest first impression...</li>
            <li>It removed the unwanted hairs easily and accurately without any frustration.</li>
            <li>It did not perform quite as well on the baby fine hairs around my lip and jaw line.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work so well with fine hairs though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found the experience rather soothing, and ended up washing for longer than I would have otherwise, which was just fine.</li>
            <li>I love the way the soft brush feels on my face and leaves it clean and bright.</li>
            <li>It gets really fine hair</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what i always needed is really easy to use with excellents results, i actually enjoy this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Braun epilator and brush for about two weeks now and overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive my first free product to try from BzzAgent.com because theBraun Face Beauty Edition 810 is just the kind of product I have been looking for for cleansing and hair removal.</li>
            <li>though the sound if the machine was a little intimidating the result was wonderful.</li>
            <li>I scrubbed my face and it really exfoliated my skin leaving a nice smooth texture and a glow that i haven&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for superflous facial hair.</li>
            <li>I am happy to have this product so I can improve my facial cleansing</li>
            <li>However, this a genuine review and</li>
            <li>I prefer to use it in the shower with a facial wash and it just feels great, like a massage.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow feature is also great, it definitely holds me over between trips to the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a bit of difficulty with getting to a point where I felt comfortable and in control of the device to the point where I could achieve the look I was going for.  </li>
            <li>After using it my face felt smooth, and that was just after one time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about it is just great.</li>
            <li>I could see a reduced number of blackheads, my skin felt quote smooth, and I wasn&#x27;t covered in skin flakes.</li>
            <li>Once again, the head will spin in either direction depending on the direction you push the switch, which in this case I find more useful than for the brush head.</li>
            <li>any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Bzz Agent and received this product free of charge to try out.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks I am still hair free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#got it free from Braun</li>
            <li>It was gentle and effective and the results were immediate.</li>
            <li>I received this product free to test as part of a BzzAgent campaign.</li>
            <li>After using it for a 1.5 week on my acne-prone skin it feels cleaned and smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I received my Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 from Braun to try for free.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Braun, for such a versatile and great product!</li>
            <li>But after I got the hang of it, I realized I loved the epilator better than a regular tweezer or even an at home wax product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice quality and effective in not only showing the product, but describes how the product will work as well.    </li>
            <li>I also found that several of the fine hairs I attempted to epilate were not fully removed &amp; experienced a significant amount of breakage.</li>
            <li>I received my Braun epilator to try out from BzzAgent in the mail as part of a promo by Braun &amp; its arrival was highly anticipated as it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time!</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so smooth and clean</li>
            <li>My skin looks so clean and feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>The epilator head and cleansing brush are super easy to interchange.</li>
            <li>The epilator and face scrubber heads are very easy to switch which is also very convenient.</li>
            <li>I received the new Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 for free from Braun to test it and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and gentle to my face and it works really great.</li>
            <li>It was even more gentle than tweezing!  </li>
            <li>I was excited to be chosen to try this out since it was about time to rotate my beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>I was excited when I discovered I would be receiving this product courtesy of Bzzagent.com for review.</li>
            <li>Kinda excited to try this again tomorrow night.</li>
            <li>My advice for first time users is to read the instructions on how to angle the epilator head in relation to the direction of the hair, also the tingling pain sensation lessens the more you use it.</li>
            <li>the go&amp;#34;) and thus find thebattery operation to be even more of a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After receiving this product through a Bzzagent campaign, I was really excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Small and useful, perfect to take when traveling since it runs on battery and takes little space..</li>
            <li>my pores are clean after I use this product and of course I follow up with my toner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The brush head is able to rotate either clockwise or counter clockwise, which is pretty cool in my opinion, and you control the direction with just a flip of the switch.</li>
            <li>I actually get a better result with the brush turned off and just use my own muscle power to move the brush in circles.  </li>
            <li>This particular epilator pulled at a nice speed so that it was over quickly.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try my new epilator from Braun that came with one of those trendy rotating cleansing brushes</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever been able to find an epilator that actually works really well, so I was very pleasantly surprised when this one worked perfectly!  </li>
            <li>With a little practice I am sure I can use it successfully.  </li>
            <li>One feature I had difficulty getting familiar with was the spinning of the epilator-it goes to the left and right, so you can use it in the direction of the hair growth for more effective epilation.  </li>
            <li>Another great tool I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money on....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised by how much I liked this product.</li>
            <li>It switches direction about a quarter way through a full rotation.</li>
            <li>It continues to work well on the upper lip, so that is good.</li>
            <li>Never liked the makeup removal process before, would skip nights, but this is quite awesome.  </li>
            <li>I feel it really helps your skin look more youthful.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I will continue to use the facial cleansing brush as part of my daily routine (love love LOVE this feature!), and may give the epilator another try to see if I have better success.</li>
            <li>The little brush that is comes with is nice to clean it with and the cover is nice so that I can throw it in my bag to travel with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product, though the price is justifiable only if you have a significant amount of facial hair that would be pesky to tweeze.</li>
            <li>Together the epilator and the cleansing brush gave a clean and fresh effect.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t break out as quickly in between washings.</li>
            <li>but I actually think this product from Braun is better than the Clarisonic and a better value being</li>
            <li>The facial cleansing brush is my favorite part of the device since I love washing and exfoliating my face.</li>
            <li>As far as the cleansing brush love love love, the bristles are a perfect texture really get deep down and leaves your facing feeling refreshed and revitalized.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly painless, no more so than if you were tweezing, and removes all the hair in the area (even very fine hairs).  </li>
            <li>and I love how this product is versatile and high quality.</li>
            <li>The epilator attachment on this item gets every single hair on my face and I can tell you right now that it is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>If this product had continued to work as well as the very first time I used it, then I would have given it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but as i received the same as a part of a promotion, I am more than happy to use same.</li>
            <li>I experienced far less skin irritation, breakouts, and it&#x27;s very easy and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Good product brush can be a bit harsh on sensitive skin, replicator works great reccomend this product for those who travel and don&#x27;t have much time on their hand&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This product has become my new favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li>I really like how easy it is to switch from the brush head to the epilator.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and is used easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I said no way!</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with this product the facial cleanser feels great on my skin after I used it for the first time, the only downside about it is the speed of the brush</li>
            <li>I agree with others that the price is a little steep but still a great product based on the handyness and the fact that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li>(considering I have fine &amp; very sparse facial hair in these areas, this was an issue for me), and also noticed that the wand does get mildly warm when using beyond 60-90 seconds.</li>
            <li>And while it makes my skin feel nice for a little while after use, they cause more issues than they solve, for me.</li>
            <li>It’s also much more cost effective than buying the no heat wax strips every few</li>
            <li>– I really liked that I could do my eyebrows as well as facial hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth its money.</li>
            <li>I can see this being useful for bikini line grooming, though that is not a use I saw suggested anywhere in the enclosed manual.  </li>
            <li>It was fun to trial it</li>
            <li>Getting the battery door open was a bit of a struggle, but having a coin handy helped.    </li>
            <li>The brush is a nice extra, but I feel like if someone is going to purchase this, it would be for the epilator.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever write  reviews</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll definitely still need tweezers to shape them, but the epilator did a great job of removing hair between the brows and around the forehead near the brows.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li>Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li>think this is a great purchase for anyone, but definitely for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The above review is my honest opinion of this Braun Epilator.</li>
            <li>I had a 100% success rate with my eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>As far as the facial cleansing is concerned, I have been more than thrilled.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this product through Bzzagent.com from Braun for free because I was lookin for a 2 in 1 device that would help me abtain a healthier, clearer complexion and fight off those stubborn facial hairs.</li>
            <li>and I still feel like my face is freshly scrubbed and cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had about a month with this product and all opinions and experiences are my own and based off of regular and continuous use of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will say that the product claims to be safe for sensitive skin and will give the benefit of the doubt that my skin needs a firmer touch</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rotate at all just kind of vibrates, so you don&#x27;t get much scrubbing action.  </li>
            <li>it is totally worth</li>
            <li>Honestly, it worked so well the first time (speaking of the epilator part, not the facial cleansing brush) that I was super excited, ecstatic even, because it worked so efficiently and fast.  </li>
            <li>There are other options with better bristles that feel more exfoliating and cleansing.</li>
            <li>I received my Braun Epilator a week ago and tried right away,</li>
            <li>Yes this hurts but beauty has its price right?</li>
            <li>then packed it right up and drove to UPS.</li>
            <li>I wax my eyebrows and every time i go, the lady asks me if I want to do my upper lip (because apparently i have a mustache lol)</li>
            <li>This felt more like a vibrating facial massage than a true exfoliating clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It would be nice if this had a rechargeable battery, however the fact that it has lasted this long already makes me think it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the added cost of a charger to the retail</li>
            <li>As for the facial cleaning brush, I would have liked one more attachment with a smaller brush to get around the nose area.</li>
            <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t have bought it, but I got it free to try.</li>
            <li>It does the job without being overly abrasive, and used in conjunction with a facial moisturizer, keeps skin looking fresh and healthy.    </li>
            <li>She is 64 years old and can&#x27;t see really well to tweeze or wax and with the epilator she was able to get all the unwanted hair</li>
            <li>Have had this item before and so easy to use and not harsh on the face.</li>
            <li>definitely a product worth trying :)</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great that this the the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush has two functions.</li>
            <li>Though its very slim and sleek looking, I did not expect the whole machinery to be to light in weight</li>
            <li>The epilator seem like it was going super fast.</li>
            <li>I used this product on my my lip and it went pretty smooth, I dont really have much there</li>
            <li>The brush is very gentle and the epilator worked well.</li>
            <li>The pain is minimal, just like with waxing, the tool is easy to use and easy to control.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t make any mess.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I am thorough on my facial routine, but the Braun was better.</li>
            <li>So - my overall impression... FABULOUSSSS :)</li>
            <li>I may not know exactly what to expect.  </li>
            <li>(product is water resistant for the shower), and that aspect was exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>All you do is use your favorite cleanser and the Braun Facial Epilator</li>
            <li>make sure the product gets deep into your pores.</li>
            <li>so im ok with it because it is only temporary</li>
            <li>for being the first time trying out this product/brand  </li>
            <li>This item has a lot of use, so you&#x27;re really getting the worth for your money.</li>
            <li>, I definitely think it is a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>After just the first use, I could tell that it was making a difference in my grooming routine</li>
            <li>the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>I love the facial scrubber attachment.</li>
            <li>The epilator did hurt when I first used it since I was not expecting the pull</li>
            <li>When I first heard that it was an epilator for my face</li>
            <li>Even saying that,  I would have been satisfied with an efficiency that only lasted a year...  </li>
            <li>I appreciated the battery being included!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a first time epilator user, DO NOT test it out before heading out the door for a date or meeting..</li>
            <li>The brush (with water alone) cleaned my face better than facial soap and water.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I love the facial cleaner part!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the facial brush</li>
            <li>as well I found it to be a nice texture not to rough.</li>
            <li>This really hurts!</li>
            <li>Braun Facial Epilator is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>This facial epilator is my favorite of all time.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no charging necessary, therefore there are no cords which makes this product even more convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to use facial brush IN the shower so yet again, adding to the convenience factor!</li>
            <li>Also, this is at the top of my list to take with me next time</li>
            <li>I am in love with the Braun epilator and facial brush!!</li>
            <li>I first used the epilator and</li>
            <li>I love that it includes the batteries, sometimes when I buy something I forget to read if batteries are included and when I get home I have to go back to the store for the batteries.</li>
            <li>I received my Braun epilator courtesy of a promotion by Braun and  BzzAgent, is my first time to use a epilator</li>
            <li>** to those interested</li>
            <li>, in my opinion, is a facial epilator first and foremost and the dual functionality is more of a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Everywhere I&#x27;ve used it feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>THAT YOU REALLY DON&#x27;T NEED &amp; THEY HURT WITH EVERY PULL !</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red or irritated at all.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I used an Epilator.</li>
            <li>makes your face so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>it’s not supposed to), but good for everyday buffing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and leaves my skin feeling clean without causing redness.</li>
            <li>The Braun Facial Epilator and Cleansing Brush is amazing, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spin full and the bristles are a little to soft to get a good foam with my cleanser.</li>
            <li>it does pinch at first but is so worth the final result of bein hair free for weeks</li>
            <li>The hair on my upper lip is also rather fine and the epilator pulled it right out from the root</li>
            <li>The cleansing brush really makes my face feel soft and smooth -</li>
            <li>is the most I have problems with so this really get tiny hairs</li>
            <li>After an hour or so, I applied my regular facial cream and was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No clumsy electrical cords here, battery operated and very convenient!!    </li>
            <li>First off, the cleanser brush is super soft.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first on whether I really knew how to use it.</li>
            <li>When i first received it I really took heed to the packaging it came in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received my Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush courtesy of BzzAgent as a part of promotion from the brando shape them, but the epilator did a great job of removing hair between the brows and around the forehead near the brows.</li>
            <li>At first touch, the bristles are very soft and smooth and not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit hard to describe with words, so the manual&#x27;s diagrams does a pretty good job.)    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a mini facial everyday, its gentle yet effective to make sure your skin is being gently exfoliated of the impurities.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now for those of you who are super sensitive to pain, be mindful that this unit removes the hair from your body as with tweezers, so there is a bit of pain involved.</li>
            <li>But be sure to use a moisturizer after using the scrubber; you don&#x27;t want to acquire any dry</li>
            <li>(Strongly suggest cleaning with witch hazel or similar product to alleviate)</li>
            <li>The facial cleansing head was more gentle than the scrub I normally use</li>
            <li>It is not really painful but more of a uncomfortable pinching sensation that I found the more I used it that it went away.</li>
            <li>My skin actually felt clean after the first use.</li>
            <li>I was so happy that the only time I had any redness with the Epilator was after the very first use, and it was completely gone within a few hours.</li>
            <li>con straight out of the package is the AA battery.</li>
            <li>maybe it’s supposed to really get at it.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is really gentle</li>
            <li>I really like this product because I know I don&#x27;t have any residue makeup still on my face</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>And the face scrubber worked really well.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the brush daily for a few weeks now and feel like my face is getting so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I have tried it with a few different types of face soap and personally think the brush works the best with a foaming face wash.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I hope this is helpful for anyone who wants to buy this product.</li>
            <li>It worked really well</li>
            <li>I received the Braun facial epilator and cleansing brush free from Bzzagent to try out.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will not cost me much in batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason I say this is because I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>However, it is not noticeable unless you look very closely.</li>
            <li>The epilator did not seem to do much for these types of hairs so if you have a problem with this, you will need to stick to threading/waxing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the brush, it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I had to keep going over hairs repeatedly, and even after many tries, the epilator was still not getting them.  </li>
            <li>it removed hair efficiently and fast.  </li>
            <li>So let me first say that I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and am not particularly sensitive to pain, with most beauty is pain</li>
            <li>really fast!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>so much $$ going to the salon for my eyebrow &amp; lip de-fuzzing.</li>
            <li>The epilator head/attachment comes with a convenient cover, but it would be fantastic if the product came with a traveling pouch or case for the facial brush attachment as well.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun Facial Epilator and Cleaning Brush 2-in-1 from Braun to try for FREE through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start with the product as a whole.</li>
            <li>I have seen results but not as much as i would like</li>
            <li>I find when I get it to my face that it really does not do anything for it.</li>
            <li>a light touch is all that&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth after using it because it scrubs away the dirt/makeup above the pores, but I can see that there are still impurities deeper in the pores.</li>
            <li>brush does a great job at exfoliating my face without irritating it.</li>
            <li>brush head is unbelievably gentle.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really find that to be a issue</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much someone says it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and how much you want the hair removed I would think twice about this product.</li>
            <li>But after much research and reading the reviews on this site, I decided to give epilation another try.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to realize that this thing doesn&#x27;t whir and buzz fast.</li>
            <li>My face is always much smoother after using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have tried this product several times now, and I have to say that if I wouldn&#x27;t have receive this for free I would have bought it myself.  </li>
            <li>It has been a day since I did this whole cleansing routine</li>
            <li>My face just feels so much softer and it feels cleaner.</li>
            <li>and it just felt like plucking but much faster.</li>
            <li>This device is not the quietest method of hair removal and thus is not 100% discreet, but it is a volume that is possible to mask the sound with running</li>
            <li>but the oscillation seems to also be effected by the amount of pressure applied to the cleaning surface which in my opinion, shouldn&#x27;t alter the performance of this feature as it allows for too much user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the end I enjoy having this device for facial hair removal but would not invest the ~$80 for it.</li>
            <li>but it really is.  </li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit comfortably in your hand and easy to switch heads on.</li>
            <li>So first off, a huge thank you to Bzz Agent for allowing me to give my unbiased review of Braun&#x27;s new facial epilator, the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The little cleaning brush is great for cleaning the epilator head, though I wish it had some kind of carrying case so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the brush getting dirty and then contaminating the epilator when I clean it.</li>
            <li>I guess my cleansing routine is NOW complete!!!    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to store and instead of having two different devices, you only have one.</li>
            <li>I was so excited because I wanted to get a facial cleanser for a while now</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive it because I was looking to purchase similar products for the holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used epilators in the past some were better than others but most recently have just been sticking with waxing.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to wash my face a second time to get it really clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I really like that this one is small and fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling wonderfully clean.</li>
            <li>After I finished the epilation process, I used Giovanni Facial Cleansing Towelettes, Unscented, to clean and soothe my skin.</li>
            <li>I personally use the brush while in the shower just to use the soap and clean my face.</li>
            <li>As a woman with fair skin and dark hair, facial hair has always been a concern of mine.    </li>
            <li>I just feel as if Braun could sell their facial epilator device on its own and leave the facial brush to another product as this one does seem as if it is powerful enough forthat use</li>
            <li>Someone, finally, got it right!</li>
            <li>It comes packaged nicely and includes the epilator attachment, the exfoliating brush attachment, a small cleaning brush, a cap that will cover the epilator attachment, and a AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try the Braun epilator and cleansing brush because it was something new and different for me.  </li>
            <li>Having all those unwanted hairs removed in less than 5 minutes with ease,  sure beat spending 30 minutes plucking to perfection with concentrated effort.  </li>
            <li>Love the way both make my skin feel, especially not having to use the eplilator daily!</li>
            <li>At the price of this item it is very comparable to those $150 worth facial cleansing brush out there.</li>
            <li>It definitely pulled the more coarse of the hairs immediately.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn&#x27;t JUST an epilator, its a fantastic facial cleansing brush!!</li>
            <li>Facial creams and makeup seem to be working better since there is no facial</li>
            <li>It seems that I can &amp;#34;home in&amp;#34; on specific facial hairs, and I end up feeling it is more efficient than epilators that try for a broader swath of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mainly used the epilator around my eyebrows which is were</li>
            <li>The greatest part about it is that I was able to run it along my chin and feel each of those nasty hairs being removed, including the ones that I normally would have missed while tweezing and then saw in my reflection in the car, etc while without tweezers ::</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product and I will definitely be recommending it down the line to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft, almost dewlike!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the price tag looks high initially, I think it is well worth</li>
            <li>Exfoliating was gentle not harsh.  </li>
            <li>It will probably be a sometimes tool, not an everyday favorite.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I had to go over a few areas with the epilator more than once to maximize removal</li>
            <li>I did use this product for a few weeks to get enough information for my review and after my trial period, I&#x27;m very satisfied with how this product works.</li>
            <li>Cleansing brush should be replace every 3 months but that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>but since the hair was pretty thin it just kind of glided through.</li>
            <li>I normally have one or two coarser hairs on my chin</li>
            <li>It just seems the motor isn&#x27;t powerful enough to move the brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been good at keeping up with plucking, waxing, or using remover creams because my skin would react so poorly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, about the facial cleanser - I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these, but they are pretty pricey on their own from other brands, so I hadn&#x27;t tried one prior to this one.</li>
            <li>The battery held up pretty well and did not loose power</li>
            <li>The head can be switched to rotate left or right depending on which way the hair grows so you don&#x27;t have to twist your hand around to get everywhere</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t mind stocking up on batteries and are looking for an accessible and quick at home solution to facial hair removal the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I received this product free of charge as part of a testing campaign through Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>The brush head was suuuper soft, and left my face noticeably cleaner &amp; smoother after just the first use!</li>
            <li>It seemed a little scratchy on the more sensitive parts of my face.</li>
            <li>and after a week now I still don&#x27;t feel or see any new hairs.</li>
            <li>The Epilator part was new to me</li>
            <li>but the effectiveness of this new design is an improvement.  </li>
            <li>and I tried new batteries and still did not work</li>
            <li>As someone who has been thinking about laser hair removal and other more expensive options for the hair on my upper lip, this product is great for that.</li>
            <li>The base is a nice size and fits into my hand nicely.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft</li>
            <li>and it definitely makes me cringe thinking about how much I spent on this produce that could have been amazing if it only had lasted a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>I had used my facial cleanser first and then the Braun.</li>
            <li>I used the epilator attachment first removing any unwanted hair from my upper lip and</li>
            <li>I love that instead of two different products, all I have to do is change the attachment from one to the other.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic size for taking care of hair above the upper lip and those stray hairs near the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it because I have to learn how to use it better</li>
            <li>What was really special about this new product is that it also has a facial scrubbing option where it has a facial scrubbing brush attachment.</li>
            <li>but seriously that was not what I had expected or had ever experienced with any others.</li>
            <li>The Epilator picks up even the really fine hairs on my face, which would take so long to find and pluck with traditional tweezer</li>
            <li>I was a little taken aback at first, however the results for it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I tend to have very oily skin, and for me personally, the vibration and high speed spinning of these brushes seems to stimulate oil production with my skin.</li>
            <li>and I even love it just plain!</li>
            <li>The next day I gave it another try, this time I held the skin more taught and it hurt alot less.</li>
            <li>The device is made of a smooth finish plastic that does make it slick when wet but because of its light weight, tapered handle and easy to grip size it is not effected by the slick texture in terms of ease of operation in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with clear instructions for use, maintenance and cleaning, replacing parts, and changing the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally prefer wax to remove hair because is fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am pleasantly surprised by this Braun system.</li>
            <li>After I finished that I was very intrigued by the facial scrubbing attachment and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>After use, my skin felt soft.    </li>
            <li>but it just does not have enough power to spin very well.</li>
            <li>but I just did what felt natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is much brighter now that I have been using it regularly</li>
            <li>I saw that the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 was an answer for cleansing, exfoliating, and hair removal that was tested and approved by dermatologists for sensitive skin, I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 3 babies naturally with no meds.</li>
            <li>The old one was made in France,</li>
            <li>The pain factor was zero, but there was sensation similar to gentle tweezing.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s soft on the skin, I was worried it would be abrasive.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>After simply popping in the battery, you&#x27;re ready to roll.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s so much faster using the Braun Facial Epilator attachment</li>
            <li>I used it on my lip and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and i was quite surprised to find it so.  </li>
            <li>There are 3 positions to the &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch which in my experience, only really effects the direction in which the epilator head spins and does not have an effect on the cleansing head attachment/</li>
            <li>/&gt;The epilator attachment head has a sufficiently narrow target area that is comfortable to use around the lip and chin area without fear of snagging surrounding areas</li>
            <li>but i would worry about using it near my eyes aside from the area between the brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see myself continuing to use the cleansing head daily and giving the epilator a few more chances to see if my skin can handle it.</li>
            <li>With waxing and epilating with other models I experienced red skin for days and when that subsided I would get these tiny little whiteheads all over the area.  </li>
            <li>any hair there or on my upper lip for that matter is very fine with maybe one or two pieces a bit darker than others which are the ones that usually call for some type of beauty treatment aka waxing.</li>
            <li>have long struggled to find a way to easily and relatively painlessly remove unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>that yes, it is possible to catch your skin with the epilator attachment, although this does not happen often and is more likely due to user error than anything.</li>
            <li>It is small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>After using this product for about half a month, it has become less effective.</li>
            <li>at first I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to use it because epilators are so painful, but if you are like me and pays every month for eyebrow and lip waxing, its definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks and the original battery is still working.</li>
            <li>It does not come with its own case or bag, so if you were going to travel with it, it would make sense to buy a small bag for travel purposes, to keep track of the different heads and accessories, and maybe an extra battery.    </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to downplay this product completely because perhaps someone out there was lucky enough to have one built well enough to last.  </li>
            <li>The brush actually spins in either direction (depending on the direction you turn the switch), while the unit gives a steady vibration.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only draw back may be that the retail price of the product is on the higher side</li>
            <li>The facial cleanser brush is gentle and provides a deep down clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I had several in grown hairs along my lip the day after using this, so I would highly recommend exfoliating those areas with finer hairs.</li>
            <li>the most important section, the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush is unfortunately, mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt like sandpaper on my face, though in total disclosure I own a Clarisonic facial brush, so I am hard to please in that area.  </li>
            <li>The facial cleansing brush was a bit too abrasive for my sensitive skin even though the brush has very soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>But to be fair, it has always been difficult for me to fully clean my pores because the stuff that&#x27;s clogging them is sort of hard and has to be squeezed out.</li>
            <li>I was asked as part of a promotional campaign as a Buzzagent to try the new Braun two in one facial eplilator and cleanser.</li>
            <li>-my skin felt smoother, and the dry patches I sometimes have an issue with were being gently sloughed away.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and thought the cleanser brush was soft enough to not cause irritation to my face.</li>
            <li>The epilator feature seems to be what the manufacturer views as the selling point of this product, but after using it regularly for a couple of weeks, I felt that the facial cleansing mode was where this product really performed well.  </li>
            <li>Finer hairs took a few more passes as I expected.</li>
            <li>tested the epilator on my upper lip and eyebrow area, with minimal success.</li>
            <li>The coarse hairs were pulled nicely by the root, whereas the finer hairs seemed to have broken at the skin line.</li>
            <li>and I saw major improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>and I am glad to have one small enough for facial</li>
            <li>I had a lovely red spot above my eyebrow and redness/swelling on my upper lip for a few hours after testing the product.</li>
            <li>CAN EVEN CLEAN UP AROUND MY BROWS.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S SMALL &amp; SO CONVENIENT TO USE.&lt;br /&gt;OH...AND</li>
            <li>It does a nice job of getting all of the little hairs with out breaking them off like waxing has done in the past.</li>
            <li>Oh, the package also includes a snap-on cover for the device, but it&#x27;s only large enough to accomodate the epilator head, not the facial brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush head attachment is a standard round bristle set, nothing special about the texture in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fast and the pain does not last long.</li>
            <li>You barely feel it working, but once you feel the smoothness if your face after, you know it was a job well done.</li>
            <li>It does what it claims to do and is a bit cheaper than similar products that are much more expensive that do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>i do recommend it but not for young kids who may have the facial hair issue.</li>
            <li>and i use natural soaps and all i do is lather it on the brush and use it daily.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for the same device about 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic size for taking care of hair above the upper lip and those stray hairs near the neckline, but you have a few hairs between your eyebrows or above them, the epilator will take care of them so you don&#x27;t have to.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;Provided the device is well maintained, it is a quick solution to mass facial hair removal at home with little to no prep required and satisfactory results.</li>
            <li>It really removes all of the unwanted hairs and even the thin fine ones than most products are unable to remove.</li>
            <li>Normally I am dealing with dry itchy skin on my forehead during this time of year but using the brush part of this product has helped prevent that.</li>
            <li>The epilator solved my facial hair problem since it&#x27;s able to grab and pull the hairs, especially the ones on my chin, something that my other epilator couldn&#x27;t do due to its size (too big).  </li>
            <li>For me this is something you can use while you are traveling and need a small quick fix.</li>
            <li>After using this epilator for the first time I couldn&#x27;t believe how clear my skin looked, goodbye little red dots.</li>
            <li>As it notes in the details above, the package came with the epilator, a cleansing brush attachment, a cover for the epilator, and a small brush to clean it.</li>
            <li>I have used the products epilator function once so far, and the facial cleansing daily.</li>
            <li>As expected it did cause a regular amount of sting but nothing unbearable or unusual.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need two different pieces of equipment to complete my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone, oily, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was a little scared at first to use an epilator.</li>
            <li>My face was a little pink but felt clean.</li>
            <li>I expect a product that costs nearly $100 to work for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I usually get my facial hair removed at a professional spa, using hot wax.</li>
            <li>, however, I don&#x27;t feel like it really cleans deep down in the pores.</li>
            <li>The bottom is flat so it can stand on its own, but because it&#x27;s so thin it gets knocked down easily&lt;</li>
            <li>The bottom is flat so it can stand on its own, but because it&#x27;s so thin it gets knocked down easily&lt;</li>

            <li> mother also tried and loved it!</li>
            <li> Great for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product</li>
            <li> combination of the two tools in one unit make a great pair.</li>
            <li> It is great for getting stray hairs between threading/waxing/plucking sessions as a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; but not for defining.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great pulling the hair around my lips and chin and after one week I still see no traces of hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great idea</li>
            <li> The epilator does a great job on thicker hairs, even if they have just started poking through the surface.</li>
            <li> I received mine in the mail and tried it out, I was happy and relieved.</li>
            <li> Happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still great for putting into my travel case.    </li>
            <li> As i have already mentioned, the result was great.  </li>
            <li> but it is a great investment for your money.</li>
            <li> but he wouldn&#x27;t have it lol.</li>
            <li> The Epilator works great as well.</li>
            <li> Another great feature is that you can take it in the shower with you with the cleansing brush on.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to have.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great idea for the 2-in-1 feature of this product including both the epilator head and brush head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice and has a great eye appeal to it.</li>
            <li> the fact that this is a 2 in one situation makes it THAT MUCH BETTER!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> It is very effective.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t of come at a more perfect time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m kind of a slacker and should be repeating the process at night!.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to plan, warm up wax, try not to spill wax on my face/counter/floor, then try not to remove the hair I do want to keep!</li>
            <li> And ladies, let&#x27;s be honest, ALL hair removal hurts!  </li>
            <li> Gives a great clean finish to my face..  excellent idea.....      </li>
            <li> and they loved it too.</li>
            <li> The device is battery powered which is good for traveling and being on the go.</li>
            <li> I started to tout this product to my friends and loved ones, However...</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, I&#x27;ve used epilators before on my face</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s a good speed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe for use in the shower, which makes it incredibly convenient.</li>
            <li> I received this product through Buzzagent as a promotion campaign for Braun and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Is a good product and i recommend ..</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush head is the perfect size and makes your face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> and  my faces look very cute and good .</li>
            <li> Super awesome.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have been able to try it from bzzagent!!</li>
            <li> I think I am most impressed that it even grabbed the fine hairs as I have an issue even getting tweezers to grip them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can use it in the shower!</li>
            <li> It was even better than a shave!</li>
            <li> okay!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s safe to use in the shower, which also means it&#x27;s cordless!</li>
            <li> It took away 95% of my most troublesome hairs in a matter of minutes!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I first tried it on my arm to see how it felt, and it was indeed plucking hairs at an incredible speed!</li>
            <li> The battery life isn&#x27;t the best, but it just takes AA batteries which most everyone has in their household, and for the convince of this thing, it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> The handle and weight of the device is very comfortable and it feels durable and of good quality.</li>
            <li> It worked great even under the running water and works fine</li>
            <li> I also like that the hair removal lasts for weeks instead of days!&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to try for free as part of a promotion from Braun and am very satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li> so I have been using this amazing product for that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, so I don&#x27;t mind replacing the battery every now</li>
            <li> gave this a 3 star rating because it was good, but not something I am in love with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> The epilator headalso spins either clockwise or counter clockwise, which is really nice, so you dont have to keep switching directions manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m ok with using a pair of tweezers, thread, and a good exfoliating facewash.</li>
            <li> so you kind of get use to it.</li>
            <li> I tested this on my lip and eye brow area and actually really liked the epilator part of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that the epilator runs on an AA battery.</li>
            <li> I love the cleansing brush because it leaves my skin feeling smooth, but what impressed me the most was the epilator.</li>
            <li> There is some kind of pain</li>
            <li> If I were to purchase this product on my own</li>
            <li> and i must say the first look of it was most impressive.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I thought it couldn&#x27;t be doing a very good job, but it was.</li>
            <li> Works really well, fairly painless and is great for those who have reactions to waxing.</li>
            <li> I love this item so much it works wonderfully</li>
            <li> Of course, the brush is very soft and is excellent for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to feel more feminine, have a fuzz-free face, and not have to worry about tweezing all those chin hairs.</li>
            <li> And I am in love it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very fine hair all over my face that look like peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, it is superior performance, better than thread by a margin</li>
            <li> I threw out the packaging after the first time using it since I was so happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So on to the review, the packaging was great, loved that it came with batteries, and not the generic kind.</li>
            <li> I was especially excited because the product is advertised as being good for sensitive skin, like mine.</li>
            <li> so I can’t say if it’s “strong” or not, but it is certainly effective.  </li>
            <li> The epilator bladed rotate in opposite directions catching hold and removing even fine hair which was very impressive.</li>
            <li> It is a nice size, and fits comfortably in the hand while using.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with the  performance of the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> the more you use it</li>
            <li> Until now, i have been waxing at home, but this epilator has saved the day and  does the job BETTER than the home wax kit  </li>
            <li> overall, I would recommend purchasing this product… PS-the included brush is great!!</li>
            <li> but I found it most beneficial to remove unwanted eyebrow hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel refreshed after using this product :]</li>
            <li> I think it just feels like the pain of tweezing, but many hairs at once.</li>
            <li> I received this free as a promotion, but the opinion is honestly mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and the top part of my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> so make sure to test it</li>
            <li> While I love how it worked on my eyebrow area, the epilator is not made for sculpting brows by any means.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have this item</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am really glad that I was chosen for this opportunity.</li>
            <li> I can tell that it is a quality product and even more so with Braun being as the brand.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased.</li>
            <li> So, if you want to try this epilator, be sure to keep your box and receipt for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the compact design,  </li>
            <li> It comes with a top to cover the attachment and a cleaning brush along with the interchangeable head to either use as the cleansing brush or epilator.</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush works better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I immediately inserted the AA battery (included, yay!) and used my favorite cleansing foam.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not big on Epilators, however, this one seems to work best out of any I have tried.</li>
            <li> and I love that it has an epilator attached.</li>
            <li> I am able to take it in the shower without worry of damage, or use it at the sink just as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just looking at it, I want quite sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!and I got it free to test from bzzzagent!</li>
            <li> I would say on a scale of 1-10 the pain when using this was around a 2 for me which is better then</li>
            <li> Am I glad that I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received my Braun epilator courtesy of BzzAgent as part of a promotion by Braun, and it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.</li>
            <li> All in all, the epilator and the package&#x27;s inclusions are fantastic!</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I was chosen because my face has never felt better .......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for travel and only takes one AA battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then I read a suggestion to add your favorite face wash and then use that with the device.</li>
            <li> On the whole the epilator and the cleansing brush duo is a great pack</li>
            <li> After trying both ways I figured out the best way for the epilator to work so that most of my facial hair came out.</li>
            <li> love that you can have it in the shower and the water will not damage or get inside the battery area.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am estastic to have received this item to try and would gladly buy it if I had&#x27;nt and recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> AS YOU AGE, ( SOME OF US :)  </li>
            <li> IS THE BEST THING I HAVE FOUND TO COMBAT THAT PROBLEM, TOTALLY PAINLESS ( FOR ME ) ....</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> my wife love the product and it did the job as described.</li>
            <li> I need it most</li>
            <li> I love that it has a dual head.</li>
            <li> I love the cleanser brush to it</li>
            <li> and i really Love it</li>
            <li> My boyfriend used it and said it was ok.  </li>
            <li> (I know mustaches are trendy right now, but no thank you!)</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVED the epilator the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I love that it is waterproof and how easily the heads can be switched.</li>
            <li> I love that the brush head detaches from the  brush adapter itself for easy cleaning and replacement.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and the results couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and great for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to clean and store after each use.</li>
            <li> With some practice, though, I think I will become more confident and have more success in this area.    </li>
            <li> More importantly, it can not pick up any hair from my forehead and jaws.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love it and see myself using it often as my primary method of hair removal for my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love it and see myself using it often as my primary method of hair removal for my face.</li>
            <li> If you tried a clarisonic before you will not care for the brush, plus I wouldn&#x27;t know where to buy a brush head to replace the old one.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a great products and most important, it works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far happy with the results and more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It is removing more of my makeup and leaving my skin feeling very fresh.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this!</li>
            <li> The product did great on the more coarse hairs on my face like chin and brow.</li>
            <li> The slim design of it makes it easy for me to bring it with me whenever I travel.</li>
            <li> However, it is not made to stand up and will easily tip over, so I end up setting it on it&#x27;s side on the counter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to control where you pluck.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and maneuver over my face.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s portable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have experimented with many different routines for washing and exfoliating my face, without a great deal of luck.</li>
            <li> The option to set which direction the epilator rotates makes it easy to get any where on my face easily.</li>
            <li> - so honest first impression...</li>
            <li> It removed the unwanted hairs easily and accurately without any frustration.</li>
            <li> It did not perform quite as well on the baby fine hairs around my lip and jaw line.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work so well with fine hairs though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the experience rather soothing, and ended up washing for longer than I would have otherwise, which was just fine.</li>
            <li> I love the way the soft brush feels on my face and leaves it clean and bright.</li>
            <li> It gets really fine hair</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what i always needed is really easy to use with excellents results, i actually enjoy this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun epilator and brush for about two weeks now and overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive my first free product to try from BzzAgent.com because theBraun Face Beauty Edition 810 is just the kind of product I have been looking for for cleansing and hair removal.</li>
            <li> though the sound if the machine was a little intimidating the result was wonderful.</li>
            <li> I scrubbed my face and it really exfoliated my skin leaving a nice smooth texture and a glow that i haven&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for superflous facial hair.</li>
            <li> I am happy to have this product so I can improve my facial cleansing</li>
            <li> However, this a genuine review and</li>
            <li> I prefer to use it in the shower with a facial wash and it just feels great, like a massage.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow feature is also great, it definitely holds me over between trips to the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a bit of difficulty with getting to a point where I felt comfortable and in control of the device to the point where I could achieve the look I was going for.  </li>
            <li> After using it my face felt smooth, and that was just after one time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about it is just great.</li>
            <li> I could see a reduced number of blackheads, my skin felt quote smooth, and I wasn&#x27;t covered in skin flakes.</li>
            <li> Once again, the head will spin in either direction depending on the direction you push the switch, which in this case I find more useful than for the brush head.</li>
            <li> any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Bzz Agent and received this product free of charge to try out.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I am still hair free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#got it free from Braun</li>
            <li> It was gentle and effective and the results were immediate.</li>
            <li> I received this product free to test as part of a BzzAgent campaign.</li>
            <li> After using it for a 1.5 week on my acne-prone skin it feels cleaned and smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 from Braun to try for free.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Braun, for such a versatile and great product!</li>
            <li> But after I got the hang of it, I realized I loved the epilator better than a regular tweezer or even an at home wax product.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice quality and effective in not only showing the product, but describes how the product will work as well.    </li>
            <li> I also found that several of the fine hairs I attempted to epilate were not fully removed &amp; experienced a significant amount of breakage.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun epilator to try out from BzzAgent in the mail as part of a promo by Braun &amp; its arrival was highly anticipated as it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time!</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so smooth and clean</li>
            <li> My skin looks so clean and feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> The epilator head and cleansing brush are super easy to interchange.</li>
            <li> The epilator and face scrubber heads are very easy to switch which is also very convenient.</li>
            <li> I received the new Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 for free from Braun to test it and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and gentle to my face and it works really great.</li>
            <li> It was even more gentle than tweezing!  </li>
            <li> I was excited to be chosen to try this out since it was about time to rotate my beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> I was excited when I discovered I would be receiving this product courtesy of Bzzagent.com for review.</li>
            <li> Kinda excited to try this again tomorrow night.</li>
            <li> My advice for first time users is to read the instructions on how to angle the epilator head in relation to the direction of the hair, also the tingling pain sensation lessens the more you use it.</li>
            <li> the go&amp;#34;) and thus find thebattery operation to be even more of a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After receiving this product through a Bzzagent campaign, I was really excited to use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Small and useful, perfect to take when traveling since it runs on battery and takes little space..</li>
            <li> my pores are clean after I use this product and of course I follow up with my toner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The brush head is able to rotate either clockwise or counter clockwise, which is pretty cool in my opinion, and you control the direction with just a flip of the switch.</li>
            <li> I actually get a better result with the brush turned off and just use my own muscle power to move the brush in circles.  </li>
            <li> This particular epilator pulled at a nice speed so that it was over quickly.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try my new epilator from Braun that came with one of those trendy rotating cleansing brushes</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever been able to find an epilator that actually works really well, so I was very pleasantly surprised when this one worked perfectly!  </li>
            <li> With a little practice I am sure I can use it successfully.  </li>
            <li> One feature I had difficulty getting familiar with was the spinning of the epilator-it goes to the left and right, so you can use it in the direction of the hair growth for more effective epilation.  </li>
            <li> Another great tool I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money on....</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised by how much I liked this product.</li>
            <li> It switches direction about a quarter way through a full rotation.</li>
            <li> It continues to work well on the upper lip, so that is good.</li>
            <li> Never liked the makeup removal process before, would skip nights, but this is quite awesome.  </li>
            <li> I feel it really helps your skin look more youthful.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use the facial cleansing brush as part of my daily routine (love love LOVE this feature!), and may give the epilator another try to see if I have better success.</li>
            <li> The little brush that is comes with is nice to clean it with and the cover is nice so that I can throw it in my bag to travel with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product, though the price is justifiable only if you have a significant amount of facial hair that would be pesky to tweeze.</li>
            <li> Together the epilator and the cleansing brush gave a clean and fresh effect.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t break out as quickly in between washings.</li>
            <li> but I actually think this product from Braun is better than the Clarisonic and a better value being</li>
            <li> The facial cleansing brush is my favorite part of the device since I love washing and exfoliating my face.</li>
            <li> As far as the cleansing brush love love love, the bristles are a perfect texture really get deep down and leaves your facing feeling refreshed and revitalized.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly painless, no more so than if you were tweezing, and removes all the hair in the area (even very fine hairs).  </li>
            <li> and I love how this product is versatile and high quality.</li>
            <li> The epilator attachment on this item gets every single hair on my face and I can tell you right now that it is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> If this product had continued to work as well as the very first time I used it, then I would have given it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but as i received the same as a part of a promotion, I am more than happy to use same.</li>
            <li> I experienced far less skin irritation, breakouts, and it&#x27;s very easy and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Good product brush can be a bit harsh on sensitive skin, replicator works great reccomend this product for those who travel and don&#x27;t have much time on their hand&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product has become my new favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li> I really like how easy it is to switch from the brush head to the epilator.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and is used easily in the shower.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I said no way!</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this product the facial cleanser feels great on my skin after I used it for the first time, the only downside about it is the speed of the brush</li>
            <li> I agree with others that the price is a little steep but still a great product based on the handyness and the fact that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li> (considering I have fine &amp; very sparse facial hair in these areas, this was an issue for me), and also noticed that the wand does get mildly warm when using beyond 60-90 seconds.</li>
            <li> And while it makes my skin feel nice for a little while after use, they cause more issues than they solve, for me.</li>
            <li> It’s also much more cost effective than buying the no heat wax strips every few</li>
            <li> – I really liked that I could do my eyebrows as well as facial hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth its money.</li>
            <li> I can see this being useful for bikini line grooming, though that is not a use I saw suggested anywhere in the enclosed manual.  </li>
            <li> It was fun to trial it</li>
            <li> Getting the battery door open was a bit of a struggle, but having a coin handy helped.    </li>
            <li> The brush is a nice extra, but I feel like if someone is going to purchase this, it would be for the epilator.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever write  reviews</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely still need tweezers to shape them, but the epilator did a great job of removing hair between the brows and around the forehead near the brows.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li> Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li> think this is a great purchase for anyone, but definitely for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The above review is my honest opinion of this Braun Epilator.</li>
            <li> I had a 100% success rate with my eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> As far as the facial cleansing is concerned, I have been more than thrilled.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this product through Bzzagent.com from Braun for free because I was lookin for a 2 in 1 device that would help me abtain a healthier, clearer complexion and fight off those stubborn facial hairs.</li>
            <li> and I still feel like my face is freshly scrubbed and cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had about a month with this product and all opinions and experiences are my own and based off of regular and continuous use of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say that the product claims to be safe for sensitive skin and will give the benefit of the doubt that my skin needs a firmer touch</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rotate at all just kind of vibrates, so you don&#x27;t get much scrubbing action.  </li>
            <li> it is totally worth</li>
            <li> Honestly, it worked so well the first time (speaking of the epilator part, not the facial cleansing brush) that I was super excited, ecstatic even, because it worked so efficiently and fast.  </li>
            <li> There are other options with better bristles that feel more exfoliating and cleansing.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun Epilator a week ago and tried right away,</li>
            <li> Yes this hurts but beauty has its price right?</li>
            <li> then packed it right up and drove to UPS.</li>
            <li> I wax my eyebrows and every time i go, the lady asks me if I want to do my upper lip (because apparently i have a mustache lol)</li>
            <li> This felt more like a vibrating facial massage than a true exfoliating clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It would be nice if this had a rechargeable battery, however the fact that it has lasted this long already makes me think it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the added cost of a charger to the retail</li>
            <li> As for the facial cleaning brush, I would have liked one more attachment with a smaller brush to get around the nose area.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t have bought it, but I got it free to try.</li>
            <li> It does the job without being overly abrasive, and used in conjunction with a facial moisturizer, keeps skin looking fresh and healthy.    </li>
            <li> She is 64 years old and can&#x27;t see really well to tweeze or wax and with the epilator she was able to get all the unwanted hair</li>
            <li> Have had this item before and so easy to use and not harsh on the face.</li>
            <li> definitely a product worth trying :)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great that this the the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush has two functions.</li>
            <li> Though its very slim and sleek looking, I did not expect the whole machinery to be to light in weight</li>
            <li> The epilator seem like it was going super fast.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my my lip and it went pretty smooth, I dont really have much there</li>
            <li> The brush is very gentle and the epilator worked well.</li>
            <li> The pain is minimal, just like with waxing, the tool is easy to use and easy to control.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t make any mess.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am thorough on my facial routine, but the Braun was better.</li>
            <li> So - my overall impression... FABULOUSSSS :)</li>
            <li> I may not know exactly what to expect.  </li>
            <li> (product is water resistant for the shower), and that aspect was exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> All you do is use your favorite cleanser and the Braun Facial Epilator</li>
            <li> make sure the product gets deep into your pores.</li>
            <li> so im ok with it because it is only temporary</li>
            <li> for being the first time trying out this product/brand  </li>
            <li> This item has a lot of use, so you&#x27;re really getting the worth for your money.</li>
            <li> , I definitely think it is a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> After just the first use, I could tell that it was making a difference in my grooming routine</li>
            <li> the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I love the facial scrubber attachment.</li>
            <li> The epilator did hurt when I first used it since I was not expecting the pull</li>
            <li> When I first heard that it was an epilator for my face</li>
            <li> Even saying that,  I would have been satisfied with an efficiency that only lasted a year...  </li>
            <li> I appreciated the battery being included!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a first time epilator user, DO NOT test it out before heading out the door for a date or meeting..</li>
            <li> The brush (with water alone) cleaned my face better than facial soap and water.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I love the facial cleaner part!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the facial brush</li>
            <li> as well I found it to be a nice texture not to rough.</li>
            <li> This really hurts!</li>
            <li> Braun Facial Epilator is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> This facial epilator is my favorite of all time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no charging necessary, therefore there are no cords which makes this product even more convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe to use facial brush IN the shower so yet again, adding to the convenience factor!</li>
            <li> Also, this is at the top of my list to take with me next time</li>
            <li> I am in love with the Braun epilator and facial brush!!</li>
            <li> I first used the epilator and</li>
            <li> I love that it includes the batteries, sometimes when I buy something I forget to read if batteries are included and when I get home I have to go back to the store for the batteries.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun epilator courtesy of a promotion by Braun and  BzzAgent, is my first time to use a epilator</li>
            <li> ** to those interested</li>
            <li> , in my opinion, is a facial epilator first and foremost and the dual functionality is more of a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Everywhere I&#x27;ve used it feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> THAT YOU REALLY DON&#x27;T NEED &amp; THEY HURT WITH EVERY PULL !</li>
            <li> I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red or irritated at all.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I used an Epilator.</li>
            <li> makes your face so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> it’s not supposed to), but good for everyday buffing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and leaves my skin feeling clean without causing redness.</li>
            <li> The Braun Facial Epilator and Cleansing Brush is amazing, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spin full and the bristles are a little to soft to get a good foam with my cleanser.</li>
            <li> it does pinch at first but is so worth the final result of bein hair free for weeks</li>
            <li> The hair on my upper lip is also rather fine and the epilator pulled it right out from the root</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush really makes my face feel soft and smooth -</li>
            <li> is the most I have problems with so this really get tiny hairs</li>
            <li> After an hour or so, I applied my regular facial cream and was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No clumsy electrical cords here, battery operated and very convenient!!    </li>
            <li> First off, the cleanser brush is super soft.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first on whether I really knew how to use it.</li>
            <li> When i first received it I really took heed to the packaging it came in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received my Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush courtesy of BzzAgent as a part of promotion from the brando shape them, but the epilator did a great job of removing hair between the brows and around the forehead near the brows.</li>
            <li> At first touch, the bristles are very soft and smooth and not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to describe with words, so the manual&#x27;s diagrams does a pretty good job.)    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a mini facial everyday, its gentle yet effective to make sure your skin is being gently exfoliated of the impurities.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now for those of you who are super sensitive to pain, be mindful that this unit removes the hair from your body as with tweezers, so there is a bit of pain involved.</li>
            <li> But be sure to use a moisturizer after using the scrubber; you don&#x27;t want to acquire any dry</li>
            <li> (Strongly suggest cleaning with witch hazel or similar product to alleviate)</li>
            <li> The facial cleansing head was more gentle than the scrub I normally use</li>
            <li> It is not really painful but more of a uncomfortable pinching sensation that I found the more I used it that it went away.</li>
            <li> My skin actually felt clean after the first use.</li>
            <li> I was so happy that the only time I had any redness with the Epilator was after the very first use, and it was completely gone within a few hours.</li>
            <li> con straight out of the package is the AA battery.</li>
            <li> maybe it’s supposed to really get at it.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is really gentle</li>
            <li> I really like this product because I know I don&#x27;t have any residue makeup still on my face</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> And the face scrubber worked really well.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the brush daily for a few weeks now and feel like my face is getting so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have tried it with a few different types of face soap and personally think the brush works the best with a foaming face wash.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I hope this is helpful for anyone who wants to buy this product.</li>
            <li> It worked really well</li>
            <li> I received the Braun facial epilator and cleansing brush free from Bzzagent to try out.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will not cost me much in batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason I say this is because I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> However, it is not noticeable unless you look very closely.</li>
            <li> The epilator did not seem to do much for these types of hairs so if you have a problem with this, you will need to stick to threading/waxing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the brush, it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I had to keep going over hairs repeatedly, and even after many tries, the epilator was still not getting them.  </li>
            <li> it removed hair efficiently and fast.  </li>
            <li> So let me first say that I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and am not particularly sensitive to pain, with most beauty is pain</li>
            <li> really fast!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> works really well</li>
            <li> so much $$ going to the salon for my eyebrow &amp; lip de-fuzzing.</li>
            <li> The epilator head/attachment comes with a convenient cover, but it would be fantastic if the product came with a traveling pouch or case for the facial brush attachment as well.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Facial Epilator and Cleaning Brush 2-in-1 from Braun to try for FREE through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the product as a whole.</li>
            <li> I have seen results but not as much as i would like</li>
            <li> I find when I get it to my face that it really does not do anything for it.</li>
            <li> a light touch is all that&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth after using it because it scrubs away the dirt/makeup above the pores, but I can see that there are still impurities deeper in the pores.</li>
            <li> brush does a great job at exfoliating my face without irritating it.</li>
            <li> brush head is unbelievably gentle.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really find that to be a issue</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much someone says it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and how much you want the hair removed I would think twice about this product.</li>
            <li> But after much research and reading the reviews on this site, I decided to give epilation another try.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to realize that this thing doesn&#x27;t whir and buzz fast.</li>
            <li> My face is always much smoother after using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product several times now, and I have to say that if I wouldn&#x27;t have receive this for free I would have bought it myself.  </li>
            <li> It has been a day since I did this whole cleansing routine</li>
            <li> My face just feels so much softer and it feels cleaner.</li>
            <li> and it just felt like plucking but much faster.</li>
            <li> This device is not the quietest method of hair removal and thus is not 100% discreet, but it is a volume that is possible to mask the sound with running</li>
            <li> but the oscillation seems to also be effected by the amount of pressure applied to the cleaning surface which in my opinion, shouldn&#x27;t alter the performance of this feature as it allows for too much user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the end I enjoy having this device for facial hair removal but would not invest the ~$80 for it.</li>
            <li> but it really is.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit comfortably in your hand and easy to switch heads on.</li>
            <li> So first off, a huge thank you to Bzz Agent for allowing me to give my unbiased review of Braun&#x27;s new facial epilator, the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The little cleaning brush is great for cleaning the epilator head, though I wish it had some kind of carrying case so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the brush getting dirty and then contaminating the epilator when I clean it.</li>
            <li> I guess my cleansing routine is NOW complete!!!    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to store and instead of having two different devices, you only have one.</li>
            <li> I was so excited because I wanted to get a facial cleanser for a while now</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive it because I was looking to purchase similar products for the holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators in the past some were better than others but most recently have just been sticking with waxing.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to wash my face a second time to get it really clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I really like that this one is small and fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling wonderfully clean.</li>
            <li> After I finished the epilation process, I used Giovanni Facial Cleansing Towelettes, Unscented, to clean and soothe my skin.</li>
            <li> I personally use the brush while in the shower just to use the soap and clean my face.</li>
            <li> As a woman with fair skin and dark hair, facial hair has always been a concern of mine.    </li>
            <li> I just feel as if Braun could sell their facial epilator device on its own and leave the facial brush to another product as this one does seem as if it is powerful enough forthat use</li>
            <li> Someone, finally, got it right!</li>
            <li> It comes packaged nicely and includes the epilator attachment, the exfoliating brush attachment, a small cleaning brush, a cap that will cover the epilator attachment, and a AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try the Braun epilator and cleansing brush because it was something new and different for me.  </li>
            <li> Having all those unwanted hairs removed in less than 5 minutes with ease,  sure beat spending 30 minutes plucking to perfection with concentrated effort.  </li>
            <li> Love the way both make my skin feel, especially not having to use the eplilator daily!</li>
            <li> At the price of this item it is very comparable to those $150 worth facial cleansing brush out there.</li>
            <li> It definitely pulled the more coarse of the hairs immediately.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn&#x27;t JUST an epilator, its a fantastic facial cleansing brush!!</li>
            <li> Facial creams and makeup seem to be working better since there is no facial</li>
            <li> It seems that I can &amp;#34;home in&amp;#34; on specific facial hairs, and I end up feeling it is more efficient than epilators that try for a broader swath of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mainly used the epilator around my eyebrows which is were</li>
            <li> The greatest part about it is that I was able to run it along my chin and feel each of those nasty hairs being removed, including the ones that I normally would have missed while tweezing and then saw in my reflection in the car, etc while without tweezers ::</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product and I will definitely be recommending it down the line to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft, almost dewlike!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the price tag looks high initially, I think it is well worth</li>
            <li> Exfoliating was gentle not harsh.  </li>
            <li> It will probably be a sometimes tool, not an everyday favorite.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I had to go over a few areas with the epilator more than once to maximize removal</li>
            <li> I did use this product for a few weeks to get enough information for my review and after my trial period, I&#x27;m very satisfied with how this product works.</li>
            <li> Cleansing brush should be replace every 3 months but that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> but since the hair was pretty thin it just kind of glided through.</li>
            <li> I normally have one or two coarser hairs on my chin</li>
            <li> It just seems the motor isn&#x27;t powerful enough to move the brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been good at keeping up with plucking, waxing, or using remover creams because my skin would react so poorly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, about the facial cleanser - I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these, but they are pretty pricey on their own from other brands, so I hadn&#x27;t tried one prior to this one.</li>
            <li> The battery held up pretty well and did not loose power</li>
            <li> The head can be switched to rotate left or right depending on which way the hair grows so you don&#x27;t have to twist your hand around to get everywhere</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind stocking up on batteries and are looking for an accessible and quick at home solution to facial hair removal the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I received this product free of charge as part of a testing campaign through Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> The brush head was suuuper soft, and left my face noticeably cleaner &amp; smoother after just the first use!</li>
            <li> It seemed a little scratchy on the more sensitive parts of my face.</li>
            <li> and after a week now I still don&#x27;t feel or see any new hairs.</li>
            <li> The Epilator part was new to me</li>
            <li> but the effectiveness of this new design is an improvement.  </li>
            <li> and I tried new batteries and still did not work</li>
            <li> As someone who has been thinking about laser hair removal and other more expensive options for the hair on my upper lip, this product is great for that.</li>
            <li> The base is a nice size and fits into my hand nicely.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft</li>
            <li> and it definitely makes me cringe thinking about how much I spent on this produce that could have been amazing if it only had lasted a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> I had used my facial cleanser first and then the Braun.</li>
            <li> I used the epilator attachment first removing any unwanted hair from my upper lip and</li>
            <li> I love that instead of two different products, all I have to do is change the attachment from one to the other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic size for taking care of hair above the upper lip and those stray hairs near the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it because I have to learn how to use it better</li>
            <li> What was really special about this new product is that it also has a facial scrubbing option where it has a facial scrubbing brush attachment.</li>
            <li> but seriously that was not what I had expected or had ever experienced with any others.</li>
            <li> The Epilator picks up even the really fine hairs on my face, which would take so long to find and pluck with traditional tweezer</li>
            <li> I was a little taken aback at first, however the results for it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I tend to have very oily skin, and for me personally, the vibration and high speed spinning of these brushes seems to stimulate oil production with my skin.</li>
            <li> and I even love it just plain!</li>
            <li> The next day I gave it another try, this time I held the skin more taught and it hurt alot less.</li>
            <li> The device is made of a smooth finish plastic that does make it slick when wet but because of its light weight, tapered handle and easy to grip size it is not effected by the slick texture in terms of ease of operation in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with clear instructions for use, maintenance and cleaning, replacing parts, and changing the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally prefer wax to remove hair because is fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am pleasantly surprised by this Braun system.</li>
            <li> After I finished that I was very intrigued by the facial scrubbing attachment and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> After use, my skin felt soft.    </li>
            <li> but it just does not have enough power to spin very well.</li>
            <li> but I just did what felt natural.</li>
            <li> My skin is much brighter now that I have been using it regularly</li>
            <li> I saw that the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 was an answer for cleansing, exfoliating, and hair removal that was tested and approved by dermatologists for sensitive skin, I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 babies naturally with no meds.</li>
            <li> The old one was made in France,</li>
            <li> The pain factor was zero, but there was sensation similar to gentle tweezing.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s soft on the skin, I was worried it would be abrasive.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> After simply popping in the battery, you&#x27;re ready to roll.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s so much faster using the Braun Facial Epilator attachment</li>
            <li> I used it on my lip and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and i was quite surprised to find it so.  </li>
            <li> There are 3 positions to the &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch which in my experience, only really effects the direction in which the epilator head spins and does not have an effect on the cleansing head attachment/</li>
            <li> /&gt;The epilator attachment head has a sufficiently narrow target area that is comfortable to use around the lip and chin area without fear of snagging surrounding areas</li>
            <li> but i would worry about using it near my eyes aside from the area between the brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see myself continuing to use the cleansing head daily and giving the epilator a few more chances to see if my skin can handle it.</li>
            <li> With waxing and epilating with other models I experienced red skin for days and when that subsided I would get these tiny little whiteheads all over the area.  </li>
            <li> any hair there or on my upper lip for that matter is very fine with maybe one or two pieces a bit darker than others which are the ones that usually call for some type of beauty treatment aka waxing.</li>
            <li> have long struggled to find a way to easily and relatively painlessly remove unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li> that yes, it is possible to catch your skin with the epilator attachment, although this does not happen often and is more likely due to user error than anything.</li>
            <li> It is small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about half a month, it has become less effective.</li>
            <li> at first I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to use it because epilators are so painful, but if you are like me and pays every month for eyebrow and lip waxing, its definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and the original battery is still working.</li>
            <li> It does not come with its own case or bag, so if you were going to travel with it, it would make sense to buy a small bag for travel purposes, to keep track of the different heads and accessories, and maybe an extra battery.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to downplay this product completely because perhaps someone out there was lucky enough to have one built well enough to last.  </li>
            <li> The brush actually spins in either direction (depending on the direction you turn the switch), while the unit gives a steady vibration.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only draw back may be that the retail price of the product is on the higher side</li>
            <li> The facial cleanser brush is gentle and provides a deep down clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I had several in grown hairs along my lip the day after using this, so I would highly recommend exfoliating those areas with finer hairs.</li>
            <li> the most important section, the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush is unfortunately, mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt like sandpaper on my face, though in total disclosure I own a Clarisonic facial brush, so I am hard to please in that area.  </li>
            <li> The facial cleansing brush was a bit too abrasive for my sensitive skin even though the brush has very soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> But to be fair, it has always been difficult for me to fully clean my pores because the stuff that&#x27;s clogging them is sort of hard and has to be squeezed out.</li>
            <li> I was asked as part of a promotional campaign as a Buzzagent to try the new Braun two in one facial eplilator and cleanser.</li>
            <li> -my skin felt smoother, and the dry patches I sometimes have an issue with were being gently sloughed away.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and thought the cleanser brush was soft enough to not cause irritation to my face.</li>
            <li> The epilator feature seems to be what the manufacturer views as the selling point of this product, but after using it regularly for a couple of weeks, I felt that the facial cleansing mode was where this product really performed well.  </li>
            <li> Finer hairs took a few more passes as I expected.</li>
            <li> tested the epilator on my upper lip and eyebrow area, with minimal success.</li>
            <li> The coarse hairs were pulled nicely by the root, whereas the finer hairs seemed to have broken at the skin line.</li>
            <li> and I saw major improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> and I am glad to have one small enough for facial</li>
            <li> I had a lovely red spot above my eyebrow and redness/swelling on my upper lip for a few hours after testing the product.</li>
            <li> CAN EVEN CLEAN UP AROUND MY BROWS.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S SMALL &amp; SO CONVENIENT TO USE.&lt;br /&gt;OH...AND</li>
            <li> It does a nice job of getting all of the little hairs with out breaking them off like waxing has done in the past.</li>
            <li> Oh, the package also includes a snap-on cover for the device, but it&#x27;s only large enough to accomodate the epilator head, not the facial brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush head attachment is a standard round bristle set, nothing special about the texture in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fast and the pain does not last long.</li>
            <li> You barely feel it working, but once you feel the smoothness if your face after, you know it was a job well done.</li>
            <li> It does what it claims to do and is a bit cheaper than similar products that are much more expensive that do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> i do recommend it but not for young kids who may have the facial hair issue.</li>
            <li> and i use natural soaps and all i do is lather it on the brush and use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same device about 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic size for taking care of hair above the upper lip and those stray hairs near the neckline, but you have a few hairs between your eyebrows or above them, the epilator will take care of them so you don&#x27;t have to.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Provided the device is well maintained, it is a quick solution to mass facial hair removal at home with little to no prep required and satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> It really removes all of the unwanted hairs and even the thin fine ones than most products are unable to remove.</li>
            <li> Normally I am dealing with dry itchy skin on my forehead during this time of year but using the brush part of this product has helped prevent that.</li>
            <li> The epilator solved my facial hair problem since it&#x27;s able to grab and pull the hairs, especially the ones on my chin, something that my other epilator couldn&#x27;t do due to its size (too big).  </li>
            <li> For me this is something you can use while you are traveling and need a small quick fix.</li>
            <li> After using this epilator for the first time I couldn&#x27;t believe how clear my skin looked, goodbye little red dots.</li>
            <li> As it notes in the details above, the package came with the epilator, a cleansing brush attachment, a cover for the epilator, and a small brush to clean it.</li>
            <li> I have used the products epilator function once so far, and the facial cleansing daily.</li>
            <li> As expected it did cause a regular amount of sting but nothing unbearable or unusual.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need two different pieces of equipment to complete my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone, oily, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared at first to use an epilator.</li>
            <li> My face was a little pink but felt clean.</li>
            <li> I expect a product that costs nearly $100 to work for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I usually get my facial hair removed at a professional spa, using hot wax.</li>
            <li> , however, I don&#x27;t feel like it really cleans deep down in the pores.</li>
            <li> The bottom is flat so it can stand on its own, but because it&#x27;s so thin it gets knocked down easily&lt;</li>
            <li> The bottom is flat so it can stand on its own, but because it&#x27;s so thin it gets knocked down easily&lt;</li>
            <li> Regardless, I like that the brush doesn&#x27;t rotate completely like other facial brushes.</li>
            <li> Washed the brush w soap and little water and its new again!</li>
            <li> A little price-y in my opinion, but if you&#x27;re someone that likes to manage their facial hair, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than constantly going to the salon for touch-ups and a lot more convenient than slowly plucking every single hair to perfection.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and was very careful with following the enclosed instructions TO THE LETTER.</li>
            <li> I also think the price point for this is a little high.</li>
            <li> is a little high considering additional battery cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or if my skin is just too sensitive, but in the week following application of the product my upper lip was a little red and I got tiny bumps in the hair follicles.</li>
            <li> not only because I have very sensitive skin, but because my hair is very dark and coarse.</li>
            <li> My chin wasn&#x27;t as painful and seemed to go pretty smoothly and all the peach fuzz was soon gone.</li>
            <li> I have had to change the batteries twice in a month long period with frequent use, which seems extremely highfor a device such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I could send it back, but its been too long</li>
            <li> Batteries do not last long enought</li>
            <li> (I have a pretty hairy chin and thick eyebrows).</li>
            <li> The epilator was a little painful at first but has left my face free of hair for a week!</li>
            <li> Overall it does what it claims to do, I always have a little trouble the first couple of passes as the epilator just seems to break the hair versus pull it from the root which means I have to try to go over it leaving red spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little confusing otherwise, but there are detailed explanations and diagrams that help explain everything.</li>
            <li> this product does hurt a little ill be honest.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received it I rushed to use it starting first on my upper lip,  which again has been waxed for the last 6 months approximately 1 a month and by</li>
            <li> your visits to a salon are less frequent.</li>
            <li> I have not had the item long enough to comment on how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> My only very slight wish is that it came with a travel case, but it&#x27;s so small that I&#x27;m sure I wouldn&#x27;t have trouble finding one.</li>
            <li> I have used Epilators and Facial Cleansing Brushes in the past with little success.</li>
            <li> At first, I did have a little trouble with it because I haven&#x27;t used an Epilator in a really long time (especially not on my face).</li>
            <li> Only one AA battery needed, which it comes with, so no having to rummage around in your junk drawer for a loose AA</li>
            <li> The brush was little too harsh/rough for my sensitive</li>
            <li> I am still using this product and will continue to use this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> It will save you money in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it first on my upper lip (which I usually wax at home) and was done within a few minutes, including the time it took me to figure out which way to spin it.</li>
            <li> Next I tried it on my eyebrow area, being careful not to get too close to my eyebrows and it worked like a charm there too.</li>
            <li> It is unclear how long this device will hold up, but may be a cheaper alternative to purchasing wax strips if maintained for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I had less success getting all the little hairs the 2nd time I tried and accidentally epilated off half an eyebrow (yikes!)</li>
            <li> The only drawback was the next day my chin was slightly broke-out where I had used the epilator.</li>
            <li> The head is small enough still that you can be pretty precise for small or difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only other thing I would add to this product is some type of stand/holder.</li>
            <li> I chose Braun facial epilator after weeks of web search and other users&#x27; reviews.</li>
            <li> generally tweeze my unwanted facial hair because it&#x27;s more convenient and less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> It takes very long to epilate with this device.</li>
            <li> There was no redness or irritation on either area immediate after, but did notice a few hours later that there was redness on my upper lip that lasted 3 days.</li>
            <li> Bottom line not a great product for me when waxing last so much longer with no complications.  </li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s not intended for shaping the eyebrows, but you have a few hairs between your eyebrows or above them, the epilator will take care of them so you don&#x27;t need to crane your neck in front of the mirror while trying to tweeze them individually.    </li>
            <li> Actually, it just goes slow, and if you press it against your skin, it will nearly stop.</li>
            <li> It removed every single piece of hair in my face without the waxing.</li>
            <li> on a single battery (included in packaging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush seems to perform roughly the same as any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> For areas like the upper lip, where the goal is simply to remove all hair and precision is not as much of an issue, it does the job well, and is not overly uncomfortable (though it is an epilator-it isn&#x27;t pain-free).  </li>
            <li> I am curious, however, to see how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> At first I was somewhat confused on how the epilator worked and</li>
            <li> only con that I see for these items is that the battery is not rechargeable, however, the price for the bundle is a steal... usually the facial cleanser brush sells for $100 on</li>
            <li> Previously, I was usuing another facial epilator from Panasonic for almost 8 years</li>
            <li> It looks slightly like the head of a personal grooming shaver, except I couldn&#x27;t see any blades.</li>
            <li> The brush head also spins in different directions and has a slight vibration to it.</li>
            <li> so I found that subsequent times I used it the stinging has become less noticeable.</li>
            <li> A little &#x27;bite&#x27; is present when using on upper lip, but hold skin tight to reduce that.</li>
            <li> It is a nifty little gadget, which serves as both a facial cleanser and epilator, via interchangeable heads.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially tweezing one little hair at a time and pulling it out using a rotating tweezer.</li>
            <li> All I have to do is add a little facial wash and flip the switch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a lot of little slit openings around the head, and they actually open and close, plucking out hairs as they go.</li>
            <li> The package includes a battery, the epilator, a facial brush, and a little epilator cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> never used an electric epilator prior to this product, so I was a little scared when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> (I could literally see the root on nearly all the hairs that were pulled) with hardly any breakage.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a secondary brush to clean the epilator head and a cap to keep the head protected from dust and other little particles that could get into the small crevices.</li>
            <li> After subsequent uses, it did not work as well, leaving difficult hairs and making the whole processes time consuming again..  </li>
            <li> It also made fast work of eye brow hairs, though I would not recommend it for sculpting your brows as the precision is not really great for that.</li>
            <li> Personally, I had trouble using it for shaping my brows-</li>
            <li> I also noticed a lot of my pores closed up.</li>
            <li> That should be expected, but after awhile you become desensitized to it.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t exfoliate, my skin is rough and filmy.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about the device getting wet, either.</li>
            <li> but it is very easy to use and much less painful than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Though it is a little pricey, it is comparable with other facial cleansers and epilators on the market, and has the added bonus of being both!</li>
            <li> SMALL, SO YOU CAN JUST GET THOSE FEW LITTLE ONES THAT POP UP, OTHERS I HAVE TRIED TAKES A LARGE AREA</li>
            <li> I also ended up with a few hives due to sensitivity, which I didn&#x27;t expect.. total bummer!</li>
            <li> The epilator is slightly painful on sensitive areas of the face but it is very efficient in removing the hair so you don&#x27;t have to put up with the pain for long.</li>
            <li> that at least sounds reasonable for the price, but this took less than three uses to be not effective, and that is simply not acceptable.  </li>
            <li> I have very little facial hair and not much eyebrows to speak of</li>
            <li> I did have to pluck a couple of hairs in my upper lip but not a big problem at least I do not have to pluck all of them, which can be a little more painful than using this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As to the epilator, the first time I tried it, I did expect a bit of pain and it was quite painful since my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> and I end up having to just blindly pluck until I get lucky and get the beastly little hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small enough to fit in a bag and since it has two functions, I&#x27;m cutting down on the devices I would otherwise bring.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say the first time I used it there was no sting - there was but not near as bad as using tweezers or waxes which seem to cause red irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s comparable to other hair removal tools.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun epilator courtesy of BzzAgent as part of a promotion by Braun, The epilator has a relatively small head since it&#x27;s intended for facial use.</li>
            <li> The facial brush is small and I always use it</li>
            <li> If the price point of this ever drops to about $20, I&#x27;m in, other than that</li>
            <li> For me that was a no go going forward no more upper lip with this thing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a other solution.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with other epilators pinching my skin but this one has yet to do so.</li>
            <li> my other epilator which is around a 5.</li>
            <li> The epilator has a relatively small head since it&#x27;s intended for facial use.</li>
            <li> :  Let me just start by saying that you could take it anywhere  due to its size and the fact that is cordless.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bring a mirror like the other model (830)  </li>
            <li> so I was skeptical before my first use.</li>
            <li> Additionally, as with any other hair removal method in which hair is pulled from the source, it is advised that the user cleans the area thoroughly after in order to reduce the chance of developing any &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; or pimples.</li>
            <li> Not quite rough enough to scrub hard (I know,</li>
            <li> The epilator even pulled out the stubborn hairs that regular tweezers often left behind.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes a few times to get all of the hairs and it makes your skin a little red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I especially have a hard time keeping my chin hairless and this did the trick.</li>
            <li> So now, its almost not worth to have it  </li>
            <li> I understand this is a complication that is common with facial epilation</li>
            <li> and I attempted to continue use and exfoliate to allow the hair to grow through the skin, but unfortunately it still causes painful blemishes on some more sensitive areas like the cheek and jawline.</li>
            <li> And the result was not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> Also, the smaller area seems to mean it hurts less when I do a lot of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I poured a small amount of cleanser on to the brush and must confess that a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have waxed and tweezed but have found that this product takes much less time.</li>
            <li> Taking an ibuprofen or tylenol about half an hour before use may help with the pain and irritation.    </li>
            <li> The price could be slightly lower, but look at what you would pay for both these items separately.</li>
            <li> My face needed a serious thorough deep cleaning and this does the job.</li>
            <li> I must say at first I was afraid that it would hurt to use the epilator</li>
            <li> Once I used the Epilator a few times, there was less regrowth, and a lot less</li>
            <li> and I was prepared for a little pain (as in waxing).</li>
            <li> For me, the epilation feature was a little tricky to master.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still have to get your eyebrows waxed or threaded or whatever you prefer, but this little do-dad will make it so</li>
            <li> approximately it&#x27;s usually a little over a month...</li>
            <li> As with any Epilator, it will cause a little discomfort till you get use to using it.</li>
            <li> The brush could have been a little softer too.</li>
            <li> but once it starts to spin, they can feel a little rougher, so</li>
            <li> Ehhh I think it could stand to be a little cheaper, but we&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ehhh I think it could stand to be a little cheaper, but we&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this might just take a little practice.</li>
            <li> LITTLE HAIRS ON YOUR CHIN.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the brush to be rather coarse and it felt a bit irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Just enough abrasion to scrub away the dirt and oil without irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face without a harsh feeling</li>
            <li> a few hairs I found lingering around my face.</li>
            <li> It felt like I was tweezing but not with harsh pain.</li>
            <li> use it a few days before</li>
            <li> After my face was rinsed and dried, I could feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li> just a few minutes after I finish and put moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li> I thought the battery it came with was dead.</li>
            <li> It was wasy to understand and was assembled in a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the battery factor.</li>
            <li> but i could still feel the brush scrub away the dirt and dead skin left behind after the hair removal.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can compare this device to is threading, but that can be expensive and it may be difficult to find someone in your area who specializes in that particular</li>
            <li> But it went really well, and it is A LOT less painful than I remeber.</li>
            <li> Honestly this was a bit painful but in line with other epilators not more or less painful just be prepared if you have never used one.</li>
            <li> The revolving tweezers are painful at first</li>
            <li> The first time using it is painful.</li>
            <li> the box, you get the base, epilator head, brush head, small brush to clean epilator, and cover for epilator head.</li>
            <li> If I do, it&#x27;s raw and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more messy wax and no more waiting in line for wax or threading.</li>
            <li> But no more than tweezing.</li>
            <li> the head of the epilator is small</li>
            <li> so I usually feel like my pores are clogged even after one wash.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I had a Clarisonic in the past</li>
            <li> Its not an uncomfortable amount of heat, but it is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Of course there was some pain, but no more than waxing or tweezing.</li>
            <li> so I was not really able to compare it to anything else.</li>
            <li> The box contains the epilator with exfoliating brush and a small epilator cleaning brush, also a lid for the epilator.</li>
            <li> little painful on sensitive areas</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only one other experience with one and it was painful.</li>
            <li> Now with that being said not sure that I would buy it just for the cleansing brush, I mean there are a ton on the market, of which I&#x27;ve tried at least 2 that I can recall and this one is comparable.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I could hardly wait to epilate my face.</li>
            <li> The directions are slightly confusing</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a facial epilator, and this one does the job well.</li>
            <li> its not amazing</li>
            <li> but this one does not even compare because it is so slow.</li>
            <li> It is quite slow as the heads go around.</li>
            <li> , I always decline because it KILLS me to have to spend 10 bucks to rip out a few hairs!!</li>
            <li> As far as the cleansing brush I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The problem with tweezing for me though is that I tend to get thick hairs on the bottom of my chin and they are very hard to see</li>
            <li> the micro-oscillation feels weak in comparison to competitors.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about using it because I was fearful of pain from previous epilators I have used in the past</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I felt the bristles were tough, I tried the brush with some exfoliating bath wash on my knees and elbows.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was unable to uproot a few of my above-the-lip hairs, but tweezing 2-3 isn&#x27;t a biggie.</li>
            <li> As expected, the hair removal process is slightly to moderately painful and does induce redness.</li>
            <li> in all, I think this brush/epilator has been a game changer for my face</li>
            <li> You either get used to it or it just gets finer and less painful.</li>
            <li> , it is a little bit painful but beauty is pain</li>
            <li> However, this product is not ideal for styling the eyebrow, just for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> When I received this one I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> Therefore, you don&#x27;t have to position your arms in a weird uncomfortable way.</li>
            <li> and I know that I didn&#x27;t randomly miss one hair that&#x27;ll now stick out.</li>
            <li> function is mediocre</li>
            <li> This provides portability but requires the user to stock up on batteries which are expensive and wasteful.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of baby hairs that are annoying on my face and sometimes waxing is just to cumbersome and messy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s absolutely less painful than waxing!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had a bad reaction to the epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that the motor may be defective.</li>
            <li> I was so afraid to touch it to my face</li>
            <li> ..very painful, and has a tendency to break them as well.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t painful at all.</li>
            <li> however I did find it painful as a beginner with epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was so disappointed considering the price of this item.</li>
            <li> I really hate clutter</li>
            <li> but its very painful</li>
            <li> I got three weeks ago, but I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have to give the Braun 810 a 4 star though because I am very disappointed in the face brush attachment.  </li>
            <li> but this was awful!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does the same job as the inexpensive epilators.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared at first to use an epilator. I&#x27;ve only one other experience with one and it was painful. I gave the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleanser a try on my eyebrows and was amazed. It was even more gentle than tweezing!  It&#x27;s great for superflous facial hair. The facial cleansing head was more gentle than the scrub I normally use and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how well it works. You barely feel it working, but once you feel the smoothness if your face after, you know it was a job well done. I had used my facial cleanser first and then the Braun. I feel like I am thorough on my facial routine, but the Braun was better. I hadn&#x27;t worn makeup that day, but the Braun Facial Cleansing head removed makeup. I am happy to have this product so I can improve my facial cleansing routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product as a promotion from the brand. However, this a genuine review and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!</li>
            <li> I received this product through a Bzzagent.com campaign.&lt;br /&gt;I am not usually a big fan of epilators. When I received this one I was a bit skeptical. It comes packaged nicely and includes the epilator attachment, the exfoliating brush attachment, a small cleaning brush, a cap that will cover the epilator attachment, and a AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;First con straight out of the package is the AA battery. I am personally only planning on using the epilator and not the scrub brush (I will explain below) but if I were planning on using the brush on a regular basis, I would definitely prefer to have a rechargeable unit. I have not had the item long enough to comment on how long the battery lasts. But it is something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator works quite well. It is a nice size, and fits comfortably in the hand while using. I have an issue with course hairs growing along my chin. The epilator took care of those wonderfully. Of course there was some pain. But no more than tweezing. This particular epilator pulled at a nice speed so that it was over quickly. It also made fast work of eye brow hairs, though I would not recommend it for sculpting your brows as the precision is not really great for that. The product did great on the more coarse hairs on my face like chin and brow. It pulled even the hairs that had just started to grow back from a recent tweezing. It did not perform quite as well on the baby fine hairs around my lip and jaw line. The coarse hairs were pulled nicely by the root, whereas the finer hairs seemed to have broken at the skin line. I had several in grown hairs along my lip the day after using this, so I would highly recommend exfoliating those areas with finer hairs. I think I am most impressed that it even grabbed the fine hairs as I have an issue even getting tweezers to grip them. The only thing that had every worked is threading. ..very painful, and has a tendency to break them as well. I used the product over a week ago and still see no signs of needing to use it again yet.  Overall I am very happy with the  performance of the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the facial exfoliating brushes. I tend to have very oily skin, and for me personally, the vibration and high speed spinning of these brushes seems to stimulate oil production with my skin. And while it makes my skin feel nice for a little while after use, they cause more issues than they solve, for me. I did try it out just for this review. This brush seems to perform roughly the same as any other I have tried. There is nothing that sets it apart. There are other options with better bristles that feel more exfoliating and cleansing. This felt more like a vibrating facial massage than a true exfoliating clean.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this as an epilator to friends and family, though I don&#x27;t believe the scrub brush adds anything to the product.</li>
            <li> Update, this thing kills batteries if left in it overnight. Junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally tweeze my unwanted facial hair because it&#x27;s more convenient and less painful than waxing. The problem with tweezing for me though is that I tend to get thick hairs on the bottom of my chin and they are very hard to see and I end up having to just blindly pluck until I get lucky and get the beastly little hair. I was super excited to try my new epilator from Braun that came with one of those trendy rotating cleansing brushes (we&#x27;ll get to that gem later in the review)! Okay - so honest first impression... ouch... it does hurt a bit, BUT you get used to the feeling the more you use it and it&#x27;s absolutely less painful than waxing!! The greatest part about it is that I was able to run it along my chin and feel each of those nasty hairs being removed, including the ones that I normally would have missed while tweezing and then saw in my reflection in the car, etc while without tweezers ::horror::!! I also used it on my mustache (I know mustaches are trendy right now, but no thank you!) and after a week now I still don&#x27;t feel or see any new hairs. So - my overall impression... FABULOUSSSS :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the facial cleanser - I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these, but they are pretty pricey on their own from other brands, so I hadn&#x27;t tried one prior to this one. I LOVE IT! I prefer to use it in the shower with a facial wash and it just feels great, like a massage. It makes my face feel so smooth and clean and I&#x27;m convinced that my pores have shrunk since I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I see for these items is that the battery is not rechargeable, however, the price for the bundle is a steal... usually the facial cleanser brush sells for $100 on it&#x27;s own, so I don&#x27;t mind replacing the battery every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying these to give out for gifts for my family this year for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my BRAUN FACE BEAUTY EDITION 810 as a promotional item from BzzAgent to use and review.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a way to eliminate facial hair that didn&#x27;t require a daily regiment. I was asked as part of a promotional campaign as a Buzzagent to try the new Braun two in one facial eplilator and cleanser. It couldn&#x27;t of come at a more perfect time. I have been using it for almost three weeks, let me correct that, I haven&#x27;t had to use the eplilator every day, but have used the cleansing brush daily. Love the way both make my skin feel, especially not having to use the eplilator daily! I have noticed that after using the eplilator once on my upper lip, the hair growth has been virtually nonexistent. Additionally, I can use it on the go, even in the shower! Thanks Braun, for such a versatile and great product! Someone, finally, got it right!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush from Braun and BzzAgent to try for free.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVED the epilator the first time I used it – I really liked that I could do my eyebrows as well as facial hair.  I have very little facial hair and not much eyebrows to speak of so I can’t say if it’s “strong” or not, but it is certainly effective.  I had less success getting all the little hairs the 2nd time I tried and accidentally epilated off half an eyebrow (yikes!), so I haven’t tried again for fear of another user error. Overall, I would have to give the epilator 5 stars.  With a little practice I am sure I can use it successfully.  It’s also much more cost effective than buying the no heat wax strips every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not care for the facial cleansing brush.  I have never used one before, so I may not know exactly what to expect.  I found the brush to be rather coarse and it felt a bit irritating to my skin.  I had no redness or irritation afterwards, so maybe it’s supposed to really get at it.  I did use it in the shower (product is water resistant for the shower), and that aspect was exactly as promised.  It worked great even under the running water and works fine still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I felt the bristles were tough, I tried the brush with some exfoliating bath wash on my knees and elbows.  Not quite rough enough to scrub hard (I know, it’s not supposed to), but good for everyday buffing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a 3 star rating because it was good, but not something I am in love with.  It will probably be a sometimes tool, not an everyday favorite.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun epilator from of BzzAgent.com as part of a promotion by Braun, and I am loving it!!! I wax my eyebrows and every time i go, the lady asks me if I want to do my upper lip (because apparently i have a mustache lol), I always decline because it KILLS me to have to spend 10 bucks to rip out a few hairs!! Until now, i have been waxing at home, but this epilator has saved the day and  does the job BETTER than the home wax kit  (AND the ladies at the salon) and it is saving me money too!! The eyebrow feature is also great, it definitely holds me over between trips to the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cleansing brush, i am loving it!! I have been in the market for a cleansing brush for a while and the fact that this is a 2 in one situation makes it THAT MUCH BETTER!! I epilate, then i cleanse! And my skin is definitely appreciating the extra help!! My pores are clearer and tighter and overall my skin is looking better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package comes with everything you need to get started including the battery!! I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I received this epilator as a promotional product from Bzzagent. I do not have a lot of issues with hair so to speak but it is very easy to use and much less painful than I had anticipated. I have waxed and tweezed but have found that this product takes much less time. My only complaint is that it takes a few times to get all of the hairs and it makes your skin a little red and irritated. (Strongly suggest cleaning with witch hazel or similar product to alleviate) overall, I would recommend purchasing this product… PS-the included brush is great!!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Facial Epilator through the BzzAgent campaign. I used the product for over a week and I saw major improvements in my skin. The product is assembled with a brush head, revolving tweezers head, and 2AA batteries. The brush head is really gentle but you cannot over use it or it will irritate your skin (no brainer).  The revolving tweezers are painful at first but I found it most beneficial to remove unwanted eyebrow hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say this product works like a charm it improves your overall skin texture to remove impurities that cause breakouts and excess oil that clog pores. My skin looked brighter, healthier, and had a glow. All you do is use your favorite cleanser and the Braun Facial Epilator make sure the product gets deep into your pores. It&#x27;s like a mini facial everyday, its gentle yet effective to make sure your skin is being gently exfoliated of the impurities. I really like this product because I know I don&#x27;t have any residue makeup still on my face my pores are clean after I use this product and of course I follow up with my toner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail as a trial from BzzAgent I was so excited because I wanted to get a facial cleanser for a while now, I got this Braun 2 in 1 Epilator and Facial cleanser. I am really satisfied with this product the facial cleanser feels great on my skin after I used it for the first time, the only downside about it is the speed of the brush i wish It was faster it is battery operated so it could be the reason why. I love the fact that I can use it in the shower! makes it even easier for me to wash my face.  The Epilator part was new to me but I am satisfied with it. I plucks my tiny hairs out upper lip is the most I have problems with so this really get tiny hairs, it is a little bit painful but beauty is pain so im ok with it because it is only temporary :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for being the first time trying out this product/brand  I really like it alot and it&#x27;s worth its money.</li>
            <li> I participated in a campaign through BzzAgent. I was hesitant at first on whether I really knew how to use it. But after I got the hang of it, I realized I loved the epilator better than a regular tweezer or even an at home wax product. It was even better than a shave! It really removes all of the unwanted hairs and even the thin fine ones than most products are unable to remove. And the face scrubber worked really well. Just enough abrasion to scrub away the dirt and oil without irritating your skin. You&#x27;ll feel refreshed after using this product :]</li>
            <li> I like that the Braun Facial Epilator and Cleansing Brush was two items in one. I have sensitive skin and thought the cleanser brush was soft enough to not cause irritation to my face. I knew going in that the epilator would cause reddening of the areas I used it on and I was prepared for a little pain (as in waxing). I would recomend this as a tool to use every day in your facial cleaning ritual. I also like that the hair removal lasts for weeks instead of days!&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to try for free as part of a promotion from Braun and am very satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li> Super awesome. Just what i was looking for. Great for eyebrows. A little &#x27;bite&#x27; is present when using on upper lip, but hold skin tight to reduce that. Very happy today, the day i received it.</li>
            <li> I got this item and it works so great! At the price of this item it is very comparable to those $150 worth facial cleansing brush out there. This item has a lot of use, so you&#x27;re really getting the worth for your money. The brush is very soft and gentle to my face and it works really great. The slim design of it makes it easy for me to bring it with me whenever I travel. The epilator attachment on this item gets every single hair on my face and I can tell you right now that it is the best I have used so far. I am so happy with this product and I recommend it to my family and friends and they loved it too.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the brush daily for a few weeks now and feel like my face is getting so much cleaner. It is removing more of my makeup and leaving my skin feeling very fresh. I have tried it with a few different types of face soap and personally think the brush works the best with a foaming face wash.&lt;br /&gt;The Epilator is such a time saving tool, I wish I had one like this years ago! I&#x27;ve tried various hair removing products but the only thing that truly worked for my face was tweezing, which is so time consuming. I can&#x27;t wax because of the redness and irritation. I was so happy that the only time I had any redness with the Epilator was after the very first use, and it was completely gone within a few hours. The first time using it is painful. However, it&#x27;s comparable to other hair removal tools. I think it just feels like the pain of tweezing, but many hairs at once. Once I used the Epilator a few times, there was less regrowth, and a lot less pain.&lt;br /&gt;The combination of the two tools in one unit make a great pair. I love that it is waterproof and how easily the heads can be switched. I have been using this for a few weeks and the original battery is still working. It would be nice if this had a rechargeable battery, however the fact that it has lasted this long already makes me think it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the added cost of a charger to the retail price.&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I would add to this product is some type of stand/holder. After using it, my instinct is to stand it upright. However, it is not made to stand up and will easily tip over, so I end up setting it on it&#x27;s side on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is an excellent product. I have already recommended it to several people. I received this free as a promotion, but the opinion is honestly mine.&lt;br /&gt;Although the price tag looks high initially, I think it is well worth the money saved on waxing, threading etc. I have already saved so much time by epilating rather than tweezing in just a few weeks, I definitely think it is a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun epilator courtesy of BzzAgent as part of a promotion by Braun, The epilator has a relatively small head since it&#x27;s intended for facial use. It&#x27;s a fantastic size for taking care of hair above the upper lip and those stray hairs near the neckline, but you have a few hairs between your eyebrows or above them, the epilator will take care of them so you don&#x27;t have to.   The exfoliating brush is the best. Gives a great clean finish to my face..  excellent idea.....      Very good product.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I received this product free of charge as part of a testing campaign through Bzzagent.  It is a nifty little gadget, which serves as both a facial cleanser and epilator, via interchangeable heads.  The epilator feature seems to be what the manufacturer views as the selling point of this product, but after using it regularly for a couple of weeks, I felt that the facial cleansing mode was where this product really performed well.  The cleansing brush can be used with or without a cleansing product, and can be used in the shower, which is a timesaver.  I had never used this type of brush before, and I was impressed.  After just the first use, I could tell that it was making a difference in my grooming routine-my skin felt smoother, and the dry patches I sometimes have an issue with were being gently sloughed away.  It does the job without being overly abrasive, and used in conjunction with a facial moisturizer, keeps skin looking fresh and healthy.    For me, the epilation feature was a little tricky to master.  For areas like the upper lip, where the goal is simply to remove all hair and precision is not as much of an issue, it does the job well, and is not overly uncomfortable (though it is an epilator-it isn&#x27;t pain-free).  I can see this being useful for bikini line grooming, though that is not a use I saw suggested anywhere in the enclosed manual.  Personally, I had trouble using it for shaping my brows-I had a bit of difficulty with getting to a point where I felt comfortable and in control of the device to the point where I could achieve the look I was going for.  One feature I had difficulty getting familiar with was the spinning of the epilator-it goes to the left and right, so you can use it in the direction of the hair growth for more effective epilation.  With some practice, though, I think I will become more confident and have more success in this area.    The size of the epilator makes it convenient for travel-just toss in your bag and go.  It does not come with its own case or bag, so if you were going to travel with it, it would make sense to buy a small bag for travel purposes, to keep track of the different heads and accessories, and maybe an extra battery.    Overall, this is a product I can see myself continuing to use in the future, and would definitely recommend to others.  Though it is a little pricey, it is comparable with other facial cleansers and epilators on the market, and has the added bonus of being both!</li>
            <li> Very Good!  Just what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Pat McKenny</li>
            <li> I must say at first I was afraid that it would hurt to use the epilator but i received this product as a campaign promotion from the brand, so i decided to give this one a try and I love it. Do not try to remove all the hair with just one session, you need to be patient. I would advice users to avoid caffeinated drink during the day you use the epilator since caffeine tends to intensify the hurt sensation. I personally prefer wax to remove hair because is fast. For me this is something you can use while you are traveling and need a small quick fix. The facial brush is small and I always use it when im travelling.</li>
            <li> I chose Braun facial epilator after weeks of web search and other users&#x27; reviews. I got three weeks ago, but I am very disappointed with this product. Previously, I was usuing another facial epilator from Panasonic for almost 8 years and I was very happy with that, untill it got damaged. Although, I looked for the same model to buy, apparantly, it was no longer produced by the company. So, I ended up buying Braun E810. It takes very long to epilate with this device. I spend almost 5 minutes for only upper lip area. More importantly, it can not pick up any hair from my forehead and jaws. Today, when I was using it for second time, my skin got stucked inside its tweezers. I hope this is helpful for anyone who wants to buy this product.</li>
            <li> it works okay! its not amazing and it doesn&#x27;t suck!</li>
            <li> I got my Braun 2-in-1 epilator and cleanser brush via a campaign from BzzAgent. First off, the cleanser brush is super soft. After using it my face felt smooth, and that was just after one time. Secondly, the epilator: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! It&#x27;s a little confusing otherwise, but there are detailed explanations and diagrams that help explain everything. I used the epilator on my chin and eyebrow area. It worked really well, I only had two or three hairs I had to pluck after the fact and I didn&#x27;t start to see any regrowth on my chin for two weeks and three weeks for my eyebrows (I have a pretty hairy chin and thick eyebrows). For my eyebrows, I only used it on the bridge of my nose (ew, unibrow) and the top part of my eyebrow. However, this product is not ideal for styling the eyebrow, just for touch-ups. You&#x27;ll still have to get your eyebrows waxed or threaded or whatever you prefer, but this little do-dad will make it so your visits to a salon are less frequent. It can also be used on the upper lip but I didn&#x27;t try it since it&#x27;s not a problem area for me, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the actual design. the head of the epilator is small so it&#x27;s easy to control where you pluck. The head can be switched to rotate left or right depending on which way the hair grows so you don&#x27;t have to twist your hand around to get everywhere you need to. The epilator head detaches so you can switch it out with the cleansing brush. It&#x27;s all water proof so it&#x27;s safe to use in the shower, which also means it&#x27;s cordless! Only one AA battery needed, which it comes with, so no having to rummage around in your junk drawer for a loose AA the first time you use it. It also comes with a secondary brush to clean the epilator head and a cap to keep the head protected from dust and other little particles that could get into the small crevices. The only drawback was the next day my chin was slightly broke-out where I had used the epilator. I have pretty sensitive skin so make sure to test it and know how you&#x27;ll react before using before a big event like a date or dinner party or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really liked this product. I especially have a hard time keeping my chin hairless and this did the trick. A little price-y in my opinion, but if you&#x27;re someone that likes to manage their facial hair, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than constantly going to the salon for touch-ups and a lot more convenient than slowly plucking every single hair to perfection.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun facial epilator and cleansing brush free from Bzzagent to try out. I was excited to receive it because I was looking to purchase similar products for the holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the box, you get the base, epilator head, brush head, small brush to clean epilator, and cover for epilator head. The base is a nice size and fits into my hand nicely. It is easy to handle and maneuver over my face. The device is battery powered which is good for traveling and being on the go. I am curious, however, to see how long the battery lasts. Hopefully it will not cost me much in batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by how much I liked this product. The brush is very soft and great for exfoliation. I wear makeup and sometimes using facewash and makeup remover just doesn&#x27;t cut it. My skin actually felt clean after the first use. The reason I say this is because I have very oily skin so I usually feel like my pores are clogged even after one wash. Sometimes I have to wash my face a second time to get it really clean feeling. The brush head is able to rotate either clockwise or counter clockwise, which is pretty cool in my opinion, and you control the direction with just a flip of the switch. That being said, I don&#x27;t think there is any difference between this product and the more expensive Clarisonic version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator worked well also. I used it all over my face just to see how it worked on different areas and hair thicknesses. While I love how it worked on my eyebrow area, the epilator is not made for sculpting brows by any means. It is great for getting stray hairs between threading/waxing/plucking sessions as a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; but not for defining. I have a lot of very fine hair all over my face that look like peach fuzz. However, it is not noticeable unless you look very closely. The epilator did not seem to do much for these types of hairs so if you have a problem with this, you will need to stick to threading/waxing. The epilator headalso spins either clockwise or counter clockwise, which is really nice, so you dont have to keep switching directions manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleasantly surprised by this Braun system. It does what it claims to do and is a bit cheaper than similar products that are much more expensive that do the exact same thing. I am glad to have this item but it is not something I could ever see myself spending a lot of money on. If the price point of this ever drops to about $20, I&#x27;m in, other than that, I&#x27;m ok with using a pair of tweezers, thread, and a good exfoliating facewash.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this! I have used an epilator on my legs but never my face. Not going to lie, it hurts. The first time I used it, I said no way! Put back in the box, it was a torture device. The next day I gave it another try, this time I held the skin more taught and it hurt alot less. I have used it probably 6 times now and I dont even notice it anymore. You either get used to it or it just gets finer and less painful. I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the brush, it doesn&#x27;t do much. Maybe if you have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun epilator courtesy of BzzAgent as part of a promotion by Braun. It was fun to trial it but I don&#x27;t think I would buy it at the given price. I used to use wax before but now that I have this I use only this. I love the facial scrubber attachment. It cleans my face without a harsh feeling and I don&#x27;t break out as quickly in between washings. The epilator did hurt when I first used it since I was not expecting the pull but after a couple of uses with it I am used to it now. I do have to use it sooner then 4 weeks since hair starts to grow.</li>
            <li> I received the new Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 for free from Braun to test it and give my honest feedback. I have been using it for the past 3 weeks and I have to say that I am really glad that I was chosen for this opportunity. When I first heard that it was an epilator for my face I was a little apprehensive about using it because I was fearful of pain from previous epilators I have used in the past but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all. When i first received it I really took heed to the packaging it came in. It&#x27;s very nice and has a great eye appeal to it. I can tell that it is a quality product and even more so with Braun being as the brand. What was really special about this new product is that it also has a facial scrubbing option where it has a facial scrubbing brush attachment. I used the epilator attachment first removing any unwanted hair from my upper lip and a few hairs I found lingering around my face. It wasn&#x27;t painful at all. It felt like I was tweezing but not with harsh pain. It removed the unwanted hairs easily and accurately without any frustration. After I finished that I was very intrigued by the facial scrubbing attachment and decided to give it a try. All I have to say for that is &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; It is wonderful! I scrubbed my face and it really exfoliated my skin leaving a nice smooth texture and a glow that i haven&#x27;t seen in years. It is so easy to use and I love how this product is versatile and high quality. It was very easy to clean and store after each use. I had a Clarisonic in the past but I actually think this product from Braun is better than the Clarisonic and a better value being I get 2 products in one device. I am still using this product and will continue to use this for a long time to come. It is now part of my facial ritual.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have problems with hair removal...not only because I have very sensitive skin, but because my hair is very dark and coarse. So I figured since depilatories, waxes, bleaches, etc. did not work, I would give this epilator a shot. I have to say for me it worked great! It took away 95% of my most troublesome hairs in a matter of minutes! I was quite pleased. Now for those of you who are super sensitive to pain, be mindful that this unit removes the hair from your body as with tweezers, so there is a bit of pain involved. However, if you get a topical numbing cream, the discomfort level decreases dramatically. This is definitely a great beauty tool! I would have given it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the battery factor. If not for that, I would have rated a five.</li>
            <li> If this product had continued to work as well as the very first time I used it, then I would have given it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Honestly, it worked so well the first time (speaking of the epilator part, not the facial cleansing brush) that I was super excited, ecstatic even, because it worked so efficiently and fast.  Having all those unwanted hairs removed in less than 5 minutes with ease,  sure beat spending 30 minutes plucking to perfection with concentrated effort.  I started to tout this product to my friends and loved ones, However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After subsequent uses, it did not work as well, leaving difficult hairs and making the whole processes time consuming again..  I had to keep going over hairs repeatedly, and even after many tries, the epilator was still not getting them.  It made me have to get out the ol&#x27; tweezers again.  So now, its almost not worth to have it  and it definitely makes me cringe thinking about how much I spent on this produce that could have been amazing if it only had lasted a lot longer.  I expect a product that costs nearly $100 to work for a long time.  Even saying that,  I would have been satisfied with an efficiency that only lasted a year...  that at least sounds reasonable for the price, but this took less than three uses to be not effective, and that is simply not acceptable.  For those of you wondering if it could have just been the battery power- it was not.  I changed the battery a few times, and it still did not work very well.  I am assuming that the mechanism, with the way it is built,  gets worn out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  For this reason it gets 3 stars.  I didn&#x27;t want to downplay this product completely because perhaps someone out there was lucky enough to have one built well enough to last.  If I could have one that did keep its efficiency I would be very happy with this product.  I wish I could send it back, but its been too long and I don&#x27;t have the box- I threw out the packaging after the first time using it since I was so happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So, if you want to try this epilator, be sure to keep your box and receipt for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The facial cleansing brush was a bit too abrasive for my sensitive skin even though the brush has very soft bristles.  I really only purchased this machine for the epilator part.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I was really excited to try the Braun epilator and cleansing brush because it was something new and different for me.  It is very easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t make any mess.  As to the epilator, the first time I tried it, I did expect a bit of pain and it was quite painful since my skin is sensitive.  I do like that it removed hair efficiently and fast.  However, I could see the hair growing back in a couple of days to a week, not up to 4 weeks.  Overall, I think that the epilator works for different people, I was not the case.  Although I did use it about 3-4 times, I will stick to waxing. As far as the cleansing brush I was disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t spin full and the bristles are a little to soft to get a good foam with my cleanser.</li>
            <li> It just stopped working.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Epilator on a promo for review. I&#x27;ve used epilators in the past some were better than others but most recently have just been sticking with waxing. I was excited to be chosen to try this out since it was about time to rotate my beauty routine.  You ever feel like you just need a change? Well that&#x27;s how I was feeling and thought....perfect timing. So let me first say that I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and am not particularly sensitive to pain, with most beauty is pain so you kind of get use to it. So on to the review, the packaging was great, loved that it came with batteries, and not the generic kind. Love the compact design,  it&#x27;s portable and easy to use. It comes with a top to cover the attachment and a cleaning brush along with the interchangeable head to either use as the cleansing brush or epilator. As soon as I received it I rushed to use it starting first on my upper lip,  which again has been waxed for the last 6 months approximately 1 a month and by approximately it&#x27;s usually a little over a month...not under...more like every 5 to 6 weeks. Honestly this was a bit painful but in line with other epilators not more or less painful just be prepared if you have never used one. It&#x27;s essentially tweezing one little hair at a time and pulling it out using a rotating tweezer. Next I went to my chin,  any hair there or on my upper lip for that matter is very fine with maybe one or two pieces a bit darker than others which are the ones that usually call for some type of beauty treatment aka waxing. My chin wasn&#x27;t as painful and seemed to go pretty smoothly and all the peach fuzz was soon gone. There was no redness or irritation on either area immediate after, but did notice a few hours later that there was redness on my upper lip that lasted 3 days. It was coverable with foundation but seriously that was not what I had expected or had ever experienced with any others. For me that was a no go going forward no more upper lip with this thing. As faras my chin, again no issues but the hair came back within a week. Bottom line not a great product for me when waxing last so much longer with no complications.  As far as the cleansing brush love love love, the bristles are a perfect texture really get deep down and leaves your facing feeling refreshed and revitalized.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it is just great. My skin looks so clean and feels so smooth.  Now with that being said not sure that I would buy it just for the cleansing brush, I mean there are a ton on the market, of which I&#x27;ve tried at least 2 that I can recall and this one is comparable. Overall for me the product is a no go.</li>
            <li> This epilator succeeded all of my expectations. It is very effective.</li>
            <li> Good product brush can be a bit harsh on sensitive skin, replicator works great reccomend this product for those who travel and don&#x27;t have much time on their hand&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about half a month, it has become less effective. I&#x27;m afraid that the motor may be defective. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Batteries do not last long enought</li>
            <li> The box containing this was open, not sealed. That is a big concern considering it is a personal hygiene product.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun Epilator a week ago and tried right away, at first I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to use it because epilators are so painful, but if you are like me and pays every month for eyebrow and lip waxing, its definitely worth trying. It will save you money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;It works great pulling the hair around my lips and chin and after one week I still see no traces of hair!&lt;br /&gt;My mother also tried and loved it! She is 64 years old and can&#x27;t see really well to tweeze or wax and with the epilator she was able to get all the unwanted hair really fast!&lt;br /&gt;It works really well but its very painful, if you are not used to epilators or waxing I wouldn&#x27;t advise.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because I thought the brush was really harsh on my skin and didn&#x27;t do much at all. If you tried a clarisonic before you will not care for the brush, plus I wouldn&#x27;t know where to buy a brush head to replace the old one.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a great products and most important, it works!&lt;br /&gt;I received my epilator as a courtesy from Braun from bzzagent but I would definitely purchase one.</li>
            <li> I got this item as a promotional offer from Braun and Bzzagent. The cleansing brush works better than anything I have ever used. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and flawless. I also noticed a lot of my pores closed up. The epilator was a little painful at first but has left my face free of hair for a week!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I discovered I would be receiving this product courtesy of Bzzagent.com for review. As a woman with fair skin and dark hair, facial hair has always been a concern of mine.    The packaging is nice quality and effective in not only showing the product, but describes how the product will work as well.    I appreciated the battery being included! Especially since I have no clue where the batteries in my house are hiding. Getting the battery door open was a bit of a struggle, but having a coin handy helped.    There is a sting. That should be expected, but after awhile you become desensitized to it. There is redness. Taking an ibuprofen or tylenol about half an hour before use may help with the pain and irritation.    It definitely pulled the more coarse of the hairs immediately. Finer hairs took a few more passes as I expected. After use, my skin felt soft.    The brush is a nice extra, but I feel like if someone is going to purchase this, it would be for the epilator. Regardless, I like that the brush doesn&#x27;t rotate completely like other facial brushes. It switches direction about a quarter way through a full rotation. You only need a pea size of face cleanser, as the brush lathers well.    Unfortunately I had a bad reaction to the epilator. I broke out in two places on my face. I understand this is a complication that is common with facial epilation and I attempted to continue use and exfoliate to allow the hair to grow through the skin, but unfortunately it still causes painful blemishes on some more sensitive areas like the cheek and jawline. It continues to work well on the upper lip, so that is good.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun epilator to try out from BzzAgent in the mail as part of a promo by Braun &amp; its arrival was highly anticipated as it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time! I&#x27;ve been wanting to give a facial epilator a try so I don&#x27;t have to spend so much $$ going to the salon for my eyebrow &amp; lip de-fuzzing. Once I received the package, I was giddy to give it a whirl (pun totally intended)! I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn&#x27;t JUST an epilator, its a fantastic facial cleansing brush!! I immediately inserted the AA battery (included, yay!) and used my favorite cleansing foam.&lt;br /&gt;The wand/handle has a convenient switch to turn the heads in either direction, and turns off the device with the middle setting. The brush head was suuuper soft, and left my face noticeably cleaner &amp; smoother after just the first use! I love that the brush head detaches from the  brush adapter itself for easy cleaning and replacement. The epilator head/attachment comes with a convenient cover, but it would be fantastic if the product came with a traveling pouch or case for the facial brush attachment as well.The enclosed manual for the epilator attachment is KEY.. always follow the instructions!&lt;br /&gt;I tested the epilator on my upper lip and eyebrow area, with minimal success. I have sensitive skin, and was very careful with following the enclosed instructions TO THE LETTER. I noticed that I had to go over a few areas with the epilator more than once to maximize removal (considering I have fine &amp; very sparse facial hair in these areas, this was an issue for me), and also noticed that the wand does get mildly warm when using beyond 60-90 seconds. Its not an uncomfortable amount of heat, but it is definitely noticeable. I also found that several of the fine hairs I attempted to epilate were not fully removed &amp; experienced a significant amount of breakage. I also ended up with a few hives due to sensitivity, which I didn&#x27;t expect.. total bummer! I had a lovely red spot above my eyebrow and redness/swelling on my upper lip for a few hours after testing the product. If you&#x27;re a first time epilator user, DO NOT test it out before heading out the door for a date or meeting.. use it a few days before so you know how your skin will react.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use the facial cleansing brush as part of my daily routine (love love LOVE this feature!), and may give the epilator another try to see if I have better success.</li>
            <li> It hurt a bit, but did its job. However it quit working within two months and now I can&#x27;t figure out how to get Amazon to replace it or return my money.</li>
            <li> After receiving the face epilator from Bran to try at out, I used weekly for 30 days days. I usually get my facial hair removed at a professional spa, using hot wax. After a couple of friends told me that waxing the upper lip will make wrinkle faster I was looking for a other solution. I am very happy with the results of this product. It removed every single piece of hair in my face without the waxing.</li>
            <li> I had this face epilator for about three months and I would say I used it about once a week and just like that it stopped working! I rarely ever write  reviews but I was so disappointed considering the price of this item.</li>
            <li> Zero stars. Stopped working a month and a week after I bought it and it can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> Miracle worker. Never going back to waxing or burning nair creams! Yes this hurts but beauty has its price right?</li>
            <li> Have had this item before and so easy to use and not harsh on the face.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Facial Epilator and Cleaning Brush 2-in-1 from Braun to try for FREE through BzzAgent. I decided to try the product for a bit before writing my review. Let&#x27;s start with the product as a whole. I love that instead of two different products, all I have to do is change the attachment from one to the other. The size fits well into the hand and comes with a cover for the Epilator attachment. I am not big on Epilators, however, this one seems to work best out of any I have tried. As with any Epilator, it will cause a little discomfort till you get use to using it. I would recommend using the night before to help with any redness or swelling that might occur. As for the facial cleaning brush, I would have liked one more attachment with a smaller brush to get around the nose area. The brush could have been a little softer too. It seemed a little scratchy on the more sensitive parts of my face. I only used the product with water, which seemed to do the trick. The brush (with water alone) cleaned my face better than facial soap and water. I would recommend the product for use and quality alone. The price could be slightly lower, but look at what you would pay for both these items separately. Thank you Braun and BzzAgent for letting me try this product!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time 2 weeks ago. I am amazed at how well it kept my hair off my face. I don&#x27;t have much upper lip hair but eye brows I&#x27;m constantly tweezing.. this product does hurt a little ill be honest. But we all know the saying pain is beauty! i do recommend it but not for young kids who may have the facial hair issue. It might intimidate them into solving the problem because of the feeling of it. Must read the directions! I love the facial cleaner part! i have acne prone skin and i use natural soaps and all i do is lather it on the brush and use it daily. I have seen results but not as much as i would like but I&#x27;m kind of a slacker and should be repeating the process at night!. definitely a product worth trying :)</li>
            <li> I tested the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush with BzzAgent. I have used Epilators and Facial Cleansing Brushes in the past with little success. I tested this on my lip and eye brow area and actually really liked the epilator part of it. It does a nice job of getting all of the little hairs with out breaking them off like waxing has done in the past. It is not really painful but more of a uncomfortable pinching sensation that I found the more I used it that it went away. The little brush that is comes with is nice to clean it with and the cover is nice so that I can throw it in my bag to travel with. It is small and easy to travel with. I have had issues with other epilators pinching my skin but this one has yet to do so. I will be using this over and over again. Now the cleaning brush leaves a lot to be desired. I thought it was a great idea but it just does not have enough power to spin very well. I find when I get it to my face that it really does not do anything for it. I have another cleansing brush from Mary Kay that I adore but this one does not even compare because it is so slow. I also think the price point for this is a little high.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun 2-in-1 epilator and cleanser brush from BzzAgent. The brush is very gentle and the epilator worked well. I used it on the sides of my upper lip and my eye brow area. The directions are slightly confusing but I just did what felt natural. I&#x27;m keeping my brush in my shower.  I agree with others that the price is a little steep but still a great product based on the handyness and the fact that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun epilator and brush for about two weeks now and overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product! As it notes in the details above, the package came with the epilator, a cleansing brush attachment, a cover for the epilator, and a small brush to clean it. Batteries were included as well. As soon as I received it, I tried out the cleansing brush since I had been meaning to buy one for some time. The brush works rather well and does its job of cleansing the face. All I have to do is add a little facial wash and flip the switch. The bristles are very soft but once it starts to spin, they can feel a little rougher, so a light touch is all that&#x27;s necessary. Overall I like the brush and will continue to use it, however, I don&#x27;t feel like it really cleans deep down in the pores. My skin is smooth after using it because it scrubs away the dirt/makeup above the pores, but I can see that there are still impurities deeper in the pores. But to be fair, it has always been difficult for me to fully clean my pores because the stuff that&#x27;s clogging them is sort of hard and has to be squeezed out. TMI but moving on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a pro at removing hair from my face...I wax and tweeze practically every day. Nevertheless, I was terrified to use the epilator and kept putting it off. I think the speed it spins scared me just a bit. Anyway I finally worked up the courage to use it and I LOVE IT! I used it first on my upper lip (which I usually wax at home) and was done within a few minutes, including the time it took me to figure out which way to spin it. Of course there was some pain, but no more than waxing or tweezing. The hair on my upper lip is also rather fine and the epilator pulled it right out from the root (I could literally see the root on nearly all the hairs that were pulled) with hardly any breakage. Next I tried it on my eyebrow area, being careful not to get too close to my eyebrows and it worked like a charm there too. You&#x27;ll definitely still need tweezers to shape them, but the epilator did a great job of removing hair between the brows and around the forehead near the brows. When I finished I could see the area getting red, but that happens when I wax too. The redness was gone by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple cons I found with this product:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s pricy&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not rechargeable (but batteries are included in the package which is nice)&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t come with a stand to put the device on. The bottom is flat so it can stand on its own, but because it&#x27;s so thin it gets knocked down easily&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t come with some sort of cover for the brush, like the cover for the epilator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love it and see myself using it often as my primary method of hair removal for my face. Is it worth the money? Ehhh I think it could stand to be a little cheaper, but we&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received my Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush courtesy of BzzAgent as a part of promotion from the brando shape them, but the epilator did a great job of removing hair between the brows and around the forehead near the brows.

            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product through BzzAgent.com. This brush works great! My skin is much brighter now that I have been using it regularly and I love that it has an epilator attached. I already owned an epilator for my legs and I am glad to have one small enough for facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does a great job at exfoliating my face without irritating it. Normally I am dealing with dry itchy skin on my forehead during this time of year but using the brush part of this product has helped prevent that. I really like how easy it is to switch from the brush head to the epilator. The epilator does a great job on thicker hairs, even if they have just started poking through the surface. It didn&#x27;t work so well with fine hairs though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this brush/epilator has been a game changer for my face and I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone, oily, dry skin. I&#x27;ve never been good at keeping up with plucking, waxing, or using remover creams because my skin would react so poorly. I have experimented with many different routines for washing and exfoliating my face, without a great deal of luck. If I don&#x27;t exfoliate, my skin is rough and filmy. If I do, it&#x27;s raw and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 was an answer for cleansing, exfoliating, and hair removal that was tested and approved by dermatologists for sensitive skin, I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received mine in the mail and tried it out, I was happy and relieved. It works wonders for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is unbelievably gentle. When I first tried it, I thought it couldn&#x27;t be doing a very good job, but it was. I added some of my sensitive face wash to the bristles, wet my face, and started it up. The brush actually spins in either direction (depending on the direction you turn the switch), while the unit gives a steady vibration. I found the experience rather soothing, and ended up washing for longer than I would have otherwise, which was just fine. After my face was rinsed and dried, I could feel and see a difference. I could see a reduced number of blackheads, my skin felt quote smooth, and I wasn&#x27;t covered in skin flakes. I am able to take it in the shower without worry of damage, or use it at the sink just as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the epilator head. Just looking at it, I want quite sure what to expect. It looks slightly like the head of a personal grooming shaver, except I couldn&#x27;t see any blades. It&#x27;s got a lot of little slit openings around the head, and they actually open and close, plucking out hairs as they go. Once again, the head will spin in either direction depending on the direction you push the switch, which in this case I find more useful than for the brush head. This allows you to go against the direction of hair growth, regardless of which is your dominant hand. I first tried it on my arm to see how it felt, and it was indeed plucking hairs at an incredible speed! The head is small enough still that you can be pretty precise for small or difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with clear instructions for use, maintenance and cleaning, replacing parts, and changing the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great purchase for anyone, but definitely for those with sensitive skin. I am very happy with this item!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!and I got it free to test from bzzzagent! Awesome!</li>
            <li> I loved this product, I&#x27;ve used epilators before on my face but they were bigger and bulky to use. I really like that this one is small and fits nicely in my hand. The option to set which direction the epilator rotates makes it easy to get any where on my face easily. There is only one speed but I didn&#x27;t really find that to be a issue, I think it&#x27;s a good speed. I would say on a scale of 1-10 the pain when using this was around a 2 for me which is better then my other epilator which is around a 5. Though as with all epilators your personal pain level will vary.  I enjoyed the facial brush as well I found it to be a nice texture not to rough. It left my face feeling wonderfully clean. I would recommend this product to anyone any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Bzz Agent and received this product free of charge to try out. The above review is my honest opinion of this Braun Epilator.</li>
            <li> Works really well, fairly painless and is great for those who have reactions to waxing. Highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, it is superior performance, better than thread by a margin</li>
            <li> This really hurts! I don&#x27;t care how much someone says it doesn&#x27;t and how much you want the hair removed I would think twice about this product. I was so afraid to touch it to my face so I put it on my arm then packed it right up and drove to UPS. I can take pain. I&#x27;ve had 3 babies naturally with no meds. and have been waxing for years but this was awful!!!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same device about 15 years old.  The old one was made in France, this one in China.  I worried about that but the effectiveness of this new design is an improvement.  So far happy with the results and more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical about any epilator because more than 20 years ago I used Epilady.  It was torture! And the result was not worth the pain. But after much research and reading the reviews on this site, I decided to give epilation another try. Am I glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Facial Epilator is a fabulous product! When it arrived, I could hardly wait to epilate my face. The battery provided plenty of power for the treatment. It was easy to use and the results couldn&#x27;t be better. The pain factor was zero, but there was sensation similar to gentle tweezing. Perhaps that&#x27;s a result of strip waxing at home and tweezing some of the chin hairs. The epilator even pulled out the stubborn hairs that regular tweezers often left behind. After I finished the epilation process, I used Giovanni Facial Cleansing Towelettes, Unscented, to clean and soothe my skin. They contain aloe which not only soothes the skin but also calms it. After an hour or so, I applied my regular facial cream and was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to feel more feminine, have a fuzz-free face, and not have to worry about tweezing all those chin hairs. Facial creams and makeup seem to be working better since there is no facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so grateful to have found the Braun Facial Epilator.</li>
            <li> I like this epilator. It seems that I can &amp;#34;home in&amp;#34; on specific facial hairs, and I end up feeling it is more efficient than epilators that try for a broader swath of hair. Also, the smaller area seems to mean it hurts less when I do a lot of hair removal. I don&#x27;t have lasting redness following use, just a few minutes after I finish and put moisturizer on my face. It took me a while to realize that this thing doesn&#x27;t whir and buzz fast. It is quite slow as the heads go around. I thought the battery it came with was dead. Actually, it just goes slow, and if you press it against your skin, it will nearly stop. This facial epilator is my favorite of all time. Happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun epilator courtesy of BzzAgent as part of a promotion by Braun, and it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time. I was in desperate need of a facial epilator, and this one does the job well. The epilator has a relatively small head since it&#x27;s intended for facial use. It&#x27;s a fantastic size for taking care of hair above the upper lip and those stray hairs near the eyebrows. Of course, it&#x27;s not intended for shaping the eyebrows, but you have a few hairs between your eyebrows or above them, the epilator will take care of them so you don&#x27;t need to crane your neck in front of the mirror while trying to tweeze them individually.    The epilator grabs, I would say, 95% of hairs. Unfortunately, it was unable to uproot a few of my above-the-lip hairs, but tweezing 2-3 isn&#x27;t a biggie. I had a 100% success rate with my eyebrow hairs. The manual shows you in what direction you should set (via a bidrectional switch) the head to rotate and in what direction you should move the epilator. Figuring out the head direction can take a bit of thinking, especially if you&#x27;re trying to figure it out as you look in the mirror. (For those who don&#x27;t know, the tweezers should rotate in the direction the hair grows, but you should move the epilator in the opposite direction of hair growth. It&#x27;s a bit hard to describe with words, so the manual&#x27;s diagrams does a pretty good job.)    It&#x27;s nice that the epilator runs on an AA battery. No cords to worry about here! The package includes a battery, the epilator, a facial brush, and a little epilator cleaning brush. The epilator head can be removed, and the facial brush can be attached. The brush, like the epilator, can change to spin in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. Of course, the brush is very soft and is excellent for exfoliating. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the device getting wet, either. It&#x27;s safe for use in the shower, which makes it incredibly convenient. The little cleaning brush is great for cleaning the epilator head, though I wish it had some kind of carrying case so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the brush getting dirty and then contaminating the epilator when I clean it. Oh, the package also includes a snap-on cover for the device, but it&#x27;s only large enough to accomodate the epilator head, not the facial brush. It&#x27;s still great for putting into my travel case.    All in all, the epilator and the package&#x27;s inclusions are fantastic! I&#x27;m very happy with the product, though the price is justifiable only if you have a significant amount of facial hair that would be pesky to tweeze.</li>
            <li> The Braun package came with everything included.  It was wasy to understand and was assembled in a few seconds.  No clumsy electrical cords here, battery operated and very convenient!!    So it&#x27;s soft on the skin, I was worried it would be abrasive. My face was a little pink but felt clean. Exfoliating was gentle not harsh.  My skin felt soft, almost dewlike!! My pores were opened!! Wow. In my 7x mirror I see changes already. When I went to bed my face felt tingly.    My skin looks brighter.  Did it remove a layer of gunk? Wow. Thought I washed away all my makeup before I used it but the brush had makeup over it! Washed the brush w soap and little water and its new again! Kinda excited to try this again tomorrow night. Never liked the makeup removal process before, would skip nights, but this is quite awesome.  Keep looking at myself in the mirror!! I just used water and it made such a difference. I guess my cleansing routine is NOW complete!!!    I received my Braun epilator as part of a promotion by Braun.</li>
            <li> I got my Braun 2 in 1 epilator courtesy of bzzagent. And I am in love it is an amazing product.I had never used anything like this before but I am so glad I was chosen because my face has never felt better .......</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive my first free product to try from BzzAgent.com because theBraun Face Beauty Edition 810 is just the kind of product I have been looking for for cleansing and hair removal. I was especially excited because the product is advertised as being good for sensitive skin, like mine. I have used the products epilator function once so far, and the facial cleansing daily. As someone who has been thinking about laser hair removal and other more expensive options for the hair on my upper lip, this product is great for that. I also used it to remove the hair between my eyebrows. My experience with the epilator was mixed. I am not sure if it because I have to learn how to use it better or if my skin is just too sensitive, but in the week following application of the product my upper lip was a little red and I got tiny bumps in the hair follicles. I plan to continue to try it out again and see if my experience will improve. As far as the facial cleansing is concerned, I have been more than thrilled. It is gentle and is used easily in the shower. I love the way the soft brush feels on my face and leaves it clean and bright. Overall, a great product. I can see myself continuing to use the cleansing head daily and giving the epilator a few more chances to see if my skin can handle it.</li>
            <li> This product has become my new favorite beauty tool. The Braun Facial Epilator and Cleansing Brush is amazing, I have very sensitive skin so I was expecting the epilator to irritate my skin as it would after using my tweezers. After using this epilator for the first time I couldn&#x27;t believe how clear my skin looked, goodbye little red dots. It truly does capture even the finest and shortest hairs. The battery held up pretty well and did not loose power like I thought it would after using it a second time. The epilator head and cleansing brush are super easy to interchange. After 3 weeks I am still hair free. My advice for first time users is to read the instructions on how to angle the epilator head in relation to the direction of the hair, also the tingling pain sensation lessens the more you use it. I&#x27;ve been epilading my legs for years now and can attest to that. The handle and weight of the device is very comfortable and it feels durable and of good quality. The cleansing brush head is the perfect size and makes your face feel clean and refreshed. It&#x27;s perfect for travel and only takes one AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;#got it free from Braun</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun 2 in 1 Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush from BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve never had anything similar to this product so I was not really able to compare it to anything else. I did use this product for a few weeks to get enough information for my review and after my trial period, I&#x27;m very satisfied with how this product works. After simply popping in the battery, you&#x27;re ready to roll. There&#x27;s no charging necessary, therefore there are no cords which makes this product even more convenient. It&#x27;s very easy to store and instead of having two different devices, you only have one. The epilator and face scrubber heads are very easy to switch which is also very convenient. The epilator is slightly painful on sensitive areas of the face but it is very efficient in removing the hair so you don&#x27;t have to put up with the pain for long. The facial cleansing brush is my favorite part of the device since I love washing and exfoliating my face. I used the brush with just water and then I read a suggestion to add your favorite face wash and then use that with the device. I tried both ways and I even love it just plain! My face is always much smoother after using it in the shower. Oh yeah, that&#x27;s another thing. It&#x27;s safe to use facial brush IN the shower so yet again, adding to the convenience factor! But be sure to use a moisturizer after using the scrubber; you don&#x27;t want to acquire any dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works well&lt;br /&gt;No cords/charging necessary&lt;br /&gt;Runs on a single battery (included in packaging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;A little painful on sensitive areas</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this product through Bzzagent.com from Braun for free because I was lookin for a 2 in 1 device that would help me abtain a healthier, clearer complexion and fight off those stubborn facial hairs. I have tried this product several times now, and I have to say that if I wouldn&#x27;t have receive this for free I would have bought it myself.  Pros:  Let me just start by saying that you could take it anywhere  due to its size and the fact that is cordless. It&#x27;s waterproof, so you could either cleanse or epilate your face in the shower or even both. This device allows you to decide the direction on which you want the epilator to rotate, which is a bonus especially when epilating since hair grows in different directions. Therefore, you don&#x27;t have to position your arms in a weird uncomfortable way. I love the cleansing brush because it leaves my skin feeling smooth, but what impressed me the most was the epilator.The epilator solved my facial hair problem since it&#x27;s able to grab and pull the hairs, especially the ones on my chin, something that my other epilator couldn&#x27;t do due to its size (too big).  Cons:  It&#x27;s battery operated.  It doesn&#x27;t bring a pouch to put everything.  It doesn&#x27;t bring a mirror like the other model (830)  Cleansing brush should be replace every 3 months but that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> I think this is the perfect device to keep on my bathroom counter. I really hate clutter so it&#x27;s great that this the the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush has two functions. Also, this is at the top of my list to take with me next time I travel it&#x27;s small enough to fit in a bag and since it has two functions, I&#x27;m cutting down on the devices I would otherwise bring.    The brush is very soft and leaves my skin feeling clean without causing redness. The Epilator picks up even the really fine hairs on my face, which would take so long to find and pluck with traditional tweezer - it&#x27;s so much faster using the Braun Facial Epilator attachment and I know that I didn&#x27;t randomly miss one hair that&#x27;ll now stick out. My only very slight wish is that it came with a travel case, but it&#x27;s so small that I&#x27;m sure I wouldn&#x27;t have trouble finding one.I received my epilator as a courtesy from Braun from bzzagent but I would still have purchase one.</li>
            <li> I received this from bzzagent as a campaign from Braun. I love it!! I have never used an epilator before so I was skeptical before my first use. I used it on my lip and was pleasantly surprised. It was gentle and effective and the results were immediate. The facial cleanser brush is gentle and provides a deep down clean after using it. I am in love with the Braun epilator and facial brush!! I am so glad to have been able to try it from bzzagent!!</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun face 810 model and i must say the first look of it was most impressive. Though its very slim and sleek looking, I did not expect the whole machinery to be to light in weight and i was quite surprised to find it so.  I first used the epilator and though the sound if the machine was a little intimidating the result was wonderful. As expected it did cause a regular amount of sting but nothing unbearable or unusual. The epilator bladed rotate in opposite directions catching hold and removing even fine hair which was very impressive. As i have already mentioned, the result was great.  I then used the cleansing brush. Changing the epilator head to the cleansing brush head was fairly simple and it changed with ease. At first touch, the bristles are very soft and smooth and not harsh on skin. I did rinse my face. I poured a small amount of cleanser on to the brush and must confess that a little does go a long way. The brush head also spins in different directions and has a slight vibration to it. I dint have any make up on but i could still feel the brush scrub away the dirt and dead skin left behind after the hair removal. Together the epilator and the cleansing brush gave a clean and fresh effect. It has been a day since I did this whole cleansing routine and I still feel like my face is freshly scrubbed and cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back may be that the retail price of the product is on the higher side but as i received the same as a part of a promotion, I am more than happy to use same. On the whole the epilator and the cleansing brush duo is a great pack and I would definitely recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I received this product free to test as part of a BzzAgent campaign. Thank You BzzAgent !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the practical idea of the 2 in 1 tool.  After using it for a 1.5 week on my acne-prone skin it feels cleaned and smooth. But wished it had different texture of brush head. The brush was little too harsh/rough for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used an electric epilator prior to this product, so I was a little scared when I turn it on. The epilator seem like it was going super fast. But I tried it on the baby hairs that I have on my forehead and I was impressed with the results however I did find it painful as a beginner with epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small and useful, perfect to take when traveling since it runs on battery and takes little space.. Don&#x27;t need to take charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, like it but wished there was an option for softer brush head.</li>
            <li> I received this product through Buzzagent as a promotion campaign for Braun and I loved it. I have been using it since I got it. My face needed a serious thorough deep cleaning and this does the job. I also needed to get a facial so I have been using this amazing product for that. My face just feels so much softer and it feels cleaner. At first I was somewhat confused on how the epilator worked and which way I was supposed to use it, since it can go clockwise or counter clockwise. After trying both ways I figured out the best way for the epilator to work so that most of my facial hair came out. There is some kind of pain but it&#x27;s fast and the pain does not last long. I did have to pluck a couple of hairs in my upper lip but not a big problem at least I do not have to pluck all of them, which can be a little more painful than using this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;I love that you can have it in the shower and the water will not damage or get inside the battery area. I personally use the brush while in the shower just to use the soap and clean my face. I use the exfoliating brush all over my face even on my eyelids, I have noticed that the dryness I sometimes get on my eyelids is not there anymore, hopefully it won&#x27;t come back.  The box contains the epilator with exfoliating brush and a small epilator cleaning brush, also a lid for the epilator. I love that it includes the batteries, sometimes when I buy something I forget to read if batteries are included and when I get home I have to go back to the store for the batteries. Overall this is a great product and I will definitely be recommending it down the line to my friends and family. The price is not bad I thought it would be around $50 but it is a great investment for your money.</li>
            <li> I received this epilator as a promotional product from Bzzagent. Overall I think this is a great product. At first, I did have a little trouble with it because I haven&#x27;t used an Epilator in a really long time (especially not on my face). But it went really well, and it is A LOT less painful than I remeber. I used this product on my my lip and it went pretty smooth, I dont really have much there but since the hair was pretty thin it just kind of glided through. I normally have one or two coarser hairs on my chin and it just felt like plucking but much faster. Overall it does what it claims to do, I always have a little trouble the first couple of passes as the epilator just seems to break the hair versus pull it from the root which means I have to try to go over it leaving red spots on my skin. I think this might just take a little practice. I wanted to try it in my husband but he wouldn&#x27;t have it lol.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun epilator courtesy of a promotion by Braun and  BzzAgent, is my first time to use a epilator and i fascinate with this product.  Works very good and  my faces look very cute and good . Is a good product and i recommend ..</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: I did receive this product as a PR sample from Braun. I have had about a month with this product and all opinions and experiences are my own and based off of regular and continuous use of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Compact&lt;br /&gt;Convenient&lt;br /&gt;Attractive&lt;br /&gt;Multi-Functional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Requires batteries&lt;br /&gt;Not so silent&lt;br /&gt;No housing for removable parts&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing function is mediocre&lt;br /&gt;Cost is a little high considering additional battery cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Form:&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush is about the size of a tube of toothpaste and has removable epilator and face brush attachments as well as a cover for the epilator head. The device is made of a smooth finish plastic that does make it slick when wet but because of its light weight, tapered handle and easy to grip size it is not effected by the slick texture in terms of ease of operation in the shower. There are 3 positions to the &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch which in my experience, only really effects the direction in which the epilator head spins and does not have an effect on the cleansing head attachment/functionality.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head attachment is a standard round bristle set, nothing special about the texture in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator attachment head has a sufficiently narrow target area that is comfortable to use around the lip and chin area without fear of snagging surrounding areas but i would worry about using it near my eyes aside from the area between the brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practicality:&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush is battery operated instead of being rechargeable or outlet powered. This provides portability but requires the user to stock up on batteries which are expensive and wasteful. Rechargeable batteries are a solution, but the device comes with disposable batteries in the packaging. I have had to change the batteries twice in a month long period with frequent use, which seems extremely highfor a device such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provided the device is well maintained, it is a quick solution to mass facial hair removal at home with little to no prep required and satisfactory results. It is unclear how long this device will hold up, but may be a cheaper alternative to purchasing wax strips if maintained for an extended period of time. This device is not the quietest method of hair removal and thus is not 100% discreet, but it is a volume that is possible to mask the sound with running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:&lt;br /&gt;Arguably the most important section, the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush is unfortunately, mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a cleansing brush the micro-oscillation feels weak in comparison to competitors. I will say that the product claims to be safe for sensitive skin and will give the benefit of the doubt that my skin needs a firmer touch but the oscillation seems to also be effected by the amount of pressure applied to the cleaning surface which in my opinion, shouldn&#x27;t alter the performance of this feature as it allows for too much user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an epilator, which i feel is the stronger of the two functions, the device function is satisfactory. It gets the job done. I will give a **warning** to those interested that yes, it is possible to catch your skin with the epilator attachment, although this does not happen often and is more likely due to user error than anything. The epilator does require the user to be thorough and revisit areas multiple times to achieve desired results. As expected, the hair removal process is slightly to moderately painful and does induce redness. Additionally, as with any other hair removal method in which hair is pulled from the source, it is advised that the user cleans the area thoroughly after in order to reduce the chance of developing any &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; or pimples. Because of this reason, I would not advise using this device away from a sink (&amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34;) and thus find thebattery operation to be even more of a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note additionally, that this product was tested on female facial hair, so its performance on male facial hair is not conclusive in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview:&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind stocking up on batteries and are looking for an accessible and quick at home solution to facial hair removal the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush may be a device for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a facial cleansing device I would not suggest this one.&lt;br /&gt;This, in my opinion, is a facial epilator first and foremost and the dual functionality is more of a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;In the end I enjoy having this device for facial hair removal but would not invest the ~$80 for it.</li>
            <li> Very good result , not any pain , would recommend it . Haven&#x27;t tried facial cleansing brush yet .</li>
            <li> I received my Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 from Braun to try for free.  I gave a review on it after a couple of weeks but wanted to do another after using it for a couple of months. I love this product. It comes with a detachable Epilator and a detachable facial cleansing brush.  It is small enough to fit comfortably in your hand and easy to switch heads on. The cleansing brush really makes my face feel soft and smooth - I feel it really helps your skin look more youthful. I seem to have a glow to my face afterwards. The Epilator works great as well. I&#x27;m not going to say the first time I used it there was no sting - there was but not near as bad as using tweezers or waxes which seem to cause red irritation on my skin. It gets really fine hair so I found that subsequent times I used it the stinging has become less noticeable. Everywhere I&#x27;ve used it feels so smooth and soft. Another great feature is that you can take it in the shower with you with the cleansing brush on. I am estastic to have received this item to try and would gladly buy it if I had&#x27;nt and recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> AS YOU AGE, ( SOME OF US :)  GET THESE COURSE LITTLE HAIRS ON YOUR CHIN.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE BEST THING I HAVE FOUND TO COMBAT THAT PROBLEM, TOTALLY PAINLESS ( FOR ME ) ....SMALL, SO YOU CAN JUST GET THOSE FEW LITTLE ONES THAT POP UP, OTHERS I HAVE TRIED TAKES A LARGE AREA THAT YOU REALLY DON&#x27;T NEED &amp; THEY HURT WITH EVERY PULL !&lt;br /&gt;I CAN EVEN CLEAN UP AROUND MY BROWS.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S SMALL &amp; SO CONVENIENT TO USE.&lt;br /&gt;OH...AND THE CLEANING BRUSH DOES A GREAT JOB TOO !</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to have. I normally wouldn&#x27;t have bought it, but I got it free to try. I am so glad I did. I have a lot of baby hairs that are annoying on my face and sometimes waxing is just to cumbersome and messy. Now I can literally use this thing every day or when the need arises and I don&#x27;t have to plan, warm up wax, try not to spill wax on my face/counter/floor, then try not to remove the hair I do want to keep! The pain is minimal, just like with waxing, the tool is easy to use and easy to control. The battery life isn&#x27;t the best, but it just takes AA batteries which most everyone has in their household, and for the convince of this thing, it is definitely worth it! Plus I haven&#x27;t even mentioned the cleansing brush! Another great tool I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money on.... man I guess I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. Just buy this thing, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> It did not work or turn on and I tried new batteries and still did not work so returned it.</li>
            <li> my wife love the product and it did the job as described.</li>
            <li> It is AWESOME. No more messy wax and no more waiting in line for wax or threading. It is worth the money. I am 😋</li>
            <li> After receiving this product through a Bzzagent campaign, I was really excited to use it.  I haven&#x27;t ever been able to find an epilator that actually works really well, so I was very pleasantly surprised when this one worked perfectly!  It is fairly painless, no more so than if you were tweezing, and removes all the hair in the area (even very fine hairs).  I&#x27;ve mainly used the epilator around my eyebrows which is were I need it most and I have had excellent results.  I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red or irritated at all.  I have to give the Braun 810 a 4 star though because I am very disappointed in the face brush attachment.  I thought it was a great idea for the 2-in-1 feature of this product including both the epilator head and brush head.  That was until I tried the face brush.  It doesn&#x27;t rotate at all just kind of vibrates, so you don&#x27;t get much scrubbing action.  I actually get a better result with the brush turned off and just use my own muscle power to move the brush in circles.  It just seems the motor isn&#x27;t powerful enough to move the brush.  If I were to purchase this product on my own I would probably go for a cheaper model that just has the epilator head!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used an Epilator. I was a little taken aback at first, however the results for it is worth it. I love that it has a dual head. I don&#x27;t need two different pieces of equipment to complete my daily routine. Making it shower proof is a bonus. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this item so much it works wonderfully it does pinch at first but is so worth the final result of bein hair free for weeks this item is awesome I love the cleanser brush to it makes your face so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I received my braun epilator from bzzagent.com and i really Love it that&#x27;s what i always needed is really easy to use with excellents results, i actually enjoy this product</li>
            <li> So first off, a huge thank you to Bzz Agent for allowing me to give my unbiased review of Braun&#x27;s new facial epilator, the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long struggled to find a way to easily and relatively painlessly remove unwanted facial hair.  Waxing, threading, plucking, epilation, exfoliation, and even (GASP!) shaving have all been utilized to banish hair from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have used an epilator on my face before, I have never used an epilator that&#x27;s sole purpose was for one&#x27;s face.  This may not seem like a big deal but it really is.  I also have Braun&#x27;s Silk-Epi 7 (which is excellent by the way!) that comes with different heads/attachments to use on various part of your body.  One of those attachments is for your face and while it does work- it did not work as well as the Beauty Edition 810.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Beauty Edition 810 I experienced far less skin irritation, breakouts, and it&#x27;s very easy and inexpensive.  With waxing and epilating with other models I experienced red skin for days and when that subsided I would get these tiny little whiteheads all over the area.  While I must admit this hurts like the dickens- especially on your upper lip- it is totally worth it given the ease of use and for how inexpensive the device is.  And ladies, let&#x27;s be honest, ALL hair removal hurts!  The only thing I can compare this device to is threading, but that can be expensive and it may be difficult to find someone in your area who specializes in that particular method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this 5 stars, although I feel as if the overall product was cheapened by the facial brush.  It felt like sandpaper on my face, though in total disclosure I own a Clarisonic facial brush, so I am hard to please in that area.  My boyfriend used it and said it was ok.  I just feel as if Braun could sell their facial epilator device on its own and leave the facial brush to another product as this one does seem as if it is powerful enough forthat use (it is powered by an included AA battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I REALLY am happy with the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 and thank Bzz Agent again for sending me this wonderful product to try.</li>
