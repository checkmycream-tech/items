            <li>but this one works great and goes on smoothly</li>

            <li>/&gt;- does not smear, or &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;- inexpensive (around $10~)&lt;br /&gt;- very easy to use, goes on smoothly&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like when you&#x27;re young and it makes a perfect line.</li>
            <li>I would have really liked this product if it had more staying power.</li>
            <li>So easy to use!</li>
            <li>so it goes on very smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>This goes on very smooth and the easiest one I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The applicator tip is easy to work with to create a nice line.  </li>
            <li>this eyeliner is perfect- affordable, easy to use glider pen, one of my favorite milani purchases by far</li>
            <li>I love this eye liner.</li>
            <li>love love love</li>
            <li>This is my favorite liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the marker point</li>
            <li>as the end of the day I noticed the eyeliner was smudging all over the top of my eye...</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I saw an infographic on Pinterest demonstrating cruelty-free alternatives to cult favorite beauty products, and immediately bought this pen.</li>
            <li>I thought this eyeliner was going to be more stubborn to get off.</li>
            <li>And the price is so much better</li>
            <li>I have hooded monolids, so most eyeliner creases on me.</li>
            <li>and I have used MANY eye liners from drugstore brands to department store brands and brands you purchase at Sephora.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not tested on animals:)</li>
            <li>I plan to order more when this one is gone.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>and I wish there were more colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m picky, and I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I just love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner pen should include more product for the price.</li>
            <li>love this product-</li>
            <li>Application is very smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried this product on I  loved it but</li>
            <li>pretty good for the price i did have to reapply throughout the day though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and i love the color.</li>
            <li>Great easy to use, highly pigmented</li>
            <li>most accurate eye liner.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth this line is.</li>
            <li>This is my first Milani product and I can&#x27;t wait to try more!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply but comes off easily with water or tears.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and, unlike another reviewer&#x27;s experience, it lasted quite a while before drying out.</li>
            <li>It smudges easily after it should have already set.  </li>
            <li>The product shipped very quick.</li>
            <li>Easy to make cat eyes</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try and it applies easily and stays on well.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it does not flake or anything and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It goes on super smoothly and evenly and the long tapered applicator is perfect for the cat-eye look.  </li>
            <li>It is fine tip</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have hooded eyelids, this will probably work just fine for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- sharp bold lines for the perfect winged eyeliner look</li>
            <li>This liner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>That is also a great product, and I wouldn&#x27;t have stopped using it except that I decided to only use cruelty-free cosmetics.</li>
            <li>but overall this is a great eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Easiest to precisely put on.</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this eyeliner</li>
            <li>I bought it after my kat Von d eyeliner ran out as a cheap animal cruelty free alternative</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, looks great, lasts long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, easy to apply, super precise, and has a gripper on the pen.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner goes on smooth and easy, as long as you have a steady hand, it will look perfect every time.</li>
            <li>tip is super flexible which makes it easy to apply</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite eyeliner!  </li>
            <li>it does run out, it runs out in the most important part, the very tip of the pen.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome, crisp, jet black liquid liner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply with a felt tip that is very tapered allowing for fine lines, or apply thicker if you wish.</li>
            <li>Bold color</li>
            <li>This is a great eye liner for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t want to deal with liquid liners, but wants a sharper, more vivid effect than  with standard pencil or stick liners.</li>
            <li>This liner has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Works just as good, if not better, than eye liners that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and is very even.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get a nice black line, only more of a light gray-ish liquid.</li>
            <li>This eye liner is easy to use, goes on well, stays on all day, looks great, has a nice &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; quality of black pigment and cost less than $10.00.It is sold at drugstores, Target and Walmart, however,  I have to order it online, becasue it is always sold out at those stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the best eyeliner, easy to use and apply with the fine soft point and this liquid eyeliner is one of very few that does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to control, and the lines come out really even.</li>
            <li>I am using it to dip in my eye studio tub of black eyeliner and its a awesome brush for eyeliner in general (:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and fluid, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
            <li>this eyeliner makes just the right size line with ease and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I may order one again, to see if that was the case--as I do like the precision brush and the way the liner worked at first.</li>
            <li>This is my first liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>(I thought it wouldn&#x27;t last more than a month or so).</li>
            <li>All in all, I love this product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>If the staying power was stronger I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li>It stays on my lids pretty well, and doesn&#x27;t travel at all.  </li>
            <li>I only use liquid pen eyeliners and over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many many many brands from drugstores (Revlon, L&#x27;oreal, Maybelline, NYX, Almay) to higher end ones (Japanese brands, Urban Decay, Dior, Stila, etc).</li>
            <li>It is super easy to apply, Thanks to the smart design of making it like  regular eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super black and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and dark, and it&#x27;s CRUELTY-FREE.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for a good eyeliner and this one finally worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply in a nice thin line.</li>
            <li>I am such a huge fan of this product, and I will absolutely recommend it to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li>so much I dont mind spending the money for another.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really noticeable to anyone but me.</li>
            <li>I gave a couple more tries and every time I would wear this eyeliner it smudges.</li>
            <li>When you have folds in your skin as you age the lines end up very jagged.</li>
            <li>I really like the applicator</li>
            <li>Draws a straight line and doesn&#x27;t smear throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner goes on very black and easy, but fades quickly, even with primer.  </li>
            <li>this is the first &#x27;felt tip&#x27; liner that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m so delighted with the thin tip so that I can apply my outward points.</li>
            <li>Stayed on all day, easy to apply, and a nice dark black color.</li>
            <li>It was just like new again!  </li>
            <li>Love the black.</li>
            <li>Only have a 4 star because it seems to run out quick.</li>
            <li>but it is thicker which I enjoy more than a thin eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>pen is great because it makes application a breeze, but it&#x27;s staying power is not impressive and it&#x27;s also not waterproof.</li>
            <li>Even better, it&#x27;s half the cost of the Stila pen!</li>
            <li>I am usually awful with liquid eyeliner, but this is great to handle with a nice steady line.</li>
            <li>felt tip can dry out quickly if you don&#x27;t store it correctly</li>
            <li>This liner delivers: long-lasting, thin to thick coverage, great leverage (feels good in the hand, allows for a steady line), and the dramatic effect is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super dark, goes on really well, and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>Eventually Stila came out with their pen, and since Stila can do no wrong with me, I tried it and was instantly converted.</li>
            <li>I tried shaking the tube, and even turning the tube upside down overnight to see if it would come back, but it is still very light.</li>
            <li>Its so easy to use, the color is very black and it never smudges.</li>
            <li>Only thing is a wish is was a little more matte</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s extremely accurate, and soft, but firm.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised when I opened it</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have young eyes and have lots of old skin to cover.</li>
            <li>I started with Urban Decay&#x27;s liquid eyeliner, which was first in a small pot with a brush, and then it changed and was only okay.</li>
            <li>I bought this liner on a whim, and I&#x27;ve had no trouble at all controlling it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because the Milani liquid eyeliner in brush form is the only drugstore eyeliner that really stays on me, but it&#x27;s a pain to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My previous favorite, Pump Up semi-permanent liner, also lasts all day, but is more difficult to remove than the Milani.</li>
            <li>I have good control, creating a thin or thick line as needed, it lasts for a long time throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
            <li>tip liners thinking they dry up, but they really aren&#x27;t.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually lasts, even onto the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;Saves SO MUCH time too.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with it is that it didn&#x27;t dry very fast.</li>
            <li>I am usually not coordinated enough to use liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>$10 isn&#x27;t bad at all for this great eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really use any makeup outside of the occasional swipe of mascara until recently.  </li>
            <li>I was a very early convert to the liquid eyeliner revival back in 2008, so I have been through a number of different products in my time.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a liner that goes on smoothly and is truly waterproof (and I have seriously tried them all), this is the one.</li>
            <li>Dries out too quick, hard to work with.</li>
            <li>It really is the blackest black, does not smear and removes with ease.</li>

            <li> so it goes on very smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> This goes on very smooth and the easiest one I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The applicator tip is easy to work with to create a nice line.  </li>
            <li> this eyeliner is perfect- affordable, easy to use glider pen, one of my favorite milani purchases by far</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner.</li>
            <li> love love love</li>
            <li> This is my favorite liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the marker point</li>
            <li> as the end of the day I noticed the eyeliner was smudging all over the top of my eye...</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I saw an infographic on Pinterest demonstrating cruelty-free alternatives to cult favorite beauty products, and immediately bought this pen.</li>
            <li> I thought this eyeliner was going to be more stubborn to get off.</li>
            <li> And the price is so much better</li>
            <li> I have hooded monolids, so most eyeliner creases on me.</li>
            <li> and I have used MANY eye liners from drugstore brands to department store brands and brands you purchase at Sephora.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not tested on animals:)</li>
            <li> I plan to order more when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> and I wish there were more colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m picky, and I love this.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner pen should include more product for the price.</li>
            <li> love this product-</li>
            <li> Application is very smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried this product on I  loved it but</li>
            <li> pretty good for the price i did have to reapply throughout the day though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and i love the color.</li>
            <li> Great easy to use, highly pigmented</li>
            <li> most accurate eye liner.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this line is.</li>
            <li> This is my first Milani product and I can&#x27;t wait to try more!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but comes off easily with water or tears.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and, unlike another reviewer&#x27;s experience, it lasted quite a while before drying out.</li>
            <li> It smudges easily after it should have already set.  </li>
            <li> The product shipped very quick.</li>
            <li> Easy to make cat eyes</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try and it applies easily and stays on well.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> it does not flake or anything and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It goes on super smoothly and evenly and the long tapered applicator is perfect for the cat-eye look.  </li>
            <li> It is fine tip</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have hooded eyelids, this will probably work just fine for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- sharp bold lines for the perfect winged eyeliner look</li>
            <li> This liner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> That is also a great product, and I wouldn&#x27;t have stopped using it except that I decided to only use cruelty-free cosmetics.</li>
            <li> but overall this is a great eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Easiest to precisely put on.</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this eyeliner</li>
            <li> I bought it after my kat Von d eyeliner ran out as a cheap animal cruelty free alternative</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and stays all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, looks great, lasts long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, easy to apply, super precise, and has a gripper on the pen.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner goes on smooth and easy, as long as you have a steady hand, it will look perfect every time.</li>
            <li> tip is super flexible which makes it easy to apply</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> it does run out, it runs out in the most important part, the very tip of the pen.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome, crisp, jet black liquid liner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply with a felt tip that is very tapered allowing for fine lines, or apply thicker if you wish.</li>
            <li> Bold color</li>
            <li> This is a great eye liner for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t want to deal with liquid liners, but wants a sharper, more vivid effect than  with standard pencil or stick liners.</li>
            <li> This liner has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Works just as good, if not better, than eye liners that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and is very even.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get a nice black line, only more of a light gray-ish liquid.</li>
            <li> This eye liner is easy to use, goes on well, stays on all day, looks great, has a nice &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; quality of black pigment and cost less than $10.00.It is sold at drugstores, Target and Walmart, however,  I have to order it online, becasue it is always sold out at those stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the best eyeliner, easy to use and apply with the fine soft point and this liquid eyeliner is one of very few that does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to control, and the lines come out really even.</li>
            <li> I am using it to dip in my eye studio tub of black eyeliner and its a awesome brush for eyeliner in general (:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and fluid, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner makes just the right size line with ease and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I may order one again, to see if that was the case--as I do like the precision brush and the way the liner worked at first.</li>
            <li> This is my first liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> (I thought it wouldn&#x27;t last more than a month or so).</li>
            <li> All in all, I love this product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> If the staying power was stronger I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li> It stays on my lids pretty well, and doesn&#x27;t travel at all.  </li>
            <li> I only use liquid pen eyeliners and over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many many many brands from drugstores (Revlon, L&#x27;oreal, Maybelline, NYX, Almay) to higher end ones (Japanese brands, Urban Decay, Dior, Stila, etc).</li>
            <li> It is super easy to apply, Thanks to the smart design of making it like  regular eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super black and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and dark, and it&#x27;s CRUELTY-FREE.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a good eyeliner and this one finally worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply in a nice thin line.</li>
            <li> I am such a huge fan of this product, and I will absolutely recommend it to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> so much I dont mind spending the money for another.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really noticeable to anyone but me.</li>
            <li> I gave a couple more tries and every time I would wear this eyeliner it smudges.</li>
            <li> When you have folds in your skin as you age the lines end up very jagged.</li>
            <li> I really like the applicator</li>
            <li> Draws a straight line and doesn&#x27;t smear throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner goes on very black and easy, but fades quickly, even with primer.  </li>
            <li> this is the first &#x27;felt tip&#x27; liner that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m so delighted with the thin tip so that I can apply my outward points.</li>
            <li> Stayed on all day, easy to apply, and a nice dark black color.</li>
            <li> It was just like new again!  </li>
            <li> Love the black.</li>
            <li> Only have a 4 star because it seems to run out quick.</li>
            <li> but it is thicker which I enjoy more than a thin eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> pen is great because it makes application a breeze, but it&#x27;s staying power is not impressive and it&#x27;s also not waterproof.</li>
            <li> Even better, it&#x27;s half the cost of the Stila pen!</li>
            <li> I am usually awful with liquid eyeliner, but this is great to handle with a nice steady line.</li>
            <li> felt tip can dry out quickly if you don&#x27;t store it correctly</li>
            <li> This liner delivers: long-lasting, thin to thick coverage, great leverage (feels good in the hand, allows for a steady line), and the dramatic effect is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super dark, goes on really well, and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> Eventually Stila came out with their pen, and since Stila can do no wrong with me, I tried it and was instantly converted.</li>
            <li> I tried shaking the tube, and even turning the tube upside down overnight to see if it would come back, but it is still very light.</li>
            <li> Its so easy to use, the color is very black and it never smudges.</li>
            <li> Only thing is a wish is was a little more matte</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s extremely accurate, and soft, but firm.</li>
            <li> but I was surprised when I opened it</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have young eyes and have lots of old skin to cover.</li>
            <li> I started with Urban Decay&#x27;s liquid eyeliner, which was first in a small pot with a brush, and then it changed and was only okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this liner on a whim, and I&#x27;ve had no trouble at all controlling it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because the Milani liquid eyeliner in brush form is the only drugstore eyeliner that really stays on me, but it&#x27;s a pain to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My previous favorite, Pump Up semi-permanent liner, also lasts all day, but is more difficult to remove than the Milani.</li>
            <li> I have good control, creating a thin or thick line as needed, it lasts for a long time throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
            <li> tip liners thinking they dry up, but they really aren&#x27;t.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually lasts, even onto the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;Saves SO MUCH time too.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with it is that it didn&#x27;t dry very fast.</li>
            <li> I am usually not coordinated enough to use liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> $10 isn&#x27;t bad at all for this great eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really use any makeup outside of the occasional swipe of mascara until recently.  </li>
            <li> I was a very early convert to the liquid eyeliner revival back in 2008, so I have been through a number of different products in my time.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a liner that goes on smoothly and is truly waterproof (and I have seriously tried them all), this is the one.</li>
            <li> Dries out too quick, hard to work with.</li>
            <li> It really is the blackest black, does not smear and removes with ease.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really long lasting.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I bought a Loreal one just like it and it lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> I can hold this steady much easier than I can a brush, the point is super long and very thin, it is easy to get at the base of your lashes.</li>
            <li> I usually have to go over my line a few times to get it as dark and filled in as I want, and it fades and creases</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of applying my eye liner with a angled brush and tube gel liner.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last AS LONG as the other stuff I use, and sometimes it like smudges up onto my eye lid as the day goes on, like splitchy marks that I have to wipe away.</li>
            <li> My usual liner smudges a bit after a few hours, but this really did last all day.</li>
            <li> The only occasions I have noticed smudging were in extreme heat or rain, which makes sense as it is not waterproof.  </li>
            <li> It is waterproof and lasts a very long time and Doesn&#x27;t fade off during the day.</li>
            <li> although it takes longer to dry, it leaves the time to fix eye liner</li>
            <li> Once dry, it stays in place well.  </li>
            <li> This eye liner pen has an ultra thin tip and a gradual widening that makes going from a thin line at the inner corner of the top eyelid to a wider line at the outer.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done but after it dries its almost like a grey or dark grey color.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it does dry out faster than other liners</li>
            <li> It glides on well and is EXTREMELY pigmented.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, not too wet, not too dry.  </li>
            <li> Even at these times, smudging was minimal (not running down my face).  </li>
            <li> This point is very thin and requires that you go over the line several times to complete it, and you guessed it, a thick line requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I ended up with some transfer in my creases, but it wasn&#x27;t too dark.</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> I have a non-active job and had to reaply this 3 times in an 8-hr shift because it had faded to a dark gray instead of</li>
            <li> The color is dark and buildable and I haven&#x27;t had any smudging with it.</li>
            <li> I heard about this liner from a blog user and I have to agree, hands down</li>
            <li> and I had black under my eyes.</li>
            <li> (I had gone back to Urban Decay, and I was not impressed with the quality.)</li>
            <li> But after an hour and a half of wearing it it already began to fade and come off.</li>
            <li> black-</li>
            <li> My only negative comment is that it seemed to have very little liquid in the tube after a few uses.</li>
            <li> the color is very dark and not shiny and even with my watery eyes it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> for almost 6 months, and I wear eyeliner EVERYDAY.  </li>
            <li> A month or so ago, I thought the tip dried up, but when I pressed the edges of the felt, you could tell there was still a lot of liquid liner in there.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the line being uneven.</li>
            <li> I can create a wing in half the time with this pen than I was with a brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an eyeliner junkie and usually use gel eyeliner with the brush.  </li>
            <li> (however, it usually lasts me 2+</li>
            <li> Tip is too hard for me</li>
            <li> unlike the thick liquid eyeliner this one is thinner and can control the amount you want to apply</li>
            <li> I, seriously, recommend this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The tip is very thin and the color is dark as intended.</li>
            <li> It goes on as thick or thin as you need it always.</li>
            <li> That can get a little inconvenient sometimes</li>
            <li> As dramatic as you want it to be.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the staying power.  </li>
            <li> So I do not recommend wearing this eyeliner to any sad movies or to the pool.</li>
            <li> And I had expensive primer on!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unlike the Milani pencil, their liquid Eye Tech liner has a nice slim brush for fine application which is great. My only negative comment is that it seemed to have very little liquid in the tube after a few uses. I wasn&#x27;t able to get a nice black line, only more of a light gray-ish liquid. I tried shaking the tube, and even turning the tube upside down overnight to see if it would come back, but it is still very light. So, I may have just received a defective one. I may order one again, to see if that was the case--as I do like the precision brush and the way the liner worked at first.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but comes off easily with water or tears. It&#x27;s supposed to be waterproof.</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner. It&#x27;s lasts all day without smudging.</li>
            <li> Milani eyeliners are the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and this one is no exception. Its so easy to use, the color is very black and it never smudges. The eyeliner goes on smooth and easy, as long as you have a steady hand, it will look perfect every time. Even over eyeshadow! I would recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome, crisp, jet black liquid liner.</li>
            <li> Great easy to use, highly pigmented, it&#x27;s what I wanted! Great for my go to winged eyeliner look.</li>
            <li> Love this eye liner!  Won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> Went from liquid liner applied by a brush, to this pen.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect Cat eyes, every time. Actually lasts, even onto the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;Saves SO MUCH time too. love love love</li>
            <li> This is my favorite liquid eyeliner. It is super easy to apply, Thanks to the smart design of making it like  regular eyeliner. It also has a gripped handle to make it even easier to apply. It is waterproof and lasts a very long time and Doesn&#x27;t fade off during the day. It is fine tip so it goes on very smoothly and evenly. You can&#x27;t get a better liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Only eyeliner I use! Waterproof and lasts all day! It does run out quicker than I hoped BUT I like the eyeliner so much I dont mind spending the money for another. I have gone through about 6 in about 6 months..</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a good eyeliner and this one finally worked. I have good control, creating a thin or thick line as needed, it lasts for a long time throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first liquid eyeliner. It&#x27;s really easy to use and i love the color. I thought it was just one eyeliner but I was surprised when I opened it and there was 3! I will totally order this agin!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, looks great, lasts long.  Only reason why it has 4 stars is that I think that this can be found in a convenience store for likely a lower price.</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had ! Buy it you will not regret it .</li>
            <li> I started looking for a liquid eyeliner since my pencil would always smear and I had black under my eyes. Not wanting to look like a football player...I tried this product based on the reviews. It&#x27;s easy to apply in a nice thin line. I&#x27;ve used it daily since purchasing it and it&#x27;s still not gone...(I thought it wouldn&#x27;t last more than a month or so). I will definitely purchase it again, it doesn&#x27;t smear like my pencil used to.</li>
            <li> My eyes water when I yawn, so I&#x27;ve always had to wear waterproof eye make up.  This liner is fantastic.  Easy to use and, unlike another reviewer&#x27;s experience, it lasted quite a while before drying out.</li>
            <li> Love it. Wish it was in local stores.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this line is. It&#x27;s pretty easy to control, and the lines come out really even. It&#x27;s really long lasting. My usual liner smudges a bit after a few hours, but this really did last all day. The only problem I had with it is that it didn&#x27;t dry very fast. I ended up with some transfer in my creases, but it wasn&#x27;t too dark. It wasn&#x27;t really noticeable to anyone but me. All in all, I love this product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!. I use the Milani 24 hr liquid liner as well, and that was what got me hooked on the Milani line. It doesn&#x27;t last AS LONG as the other stuff I use, and sometimes it like smudges up onto my eye lid as the day goes on, like splitchy marks that I have to wipe away. I try not to put the liner on the part of my eye that touches my lid when it&#x27;s open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love the marker point, it&#x27;s extremely accurate, and soft, but firm. Love the black.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product on I  loved it but as the end of the day I noticed the eyeliner was smudging all over the top of my eye... I gave a couple more tries and every time I would wear this eyeliner it smudges. Not worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used liquid eye liner for years...this is the first &#x27;felt tip&#x27; liner that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m so delighted with the thin tip so that I can apply my outward points. It does fairly well in the &#x27;waterproof&#x27; department too.</li>
            <li> I am totally happy with this eyeliner. It goes on exceptionally well.  I am 61 so I don&#x27;t have young eyes and have lots of old skin to cover. LOL  It&#x27;s not like when you&#x27;re young and it makes a perfect line. When you have folds in your skin as you age the lines end up very jagged. This goes on very smooth and the easiest one I have ever used. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Application is very smooth and easy.  The tip does not bend when applying to the eyelid or inner rim of your eyes.  I was not impressed with the staying power.  It smudges easily after it should have already set.  If the staying power was stronger I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this eyeliner. I was a very early convert to the liquid eyeliner revival back in 2008, so I have been through a number of different products in my time. I started with Urban Decay&#x27;s liquid eyeliner, which was first in a small pot with a brush, and then it changed and was only okay. Eventually Stila came out with their pen, and since Stila can do no wrong with me, I tried it and was instantly converted. That is also a great product, and I wouldn&#x27;t have stopped using it except that I decided to only use cruelty-free cosmetics. That Stila eyeliner was the only product I missed...until I found Milani&#x27;s eyeliner pen. I saw an infographic on Pinterest demonstrating cruelty-free alternatives to cult favorite beauty products, and immediately bought this pen. (I had gone back to Urban Decay, and I was not impressed with the quality.) It&#x27;s smooth, easy to apply, super precise, and has a gripper on the pen. It&#x27;s nice and dark, and it&#x27;s CRUELTY-FREE. Honestly, I don&#x27;t notice a difference from the Stila product. Even better, it&#x27;s half the cost of the Stila pen! I am such a huge fan of this product, and I will absolutely recommend it to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> Love this! As dramatic as you want it to be. It&#x27;s easy to apply with a felt tip that is very tapered allowing for fine lines, or apply thicker if you wish. I have had no problem with flaking.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really use any makeup outside of the occasional swipe of mascara until recently.  I bought this liner on a whim, and I&#x27;ve had no trouble at all controlling it.  It&#x27;s felt tipped and goes on liquid, but dries well.  It stays on my lids pretty well, and doesn&#x27;t travel at all.  I would give this product 5 stars if not for the price.</li>
            <li> The product shipped very quick. I am usually awful with liquid eyeliner, but this is great to handle with a nice steady line.</li>
            <li> I would have really liked this product if it had more staying power. I really like the applicator and it is very easy to use. But after an hour and a half of wearing it it already began to fade and come off. It also comes off very easily with water or any liquid. So I do not recommend wearing this eyeliner to any sad movies or to the pool. I would not recommend buying this product simply because it does not last.</li>
            <li> Love it! It lasts all day without running! It goes on as thick or thin as you need it always.</li>
            <li> The tip is very thin and the color is dark as intended. although it takes longer to dry, it leaves the time to fix eye liner</li>
            <li> this eyeliner makes just the right size line with ease and stays on all day. i will continue to purchase this style.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner the tip is very fine and not flimsy the color is very dark and not shiny and even with my watery eyes it lasts all day. Only thing is a wish is was a little more matte but overall this is a great eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I thought this eyeliner was going to be more stubborn to get off. But that&#x27;s not the case, at alllll. It glides on well and is EXTREMELY pigmented. Wonderful quality. I would given it a 3 star, but it&#x27;s not the sellers fault because of the brand. They delivered it way before time, and did it was still perfectly in the package. The seller is great!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;For $7, this eyeliner is great.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;Matte color.&lt;br /&gt;Very flexible felt tip.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t tug or pull on eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;When it does run out, it runs out in the most important part, the very tip of the pen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one and a Stila liquid eyeliner and I have to say this one is better! And the price is so much better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The tip is super flexible which makes it easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;-stays put&lt;br /&gt;-nice color&lt;br /&gt;-nice grip</li>
            <li> I have hooded monolids, so most eyeliner creases on me. I bought this because the Milani liquid eyeliner in brush form is the only drugstore eyeliner that really stays on me, but it&#x27;s a pain to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pen is great because it makes application a breeze, but it&#x27;s staying power is not impressive and it&#x27;s also not waterproof. I usually have to go over my line a few times to get it as dark and filled in as I want, and it fades and creases rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have hooded eyelids, this will probably work just fine for you. If not, stick to the brush-form.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This eye liner pen has an ultra thin tip and a gradual widening that makes going from a thin line at the inner corner of the top eyelid to a wider line at the outer. One stroke is all you need! It&#x27;s super black and goes on very smoothly. It really is a great product!</li>
            <li> This point is very thin and requires that you go over the line several times to complete it, and you guessed it, a thick line requires multiple passes. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner!! Easiest to precisely put on. Only have a 4 star because it seems to run out quick.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite eyeliner!  It goes on super smoothly and evenly and the long tapered applicator is perfect for the cat-eye look.  Once dry, it stays in place well.  The only occasions I have noticed smudging were in extreme heat or rain, which makes sense as it is not waterproof.  Even at these times, smudging was minimal (not running down my face).  The price is fantastic.  I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye liner for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t want to deal with liquid liners, but wants a sharper, more vivid effect than  with standard pencil or stick liners. It&#x27;s smooth and fluid, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner I have found, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  It goes on easily, not too wet, not too dry.  The applicator tip is easy to work with to create a nice line.  I will continue to use this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> pretty good for the price i did have to reapply throughout the day though</li>
            <li> this stays on all day, even through the summer! this eyeliner will last you about two months! I will be repurchasing in the future!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye liners I have ever used and I have used MANY eye liners from drugstore brands to department store brands and brands you purchase at Sephora. This eye liner is easy to use, goes on well, stays on all day, looks great, has a nice &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; quality of black pigment and cost less than $10.00.It is sold at drugstores, Target and Walmart, however,  I have to order it online, becasue it is always sold out at those stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MFD</li>
            <li> Love this pen !!! Works great ! Easy to make cat eyes</li>
            <li> this is the best eyeliner, easy to use and apply with the fine soft point and this liquid eyeliner is one of very few that does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Works just as good, if not better, than eye liners that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an eyeliner junkie and usually use gel eyeliner with the brush.  That can get a little inconvenient sometimes so I decided to try this stuff out.  The eyeliner goes on very black and easy, but fades quickly, even with primer.  I have a non-active job and had to reaply this 3 times in an 8-hr shift because it had faded to a dark gray instead of black- And I had expensive primer on!  For the price its o.k but I am going to stick with my gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this eyeliner I bought it after my kat Von d eyeliner ran out as a cheap animal cruelty free alternative and it&#x27;s not as good as kat Von d eyeliner but it is thicker which I enjoy more than a thin eyeliner. Overall it&#x27;s a great price and it&#x27;s not tested on animals:)</li>
            <li> Dries out too quick, hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of applying my eye liner with a angled brush and tube gel liner. I decided to give this a try and it applies easily and stays on well. I will definitely be reordering this product</li>
            <li> This liner has become my new favorite. It lasts all day and is easy to apply. My previous favorite, Pump Up semi-permanent liner, also lasts all day, but is more difficult to remove than the Milani. I plan to order more when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I have ever used. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done but after it dries its almost like a grey or dark grey color. it does not flake or anything and easy to apply. I just wish it was darker. I am using it to dip in my eye studio tub of black eyeliner and its a awesome brush for eyeliner in general (:</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it does dry out faster than other liners and I wish there were more colors to choose from. However, if you are looking for a liner that goes on smoothly and is truly waterproof (and I have seriously tried them all), this is the one.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use but smears as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeliner! I use it for every day makeup. It really is the blackest black, does not smear and removes with ease. The pointy pen makes application a breeze and I have not had any issue with loss of ink. It does state to store HORIZONTALLY, so that could be the problem for some.</li>
            <li> Loooved this eyeliner!! It&#x27;s also a great price! All day wear,  smudge proof and n n III smearing. I would definitely order this item again.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister so i did not use it but she says it is good so no complains on it.</li>
            <li> Draws a straight line and doesn&#x27;t smear throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this same eyeliner- literally, the same pen- for almost 6 months, and I wear eyeliner EVERYDAY.  This stuff is great.  Lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, but it still washes off nicely.  A month or so ago, I thought the tip dried up, but when I pressed the edges of the felt, you could tell there was still a lot of liquid liner in there.  So, I put it under running water for a split second and wiped the tip with a paper towel.  It was just like new again!  I think a lot of people throw out their liquid felt tip liners thinking they dry up, but they really aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m picky, and I love this.  Bold color</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and is very even. Takes the guess work out of liquid eyeliner. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> most accurate eye liner. no smell and no smudge.  unlike the thick liquid eyeliner this one is thinner and can control the amount you want to apply</li>
            <li> So easy to use! I love it. I can hold this steady much easier than I can a brush, the point is super long and very thin, it is easy to get at the base of your lashes. I can create a wing in half the time with this pen than I was with a brush! The color is dark and buildable and I haven&#x27;t had any smudging with it. This is my first Milani product and I can&#x27;t wait to try more!</li>
            <li> Loved this eyeliner. I am usually not coordinated enough to use liquid eyeliner but this one works great and goes on smoothly so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the line being uneven.</li>
            <li> Tip is too hard for me</li>
            <li> I only use liquid pen eyeliners and over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many many many brands from drugstores (Revlon, L&#x27;oreal, Maybelline, NYX, Almay) to higher end ones (Japanese brands, Urban Decay, Dior, Stila, etc). I have never found a liquid liner that is as good at Milani&#x27;s and I keep finding myself coming back to this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;- lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;- does not smear, or &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;- inexpensive (around $10~)&lt;br /&gt;- very easy to use, goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;- sharp bold lines for the perfect winged eyeliner look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;- not waterproof&lt;br /&gt;- felt tip can dry out quickly if you don&#x27;t store it correctly (however, it usually lasts me 2+ months)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best value for the best liner!</li>
            <li> Just purchased this eye liner and I have to say this is a great find.  This liner delivers: long-lasting, thin to thick coverage, great leverage (feels good in the hand, allows for a steady line), and the dramatic effect is fantastic.  I heard about this liner from a blog user and I have to agree, hands down, this is a great liner for the price.  I&#x27;ve used some of the big names out there (Lancome, Chanel, Smashbox) and this tops them all.  Wish I found it sooner.</li>
            <li> I just love this eyeliner. it&#x27;s super dark, goes on really well, and doesn&#x27;t smudge. I&#x27;m not a fan of felt tipped eyeliner, I prefer using a brush. but this tip is so pointed, I just had to try it. it took me awhile, but I got the hang of it. my cat eye eyeliner came out great. I got compliments on them. $10 isn&#x27;t bad at all for this great eyeliner. I, seriously, recommend this eyeliner. as well as brand.</li>
            <li> I loved this eyeliner. The only complaint I have is that I bought a Loreal one just like it and it lasted much longer. This eyeliner pen should include more product for the price. Otherwise it was great. Stayed on all day, easy to apply, and a nice dark black color. I would probably not purchase this again though because the Loreal one was cheaper, worked just as good, but lasted alot longer.</li>
            <li> The best I try so far , it&#x27;s precise and it stays on all day works magic for me !!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner ever. Just buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> love this product- this eyeliner is perfect- affordable, easy to use glider pen, one of my favorite milani purchases by far</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It goes on smooth and stays all day.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably stock up on this item</li>
