            <li>but the scents are nice and we both crakced up about it.  </li>
            <li>All the scents were nice....</li>
            <li>Nice spray mechs and the smell is DELISH on all four vials.</li>
            <li>I have a favorite out of the set but great buy great price and would buy and recommend very highly</li>
            <li>I love Cuba for Men - all of these smell nice.</li>
            <li>Love it Than u amazon</li>
            <li>The orange smelled okay, sorta like an orange soda, but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it as a fragrance.</li>
            <li>I know all the men in my family will love these...</li>
            <li>Functioned better for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I love that smell.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the purchase...</li>
            <li>to by more thx</li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>Lovely packaging though.</li>
            <li>I ordered this by mistake and because of the &amp;#34;DE TOILETTE&amp;#34;  is mostly alcohol</li>
            <li>Will purchase more.</li>
            <li>okay, we did keep them</li>
            <li>but they popped up when he did a search for Cigars, his own fault for not reading the full description and hilarious when they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Told</li>
            <li>A pleasant smelling scented gift set that looks like real cigars.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of cigars and tobacco you will be a huge fan of this set.</li>
            <li>I have this to my husband as a Christmas present and he loved it!</li>
            <li>and this is the 5th time I am buying it as a quick go to scent!  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>but this is a cheap winner..  </li>
            <li>My husband and son love this and the price is just right .</li>
            <li>The set would be better if it came with some kind of durable case, opening and closing the paper case ruins it over time, I&#x27;d recommend a nice cup or something like that to display them in on the dresser/ bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and made a great present!</li>
            <li>I love 3 of the 4 and the fourth is pretty good to give away as a gift.  </li>
            <li>Four large glass cigar vials are ADORABLE.</li>
            <li>amazing classy for the price</li>
            <li>Love the small compact size...and the smell great.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s begging for more and wants to know where did I get it.</li>
            <li>To me the only good scent is the Cuba Gold in this collection.</li>
            <li>:) I hope he likes them haha</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good starter pack for someone wanting to sample the different scents.</li>
            <li>I think the quality is good but the instruction is not clear.</li>
            <li>thanks !!</li>
            <li>Price great, scents great, just dont last long enough.</li>
            <li>The smells are amazing and the packaging is solid.  </li>
            <li>only looks nice</li>
            <li>This was a fun gift for my friend...</li>
            <li>was a fresh, daytime scent.&lt;br /&gt;Red</li>
            <li>descriptions should be more clear</li>
            <li>Took forever to get this but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>My baby smellin right</li>
            <li>Last year, I purchased a set for my boyfriend, he likes all but one of the scents, which he described as an &#x27;old man&#x27; smell, but I think they all smell pretty good.</li>
            <li>The person I bought it for enjoys it very much.</li>
            <li>So cute, no smell or second hand smoke; what else could you ask for.</li>
            <li>My husband is pretty fussy when it come to perfumes.</li>
            <li>Once you find the ones you like, however, recommend getting the LARGE bottles for daily use, much better price per ounce than singles.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I bought one of these for both my husband and son, and not only is the packaging cool looking, but (almost) all of the different scents are amazing.</li>
            <li>the gold one was a little girly...but other than that they were great!</li>
            <li>These Cigars will certainly turn heads.</li>
            <li>If you want a subtle fragrance for your husband, sons, dad&#x27;s or any gentleman you know, these are amazing!</li>
            <li>Works as designed, thanks for making this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Thought they were real</li>
            <li>they were real cigars.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it this way so that I could get an idea of which scents I really like on him, and I think my personal favorites are Cuba original and</li>
            <li>I love other more expensive fragrances more than these...  </li>
            <li>My husband enjoyed this little gift</li>
            <li>cigars n was very surprised they were cologne.</li>
            <li>They are good looking and very cool, but each scent is very manly, expensive smelling and different from each other.</li>
            <li>I like every scent but the blue but its so much cheaper to buy this 4 pack.</li>
            <li>I was reallly surprised when they came</li>
            <li>and she got so surprised when I have them to her.</li>
            <li>For the price it can&#x27;t be beat, he usually keeps one in the car and easy to travel with too.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son and I&#x27;m surprised he got it because we keep sniffing, and couldn&#x27;t get enough.</li>

            <li> The scent does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Instead of Cuba, as in I do not live in Cuba.....</li>
            <li> Sizes wasnt what I expected , but ok.&lt;br /&gt;It seem as if I did not see ar read that tell you the sizes</li>
            <li> The others were very sharp and I&#x27;m a fan of the sweeter fragrances.</li>
            <li> less than 3 bucks a fragrance.</li>
            <li> One of them is a little feminine</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these, going to give them as gifts to a few of my Uncles.</li>
            <li> WASTED MY HARD EARNED $s.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product, I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> He uses them everyday!</li>
            <li> would improve this set would be including the aluminum &amp;#34;cigar tubes&amp;#34; that the singles usually come in.</li>
            <li> The orange one was not to my taste at all, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that someone else might not love it.</li>
            <li> When they got here I was very disappointed in myself for not reading the whole description before I bought it...</li>
            <li> expensive for dollar store scents</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong..</li>
            <li> Oh and it smells horrible unless you want 4 shades of musk.</li>

So thought I may like some of the others. The rest weren&#x27;t my cup of tea. The orange smelled okay, sorta like an orange soda, but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it as a fragrance. The others were very sharp and I&#x27;m a fan of the sweeter fragrances.</li>
            <li> These Cigars will certainly turn heads. A pleasant smelling scented gift set that looks like real cigars. So cute, no smell or second hand smoke; what else could you ask for. I know all the men in my family will love these... Birdie Gee</li>
            <li> Works as designed, thanks for making this product. Perfectly priced. This is a must have product, I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> This is a very good option for giving a gift. All of the perfums in the set are nice. Good purchase!</li>
            <li> great prices smells great</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for both my husband and son, and not only is the packaging cool looking, but (almost) all of the different scents are amazing. The orange one was not to my taste at all, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that someone else might not love it. Great gift at a great price!</li>
            <li> If you want a subtle fragrance for your husband, sons, dad&#x27;s or any gentleman you know, these are amazing! They are not over powering at all. Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I like every scent but the blue but its so much cheaper to buy this 4 pack.</li>
            <li> item was smaller  than  I thought but my husband liked it.</li>
            <li> The person I bought it for enjoys it very much.</li>
            <li> Great scents and a good price..</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these, going to give them as gifts to a few of my Uncles. Last year, I purchased a set for my boyfriend, he likes all but one of the scents, which he described as an &#x27;old man&#x27; smell, but I think they all smell pretty good. The set would be better if it came with some kind of durable case, opening and closing the paper case ruins it over time, I&#x27;d recommend a nice cup or something like that to display them in on the dresser/ bathroom counter. Functioned better for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my cousin for Xmas n he loved it looked just like cigars n was very surprised they were cologne. They also smelled great lol this was a great gift</li>
            <li> I love that smell. and so do the ladies</li>
            <li> My husband and son love this and the price is just right .</li>
            <li> I bought these because I thought they were actually cigars. When they got here I was very disappointed in myself for not reading the whole description before I bought it... once I opened them snd smelt it I was pleased with the purchase... these smells were awesome and I eould recommend them to others</li>
            <li> I have this to my husband as a Christmas present and he loved it! He uses them everyday! Good purchase!</li>
            <li> Thought 100% these were cigars. Low and behold, it is cologne. Touché Cuba by men...fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me!</li>
            <li> My husband loves these! Loves the sizes and scents.</li>
            <li> Thought they were real</li>
            <li> amazing classy for the price.... great.</li>
            <li> Nice i like send me at imal when u have exp to by more thx</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a blonde...I bought these thinking they were real cigars. I got then for my hubby and a v-day gift I gave then a 4 star because they smelt good and the packaging was nice :) I hope he likes them haha</li>
            <li> I love this spray. It&#x27;s a good starter pack for someone wanting to sample the different scents. Once you find the ones you like, however, recommend getting the LARGE bottles for daily use, much better price per ounce than singles.&lt;br /&gt;What would improve this set would be including the aluminum &amp;#34;cigar tubes&amp;#34; that the singles usually come in. Makes it handy to carry in a jacket poket, keep a spare in your golve box, or to throw in your gym bag or suitcase.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BOTHER ORDERING THIS ITEM. IT IS UNRETURNABLE. WHO KNEW. WASTED MY HARD EARNED $s.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  I purchased it this way so that I could get an idea of which scents I really like on him, and I think my personal favorites are Cuba original and blue-- in fact, I think I&#x27;ll buy him a regular bottle of the Cuba blue I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> My husband is pretty fussy when it come to perfumes. He likes these and likes their prices too. So try you won&#x27; t regret it, besides you don&#x27;t have to break the bank to get the set.</li>
            <li> Nice and warm scents. Smells like a man.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last very long. A couple of hours tops. Lovely packaging though.</li>
            <li> I love Cuba for Men - all of these smell nice. My husband gets them every year for Christmas and loves it. I think he hates that I call it Cuba, as in Cuba Gooding Jr. Instead of Cuba, as in I do not live in Cuba.....</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake and because of the &amp;#34;DE TOILETTE&amp;#34;  is mostly alcohol it is not returnable.  Something about hazardous material.  Oh and it smells horrible unless you want 4 shades of musk.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product was excellent.</li>
            <li> Love the small compact size...and the smell great.</li>
            <li> Get complements all day</li>
            <li> Every thing perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Got this today for Christmas.  The smells are amazing and the packaging is solid.  Thinking about ordering another set just to have a backup.  If you love the smell of cigars and tobacco you will be a huge fan of this set.</li>
            <li> This was a fun gift for my friend...He actually thought it was Cuban Cigars.....I got a good laugh on that!!!</li>
            <li> great price, cute bottling. My husband enjoyed this little gift</li>
            <li> Good aromas, easy to use, great price. Reminds me of my heritage as I am cuban by birth.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> As embarrassing as this is, I ordered these for my boyfriend thinking they were actually cigars.  I was reallly surprised when they came but the scents are nice and we both crakced up about it.  One of them is a little feminine so I hijacked it and wear it myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loved it. The Orange is the best. The Blue/Silver is not so great.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase however,  house was robbed and it was stolen. Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> expensive for dollar store scents</li>
            <li> All the scents were nice....the gold one was a little girly...but other than that they were great! My brother LOVED them.&lt;br /&gt;Blue was a fresh, daytime scent.&lt;br /&gt;Red and orange smelled similar: musky...definitely for going out at night.</li>
            <li> they wrote it as cigars but turns put they are just scents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The descriptions should be more clear</li>
            <li> They smell  like I  paid $180  for them.  Um glad I found these at this price! ... my man is happy I find them at this price too!!</li>
            <li> My baby smellin right these days lol the Cuba tubes give variety and she got so surprised when I have them to her. Awesome. Shea.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, the package arrived in perfect condition to my country .. thanks !!</li>
            <li> My husband thought he was ordering Cigars!&lt;br /&gt;THESE Are Not, they are Mens Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;They smell okay, we did keep them but they popped up when he did a search for Cigars, his own fault for not reading the full description and hilarious when they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Told him Cologne is much better for his health!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and so do I. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat, he usually keeps one in the car and easy to travel with too.</li>
            <li> For the Price... You cannot go wrong.. I love 3 of the 4 and the fourth is pretty good to give away as a gift.  less than 3 bucks a fragrance. and this is the 5th time I am buying it as a quick go to scent!  I love other more expensive fragrances more than these...  but this is a cheap winner..  get some and see for yourself</li>
            <li> Took forever to get this but well worth the wait. Four large glass cigar vials are ADORABLE. Nice spray mechs and the smell is DELISH on all four vials. I knocked out four gifts with this one purchase and they were a big hit with everyone. WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father in law as a gift. He actually grew up wearing this stuff so He loved it. I will admit it smells great!</li>
