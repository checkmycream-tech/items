            <li>These little cases are GREAT!</li>
            <li>They are so cute and useful.</li>
            <li>These cases are super cute and very versatile!!</li>
            <li>Not only is it great for travel but good for organizing they are great for things other that makeup such as jewelry, hair accessories, nail polishes, ect.</li>
            <li>The clear part of the case is not glass which I liked.  </li>
            <li>How cute and you can see thru it to make sure you have everything inside instead of having to open the case which is a neat approch.</li>
            <li>You will know exactly where each make up is located at!</li>
            <li>each case is easy to open and easy to lock (the largest two have locks)</li>
            <li>The days of fumbling through organizers for the right colors, for the right look on the right days are gone.  </li>
            <li>Almost snaps the lid off if I do not close it slooooowly and line the edges up just right.</li>
            <li>I love clear cases for my makeup, it just makes it that much easier to see what you are grabbing at instead of rummaging through drawers until you find what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>The way I can out my makeup by category makes my job so much easier!</li>
            <li>and they look so cute next to each other stuffed with you favorite shany cosmetics products!</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that you get three different sizes, making this product much more versatile.</li>
            <li>Very durable and never goes out of style!</li>
            <li>now all, I have to do is keep the key somewhere safe.</li>
            <li>I love that this comes with all three sizes because I never know how light or heavy I am packing, now I can have an option.</li>
            <li>I use one for nail polish at work (makes it easy for my co-workers to grab and go as well), and filled the other two with Christmas gifts of nail polish, and makeup stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love them the big one i can put nail polish in or anything and the other 2 are just so cute</li>
            <li>Have their own little lock.</li>
            <li>These cases come with no makeup in there and are just clear plastic and aren&#x27;t worth $1 don&#x27;t buy at all,</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend getting these or giving as a gift!</li>
            <li>These cases are very well made</li>
            <li>Thought the largest one would work for nail polish plus, but really doesn&#x27;t hold a lot.</li>
            <li>Was excited I love the sizes and the lock/key feature I have younger sibblings and they like getting in things they are not supposed too, this will deffenitely keep them out although the smalk is a bit to small</li>
            <li>I keep all these of these cases out on my dresser and they&#x27;ve simplified my morning routine; now I don&#x27;t have to dig through a draw full of random makeup - everything is organized nicely.</li>
            <li>Clear is cool cause when you grab something you can see what you are grabing without having to open it.</li>
            <li>It comes in three sizes which makes it easy to separate larger creams from tiny lip glosses from long-ish length mascara.</li>
            <li>These are great little boxes, and they are little compared to what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Look at these Clear Cosmetic Cases!</li>
            <li>The clear boxes let you see what you have inside.</li>
            <li>and I like that they&#x27;re clear.</li>
            <li>its clear</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the two largest had locks</li>
            <li>It helps you keep it, well organized haha, obviously.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 4 year old girls.  </li>
            <li>and i love showing it off to other people i absolutely was bouncing up and down when the mail man came saying package for me!</li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;re an actual make-up artist or your have so much makeup that you might as well be one (I count myself in this second category)</li>
            <li>I also like the idea that it was clear so that my nieces could decorate the outside as they wished.  </li>
            <li>If I had a lot of nail polish tubes, I would get this product, because it is clear, therefore, it enables the user to see the different products at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I was a little upset that I paid so much for them, thinking that they would&#x27;ve been bigger.</li>

            <li> A Great Variety Set! The clear boxes let you see what you have inside. Great when your in a rush. Very durable and never goes out of style!</li>
            <li> Look at these Clear Cosmetic Cases! How cute and you can see thru it to make sure you have everything inside instead of having to open the case which is a neat approch. This is a great way to make you keep your make up organized or you will feel embarrassed i know i would.</li>
            <li> $25 for 3 cases, talk about a great deal. 1 large, 1 medium, and 1 small. You could put a lot of things in there and its transparent so you know what&#x27;s in there. I like the small one so i could put nail polishes in there and bring it with me on a vacation and it wont be an hassle !</li>
            <li> These cases are super cute and very versatile!! You can store virtually anything in them and have the convenience of seeing where everything is and not having to dig!! Def recommend!</li>

            <li> They are smaller than they appear but they are just the cutest. They still have a lot of space and it easier to know what&#x27;s inside because they are transparent. Luv them!</li>
            <li> I helps tokeep her things off the counter top and the she loved it as a gift. Thought they were bigger in the picture.</li>
            <li> I love them the big one i can put nail polish in or anything and the other 2 are just so cute i like that you can see through them so i dont have to dig around for stuff i can just pick them up and look</li>
            <li> These cases are very well made and I like that they&#x27;re clear. The medium one fits inside the largest one, and the smallest one fits inside the medium one.  The smallest one is so small, it hardly holds anything.  My only criticism is the size of the smallest case.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my cases in the mail! Was excited I love the sizes and the lock/key feature I have younger sibblings and they like getting in things they are not supposed too, this will deffenitely keep them out although the smalk is a bit to small but I cant complain it was a great deal and im really satisfied, now all, I have to do is keep the key somewhere safe.

            <li> i love this product it makes carrying makeup easy! its clear so i can see whats in it and i love showing it off to other people i absolutely was bouncing up and down when the mail man came saying package for me! yayayay</li>
            <li> I love matching sets! Clear is cool cause when you grab something you can see what you are grabing without having to open it. They are so cute and useful. I use it everyday.</li>
