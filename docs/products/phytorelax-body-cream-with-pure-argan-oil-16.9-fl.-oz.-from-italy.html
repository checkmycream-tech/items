            <li>and it was so good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happy with its continued use, as the bottle has a lot of product.&lt;br</li>

            <li>This one&#x27;s the best thus far.</li>
            <li>Great healthy ingredients like sweet almond oil</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is more moisturized</li>
            <li>, I love almond oil.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels and smells after using this product.</li>
            <li>Has a nice, light smell and is not too oily.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will be recommending to all my friends and family.  </li>
            <li>I do love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better lotions than this one, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li>i am fully satisfied with purchases.</li>
            <li>i love this product  -it</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>love this product....</li>
            <li>so I use another product (Argan Magic Body Lotion) as a body lotion during the winter months.</li>
            <li>The cream is not oily; my skin is looking and feeling so much more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In regard to shipping, it arrived very quickly</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and disappears into the skin immediately.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and does not leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>Rich.</li>
            <li>She got it at a retail store, but I was lucky to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and it absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>It is fragrant, so absorbable and easy to use leaving my skin very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is light, clean and fresh; very feminine.  </li>
            <li>But it is worth it.</li>
            <li>not one worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It conditions my skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>so much i give it out as gift to my family and friends!</li>
            <li>T J Maxx sells it at a much lower cost than here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Some have come reasonably close, but . . .</li>
            <li>Just amazing, far far away from any other body creams I have used.</li>
            <li>I paid a little more for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lotions before that immediately smooth out all those rough spots (like the elbows) and leave my skin feeling very very soft.</li>
            <li>I have blond hair, fair, perpetually dry skin, and have spent an entire lifetime searching for a decent hand/body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I flipped the top to take a whiff and the smell was sweet, subtle, different.</li>
            <li>But buyer beware you can get this same EXACT product from Marshall&#x27;s for $10.</li>
            <li>and it feels quite soft.</li>
            <li>I did find it also at Marshalls for only $4.99 a bottle - same exact product.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy it again and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>This cream left me ashy within hours although my skin felt soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt soft but not very soft or deeply conditioned.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this body cream because my mom recommended it. She got it at a retail store, but I was lucky to find it on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past week and apply it daily after showering.  It is not greasy and it absorbs quickly into the skin. I feel like my skin is more moisturized and it feels quite soft. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happy with its continued use, as the bottle has a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regard to shipping, it arrived very quickly, I think 2 days after I ordered it, which was great!</li>
            <li> I was browsing around in one of my favorite stores,  (T J  Maxx)  looking for something different, not too expensive body lotion. I noticed the almonds on the bottle, read the ingredients.. Great healthy ingredients like sweet almond oil , I love almond oil. I flipped the top to take a whiff and the smell was sweet, subtle, different. So, I bought both the body cream and shower gel. I love the way my skin feels and smells after using this product. I use the body cream as a face moisturizer also. My skin looks great, not oily at all. I gave this product four stars because of how great it works...T J Maxx sells it at a much lower cost than here on Amazon. I&#x27;ll go back to the store to purchase again unless Amazon decides to lower its prices.</li>
            <li> Has a nice, light smell and is not too oily.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be recommending to all my friends and family.  Received from my girlfriend as gift.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. It is very moisturizing and has a very pleasant smell. I tried it in a friend&#x27;s shop one day and it was so good I got on  Amazon to purchase some. I love it!</li>
            <li> Waw, I bought this yesterday and tried it today: face, body, hands...I am really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I knew Italians are amazing in cosmetics (I always prefer their cosmetics when I can find them), but this one gets 15 of 10! I would buy 10 at a time!!!&lt;br /&gt;I really-really-really recommend this! Do I need to mention that I tried everything on the market?</li>
            <li> It is fragrant, so absorbable and easy to use leaving my skin very soft and smooth.  I do love it.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! But buyer beware you can get this same EXACT product from Marshall&#x27;s for $10. I also found at Marshall&#x27;s the same brands shampoo conditioner body was n lotion for sway less that listed on amazon</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful. It conditions my skin pretty well. I&#x27;ve used lotions before that immediately smooth out all those rough spots (like the elbows) and leave my skin feeling very very soft. With this body cream, I often needed to reapply a few times to my elbows. My skin felt soft but not very soft or deeply conditioned. I&#x27;m a bit of a lotion junkie. I like to buy lots of different lotions and I use lotion a lot. I&#x27;ve had better lotions than this one, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it. Like I said, the smell is amazing and it conditions well (not great). It also lasts a long time. It spreads well so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i am fully satisfied with purchases. Everything was as described. I suggest it to other who want to buy it.</li>
            <li> Rich. Luxurious. Wonderful scent. I discovered it last year in one of this chain discounters. I have been looking for it ever since I ran out. I paid a little more for it on Amazon. But it is worth it.</li>
            <li> i love this product  -it goes on smooth and disappears into the skin immediately.  I did find it also at Marshalls for only $4.99 a bottle - same exact product.  I purchased all 5 bottles they had.  It is a wonderful body lotion</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because it was on sale.  I love it.  The viscosity is not too thin or thick.  Fragrance is light, clean and fresh; very feminine.  I would definitely buy it again and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I ordered one for my sister and one for me.  The only reason I, we, are giving it a 4 is because it was the scent was stronger than what we are used to.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is one of those times argan oil is over-hyped!  This cream left me ashy within hours although my skin felt soft.  I have since gone back to Eucerin Repair Lotion - no ashiness there!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff--apply after bath!</li>
            <li> love this product....i use all this brands&#x27; products...i even like it so much i give it out as gift to my family and friends!</li>
            <li> I have blond hair, fair, perpetually dry skin, and have spent an entire lifetime searching for a decent hand/body lotion.  Some have come reasonably close, but . . . not one worth the money.  I found this rather by accident, and am positively delighted!!!!!  Feels lovely, not at all greasy, light and lovely fragrance, and WORKS!!!  As long as I can find a source for it, I will never but anything else.  NEVER!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;(P.S.  What is &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34;??  I have no idea what this reviewer was referring to, but it definitely didn&#x27;t happen with me.)</li>
            <li> I will be only speaking for myself, I rather recommend You all people, to try it, then You will see why I rated it five stars. Just amazing, far far away from any other body creams I have used. O.F.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin lotion in the summer.  It is light weight and does not leave a greasy residue.  Twelve hours after using it, my skin still feels silky. This is the only lotion that I will use on my hands during the day because it leaves no residue.  I have found that this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough during the winter so I use another product (Argan Magic Body Lotion) as a body lotion during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this product and what a difference in my skin!  The cream is not oily; my skin is looking and feeling so much more hydrated.  I recommend this product hands down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally bought almost every drug store body cream and/or fancy body cream. This one&#x27;s the best thus far. Lightly scented, quick-absorbing and incredibly moisturizing. I keep one at home and one at the office. Just luscious.</li>
