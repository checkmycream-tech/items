            <li> It will last a long time bc a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This expensive cream did the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> We do chemical peels on each other.</li>
            <li> but it is such a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Just was such a small size.</li>
            <li> I think it was over 7 for this little jar.</li>
            <li> An organic moisturizer that costs this little?!  </li>
            <li> I am a professional aesthetician and facial products can be very expensive!</li>
            <li> Smells unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell yummy to me, but doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>

            <li> its ok. nothing special</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain fragrance which irritates sensitive skin, and it isn&#x27;t made with harsh chemicals. It works great after I use the peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s working, but it feels good on my face and smells fresh.  I do know it absorbs in very well.</li>
            <li> Use after my first peeling and is very good cream for after the peeling and the smell is so good.</li>
            <li> Smells unbelievable. Great deal and quality ingredients like hyaluronic acid. Like putting frosting on skin. Eases the sting and aftershock of glyconic peel.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. I have acne/ rosacsea and I&#x27;ve recently started doing AHA peels at home. This cream just soothes and moisturizes without greasiness. It seems to also calm down the redness on my face. It&#x27;s also so economical!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and really moisturizes without making me break out. I have extremely sensitive skin. Can&#x27;t believe the price! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> great moisturizer for winter months</li>
            <li> This product worked really well after a Pico Sure laser peel. It&#x27;s mild &amp; absorbs well. My laser tech talked me into purchasing a high end recovery cream($138US). This expensive cream did the same exact thing. Calmed &amp; nourished the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am selling the jars of Antioxidant Recovery Cream to the girls where I work. We do chemical peels on each other. They LOVE this face cream. Best deal for a great product. Thank you, Planet Eden!</li>
            <li> Love this cream &amp; will absolutely buy again!  I am so pleased with the price, the natural ingredients, the fact that it has hyaluronic, retinol, vitamin C, royal jelly &amp; so many other ingredients that are wonderful for the skin.  It leaves such fabulous result, skin is greatly moisturized &amp; looks supple &amp; younger.  I love using it after chemicals peels &amp; for every day use too.  I have definitely found my new face cream! :)</li>
            <li> I use the pumpkin  face mask spa treat aha 12%  glycolic peel and I use this product after the peel if I do it in the morning. It&#x27;s light weight goes on smooth, non-greasy. If I do the peel before bed, I use pure 100% shea butter that is very greasy but it absorbed in my skin over night. Both does wonders so if you prefer something non-greasy, the antioxidant recovery cream for mature skin does the trick. Don&#x27;t let mature skin throw you off. I&#x27;m 38 years old just looking for a recovery cream and this one had good reviews and a good price. Finally, a facial regime that works for me!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Texture and feel is good, but the price is too high. I think it was over 7 for this little jar.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful; it hydrates well without being heavy or sticky. I am very pleased with this cream, and the price cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> I was in need of a good moisturizer since I bought the fruit acid peel and i just want to say that this did the job. A little goes a long way, the product is a thick consistency and has a light pleasant smell. Overall, its a good product would be great if it had spf.</li>
            <li> Really rich and moisturizing. Light enough for summer and heavy enough for winter.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream to use after  chemical peels.  Leaves my skin fresh soft.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is pretty amazing.  Yeah, like everyone else says, it smells great, but it really does do lovely things for your skin: helped my recovery after a peel AND softened my skin. An organic moisturizer that costs this little?!  I&#x27;m sold!  Will continue to buy!  I&#x27;m now interspersing this lotion with my regular $70 lotion just because of the smell, texture, and COST. Thanks Planet Eden!!</li>
            <li> Really nice cream.  I highly recommend it.  I Plan to order more this week.  I have been using it on my upper lip and the skin around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Does a very nice job of hydrating the skin.  I would definitely buy it again.  Love the price</li>
            <li> Products arrived earlier than estimated time.  I bought accompaning acid as well. This is my first time using a product like this and instructions were easy to understand and implement.  It informed you of possible irritation/burn so not a surprise.  From first treatment I was happy with results.  This product in particular went on smooth without greasy feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I guess if it&#x27;s all natural I can&#x27;t complain. I just use it occasionally after I use a chemical peel or just want a simple lotion with no bells or whistles.  Not greasy is a +. Doesn&#x27;t smell yummy to me, but doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> I love this cream not to heaven but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Skin feels grest after using,  even better in the morning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this antioxidant recovery cream. I did some research and took a chance and bought it and I&#x27;m glad I did! Great price, fast shipping, great price, and an overall great product. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy and hydrates smooths and soothes my face neck and chest. I use this every night after I use my derma roller and my serum. It smells delicious and delicate. You can tell it&#x27;s all natural ingredients just by the smell. It will last a long time bc a little goes a long way. I will definitely repurchase!!</li>
            <li> Absorbs completely and quickly with no residue, oiliness, and seems to work. It&#x27;s a good buy for the money!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face after a harsh chemical peel...</li>
            <li> Cant notice a huge difference but other than using it after peels, i use it when my face is dry in general and it helps. it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am 64, so I really want to take good care of my skin.  My facial appearance has improved since I started using this light weight cream.</li>
            <li> I do like this product. I use it after I have applied an acid peel. It sooth my skin and work well. I received product in a timely manner and in good condition I would order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this. It smells great. It lasts a long time. It helps soothe and heal my acne. I have healthy glowing skin! I have repurchased this, I don&#x27;t normally do that!</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it after peels, dermal needling,  under sunscreen (before make up).</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream. I am a professional aesthetician and facial products can be very expensive! This one was not and it has great ingredients. Anything with hyaluronic acid I love. It&#x27;s so good for your skin. Highly recommend it. And, yes, I will reorder very soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I purchased it to aid in the healing of my skin after a chemical peel. It make my skin feel really soft and smooth, and I use it whenever my face seems a little dry from the winter air, not just if I have done a peel. The cream smells really wonderful, also, and it&#x27;s non-greasy and absorbs into the skin quickly, which is a HUGE plus. I will be purchasing more of this amazing skin cream for certain!</li>
            <li> seems to work fine / feels good</li>
            <li> Nice cream. Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Bomb cream!!!!! I will buy a few more creams.... I use it in combination with Rose Hip Seed Oil... You have got to try this and the best  thing is, I can actually use it under my eyes with no irritation at all......!</li>
            <li> Love the feel, the smell and especially the price of this cream. I use it after I do a peel and I never have flaky or red skin.</li>
            <li> this is one item that was not over priced and I think is actually working ....will let you know in the winter if I reorder it.</li>
            <li> This cream went on smoothly and it made my skin feel really soft. It also smelled ok. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Helped heal my burned face.</li>
            <li> What I like about this cream is that it works well at hydrating without causing any irritation. I use this post procedure without any problems</li>
            <li> Bought it 3times now that should say enough</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s said it would do. I like it and think it&#x27;s good for all kinds of problems caused by free radicals.</li>
            <li> I only use this cream right after the peel but it works great to resolve the burning that lingers from the peel.</li>
            <li> it made break out and I don&#x27;t have acne. I think mine was old.</li>
            <li> I really liked this but it is such a small amount.  It&#x27;s light on the skin and won&#x27;t clog pores, as well as moisturize great!  Just was such a small size.</li>
            <li> Lovely rich pleasant smelling cream with antibacterial qualities a must after doing a glyconic peel. I will definitely purchase another when this one runs out</li>
            <li> It really soothes my skin and keeps it moisturized after the peel.</li>
            <li> I have oily as well as very sensitive skin. I was impressed with the ingredients and since the price is decent decided to give it a try. One morning I looked in the mirror and noticed how nice my skin looked and remembered I had used this product early that morning. Never had a product perform for me so fast. My skin looked plumper and texture was improved. I have purchased SO many products that end up half used and I am on to the next but this one is a keeper for me. I use it as a general everyday moisturizer and is even nice under my makeup.  The scent is light but really nice. Will be a repeat buyer of this cream.</li>
            <li> Great after peels,smells like cinnamon rolls, softness skin, no silicone,thick, and fast absorbing, gets rid of dry spots, but the one downside is I think it breaks me out.</li>
            <li> I use this to wear under my makeup and I like it.  Soaks in pretty fast, is not greasy... yet your make up goes on smoothly and looks great, especially under the eyes (stops the make up from going into your wrinkles so badly).</li>
            <li> I only use this after chemical peels..not to heavy..and soothes my skin..&lt;br /&gt;Helps to heal it..</li>
            <li> Made my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery! I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good cream, but seems to not be as moisturizing as I anticipated.  After my peel, though, I believe it did what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I like this cream very much and is my second purchase.  However, this time it works the same, but has an odd odor and the reason for only four stars.</li>
            <li> Wonderful after a glycolic treatment! Refreshing and light but deep penetrating!</li>
            <li> Have ordered this before and find it the best I have found. I will keep reordering. I use it in between nights when I use a Retinol cream...and when I go out in the morning. Keeps my face soft and protected. It soaks right in and smells nice.</li>
