            <li>Great Hair Product - Saw a difference in hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier with results.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I love it and some of my bald spots are growing hair.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m encouraged, but, too soon to know if I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>I am ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love this product and use it faithfully.  </li>
            <li>l use MANY Keranique products.</li>
            <li>I love this product you can see results immediately I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will continue to use it for years I love</li>
            <li>I did expect more for what I paid for Keranique!&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I am awaiting for more results.</li>
            <li>Had MUCH better results from Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li>I love this Keranique Boosting Serum.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>Easy to use for a better look.</li>
            <li>This whole line of products is wonderful and really does what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>I believe, if Keranique Products I try do succeed, this will be most important because it&#x27;s a concentrated serum</li>
            <li>Easy to use and no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>I regret I did not purchase the Keritan products through the original Keritan website.</li>
            <li>I returned it for full refund and could kick myself for not reading all the reviews BEFORE I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile with some success.</li>
            <li>now this product is doing exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time using it and I am seeing and feeling results, but I am expecting for more results.</li>
            <li>This has become a product that I always order more of when I am running low.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been using it consistently as directed for a month and absolutely zero difference.</li>
            <li>I have VERY thin fine hair , this shampoo along with Keranique volumizing shampoo really works great for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product  the only product that actually really works  very pleased with it and have purchased it in the past through Amazon  as I receive it in a day to two</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see much difference, then I was not paying much attention but continued using it.</li>
            <li>Use this with the whole system to regrow hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;A must buy, for women like me, who suffer from to much hair loss.</li>
            <li>Really have not had any feedback from her on the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li>really helps.  </li>
            <li>It does make the hair soft and shiny but any regular conditioner or serum could do a better job of that.</li>
            <li>I would have received all products ordered, and would have paid appropriate standard California standard rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have short hair, definitely has more oomph.</li>
            <li>and I use it every day I am never without it I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would give me a little more oomph</li>
            <li>I feel like there is a little more boost to my hair.  </li>
            <li>any new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>she was doing me a favor by making an exception to forward the correct product prior to receiving the incorrect product first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the trouble with having to receive A PRODUCT through several merchants is risky, and more expensive than having to receive from one - and in this case - the original dealer.</li>
            <li>I have some very minor thinning of hair at the front of my hairline through the crown, probably just natural ageing.</li>

            <li> Not sure if this is really doing the trick yet...</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be slowing down the hair loss process, so I guess this is a plus.</li>
            <li> This item caused my hair to dry out and crack off after only one application.  </li>
            <li> I found that it did not take a long time to get these results.</li>
            <li> I am not certain if the product does what it sys it does as I have not used it very long.  </li>
            <li> just a little bit on the hair,and really helps slow down hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and decided to write one.</li>
            <li> due to 2 surgeries and a colonosocpy</li>
            <li> I wonder how many items on Amazon have paid reviews :(</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is sometimes hard to find.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> After using for a few weeks I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair was thinning very bad on top</li>
            <li> Made my hair very hard to brush and dry</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> The shipping receipt had the correctly ordered product, leaving me to question how the wrong product was put in the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair  and wind up with hair on all my sweaters.  </li>
            <li> I hope this review keeps at least one person from using this horrible, hair damaging product!!</li>
            <li> not seem to do what it says it will..very disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> However, the labels were almost off, very difficult to even put in place and read directions!</li>

            <li> now this product is doing exactly what it advertises.  I love it and some of my bald spots are growing hair.</li>
            <li> I am not certain if the product does what it sys it does as I have not used it very long.  However, the labels were almost off, very difficult to even put in place and read directions!</li>
            <li> Hope I see results soon...</li>
            <li> You will see an improvement in thickness, appearance and manageability. I found that it did not take a long time to get these results.</li>
            <li> The girlfriend loves this and swears by this product that it strengthens and thickens her hair that she claims has been thinning for the last fived years.</li>
            <li> This is my second time using it and I am seeing and feeling results, but I am expecting for more results.</li>
            <li> Use this with the whole system to regrow hair.  I have seen a difference.  I had surgery and the anesthesia makes my hair fall out but this sytem helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  Keranique is the only product that makes my hair grow.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product. The shipping receipt had the correctly ordered product, leaving me to question how the wrong product was put in the packaging. The merchant made me feel he/she was doing me a favor by making an exception to forward the correct product prior to receiving the incorrect product first. I have yet to receive the shipping reimbursement for returning the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the trouble with having to receive A PRODUCT through several merchants is risky, and more expensive than having to receive from one - and in this case - the original dealer. I regret I did not purchase the Keritan products through the original Keritan website. I would have received all products ordered, and would have paid appropriate standard California standard rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the experience I had with this order, and the financial losses through this one order, as well as non-standard unlawful tax charges, I will never order from Amazon ever again - for anything.</li>
            <li> For the price paid, I thought I would see a difference in  my hair. No difference seen. I will nor re-order.</li>
            <li> Great Hair Product - Saw a difference in hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier with results. Definitely recommend. This has become a product that I always order more of when I am running low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m encouraged, but, too soon to know if I LOVE IT...I believe, if Keranique Products I try do succeed, this will be most important because it&#x27;s a concentrated serum and it&#x27;s LEAVE IN (which is why I&#x27;m also trying the mousse)</li>
            <li> I just received a question from another amazon client about this product. It reminded me that I wanted to order another one. I read other reviews and decided to write one. For those who have only used it once or twice, patience, it sneaks up on you. At first I didn&#x27;t see much difference, then I was not paying much attention but continued using it. A few weeks ago I realised how much fuller and manageable my hair was. I have short hair, definitely has more oomph. I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it faithfully.  Would recommend it to others with thinning hair.  Easy to use and no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thin fine hair , this shampoo along with Keranique volumizing shampoo really works great for my hair. l use MANY Keranique products. Keep &#x27;em coming!</li>
            <li> this works! daily use I also use the shampoo and conditioner. due to 2 surgeries and a colonosocpy my hair was thinning very bad on top I read about this product and decided to try it. It does work I have lots of hair coming back in and I use it every day I am never without it I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see or feel a difference when I used this product....</li>
            <li> This item caused my hair to dry out and crack off after only one application.  I returned it for full refund and could kick myself for not reading all the reviews BEFORE I purchased it.  If I had read the reviews, I NEVER would have tried it.  I hope this review keeps at least one person from using this horrible, hair damaging product!!</li>
            <li> just started using it</li>
            <li> I love this product  the only product that actually really works  very pleased with it and have purchased it in the past through Amazon  as I receive it in a day to two</li>
            <li> I love this product you can see results immediately I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will continue to use it for years I love</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. ...it was a waste of money. Buyer&#x27;s beware</li>
            <li> I have some very minor thinning of hair at the front of my hairline through the crown, probably just natural ageing. I bought this hoping it would give me a little more oomph but I&#x27;ve been using it consistently as directed for a month and absolutely zero difference. It does make the hair soft and shiny but any regular conditioner or serum could do a better job of that. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for about 2 weeks now..I did expect more for what I paid for Keranique!&lt;br /&gt;Does not seem to do what it says it will..very disappointed</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for hair regrowth and nothing to help reduce tangling or hair loss. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does work with time</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is really doing the trick yet...but then I have only been using it a short time.  So far, it seems to be slowing down the hair loss process, so I guess this is a plus.</li>
            <li> I feel like there is a little more boost to my hair.  I just wish it would help the bald spots start growing some hair.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Keranique seems to be working.  This is my first time using it and I am seeing and feeling results.  I am awaiting for more results.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product.  After using for a few weeks I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money to get it again.</li>
            <li> Could not tell any difference.  Had MUCH better results from Nioxin products.  I wonder how many items on Amazon have paid reviews :(</li>
            <li> It was just water inside,never made the difference and my hair still the same. Wish you all users the best of luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile with some success. The only problem is that it is sometimes hard to find.</li>
            <li> I love this Keranique Boosting Serum.&lt;br /&gt;Use just a little bit on the hair,and really helps slow down hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I even bought one for my mom,and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;A must buy, for women like me, who suffer from to much hair loss.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very hard to brush and dry</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my spouse. Really have not had any feedback from her on the effectiveness of the product. Perhaps a rewrite of the review at a later time.</li>
            <li> Helps to thicken up the roots and hair shaft  for a fuller look.  Easy to use for a better look.</li>
            <li> really helps.  I have very thin hair  and wind up with hair on all my sweaters.  Hope this is the beginning of help!</li>
            <li> This whole line of products is wonderful and really does what it advertises.  You have to be patient.  It does not happen over night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 1 month.  Haven&#x27;t really&lt;br /&gt;seen any different in the texture of my hair nor do I&lt;br /&gt;see any new hair growth.  Maybe I need to give it more&lt;br /&gt;time to work????</li>
            <li> Good product. Works well.</li>
    </ol>
