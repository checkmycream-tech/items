            <li> I used this product with Refectocil cream and it worked extremely well, it was easy to mix to get the tint correct (reading the instructions of course).  I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This mixes perfectly with dye that goes with it (not too runny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for dying lashes &amp;/or brows...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To dye lashes, I mix Refectocil dye (squeeze the size of a tic-tac) with 15 drops of the creme, then leave alone for 15 minutes before washing thoroughly.  Repeat every three or four weeks.  This bottle and the tube of dye would probably last many years.</li>
            <li> Item as description. Fast delivery. Happy customer!</li>
            <li> The color comes out uneven and does not last long at all :(</li>
            <li> Ive been using Refectocil for years but had never tried the chestnutt color.  Im a redhead.  Let me share that mixing brown and chestnutt makes a kind of strange purple color...so play with it a little before applying!  What I chose to do is an application of the Chesnutt color alone, then afterwards another layer of the dark brown Refectocil.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use.  It also is rather &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; immediately afterward so I encourage you to use it a day or so in advance so the color comes off your skin and it calms down a bit.  Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is bad or if it&#x27;s the dye I bought to use with it. I bought the Refectocil eyebrow tint. The creme would not mix with the dye cream. I tried it three times without success. My GUESS is that the dye cream was old/defective and not this creme, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true. Therefore, I would not recommend this creme or the Refectocil tint creme, or any Refectocil product. It was VERY difficult to get the mixture onto my eyebrows, but when I finally did, the dye didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is over price, you can get 1 gallon of regular 10% or 3% the something for less then $10.00 anywhere.</li>
            <li> Reviews for products which do what they are supposed to do are silly. Of course I don&#x27;t love it, but there are also, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to have more control over the consistency of my brow dye.  Works great - just make sure you don&#x27;t put too much in, because it becomes too liquidy.</li>
            <li> This large bottle of creme developer will last a long time. It&#x27;s consistency is perfect for mixing with lash and brow dyes. Having been a licensed beauty operator for over 35 years I have tried them all. I would highly recommend this product and buy it again.</li>
            <li> creme is easier to mix than liquid developer.</li>
            <li> Work better than the liquid and is easier to control.</li>
            <li> This is the best oxidant to go with brow tinting colors. I highly recommend. Would repurchase and only this brand.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.The cream makes mixing easier and measuring simpler.  I also like the new squeeze plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> Be tried a bunch of different types and this is by far the best one.  Very effective ND a great price</li>
            <li> I use the product with the RefectoCil Cream Hair Dye to tint my eyebrows and it&#x27;s fantastic!  I&#x27;ve used this product in both the creme form, and liquid form, and prefer the creme.  It&#x27;s much easier to mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two products together provide great, long lasting results.  I&#x27;m blonde and I buy the RefectoCil light brown and the results are perfect and natural looking.  I save a lot of money tinting my brows at home.</li>
            <li> I used it with Refectocil cream and it is good . Love the size of the canister, It will remain with me for a long time, I would recommend this product .</li>
