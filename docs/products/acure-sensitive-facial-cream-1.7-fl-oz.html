            <li>The best I can describe the smell of this skin cream is regurgitated wine.  </li>

            <li>GREAT GREAT product!</li>
            <li>So, although it didn&#x27;t win on the scent department, the fact that my skin feels great makes this an excellent buy.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff...almost out...need more now!</li>
            <li>I liked the day cream much better.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft and silky - wonderful product.</li>
            <li>The best cream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A good lotion that does what it claims to do - calming and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Hold your breath for the first min tho lol.</li>
            <li>Like very smooth, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>I love the acure products but something about the smell turned me off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed by this cream that I didn&#x27;t even bother to finish what was left over in my Estee Lauder bottle.</li>
            <li>I use a comedogenic rating for all ingredients to check, just to be safe.</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;ve eliminated this), my skin is 100% better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attribute the lotion for clearing my skin, but i&#x27;m sure it helped heal it and</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most products.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, some people complain about the smell</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this face cream.  </li>
            <li>I love it, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I love the Acure line.</li>
            <li>and more you still can&#x27;t help the stress from the environment and our lives.  </li>
            <li>It appears to help with acne and redness, although it could be that I&#x27;m taking care of my skin better.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I have used Acure oils and love them.</li>
            <li>I do think it has an interesting scent, which could turn people off, but a lot of lotions have smells.</li>
            <li>Has an OK scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this product does not smell like perfume.</li>
            <li>if they&#x27;re okay with their skin smelling like fermented fruit.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li>(I just don&#x27;t love the Nivea ingredients).&lt;br</li>
            <li>its ok, made my face oily, not for daytime use for me but will use at night</li>
            <li>Great cream for highly reactive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer that I&#x27;ve loved and will repurchase.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m having great results and calmer skin with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re eating clean, getting lots of high PH water, great sleep at night</li>
            <li>I think that Acure makes excellent natural care products, but my skin is so reactive and sensitive, that I concluded this &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; skin label was more marketing than reality.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s most definitely not bad.</li>
            <li>When I saw myself in the mirror this morning, I realized my skin has taken on a more even tone because the mild redness I always have is going away.</li>
            <li>: Way smelly (the rose essence in it is overpowering), consistency is more like petroleum jelly than cream, didn&#x27;t moisturize that well, in conjunction with the sensitive cleanser -  </li>
            <li>I got to say, it doesn&#x27;t smell that great - but totally understandable since it&#x27;s supposed to be fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>My skins absorbs this moisturizer very well and the cream smells amazingly invigorating.</li>
            <li>I do not want to sound mean-spirited, but it smells foul.  </li>
            <li>It is light, smooth, and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I use it under my makeup and it works as a great base/primer; otherwise I use regular EVOO as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I was not expecting much from this product.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but it is a decent product and feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>This is a rich cream with plenty of slip.  </li>
            <li>I  use pure shea butter in my hair and on my body and that seems fine, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything for my face!</li>
            <li>and I eat clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally dry and have mild Rosacea and found this works great at moisturizing without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough to good things about this product.</li>
            <li>my t zone has been more oily and I find this is too much in that area if I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>are beneficial, but the other ingredients sounded great, so I bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Acure moisturizers before but this one has been great for me.</li>
            <li>the most important part is that it DOES NOT cause me any breakouts when pretty much everything does.</li>
            <li>but this fades quickly.</li>
            <li>This lotion does not produce my skin to have a burning sensation, does not make me itchy, does not clog my pores or cause pimples, and moisturizes adequately.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild  and nondescript from the added probiotic and disappears when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li>Works great but the smell is a little off for me</li>
            <li>It really is fragrance free and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>Gentle, soothing and smooth for my hyper-sensitive and reactive skin.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Totally worth it for the healing it does for your skin microbes.</li>
            <li>The cream feels nice on my skin, but the smell is a bit gross.</li>
            <li>I love Acure products, this facial cream is so rich.</li>
            <li>but it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I hope other people who have this are getting good results....</li>
            <li>Not only are they wallet friendly, earth friendly, they do your skin wonders!</li>
            <li>1 in 6 times my skin will feel dry ~two minutes after application, so I will apply a bit more or lightly apply Vaseline or Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>when something works great with my skin, it usually shows by 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>GREAT results in just a few days!</li>
            <li>, there is a bit of a strange odor, and I believe it is from the fermented resveratrol extract / probiotic (smells kind of like kombucha)</li>
            <li>coconut oil straight out of the kitchen pantry is a much better moisturizer that gives my sensitive skin something to glow about than this stuff ever will.</li>
            <li>This lotion is so good for dry and/or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been able to get away with using it only once a day</li>
            <li>No weird ingredients.  </li>
            <li>this is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever repurchased.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>Just ran out of my first tube and thought I&#x27;d write a review now that I&#x27;m ordering my second.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the last couple years I&#x27;ve only been able to use free and clear/vanicream products.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of sour.</li>
            <li>For other reviewers who struggle with issues of skin redness, I can only say that adjusting your diet is probably your best bet (especially, getting rid of added sugars).  </li>
            <li>The smell fades quickly so I can deal with it for clear skin.</li>
            <li>It has been hard finding a reasonably priced facial cream, and I am glad I decided to try this one because I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>Using this facial cream not only feels amazing, but nourishes my skin</li>
            <li>But I knew I had to try something fast because I was running out of product.</li>
            <li>I went to whole foods and asked the beauty worker</li>
            <li>cause I already use earthy funky smelling things, plus the smell fades fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I will make it through the whole tube.</li>
            <li>and this really helps add moisture day or night.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I came across this and am really liking it.</li>
            <li>I really like Acure products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very off-putting.</li>
            <li>It has absolutely nothing going for it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This stuff absolutely does.</li>
            <li>It was OK, but I decided to give Acure sensitive facial cream a try because Acure&#x27;s shampoo &amp; conditioners are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, but since becoming pregnant, it has become very sensitive to many products I have previously used.</li>
            <li>I still prefer it to other lotions because I know that when I am using it, I am not poisoning my body :-)</li>
            <li>It feels great when applied, though I concede with other reviewers that it does have a bit of a sour odor (it has no added fragrances).  </li>
            <li>The last time I was vegan and 75% raw, my skin looked great and was very clear.  </li>
            <li>I previously have purchased Aveeno&#x27;s night cream, since I love using Aveeno&#x27;s shower gel and lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is thicker than I had expected but the product is accurately described by the seller - it is a cream.</li>
            <li>I starting using this and notice immediately how calm my skin became.</li>
            <li>Although it much more dense than the oil control hydrator I used to use, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li>From left to right the dates of my skin progress are&lt;br</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t need more than half of a dime (most likely less).</li>
            <li>I really have nothing negative to say about it, but I don&#x27;t have anything super exciting to say about it either.</li>
            <li>I like this line of products, including the sensitive face wash, but I will not be purchasing this particular moisturizer again.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been trying several of the natural, organic, fragrance free options for the body that are available for a reasonable price, but none are quite enough to moisturize my dry facial skin.</li>
            <li>product I received did not have the same ingredients on its label, but I was still interested.  </li>
            <li>size was concerning at first, but one bottle lasted me FOUR months with applying a pea-sized amount 1-2 times daily.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and creamy, which means it takes a while to absorb, which is great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, uneven skin that becomes easily inflamed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a very powerful scent, and you will adjust quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, everything makes me breakout if I don&#x27;t do my research on ingredients.</li>
            <li>Old Product?  </li>
            <li>I bought this at my local health store (so it was in-fact the REAL deal) and have given it over 2 months to dazzle me...</li>
            <li>Or a soft velvety feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or goopy and doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch like a lot of products that say they are for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using the sensitive cleanser.</li>
            <li>and after I put this on at night and wake up in the morning my face is so soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft and does not irritate it in any way.</li>
            <li>The texture and feel of this cream is so silky and your skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Others charge way too much for something I could make myself, or use too much essential oils (which can cause problems).</li>
            <li>The lack of chemicals is really the only reason I would consider using it after this tube runs out.</li>
            <li>It is thankfully on sale, and I had completely run out of both the Acure Day and Night creams.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive, reactive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moisturized and soft, but not greasy or oily (although it does take 5-10 minutes to fully sink in).</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and break out in rashes from a lot of products</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>Have terribly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite facial cleanser i&#x27;ve tried over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li>It arrived so quickly in the mail that I didn&#x27;t even run out of my previous moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use Acure&#x27;s night cream and absolutely adore it, but I wanted to give my skin a break from using the same cream all the time, so I thought I&#x27;d try the sensitive one for a bottle and then switch back, especially since I have very sensitive</li>
            <li>I wanted to move towards more natural products, but finding ones that work is really tough.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, I can have clear skin again with that diet and a non-irritating skin product like Acure Sensitive Facial Cream.</li>
            <li>And I was surprised by how well this product compared to my former moisturizer.</li>
            <li>And it is sensitive enough to use on my face!</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin getting worse, it hasn&#x27;t gotten any better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect this product to completely get rid of my dermatitis (mostly on my chin area and sometimes on the sides of my nose), but it is enough that it doesn&#x27;t make it worse.  </li>
            <li>I bought this lotion because it&#x27;s one of the best as far as ingredients go, but I&#x27;m afraid it leaves my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li>I am older so my skin is very dry in places</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the other reviewers are real or if they have noses of steel, but that&#x27;s my two-cents.</li>
            <li>My local natural grocery store did not carry this product until recently.  </li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of acure lotions, and after years of sensitive, dry skin, eczema, and acne, I decided to give this probiotic-based one a try.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea, acne prone, dry, and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, dry skin, and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps my dry skin moisturized and is natural.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love it, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I love the Acure line.</li>
            <li> and more you still can&#x27;t help the stress from the environment and our lives.  </li>
            <li> It appears to help with acne and redness, although it could be that I&#x27;m taking care of my skin better.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I have used Acure oils and love them.</li>
            <li> I do think it has an interesting scent, which could turn people off, but a lot of lotions have smells.</li>
            <li> Has an OK scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that this product does not smell like perfume.</li>
            <li> if they&#x27;re okay with their skin smelling like fermented fruit.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li> (I just don&#x27;t love the Nivea ingredients).&lt;br</li>
            <li> its ok, made my face oily, not for daytime use for me but will use at night</li>
            <li> Great cream for highly reactive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer that I&#x27;ve loved and will repurchase.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m having great results and calmer skin with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re eating clean, getting lots of high PH water, great sleep at night</li>
            <li> I think that Acure makes excellent natural care products, but my skin is so reactive and sensitive, that I concluded this &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; skin label was more marketing than reality.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s most definitely not bad.</li>
            <li> When I saw myself in the mirror this morning, I realized my skin has taken on a more even tone because the mild redness I always have is going away.</li>
            <li> : Way smelly (the rose essence in it is overpowering), consistency is more like petroleum jelly than cream, didn&#x27;t moisturize that well, in conjunction with the sensitive cleanser -  </li>
            <li> I got to say, it doesn&#x27;t smell that great - but totally understandable since it&#x27;s supposed to be fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> My skins absorbs this moisturizer very well and the cream smells amazingly invigorating.</li>
            <li> I do not want to sound mean-spirited, but it smells foul.  </li>
            <li> It is light, smooth, and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it under my makeup and it works as a great base/primer; otherwise I use regular EVOO as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I was not expecting much from this product.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but it is a decent product and feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is a rich cream with plenty of slip.  </li>
            <li> I  use pure shea butter in my hair and on my body and that seems fine, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything for my face!</li>
            <li> and I eat clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally dry and have mild Rosacea and found this works great at moisturizing without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough to good things about this product.</li>
            <li> my t zone has been more oily and I find this is too much in that area if I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> are beneficial, but the other ingredients sounded great, so I bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Acure moisturizers before but this one has been great for me.</li>
            <li> the most important part is that it DOES NOT cause me any breakouts when pretty much everything does.</li>
            <li> but this fades quickly.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not produce my skin to have a burning sensation, does not make me itchy, does not clog my pores or cause pimples, and moisturizes adequately.</li>
            <li> The smell is mild  and nondescript from the added probiotic and disappears when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> Works great but the smell is a little off for me</li>
            <li> It really is fragrance free and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Gentle, soothing and smooth for my hyper-sensitive and reactive skin.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Totally worth it for the healing it does for your skin microbes.</li>
            <li> The cream feels nice on my skin, but the smell is a bit gross.</li>
            <li> I love Acure products, this facial cream is so rich.</li>
            <li> but it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I hope other people who have this are getting good results....</li>
            <li> Not only are they wallet friendly, earth friendly, they do your skin wonders!</li>
            <li> 1 in 6 times my skin will feel dry ~two minutes after application, so I will apply a bit more or lightly apply Vaseline or Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> when something works great with my skin, it usually shows by 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> GREAT results in just a few days!</li>
            <li> , there is a bit of a strange odor, and I believe it is from the fermented resveratrol extract / probiotic (smells kind of like kombucha)</li>
            <li> coconut oil straight out of the kitchen pantry is a much better moisturizer that gives my sensitive skin something to glow about than this stuff ever will.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so good for dry and/or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been able to get away with using it only once a day</li>
            <li> No weird ingredients.  </li>
            <li> this is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever repurchased.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> Just ran out of my first tube and thought I&#x27;d write a review now that I&#x27;m ordering my second.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the last couple years I&#x27;ve only been able to use free and clear/vanicream products.</li>
            <li> It smells kind of sour.</li>
            <li> For other reviewers who struggle with issues of skin redness, I can only say that adjusting your diet is probably your best bet (especially, getting rid of added sugars).  </li>
            <li> The smell fades quickly so I can deal with it for clear skin.</li>
            <li> It has been hard finding a reasonably priced facial cream, and I am glad I decided to try this one because I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> Using this facial cream not only feels amazing, but nourishes my skin</li>
            <li> But I knew I had to try something fast because I was running out of product.</li>
            <li> I went to whole foods and asked the beauty worker</li>
            <li> cause I already use earthy funky smelling things, plus the smell fades fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will make it through the whole tube.</li>
            <li> and this really helps add moisture day or night.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I came across this and am really liking it.</li>
            <li> I really like Acure products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very off-putting.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely nothing going for it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff absolutely does.</li>
            <li> It was OK, but I decided to give Acure sensitive facial cream a try because Acure&#x27;s shampoo &amp; conditioners are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, but since becoming pregnant, it has become very sensitive to many products I have previously used.</li>
            <li> I still prefer it to other lotions because I know that when I am using it, I am not poisoning my body :-)</li>
            <li> It feels great when applied, though I concede with other reviewers that it does have a bit of a sour odor (it has no added fragrances).  </li>
            <li> The last time I was vegan and 75% raw, my skin looked great and was very clear.  </li>
            <li> I previously have purchased Aveeno&#x27;s night cream, since I love using Aveeno&#x27;s shower gel and lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is thicker than I had expected but the product is accurately described by the seller - it is a cream.</li>
            <li> I starting using this and notice immediately how calm my skin became.</li>
            <li> Although it much more dense than the oil control hydrator I used to use, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> From left to right the dates of my skin progress are&lt;br</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t need more than half of a dime (most likely less).</li>
            <li> I really have nothing negative to say about it, but I don&#x27;t have anything super exciting to say about it either.</li>
            <li> I like this line of products, including the sensitive face wash, but I will not be purchasing this particular moisturizer again.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been trying several of the natural, organic, fragrance free options for the body that are available for a reasonable price, but none are quite enough to moisturize my dry facial skin.</li>
            <li> product I received did not have the same ingredients on its label, but I was still interested.  </li>
            <li> size was concerning at first, but one bottle lasted me FOUR months with applying a pea-sized amount 1-2 times daily.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy, which means it takes a while to absorb, which is great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, uneven skin that becomes easily inflamed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very powerful scent, and you will adjust quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, everything makes me breakout if I don&#x27;t do my research on ingredients.</li>
            <li> Old Product?  </li>
            <li> I bought this at my local health store (so it was in-fact the REAL deal) and have given it over 2 months to dazzle me...</li>
            <li> Or a soft velvety feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or goopy and doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch like a lot of products that say they are for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using the sensitive cleanser.</li>
            <li> and after I put this on at night and wake up in the morning my face is so soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so soft and does not irritate it in any way.</li>
            <li> The texture and feel of this cream is so silky and your skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Others charge way too much for something I could make myself, or use too much essential oils (which can cause problems).</li>
            <li> The lack of chemicals is really the only reason I would consider using it after this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> It is thankfully on sale, and I had completely run out of both the Acure Day and Night creams.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, reactive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin moisturized and soft, but not greasy or oily (although it does take 5-10 minutes to fully sink in).</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and break out in rashes from a lot of products</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> Have terribly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite facial cleanser i&#x27;ve tried over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> It arrived so quickly in the mail that I didn&#x27;t even run out of my previous moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use Acure&#x27;s night cream and absolutely adore it, but I wanted to give my skin a break from using the same cream all the time, so I thought I&#x27;d try the sensitive one for a bottle and then switch back, especially since I have very sensitive</li>
            <li> I wanted to move towards more natural products, but finding ones that work is really tough.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, I can have clear skin again with that diet and a non-irritating skin product like Acure Sensitive Facial Cream.</li>
            <li> And I was surprised by how well this product compared to my former moisturizer.</li>
            <li> And it is sensitive enough to use on my face!</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin getting worse, it hasn&#x27;t gotten any better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this product to completely get rid of my dermatitis (mostly on my chin area and sometimes on the sides of my nose), but it is enough that it doesn&#x27;t make it worse.  </li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because it&#x27;s one of the best as far as ingredients go, but I&#x27;m afraid it leaves my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> I am older so my skin is very dry in places</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the other reviewers are real or if they have noses of steel, but that&#x27;s my two-cents.</li>
            <li> My local natural grocery store did not carry this product until recently.  </li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of acure lotions, and after years of sensitive, dry skin, eczema, and acne, I decided to give this probiotic-based one a try.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, acne prone, dry, and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, dry skin, and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps my dry skin moisturized and is natural.</li>
            <li> After over 2 months of daily use, my skin looks no worse, but no better either.</li>
            <li> A little goes such a long way, i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll have the bottle for at least 2 -3 , months!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too late for my order, save yourselves ; ) ... and your $6.&lt;br /&gt;Looking</li>
            <li> It spreads very well and absorbs well: not a lot of product is needed (usually, but I have not used this product in cold/winter months</li>
            <li> Tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it comes in such a small container that it&#x27;s hard to use regularly if you have skin troubles on more than just your face.</li>
            <li> The trick is to wet your face first, apply a small amount and then rub that all over your face.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING from expensive to cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li> dries soft and can be used everyday.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my eczema spots almost completely within a few days.</li>
            <li> I am a Red-Head with pale, sensitive, sun fearing skin....</li>
            <li> my face became quite dry.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY dry skin</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of the this product because it seems that there weren&#x27;t many amazon buyers submitting reviews.</li>
            <li> It is helping dry spots heal and no new outbreaks!</li>
            <li> For the same results I could use something like cetaphil and spend half the amount.</li>
            <li> During winter time, I will add a few drops of Acure&#x27;s argan oil to the facial cream to make it thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have to be really careful what I put on it.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful what I use.</li>
            <li> cream is thick enough and hydrating enough to keep my face moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I just recently became vegan again and am aiming to become about 75% raw to see if that diet plan can keep my dermatitis at bay.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it hydrates well, and does not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this again, and I won&#x27;t be trying any other Acure Organics products.  </li>
            <li> It claims to be uncented and there are clearly no added smells or ingredients, but damn it stinks when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> Acure sensitive facial cream has saved me my pocketbook from all those expensive creams claiming to add mositure.</li>
            <li> The Acure products have generally been winners and have worked well with my sensitive skin, but the terrible odor from this one is just too much to face every morning.</li>
            <li> I have heard that manufacturers add scents to most products that they want to make \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; because the basic smell would be terrible.</li>
            <li> The fact that it hasn&#x27;t aggravated my skin or made my active dermatitis areas worse is enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it smells a little like fermented flowers, but what else can you expect from a product with probiotics?</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now in conjunction with the cleanser</li>
            <li> I will update after I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the dead flower smell</li>
            <li> I decided to try it even though other reviewers complained about the &amp;#34;horrible&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty bad and makes my skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li> But, I still need more moisture and have been going through expensive moisturizers like crazy!</li>
            <li> Works great, stinks terribly.  </li>
            <li> Instructions say use it at least twice a day</li>
            <li> Smells like dirty socks or possibly body odor.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy or too thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also too thick and didn&#x27;t spread well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, doesn&#x27;t absorb well, and it didnt seem to improve my wrinkles or acne.</li>
            <li> I was so sad washing my face a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I guess it is just flat out that I was disappointed and hoped for something to happen...</li>
            <li> This really does smell awful.</li>
            <li> Every time I opened it up the smell seemed worse.</li>
            <li> I think it even made my husband less attracted to me, it smells that bad.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, and I am unable to get past it to actually put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my tube is bad or not.  </li>
            <li> Weird consistency.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only smells awful</li>
            <li> , it has a weird, almost lumpy constancy.</li>
            <li> This smells like rotten apples...or stale beer.</li>
            <li> Organic (and cold pressed)</li>
            <li> Bad batch?  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t factually state why it smells so bad, but it does.  </li>
            <li> When something is bad for my skin, I know within 2 hours</li>
            <li> Also, for anyone out there worried about the scent; it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a week ago to try a creamier moisture than the calming stuff I&#x27;d been using, which wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Some reviews complain about the smell, but I don&#x27;t think it smells that bad (and neither does my husband).&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I felt so ugly!</li>
            <li> This product smells just awful.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely horrible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> product with no harmful nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
            <li> smells horrible -</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product smells just awful.  The Acure products have generally been winners and have worked well with my sensitive skin, but the terrible odor from this one is just too much to face every morning.</li>
            <li> I love the acure products but something about the smell turned me off. This will not&lt;br /&gt;be a repeat buy.</li>
            <li> Best cream. Not greasy or too thick. dries soft and can be used everyday. Great as night cream and smells clean. Tried it too as cream for my pitbull dogs belly after her playing outside and it soothed her rash from the grass too.</li>
            <li> Health and Beauty)I was looking for a moisturizer to replace the Estee Lauder lotion that I was using which was discontinued recently. And I was surprised by how well this product compared to my former moisturizer. This cream is great! It is thicker than I had expected but the product is accurately described by the seller - it is a cream. Although it much more dense than the oil control hydrator I used to use, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all. My face feels healthy and nourished with each use and for a 1/3 of the cost too! My skins absorbs this moisturizer very well and the cream smells amazingly invigorating.I was very skeptical of the this product because it seems that there weren&#x27;t many amazon buyers submitting reviews. But I knew I had to try something fast because I was running out of product. I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this product a try. It arrived so quickly in the mail that I didn&#x27;t even run out of my previous moisturizer. I was so impressed by this cream that I didn&#x27;t even bother to finish what was left over in my Estee Lauder bottle. Instructions say use it at least twice a day but I&#x27;ve been able to get away with using it only once a day</li>
            <li> Works great but the smell is a little off for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M IN LOVE! This is one of the ONLY face lotions I trust. I have extremely sensitive skin, everything makes me breakout if I don&#x27;t do my research on ingredients. If it has coconut oil or coconut anything in there I don&#x27;t buy it. I use a comedogenic rating for all ingredients to check, just to be safe. I  use pure shea butter in my hair and on my body and that seems fine, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything for my face! I went to whole foods and asked the beauty worker what product she would recommend and this is what she said. I was reluctant to buy it for weeks. Along iwth diet changes...I&#x27;ve been paleo but had soy lethinin in my chocolate and gum (i&#x27;ve eliminated this), my skin is 100% better. I was so sad washing my face a few weeks ago and I felt so ugly! I know this product is working, because it&#x27;s only been two weeks and no irritation and my skin is getting clearer. I can&#x27;t attribute the lotion for clearing my skin, but i&#x27;m sure it helped heal it and the most important part is that it DOES NOT cause me any breakouts when pretty much everything does. A little goes such a long way, i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll have the bottle for at least 2 -3 , months! Worth the price! I actually like the smell, I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about, maybe it&#x27;s cause I already use earthy funky smelling things, plus the smell fades fast. I also LOVE that it has probiotics! GREAT GREAT product! I hope they never change the formula! I hope these embarassing pictures of my skin before and after help! From left to right the dates of my skin progress are&lt;br /&gt;7/22/15&lt;br /&gt;7/23/15&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the lotion and began using it all over my face on the 27th (I had patch tested a sample of it prior for a week)&lt;br /&gt;7/30/15&lt;br /&gt;8/5/15&lt;br /&gt;8/5/15&lt;br /&gt;8/8/15</li>
            <li> I get red splotches in the winter on my face and this stuff works to keep them at bay.  No weird ingredients.  :)</li>
            <li> When I viewed the product page, I was intrigued by the list of ingredients.  I don&#x27;t know that probiotics applied to skin are beneficial, but the other ingredients sounded great, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received did not have the same ingredients on its label, but I was still interested.  This is a rich cream with plenty of slip.  A little goes a long way, it hydrates well, and does not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it came with a surprise odor.  I do not want to sound mean-spirited, but it smells foul.  The best I can describe the smell of this skin cream is regurgitated wine.  It is absolutely horrible.  But I&#x27;ve changed diapers; I figured I could get used to any odor.  I can&#x27;t.  I used it every day for three weeks and I&#x27;m throwing in the towel.  I do not like to be wasteful, but this is going in the trash.  I can&#x27;t bear to apply it any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why it has such a foul odor.  Bad batch?  Old Product?  Could be either with the discrepant ingredient label, or it could be lack of familiarity with stinky ingredients on my part.  I can&#x27;t factually state why it smells so bad, but it does.  I will not purchase this again, and I won&#x27;t be trying any other Acure Organics products.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> It is light, smooth, and non-greasy. It really is fragrance free and non-irritating. I really have nothing negative to say about it, but I don&#x27;t have anything super exciting to say about it either. I bought this at my local health store (so it was in-fact the REAL deal) and have given it over 2 months to dazzle me...but..Meh... It&#x27;s just alright. I am a Red-Head with pale, sensitive, sun fearing skin.... when something works great with my skin, it usually shows by 2 weeks. When something is bad for my skin, I know within 2 hours (oh the burn!!!). After over 2 months of daily use, my skin looks no worse, but no better either. I guess it is just flat out that I was disappointed and hoped for something to happen... Like very smooth, glowing skin. Or a soft velvety feel. Or great looking pores. But I got nothing. It is moisturizing, and works in that capacity, but if you are looking for something that makes your skin look radiant, I would save your money. Organic (and cold pressed) coconut oil straight out of the kitchen pantry is a much better moisturizer that gives my sensitive skin something to glow about than this stuff ever will.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most products. So happy I found Acure Organics. I use it under my makeup and it works as a great base/primer; otherwise I use regular EVOO as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought items from Amazon on a weekly basis for years and I never write reviews unless I am really impressed with something.  Acure makes Great Products! I only gave 4 stars bc of the initial smell. I&#x27;ve used other Acure moisturizers before but this one has been great for me. The smell fades quickly so I can deal with it for clear skin. Been breaking out at 41... ughhhhh..and I eat clean. I use this at night only with the Acure Firming Serum. GREAT results in just a few days!</li>
            <li> Works great, stinks terribly.  Smells like dirty socks or possibly body odor.  I&#x27;m not sure if my tube is bad or not.  I like this line of products, including the sensitive face wash, but I will not be purchasing this particular moisturizer again.  Too stinky.  I liked the day cream much better.</li>
            <li> I use Acure&#x27;s night cream and absolutely adore it, but I wanted to give my skin a break from using the same cream all the time, so I thought I&#x27;d try the sensitive one for a bottle and then switch back, especially since I have very sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;Pros: all natural&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Way smelly (the rose essence in it is overpowering), consistency is more like petroleum jelly than cream, didn&#x27;t moisturize that well, in conjunction with the sensitive cleanser -  my face became quite dry.</li>
            <li> It claims to be uncented and there are clearly no added smells or ingredients, but damn it stinks when you first put it on. I won&#x27;t buy again but it is a decent product and feels nice on my skin. Hold your breath for the first min tho lol.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because it&#x27;s one of the best as far as ingredients go, but I&#x27;m afraid it leaves my skin a little dry. I still prefer it to other lotions because I know that when I am using it, I am not poisoning my body :-)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, some people complain about the smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have always been a fan of acure lotions, and after years of sensitive, dry skin, eczema, and acne, I decided to give this probiotic-based one a try. And it&#x27;s one of the best decisions I have ever made for my skin. It cleared up my eczema spots almost completely within a few days. And it is sensitive enough to use on my face! It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed.  Also, for anyone out there worried about the scent; it&#x27;s not that bad. Yes, it smells a little like fermented flowers, but what else can you expect from a product with probiotics? Totally worth it for the healing it does for your skin microbes. It&#x27;s not a very powerful scent, and you will adjust quickly.  I cannot say enough to good things about this product. The only down side is that it comes in such a small container that it&#x27;s hard to use regularly if you have skin troubles on more than just your face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face cream.  It&#x27;s not sticky or goopy and doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch like a lot of products that say they are for sensitive skin.  It leaves my skin feeling so soft and silky - wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I tried the Acure products starting with the cleanser, and I like it so I bought this facial cream. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping it would. I have to use 2 different moisturizers -- this and also the day or night facial cream. The biggest problem, though, is the smell. It&#x27;s awful. I have heard that manufacturers add scents to most products that they want to make \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; because the basic smell would be terrible. I guess that&#x27;s what happened here. I have to hold my breath even to put it on. I&#x27;m tempted to just throw it away, but the thrifty part of me says that I shouldn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know if I will make it through the whole tube. It&#x27;s just not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  I have tried EVERYTHING from expensive to cheap stuff.  Using this facial cream not only feels amazing, but nourishes my skin and I feel good about what I am putting on my skin because this is a truly &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; product with no harmful nasty chemicals.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This lotion is so good for dry and/or sensitive skin! I have eczema on my cheeks and this is the only face lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried that keeps it at bay! I&#x27;ve tried CeraVe, Cetaphil, and all the others that my dermatologists have recommended. They don&#x27;t hold a candle to this! And I don&#x27;t notice any yucky smell like some others did.</li>
            <li> I love it, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This item is actually cheaper at Wholes Foods, which is surprising.&lt;br /&gt;Regular price is $19.99, but it is on sale at the moment for $17.99.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too late for my order, save yourselves ; ) ... and your $6.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to trying the product though. I love the Acure line.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a week ago to try a creamier moisture than the calming stuff I&#x27;d been using, which wasn&#x27;t bad. When I saw myself in the mirror this morning, I realized my skin has taken on a more even tone because the mild redness I always have is going away. I&#x27;m also using the sensitive cleanser. Going to read more about oils and probiotics for the skin!</li>
            <li> I love Acure products, this facial cream is so rich. I have REALLY dry skin and after I put this on at night and wake up in the morning my face is so soft. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out either ( I have combination skin).</li>
            <li> I used this product nightly!  I do fitness modeling and your facial complexity makes a difference!!! If you&#x27;re eating clean, getting lots of high PH water, great sleep at night and more you still can&#x27;t help the stress from the environment and our lives.  I switched to ACURE products for hair, skins, etc. about a year ago when I discovered them in San Diego, CA on a trip.  Not only are they wallet friendly, earth friendly, they do your skin wonders!</li>
            <li> The best cream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, acne prone, dry, and sensitive skin. This is by far my favorite facial cleanser i&#x27;ve tried over the past 10 years. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and does not irritate it in any way. It appears to help with acne and redness, although it could be that I&#x27;m taking care of my skin better. A little goes a long way. The trick is to wet your face first, apply a small amount and then rub that all over your face. You shouldn&#x27;t need more than half of a dime (most likely less). I like the smell, but it is definitely feminine, so it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> The cream feels nice on my skin, but the smell is a bit gross.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Gentle, soothing and smooth for my hyper-sensitive and reactive skin.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best I have come across.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making this cream for hopeless cases like me.</li>
            <li> Acure sensitive facial cream has saved me my pocketbook from all those expensive creams claiming to add mositure. I am older so my skin is very dry in places and this really helps add moisture day or night.</li>
            <li> I previously have purchased Aveeno&#x27;s night cream, since I love using Aveeno&#x27;s shower gel and lotion.  However, Aveeno&#x27;s night cream ended up stinging my skin.  It was OK, but I decided to give Acure sensitive facial cream a try because Acure&#x27;s shampoo &amp; conditioners are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Acure didn&#x27;t disappoint! The cream goes on smoothly.  I have dry, sensitive skin and it felt great.  During winter time, I will add a few drops of Acure&#x27;s argan oil to the facial cream to make it thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I got to say, it doesn&#x27;t smell that great - but totally understandable since it&#x27;s supposed to be fragrance free.  So, although it didn&#x27;t win on the scent department, the fact that my skin feels great makes this an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Quite like this stuff.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I have combination skin and prone to breakouts with a majority of skincare lines, but this one and SkinMedica are my go to product lines. I use this in the mornings with a sunscreen and in the evenings with Acure wrinkle cream and it works great together. Probably one of the best organic lines I have ever used. The texture and feel of this cream is so silky and your skin feels so soft. I like too, that there is no oily or residue feel left on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Acure oils and love them. But, I still need more moisture and have been going through expensive moisturizers like crazy! I came across this and am really liking it. I do think it has an interesting scent, which could turn people off, but a lot of lotions have smells. It is very thick and creamy, which means it takes a while to absorb, which is great for my dry skin. It is helping dry spots heal and no new outbreaks!</li>
            <li> A truly fragrance-free facial cream that is moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate. I have been trying several of the natural, organic, fragrance free options for the body that are available for a reasonable price, but none are quite enough to moisturize my dry facial skin. Others charge way too much for something I could make myself, or use too much essential oils (which can cause problems). It has been hard finding a reasonably priced facial cream, and I am glad I decided to try this one because I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there is a bit of a strange odor, and I believe it is from the fermented resveratrol extract / probiotic (smells kind of like kombucha) but this fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like Acure products but I can&#x27;t get over the smell. It smells kind of sour. Kind of like figs but I do not like it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the greatest moisturizer in the world, but I also couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. It&#x27;s disgusting. It smells like rotting flowers. Like cut flowers you forgot to throw out before you went away on holiday -- you come back to this smell. It&#x27;s very off-putting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now in conjunction with the cleanser and I&#x27;m overall unimpressed. I have sensitive, uneven skin that becomes easily inflamed and I was hoping these products would help. While I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin getting worse, it hasn&#x27;t gotten any better. The label suggests that it evens skim tone and reduces redness but this hasn&#x27;t been the case for me. It also smells pretty bad and makes my skin feel greasy. For the same results I could use something like cetaphil and spend half the amount. The lack of chemicals is really the only reason I would consider using it after this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> My holy grail. I have extremely sensitive skin, dry skin, and acne prone skin. This lotion does not produce my skin to have a burning sensation, does not make me itchy, does not clog my pores or cause pimples, and moisturizes adequately. 1 in 6 times my skin will feel dry ~two minutes after application, so I will apply a bit more or lightly apply Vaseline or Aquaphor. Has an OK scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size was concerning at first, but one bottle lasted me FOUR months with applying a pea-sized amount 1-2 times daily. It spreads very well and absorbs well: not a lot of product is needed (usually, but I have not used this product in cold/winter months yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought my second bottle and do not plan on changing. Literally five consecutive years of trying different moisturizers, and this is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever repurchased. So thankful. Phew.</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer that I&#x27;ve loved and will repurchase. Works great.</li>
            <li> AWFULLLLLL smell. Made me want to puke every time I applied it. It&#x27;s also too thick and didn&#x27;t spread well.</li>
            <li> Great cream for highly reactive skin.</li>
            <li> A good lotion that does what it claims to do - calming and great for sensitive skin. But man, that smell makes you wanna kill yourself!</li>
            <li> smells horrible - I threw it away. Weird consistency.</li>
            <li> Great organic skincare line. I have dry skin, but since becoming pregnant, it has become very sensitive to many products I have previously used. So far, I&#x27;m having great results and calmer skin with this moisturizer. I love that this product does not smell like perfume. The smell is mild  and nondescript from the added probiotic and disappears when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> This really does smell awful. I decided to give it a chance in the hopes that the smell would subside or that the benefits would outweigh the smell, well they didnt. This stuff not only smells awful, it has a weird, almost lumpy constancy. It&#x27;s thick, doesn&#x27;t absorb well, and it didnt seem to improve my wrinkles or acne. It has absolutely nothing going for it. I think it even made my husband less attracted to me, it smells that bad.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin. This product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. So far so good. The smell is pleasing. Not laced with perfumes. I decided to try it even though other reviewers complained about the &amp;#34;horrible&amp;#34; smell. Don&#x27;t let that keep you from buying it. While the smell&lt;br /&gt;is not that of flowers, it&#x27;s most definitely not bad. I will update after I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...almost out...need more now!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Don&#x27;t care for the dead flower smell but it goes away pretty quickly. Keeps my dry skin moisturized and is natural. I don&#x27;t have any irritation from this product.</li>
            <li> This is a life-savor! I cannot do without it. It has changed the texture of my skin and calms it like nothing I have ever tried. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My local natural grocery store did not carry this product until recently.  It is thankfully on sale, and I had completely run out of both the Acure Day and Night creams.  To be honest, I was not expecting much from this product.  Let me explain.  I think that Acure makes excellent natural care products, but my skin is so reactive and sensitive, that I concluded this &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; skin label was more marketing than reality.  The fact that it hasn&#x27;t aggravated my skin or made my active dermatitis areas worse is enough for me.  I don&#x27;t expect this product to completely get rid of my dermatitis (mostly on my chin area and sometimes on the sides of my nose), but it is enough that it doesn&#x27;t make it worse.  It feels great when applied, though I concede with other reviewers that it does have a bit of a sour odor (it has no added fragrances).  For other reviewers who struggle with issues of skin redness, I can only say that adjusting your diet is probably your best bet (especially, getting rid of added sugars).  I just recently became vegan again and am aiming to become about 75% raw to see if that diet plan can keep my dermatitis at bay.  The last time I was vegan and 75% raw, my skin looked great and was very clear.  Hopefully, I can have clear skin again with that diet and a non-irritating skin product like Acure Sensitive Facial Cream.</li>
            <li> This smells like rotten apples...or stale beer. Every time I opened it up the smell seemed worse. I haven&#x27;t put it on anywhere besides my hand just because of that fact. I don&#x27;t know if the other reviewers are real or if they have noses of steel, but that&#x27;s my two-cents. Smells terrible, and I am unable to get past it to actually put it on my face. I hope other people who have this are getting good results....if they&#x27;re okay with their skin smelling like fermented fruit.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I have really sensitive, reactive skin so I have to be really careful what I put on it. I wanted to move towards more natural products, but finding ones that work is really tough. This stuff absolutely does. It leaves my skin moisturized and soft, but not greasy or oily (although it does take 5-10 minutes to fully sink in). This stuff soothes my skin and leaves it happy and healthy. I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> For the last couple years I&#x27;ve only been able to use free and clear/vanicream products. I have really sensitive skin and break out in rashes from a lot of products so I have to be careful what I use. I&#x27;m generally dry and have mild Rosacea and found this works great at moisturizing without causing any irritation. The only downside I found was since pregnancy and having a baby my t zone has been more oily and I find this is too much in that area if I&#x27;m wearing makeup. I use it in the evening and then in morning if I&#x27;m not going to wear makeup that day.</li>
            <li> My skin has been breaking out and not healing at all.  I starting using this and notice immediately how calm my skin became. It&#x27;s only been the 3rd day but my acne is going away.  I have sensitive combination skin and I use this at night.</li>
            <li> Have terribly sensitive skin.  This works.</li>
            <li> Just ran out of my first tube and thought I&#x27;d write a review now that I&#x27;m ordering my second.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this cream. I&#x27;ve been looking for an organic option for years and always had to return to using Nivea, because it was the only cream that felt hydrating enough for me (I just don&#x27;t love the Nivea ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;This cream is thick enough and hydrating enough to keep my face moisturized all day. Some reviews complain about the smell, but I don&#x27;t think it smells that bad (and neither does my husband).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so grateful I found this cream.</li>
            <li> its ok, made my face oily, not for daytime use for me but will use at night</li>
    </ol>
