            <li>this was my first attempted to buy individual products to color my hair, I have always used clairol hair color; since i was 12, but this was awesome and saves me tons of money, thank you amazon for helping make that happen.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product, I am buying another bottle, because I need to keep this on hand for maintaining my new color.</li>
            <li>Super cheap and works fantastically.</li>
            <li>I was so shocked and happy when I decided to check on good old Amazon and saw it was available thru them and at a fair price.</li>
            <li>and now I have a beautiful rich white platinum blonde.</li>
            <li>but this really not work good</li>
            <li>I loved the old maximum lift and the blonde beige hair color.  </li>
            <li>i will get some more later,,</li>
            <li>I love this Clairol pure white 40 volume &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have had so many colors but never blonde (TRUE BLONDE)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a real pain.</li>
            <li>I bleached my whole head for two hours.</li>
            <li>It turned light blonde.</li>
            <li>I did my whole chest length hair with one bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for people who have the knowledge/ability to do hair.</li>
            <li>Seems a little diluted or something but worked ok.</li>
            <li>I will not be buying this product anymore and will have to find a new supplier.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I thought the Clairol Pure white was a hair dye or bleach.</li>
            <li>Can burn and sting sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If anyone knows where I can purchase a product similar to the old clairol please let me know.  </li>
            <li>My hair usually turns into spaghetti when using other brands, but this was okay, my hair was manageable.</li>
            <li>Great product but a little expensive</li>

            <li> Great product but a little expensive</li>
            <li> I am a natural dark brunette.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> Ever since our local Beauty Supply House closed down I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding this particular strength of hair bleach.</li>
            <li> you can buy same stuff at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dark black Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Went from dark black to blonde with this!</li>
            <li> Enough in the bottle for long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> its so hard to find a big bottle of 40v in stores &amp; I&#x27;m not a hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I never ever no matter how hard I tried got the color I finally got.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just half of the mix to bleach or dye your hair.</li>
            <li> After bleaching out my hair with the help of this developer, my hair still felt silky instead of the stiff, straw-like brittle bleached hair</li>
            <li> I not sure</li>
            <li> As usual with Prime, I received it in 2 days, no shipping costs.</li>
            <li> no more sally&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> very disappointed, a whole wasted evening</li>
            <li> So I guess I was told wrong and wasted my money by buying it.</li>
            <li> if you have weak hair</li>
            <li> Wish I would have known about this sooner, could of saved my hair a lot of grief.</li>

            <li> I love this Clairol pure white 40 volume &#x27;&#x27;its real good with my lighting powder..i will continue using it..i will get some more later,,</li>

            <li> worked just great!No complaints here!</li>

            <li> I bought this product based on the two reviews it had, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I just bleached my hair twice and toned over a 4 hour period, and my hair feels better than it did before I processed it. Amazing product, I am buying another bottle, because I need to keep this on hand for maintaining my new color. Yay!</li>
            <li> Great to uses with Clairol BW2 powder to get nice blonde streaks where you want them. Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> its so hard to find a big bottle of 40v in stores &amp; I&#x27;m not a hairdresser. this made my bleaching so much more quick &amp; easy! no more sally&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> Mixed with dye, did not work at all. very disappointed, a whole wasted evening and my hair looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Great developer. Works good and fast shipping. if you have weak hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommended the 40. But if you need a stronger developer this will work great.</li>
            <li> I never ever no matter how hard I tried got the color I finally got. I am a natural dark brunette. I have had so many colors but never blonde (TRUE BLONDE) I bleached my whole head for two hours. and then the next day actually next evening bleached again staying away from my white snowy roots and now I have a beautiful rich white platinum blonde. Still will get again to get a richer deeper blonde. Im not at my set color yet but that takes time gradually and this stuff I will use!!!</li>
            <li> I can only compare this to the Sally Beauty brand of Developer. But this was recommended by a youtube user. After bleaching out my hair with the help of this developer, my hair still felt silky instead of the stiff, straw-like brittle bleached hair I was dreading. I would definitely repurchase and recommend. :D Wish I would have known about this sooner, could of saved my hair a lot of grief.</li>
            <li> I used this developer along with my BW2 lightener. It lightens perfectly; and it works! I used this to bleach my extensions, and the effect is great.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Super cheap and works fantastically. Use with bleach, toner, or color. I highly recommend this product for people who have the knowledge/ability to do hair.</li>
            <li> I loved the old maximum lift and the blonde beige hair color.  I&#x27;ve tried to use this product and it it just isn&#x27;t the same.  I keep my hair very blonde and this makes my hair look drab a week or so after it is dyed.  I like the way it makes my hair feel, but the results are not the same.  If anyone knows where I can purchase a product similar to the old clairol please let me know.  I will not be buying this product anymore and will have to find a new supplier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dark black Asian hair. I bleached using this twice. It turned light blonde. It does what it says it will. My hair usually turns into spaghetti when using other brands, but this was okay, my hair was manageable. It is a cream so you won&#x27;t have dripping problems which is a plus. I also think for this price and volume it&#x27;s a great value. I did my whole chest length hair with one bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product but a little expensive you can buy same stuff at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply half the price.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Requires a powder bleach to work.  Can burn and sting sensitive skin.  Enough in the bottle for long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> Went from dark black to blonde with this! Loved it!</li>
            <li> When it came, it was expired and the bottle leaked everywhere. My sister&#x27;s a hair dresser and it turns out that you&#x27;re not even supposed to be able to buy this without a license...</li>
            <li> Seems a little diluted or something but worked ok.</li>
            <li> I thought the Clairol Pure white was a hair dye or bleach. But it&#x27;s not what I thought. It&#x27;s just half of the mix to bleach or dye your hair. It&#x27;s just the activater part. So I guess I was told wrong and wasted my money by buying it. I can get some thing cheper that does the job some where else.</li>
