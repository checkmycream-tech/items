            <li>The lather is ok, but</li>
            <li>I like the Mistral soap for men better..</li>
            <li>Have used for many years.</li>
            <li>More to follow...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, lot of choices at that price for soap.</li>
            <li>I will tell you that I love the scent, but it is not for everybody.</li>
            <li>Dial soap is actually better for my skin.</li>
            <li>what more can I say.</li>
            <li>Another great men&#x27;s product from Musgo Real</li>

            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Love the vytiver/hayflower or whatever scent it is.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this soap.</li>
            <li>Smell subtly wealthy with this fantastically European-smelling soap.</li>
            <li>Nice size bar and lots and lots of lather,  that rinses clean and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>This soap leaves me feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>bigger bar for the buck and the ones I&#x27;ve tried smell great, specifically the sandalwood one.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect blend of traditional and modern...</li>
            <li>Lathers up great but does not leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li>Great soap, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the soap is excellent and I am very keen to try some of their other scents.</li>
            <li>If you are used to better products you should really skip this one.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant, light curry smell that doesn&#x27;t linger too long - just enough to enjoy.</li>
            <li>A very manly smell and lathered just fine...</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite soap.  </li>
            <li>Very clean, masculine scent.</li>
            <li>The bar of soap is a good size and should last awhile, the fragrance is ok noting to get too excited about, the smell only last about 15 minutes, I&#x27;ve only used it once after work, I shower every morning before work, so this might smell better and last longer at 4am after a good nights rest and all the senses are at 100 percent if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>The soap is kind of expensive for what you get, size wise.  </li>
            <li>Lightly scented masculine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>you prefer a more subtle scent that smells refreshing, this might just be for you.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, manly not over powering, nice clean old fashion smell not in a bad way, sort of reminds me of my dads barber shop.  </li>
            <li>Lasts the same as two or three of Irish Spring, and smells SO MUCH BETTER!</li>
            <li>prefer a scent that compliments my body odor and chemistry, and this does that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems odd to me that people don&#x27;t talk more about the scent.</li>
            <li>It is classic yet timeless.</li>
            <li>Smell is a classic scent.</li>
            <li>A teenager would like this as well as an older gentleman.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a glass cold beer, a shot of warm whiskey and a fresh glazed doughnut with a whiff of cheap stripper mixed in.</li>
            <li>Very masculine but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Anyways I use the Mistral Soap gift set that Amazon sells, comparing fragrances the Mistral Soap smell lasts hours, Musgo Soap is a bit pricey for the short duration it lasts and weaker fragrance compared to less expensive bath soap like Irish Spring, but all in all I think this soap is good for after work shower and staying in on days off, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a first date or go to soap before work</li>

            <li> A lot of the old world recipe soaps that I&#x27;ve tried from other companies, smell like grandpa cologne.  </li>
            <li> kind of a film left that isn&#x27;t as bad as some, but still not what I wanted.  </li>

            <li> but it is not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a little skeptical about how long it will last.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very subtle and manly, and not over powering like Sandalwood Bamboo (the only other scented soap I&#x27;ve tried so</li>

            <li> One bar lasts a few months.</li>
            <li> We will buy again, though I do think it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I am really not impressed by.  </li>

            <li> This is by far my favorite soap.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years now.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d never find it in a store so thank God for Amazon.  It&#x27;s a hard soap that last a longtime so I think the value is there.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mens stores carries this product so I thought I would give it a try.  There is not much fragrance and what fragrance there is I am really not impressed by.  This soap feels like any average soap at an above average price.  It leaves a film and dried out my skin.  If you are used to better products you should really skip this one.</li>
            <li> Need a gift for a man? Perfect</li>
            <li> Love it again. Can&#x27;t say enough. Read my other reviews on Musgo Real soaps.</li>
            <li> A very manly smell and lathered just fine... I would recommend this to any man looking for a great smelling soap!!</li>
            <li> The soap is kind of expensive for what you get, size wise.  Also, the smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s not great either.  The lather is ok, but kind of a film left that isn&#x27;t as bad as some, but still not what I wanted.  I like the Mistral soap for men better.. bigger bar for the buck and the ones I&#x27;ve tried smell great, specifically the sandalwood one.  As for the Musco, I give it an &amp;#34;eh, isss ok&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a soap made for men. It smells like a glass cold beer, a shot of warm whiskey and a fresh glazed doughnut with a whiff of cheap stripper mixed in. It is classic yet timeless. Order it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ok, lot of choices at that price for soap.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap. Lather is luxurious and delightful. It seems odd to me that people don&#x27;t talk more about the scent. It is quite different than any other soap I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I will tell you that I love the scent, but it is not for everybody. In point of fact it smells like the spice cumin. It has a very pleasant, light curry smell that doesn&#x27;t linger too long - just enough to enjoy. The quality of the soap is excellent and I am very keen to try some of their other scents.</li>
            <li> Very clean, masculine scent. Compliments the shaving cream and after shave well.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Just like any other bar soap I&#x27;ve used. Also the smell reminded me of a laundry soap used back in my home country. It cleans well but it is not worth the money at all. Dial soap is actually better for my skin.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, manly not over powering, nice clean old fashion smell not in a bad way, sort of reminds me of my dads barber shop.  If you like a soap to build a nice lather then all of the Claus Porto soaps are for you.</li>
            <li> I may try one of their other scents, although if that&#x27;s an issue I prefer to smell it first.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this soap, while certainly not offensive, just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> Great scent , excellent lather what more can I say. This soap leaves me feeling clean and refreshed! Another great men&#x27;s product from Musgo Real</li>
            <li> Best smelling men&#x27;s soap. One bar lasts a few months.</li>
            <li> Great manly scent. The wife loves it too. Very masculine but not overpowering. Lathers up great but does not leave my skin dry. A great product that I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smell is a classic scent. It lathers and cleans well.  What else could you ask for from a bar of soap?</li>
            <li> if you want a man scent..that is quality.........get this one.scent is good,, lather is good....waaaaay better than store brands.......the women will love it.....</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Love the vytiver/hayflower or whatever scent it is.</li>
            <li> Nice size bar and lots and lots of lather,  that rinses clean and very smooth.  I like the scent it&#x27;s very subtle and manly, and not over powering like Sandalwood Bamboo (the only other scented soap I&#x27;ve tried so far)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a scent that compliments my body odor and chemistry, and this does that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you prefer a more subtle scent that smells refreshing, this might just be for you.</li>
            <li> Great soap, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  Lightly scented masculine fragrance.  A lot of the old world recipe soaps that I&#x27;ve tried from other companies, smell like grandpa cologne.  This is perfect blend of traditional and modern...A teenager would like this as well as an older gentleman.  So glad I found this soap.</li>
            <li> My first try with this product and it is awesome.  Lasts the same as two or three of Irish Spring, and smells SO MUCH BETTER!</li>
            <li> My husband likes this soap for its fragrance, lather and non-drying properties.  We will buy again, though I do think it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I talked to your girl, and she agrees, you&#x27;ve graduated from Irish Spring. Smell subtly wealthy with this fantastically European-smelling soap. Go for it.</li>
