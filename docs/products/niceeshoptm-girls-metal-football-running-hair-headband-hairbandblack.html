    <ol>
            <li>Perfect, keeps my 6-7 inch length hair in hold and makes me look like Gareth Bale</li>
            <li>Great if you like getting your hair tangled in it!</li>
            <li>Shes gonna look so good in casket!</li>
            <li>Great value for the price.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Great product with the price.</li>
            <li>Work great</li>
            <li>My all time favorite, hair stays in place!!</li>
            <li>Good hairbands.</li>
            <li>Looks good.</li>
            <li>I love these a good price to</li>
            <li>Super happy with them and their quality.</li>
            <li>Love these headbands.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again from a happy customer.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li>,it was super sturdy, felt nice and secure in my hair; when i got these they are a bit looser, too flexible, slides around on my hair a bit.  </li>
            <li>For the price, this is fine if you are buying these headbands for a child.</li>
            <li>the price was great but they are a bit too loose for my liking.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>It will probably fit a 5 year old fine.</li>
            <li>These took a while but were well worth the wait and price.</li>
            <li>This may just be a personal preference, but I would have liked another inch or so on each side</li>
            <li>good quaility, took nearly a month and a half to receive but worth the wait for the price.  </li>
            <li>This stayed in place and kept my bangs back while I was doing some cardio jumprope and weightlifting, but I had to reshape it when I first got it to make it fit my head.  </li>
            <li>VERY affordable.  </li>
            <li>Arrived a bit late but in good condition.</li>
            <li>So considering it was only $2, it&#x27;s definitely usable, but I would have been willing to pay a few more dollars for something better.</li>
            <li>As it is, the ends stick out from my head slightly, although maybe I just need to reshape it some more.  </li>
            <li>Decent buy for the money.</li>
            <li>Easy to decorate if you want to add a little flair.  </li>
            <li>It does stay put and holds one&#x27;s hair back but isn&#x27;t comfortable for long periods of wear.</li>
            <li>Im an adult and</li>
            <li>For my purchase, it was a waste of money, as a full grown woman they do not fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>give it a single star just because the price is decent.</li>
            <li>The bottoms are a bit sharp, but they hold longer hair back really well</li>

            <li> a little, so if you are sensitive to &amp;#34;headband heachaches&amp;#34; you might want to try another band.</li>
            <li> Kinda hurts my temples if I wear it for too long though.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s 14.5 inches long).  </li>
            <li> so on.&lt;br /&gt;definite purchase if you have a long hair and play soccer.</li>
            <li> The head band was ordered for an adult but is too small.  </li>
            <li> Also somewhat difficult to get out of my hair, but that&#x27;s probably true of all headbands like this.  </li>
            <li> bad for the price, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.................................................  ............</li>
            <li> after shower to keep hair out of eyes, and to keep it from flyaway when sleeping w wet hair</li>
            <li> Very cheap, does not fit well as it is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is very plain but overall I like this head band.</li>
            <li> They hurt a wee bit behind the ears but only after wearing for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it does &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This one hold your hair tightly even when you play soccer or basketball and</li>
            <li> this was a little to tight.</li>
            <li> I think they are for little kids...</li>
            <li> It is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not easily broke.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick wavy hair it&#x27;ll be a little tought to tack out after use.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> They are not comfortable!</li>
            <li> They are extremely small.</li>
            <li> Too bad that they didn&#x27;t finish the ends of this headband by turning the metal completely back upon itself instead of leaving a sharp end that can dig into the sides of your head, and/or ears.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and pokes!!!</li>
            <li> Just be warned, they are very small headbands.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the worst headband I have ever purchased.</li>

            <li> Good hairbands. Arrived a bit late but in good condition. They hurt a wee bit behind the ears but only after wearing for a long time. They are not for formal wear, but for sports as the description suggests. Decent buy for the money.</li>
            <li> It is very plain but overall I like this head band.</li>
            <li> Love these headbands.  Stay in place.  Flexible.  Bendable.  Not easily broke.  Easy to decorate if you want to add a little flair.  VERY affordable.  Came quickly.</li>
            <li> These took a while but were well worth the wait and price. Super happy with them and their quality. Thanks again from a happy customer.</li>
            <li> good quaility, took nearly a month and a half to receive but worth the wait for the price.  love it</li>
            <li> I currently had one of these for years but it was a different brand,it was super sturdy, felt nice and secure in my hair; when i got these they are a bit looser, too flexible, slides around on my hair a bit.  the price was great but they are a bit too loose for my liking.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite, hair stays in place!!</li>
            <li> after shower to keep hair out of eyes, and to keep it from flyaway when sleeping w wet hair&lt;br /&gt;not bad for the price, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.................................................  ............</li>
            <li> This headband can be used for fashion, or it can be used to keep your hair out of your face while working out.  The only negative is that it does &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; a little, so if you are sensitive to &amp;#34;headband heachaches&amp;#34; you might want to try another band.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair up and out of the way. Looks good. Kinda hurts my temples if I wear it for too long though.</li>
            <li> This is the worst headband I have ever purchased. Very cheap, does not fit well as it is very uncomfortable. Needs a lot of adjustment to the combs. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love these a good price to I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> It will probably fit a 5 year old fine. It does not work on adults at all. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and pokes!!!</li>
            <li> They are not comfortable!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Too bad that they didn&#x27;t finish the ends of this headband by turning the metal completely back upon itself instead of leaving a sharp end that can dig into the sides of your head, and/or ears.

This may just be a personal preference, but I would have liked another inch or so on each side (it&#x27;s 14.5 inches long).

So considering it was only $2, it&#x27;s definitely usable, but I would have been willing to pay a few more dollars for something better.</li>
            <li> my fiance loves them, thank you!</li>
            <li> They are extremely small. I think they are for little kids...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase. It was advertised as a mans headband...wait, WHAT?? If you are the world&#x27;s smallest man. For the price, this is fine if you are buying these headbands for a child. For my purchase, it was a waste of money, as a full grown woman they do not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a single star just because the price is decent. Just be warned, they are very small headbands.</li>
            <li> Perfect, keeps my 6-7 inch length hair in hold and makes me look like Gareth Bale</li>
            <li> Headband is made for a child size.  The head band was ordered for an adult but is too small.  It seems to be made for a child.</li>
            <li> Great if you like getting your hair tangled in it!</li>
            <li> Im an adult and this was a little to tight. If you have thick wavy hair it&#x27;ll be a little tought to tack out after use. But it does hold your hair in place when i was playing basketball.</li>
            <li> Great price. The bottoms are a bit sharp, but they hold longer hair back really well and they dont slip at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time. Product as described. Great product with the price.</li>
            <li> Took forever but do you expect? Work great and I got two. One for me and one for Aunt Macy! Thank god! Shes gonna look so good in casket!</li>
            <li> The metal digs in to the backs of my ears.  It is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> This one hold your hair tightly even when you play soccer or basketball and so on.&lt;br /&gt;definite purchase if you have a long hair and play soccer.</li>
