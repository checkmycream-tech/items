            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It holds about 1/4 cup of water that heats to a hot but not burning steam perfect for opening up pores but not scalding the face and the steam lasts for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>If you could afford a better one then get it!</li>

            <li>I gave it a four because it is a really great product, works very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li>Great deal and works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Good investment :)</li>
            <li>It takes quite a while to finally warm up and get going.</li>
            <li>You really have to stand over it to get the best amount of steam.</li>
            <li>Opens up pores nicely so I can exfoliate with a cleansers more effectively.</li>
            <li>very easy to use and</li>
            <li>My weekly at-home facials are much more effective with this tool.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I honestly believe a boiled pot of water and towel would be better.</li>
            <li>Much more affordable than visits to a spa, and in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>Very cheap...</li>
            <li>The metal basin is a VERY cheap metal and discolored when I would use it.</li>
            <li>That, as well as the smell, makes me think that this is a very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>very light weight - just fill cup with water and put in the container and hit the on button - wait about 1 minute</li>
            <li>I can do this in the shower and better...</li>
            <li>I feel better whenever I use it</li>
            <li>They love it.  </li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I use it to give myself a facial and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Potent device</li>
            <li>I had low expectations from this product because of the price but this steamer works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Perfect facial steamer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely adorable too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a low maintenance steamer with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can use this in bathroom in the evening, instead of having to move into the kitchen over a boiling pot of water.  </li>
            <li>Makes way more steam than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>but, I thought it would put out more steam.</li>
            <li>Omg this steamer leaves my skin so refreshing &amp; glowing</li>
            <li>but once the machine gets going, it does a phenomenal job.</li>
            <li>but I think the depth is okay.</li>
            <li>Save your money and boil a pot of water on the stove and shove your face on that- its more reliable than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I love how compact it is</li>
            <li>My pores tighten and my skin tone looks so much better after using it.</li>
            <li>which I&#x27;m sure they all do but the steam is satisfactory &amp; I pleased with my purchase..</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>but this is so much nicer and safe!!  </li>
            <li>Packaging was good and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too hot and holds a good amount of water.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean!</li>
            <li>And free if you already have a pot at home :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay - rather cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>The facial shield is the perfect size and shape to let you get a face full of steam.</li>
            <li>very inexpensive, one setting is good-</li>
            <li>love this product it works very well!!!</li>

            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to store.</li>
            <li>I just position my head about an inch and a half over the hydration system and lay a towel over my head and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Looks user friendly and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Light and portable too.</li>
            <li>Very simple but great.</li>
            <li>The thing is clearly cheap; stopping working and would not turn on after that.</li>
            <li>and it works just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for the bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li>I can fit it in it&#x27;s original box under the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is easy to store when done.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s absolutely worth investing in!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to put this on something sturdy as the water gets really hot.</li>
            <li>This is a way better alternative to putting a towel over my head and hanging my face over a sink of hot water</li>
            <li>Bonus Is a great Hydration product for your dry face.</li>
            <li>clean your face then steam then use toner and rinse  apply restorative serums (optional)</li>
            <li>get good use out of this product, and would recommend it with the precautions above.</li>
            <li>and I can fit it right on my desk.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it works great for me.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick.</li>
            <li>It works great product when used daily it will really help acne on your face.</li>
            <li>Steam gets very very hot.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results of using this facial steamer.</li>
            <li>I purchased this nearly a year ago and at first, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>But to stick your whole face in there to get the most steam is too hot.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what is suppose to!</li>
            <li>It helps alone with warm water, but I also use essential oils at times.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Wasnt worth to pack this.</li>
            <li>I will use, but the material is to light, its ok to use at home for facial anyway.</li>
            <li>I guess you could say you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Gives off the right amount of steam and covered my face well.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more focused full facial steam, though.</li>
            <li>large ones I&#x27;ve used in the salon!</li>
            <li>Overall, it was a great purchase considering the pricing and it does what I need it to do plus after doing a hydration (steaming) facial for about 10-15 min</li>
            <li>Smooth, clear skin!</li>
            <li>good steamer does leak a little can&#x27;t complain because of price</li>
            <li>, good amount of steam - not too hot, not too little.</li>
            <li>for a better middle...</li>
            <li>First time user.</li>
            <li>It is very simple to use :-)</li>
            <li>other than that I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so done with standing over a pot of hot water and counting the minutes to just get off.</li>
            <li>This is the first steamer I&#x27;ve ever used at home.  </li>
            <li>But, it can get really hot and you have to adjust your face so the steam can penetrate all the areas.</li>
            <li>I thought that there was a lot of HOT steam and stopped sticking my face in it before I ran out of steam.</li>
            <li>but Instantly I could see softer, brighter, more glowing skin.</li>
            <li>But it does exactly what I needed it to do</li>
            <li>but it really clears out the sinuses!</li>
            <li>First time using a face hydration system.  </li>
            <li>Looks exactly as pictured and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>The same could be accomplished in the shower but better.</li>
            <li>This was pretty inexpensive so I can&#x27;t really complain on the quality.</li>
            <li>Good things cime in small packages.  </li>
            <li>This device clearly helped me open my pores and purged impurities, but it made very easy to extract blackheads in my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very simple design, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much room; it is light weight; and the steam is hot enough for what we paid for.  </li>
            <li>It assembles and breaks down super fast and easy.</li>
            <li>The product is light weight, very easy to set up and break down after use and simple.</li>
            <li>Be careful using it and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>a very health-conscious person so therefore, I don&#x27;t use this product anymore.</li>
            <li>The concept is great but this model is poorly executed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li>It boils the water quite fast</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The air does not distribute very well.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing, clears the sinuses, and opens pores.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice facial steamer that does its job although I wish the steam would be a big stronger.</li>
            <li>but steam comes out kind of uneven</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no nooks or crannies for the water to fall into, just a tiny little bowl for a reservoir, so it&#x27;s super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I use this to open my pores when I want to clean my face really well.</li>
            <li>Once it starts producing steam, very little steam comes out and you really have to get close to the device for your face to feel warm.</li>
            <li>My pores felt very open and clean.</li>
            <li>great product I have a lot of black heads and this product has open my pores and my face has clear up.</li>
            <li>small, works, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This product came very fast and I have used twice so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require a lot of water and can be cleaned when done by letting it cool, remove any extra water and wipe with paper towel.  </li>
            <li>You can get the same benefits of this machine by simply putting your face over a warm or barely simmering pot of water, and it&#x27;s much healthier for you.</li>
            <li>The idea is not to burn your face but to get enough heat/steam from a safe enough distance.</li>
            <li>easy to use and no hot water splashes .</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that you cannot easily adjust the steam vent once it gets going (too hot to stick your fingers down there), so start with it closed or open halfway the first time.  If you want more intense steam, open it all the way</li>
            <li>The face cone is too wide for anyone&#x27;s face to fit well.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and it has really helped to clear up her acne.  </li>
            <li>I kept them all closed while I gave the unit a few minutes to heat up the water, then opened them wide and was very happy with the amount of steam.</li>
            <li>Cheap product and cheap quality&lt;br /&gt;Steam is way too weak</li>
            <li>The price is decent but be aware that you are definitely getting what you paid for.</li>
            <li>I moved new place I jus</li>
            <li>After using it, your skin feels very soft and moist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped clear my skin a lot!</li>
            <li>This is my first personal steamer</li>
            <li>course, the benefits of purchasing a portable home facial sauna are evident when you compare the cost of the device with the cost of a treatment at a spa or salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is basic technology--pour water in the well, well gets hot</li>
            <li>To hot for my face personally.</li>
            <li>If what I mentioned above does bother you, I&#x27;d suggest to find something else made of higher quality materials.</li>
            <li>This was my first facial steamer and it does what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>I did not like it, it is weak, you can do better with a bowl with hot water by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>its small and cute and not too fancy. serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>It is a little light, so</li>
            <li>I purchased the steamer to help clear up my sinus infections.  </li>
            <li>For me, it is just what I wanted and it works well so far.</li>
            <li>steam your face weekly and keep it young  </li>
            <li>Use daily for 10 minutes and it really helps.</li>
            <li>My face felt so soft after using it</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it is simple, does not have much buttons to choose or push.</li>
            <li>My face fits in it perfectly; easily to clean, and they provided little cup for water to pour into steamer.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the money, it was a decent purchase.</li>
            <li>primarily use it to sooth my breathing but adding a little essential oil on a cotton ball, but my skin does feel refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>I wipe the whole unit dry before putting it away.</li>
            <li>it let it cool down so that I can actually put my face over it.</li>
            <li>The plastic is kinda cheap and the construction is shoddy but it more than makes up for its deficient looks in the results it produces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 1x so far</li>
            <li>One must be careful in using it so that they don&#x27;t get burned by the hot water left in the device when one is finished.  </li>
            <li>the only thing is in the center it became to hot to handle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure the instructions were detailed enough for someone unfamiliar with a similar product.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than just using a wach rag that gets cold way too fast.</li>
            <li>It hydrates the skin and is much safer and less hassle than hanging out over a pot of boiling water on the stove.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t if this little things was going to produce enough steam but the second time using it</li>
            <li>I have a small face as I am a small person barely scratching that five foot mark and 100lbs soaking wet, so my face gets to close to the steamer inside and its super hot, it almost burns me.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s also great for colds/runny noses.</li>
            <li> The steam lasts about 15 minutes which is great for congestion as well as steaming pores.</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> This steam system helped my chronic sinus problem greatly.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> It is perfect and heats very quick</li>
            <li> and it was a good experience.</li>
            <li> Good product!&lt;br /&gt;Wife</li>

            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the way my face felt and looked!!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Sounds perfect, right?</li>
            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It holds about 1/4 cup of water that heats to a hot but not burning steam perfect for opening up pores but not scalding the face and the steam lasts for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I will try and get a better quality one!</li>
            <li> If you could afford a better one then get it!</li>
            <li> Love this product for my sinus issues!</li>
            <li> my skin felt and looked better!</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because it is a really great product, works very quickly.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> Great deal and works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Good investment :)</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to finally warm up and get going.</li>
            <li> You really have to stand over it to get the best amount of steam.</li>
            <li> Opens up pores nicely so I can exfoliate with a cleansers more effectively.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and</li>
            <li> My weekly at-home facials are much more effective with this tool.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I honestly believe a boiled pot of water and towel would be better.</li>
            <li> Much more affordable than visits to a spa, and in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> Very cheap...</li>
            <li> The metal basin is a VERY cheap metal and discolored when I would use it.</li>
            <li> That, as well as the smell, makes me think that this is a very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> very light weight - just fill cup with water and put in the container and hit the on button - wait about 1 minute</li>
            <li> I can do this in the shower and better...</li>
            <li> I feel better whenever I use it</li>
            <li> They love it.  </li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I use it to give myself a facial and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Potent device</li>
            <li> I had low expectations from this product because of the price but this steamer works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Perfect facial steamer.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely adorable too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a low maintenance steamer with excellent results.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can use this in bathroom in the evening, instead of having to move into the kitchen over a boiling pot of water.  </li>
            <li> Makes way more steam than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> but, I thought it would put out more steam.</li>
            <li> Omg this steamer leaves my skin so refreshing &amp; glowing</li>
            <li> but once the machine gets going, it does a phenomenal job.</li>
            <li> but I think the depth is okay.</li>
            <li> Save your money and boil a pot of water on the stove and shove your face on that- its more reliable than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I love how compact it is</li>
            <li> My pores tighten and my skin tone looks so much better after using it.</li>
            <li> which I&#x27;m sure they all do but the steam is satisfactory &amp; I pleased with my purchase..</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> but this is so much nicer and safe!!  </li>
            <li> Packaging was good and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too hot and holds a good amount of water.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean!</li>
            <li> And free if you already have a pot at home :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay - rather cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> The facial shield is the perfect size and shape to let you get a face full of steam.</li>
            <li> very inexpensive, one setting is good-</li>
            <li> love this product it works very well!!!</li>
            <li> This thing is really easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li> Extremely easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> , your skin looks really nice and your cheeks get very rosy :-)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and put together.</li>
            <li> cleans pores, easy to use</li>
            <li> The product was easy to assemble and use.</li>
            <li> It is easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and set up.</li>
            <li> easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to store.</li>
            <li> I just position my head about an inch and a half over the hydration system and lay a towel over my head and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Looks user friendly and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Light and portable too.</li>
            <li> Very simple but great.</li>
            <li> The thing is clearly cheap; stopping working and would not turn on after that.</li>
            <li> and it works just fantastic.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for the bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li> I can fit it in it&#x27;s original box under the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is easy to store when done.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s absolutely worth investing in!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to put this on something sturdy as the water gets really hot.</li>
            <li> This is a way better alternative to putting a towel over my head and hanging my face over a sink of hot water</li>
            <li> Bonus Is a great Hydration product for your dry face.</li>
            <li> clean your face then steam then use toner and rinse  apply restorative serums (optional)</li>
            <li> get good use out of this product, and would recommend it with the precautions above.</li>
            <li> and I can fit it right on my desk.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it works great for me.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick.</li>
            <li> It works great product when used daily it will really help acne on your face.</li>
            <li> Steam gets very very hot.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results of using this facial steamer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nearly a year ago and at first, I really liked it.</li>
            <li> But to stick your whole face in there to get the most steam is too hot.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is suppose to!</li>
            <li> It helps alone with warm water, but I also use essential oils at times.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Wasnt worth to pack this.</li>
            <li> I will use, but the material is to light, its ok to use at home for facial anyway.</li>
            <li> I guess you could say you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Gives off the right amount of steam and covered my face well.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more focused full facial steam, though.</li>
            <li> large ones I&#x27;ve used in the salon!</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a great purchase considering the pricing and it does what I need it to do plus after doing a hydration (steaming) facial for about 10-15 min</li>
            <li> Smooth, clear skin!</li>
            <li> good steamer does leak a little can&#x27;t complain because of price</li>
            <li> , good amount of steam - not too hot, not too little.</li>
            <li> for a better middle...</li>
            <li> First time user.</li>
            <li> It is very simple to use :-)</li>
            <li> other than that I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so done with standing over a pot of hot water and counting the minutes to just get off.</li>
            <li> This is the first steamer I&#x27;ve ever used at home.  </li>
            <li> But, it can get really hot and you have to adjust your face so the steam can penetrate all the areas.</li>
            <li> I thought that there was a lot of HOT steam and stopped sticking my face in it before I ran out of steam.</li>
            <li> but Instantly I could see softer, brighter, more glowing skin.</li>
            <li> But it does exactly what I needed it to do</li>
            <li> but it really clears out the sinuses!</li>
            <li> First time using a face hydration system.  </li>
            <li> Looks exactly as pictured and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The same could be accomplished in the shower but better.</li>
            <li> This was pretty inexpensive so I can&#x27;t really complain on the quality.</li>
            <li> Good things cime in small packages.  </li>
            <li> This device clearly helped me open my pores and purged impurities, but it made very easy to extract blackheads in my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very simple design, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much room; it is light weight; and the steam is hot enough for what we paid for.  </li>
            <li> It assembles and breaks down super fast and easy.</li>
            <li> The product is light weight, very easy to set up and break down after use and simple.</li>
            <li> Be careful using it and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> a very health-conscious person so therefore, I don&#x27;t use this product anymore.</li>
            <li> The concept is great but this model is poorly executed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li> It boils the water quite fast</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The air does not distribute very well.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing, clears the sinuses, and opens pores.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice facial steamer that does its job although I wish the steam would be a big stronger.</li>
            <li> but steam comes out kind of uneven</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no nooks or crannies for the water to fall into, just a tiny little bowl for a reservoir, so it&#x27;s super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I use this to open my pores when I want to clean my face really well.</li>
            <li> Once it starts producing steam, very little steam comes out and you really have to get close to the device for your face to feel warm.</li>
            <li> My pores felt very open and clean.</li>
            <li> great product I have a lot of black heads and this product has open my pores and my face has clear up.</li>
            <li> small, works, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This product came very fast and I have used twice so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require a lot of water and can be cleaned when done by letting it cool, remove any extra water and wipe with paper towel.  </li>
            <li> You can get the same benefits of this machine by simply putting your face over a warm or barely simmering pot of water, and it&#x27;s much healthier for you.</li>
            <li> The idea is not to burn your face but to get enough heat/steam from a safe enough distance.</li>
            <li> easy to use and no hot water splashes .</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that you cannot easily adjust the steam vent once it gets going (too hot to stick your fingers down there), so start with it closed or open halfway the first time.  If you want more intense steam, open it all the way</li>
            <li> The face cone is too wide for anyone&#x27;s face to fit well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and it has really helped to clear up her acne.  </li>
            <li> I kept them all closed while I gave the unit a few minutes to heat up the water, then opened them wide and was very happy with the amount of steam.</li>
            <li> Cheap product and cheap quality&lt;br /&gt;Steam is way too weak</li>
            <li> The price is decent but be aware that you are definitely getting what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I moved new place I jus</li>
            <li> After using it, your skin feels very soft and moist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped clear my skin a lot!</li>
            <li> This is my first personal steamer</li>
            <li> course, the benefits of purchasing a portable home facial sauna are evident when you compare the cost of the device with the cost of a treatment at a spa or salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is basic technology--pour water in the well, well gets hot</li>
            <li> To hot for my face personally.</li>
            <li> If what I mentioned above does bother you, I&#x27;d suggest to find something else made of higher quality materials.</li>
            <li> This was my first facial steamer and it does what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> I did not like it, it is weak, you can do better with a bowl with hot water by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> its small and cute and not too fancy. serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> It is a little light, so</li>
            <li> I purchased the steamer to help clear up my sinus infections.  </li>
            <li> For me, it is just what I wanted and it works well so far.</li>
            <li> steam your face weekly and keep it young  </li>
            <li> Use daily for 10 minutes and it really helps.</li>
            <li> My face felt so soft after using it</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it is simple, does not have much buttons to choose or push.</li>
            <li> My face fits in it perfectly; easily to clean, and they provided little cup for water to pour into steamer.</li>
            <li> Overall, for the money, it was a decent purchase.</li>
            <li> primarily use it to sooth my breathing but adding a little essential oil on a cotton ball, but my skin does feel refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> I wipe the whole unit dry before putting it away.</li>
            <li> it let it cool down so that I can actually put my face over it.</li>
            <li> The plastic is kinda cheap and the construction is shoddy but it more than makes up for its deficient looks in the results it produces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 1x so far</li>
            <li> One must be careful in using it so that they don&#x27;t get burned by the hot water left in the device when one is finished.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is in the center it became to hot to handle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the instructions were detailed enough for someone unfamiliar with a similar product.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than just using a wach rag that gets cold way too fast.</li>
            <li> It hydrates the skin and is much safer and less hassle than hanging out over a pot of boiling water on the stove.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t if this little things was going to produce enough steam but the second time using it</li>
            <li> I have a small face as I am a small person barely scratching that five foot mark and 100lbs soaking wet, so my face gets to close to the steamer inside and its super hot, it almost burns me.</li>
            <li> The large facial opening is also pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to be wary of (and the reason why I gave it 3 stars versus 4) is that you should only use it while its resting on a table or flat surface.</li>
            <li> A couple times the towel has gotten caught on the top edge of the pink funnel and when I moved my head, the whole thing tilted (meaning one side of the base lifted off the counter), nearly spilling boiling water on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hardly produces any steam, leaks and takes about 5 minutes to even get hot.</li>
            <li> Keep it on a flat sturdy surface.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to help with dry eye before starting restatis.</li>
            <li> Being in Southern California, it can get very dry.  </li>
            <li> As long as you have it set on something stable, this thing is fool proof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is possible to increase the benefits by adding a few drops of an expectorant essential oil such as peppermint to your steam treatment.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wait long for steam to come out.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly hand washed the plastic facial &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; and found no lingering smelly plastic odors as in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my dry eyes and sinus and it worked.  </li>
            <li> The only two minor issues I had with this system was that the steam payoff was quite average and the amount of water that you can put into the system is about 45 ml, but the steam payoff issue can be solved by laying a towel over your head and capturing the steam that escapes.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad (very strong plastic and burning plastic smell) that I almost threw up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to adjust to just the right amount of steam and it doesn&#x27;t feel as concentrated the further</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use as you simply put a little water into the metal basin located in the grey base, then attach the pink facial piece, flip the switch, and within a minute you are steaming your face!</li>
            <li> It works, but you do need to be careful with it.  </li>
            <li> I like to drape a towel over my head to trap the steam, but be careful if you do that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few times a month for the last 6 months.</li>
            <li> Performed just as expected.</li>
            <li> Well whenever I would use this, I would smell a foreign, burning metal scent.</li>
            <li> I have talked two other allergy and sinus infection sufferers to purchase this.  </li>
            <li> Unlike all the other steamers this one does not smell or cause any issues.</li>
            <li> so I have to move from 1 side then to the other side.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the steam level by turning a small knob to open or close vents.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews on diff facial steamers, I opted for this less expensive ($9.99) Lure Facial Hydration System.  </li>
            <li> Even though the well is small, the steam keeps coming for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Really slow and doesn&#x27;t produce enough steam!</li>
            <li> you have to breath down in this thing for the steam to come out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this, I get to lie down in front of the T.V, while steaming my face.</li>
            <li> This same review also complained of a heavy plastic smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing to note is that the base is small and not the most stable thing in the world.  </li>
            <li> The base comes off of the cone which makes it easy to store.</li>
            <li> It turns off and on with the flick of one switch and there is virtually no clean up.  </li>
            <li> The steam could be a little stronger, but hey, it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> so i had to lift my face up a little from it.</li>
            <li> this serves as a little stress reliever for me.</li>
            <li> Takes a few minutes to start working</li>
            <li> Waste of time...</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S: It may also function to alleviate congestion, runny noses and other symptoms of the common cold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s stability and spilling hot water all over myself, but the base is wide and I just might be paranoid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this once a week for the past few months</li>
            <li> The plastic mask is a little uncomfortable, so I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap quality and the packaging was horrible, all banged up.</li>
            <li> I have small face</li>
            <li> The steam is a little weak and it tends to focus on one side, so I have to keep moving around.</li>
            <li> i used it once and the water hardly got tepid.</li>
            <li> Recently my youngest, 15, caught a cold.  </li>
            <li> it goes up the funnel (duh, I know)</li>
            <li> I had a very painful accident when the boiling hot water in the system spilled on my lap.</li>
            <li> Additionally, there is very limited space for the water so within 10 min, the base is empty!</li>
            <li> With the hood it is absolutely useless, however, when I removed the hood and just used the little heating pot</li>
            <li> This is really poorly made.</li>
            <li> One reviewer mentioned that this product had a horrible burnt plastic smell, but I noticed no such odor.</li>
            <li> I use this when anyone in my house is troubled with nasal or sinus congestion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> i could have just been using it wrong.</li>
            <li> The plastic stinks when it heats</li>
            <li> Awkward shape and heat is not evenly distributed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s the base (where you put the water in), the contoured face mask that twists into the base, and a measuring cup for the water.</li>
            <li> I read a review claiming that the metal cup in the base holding the water discolored.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very cheap...I can do this in the shower and better...you have to breath down in this thing for the steam to come out.&lt;br /&gt;Go for a better middle...with all honesty!</li>
            <li> This thing is really easy to use and works well.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a facial hydration system.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have when you want to do facials at home....</li>
            <li> First time user. The package was very simple. Just one box with only 3 parts inside. There&#x27;s the base (where you put the water in), the contoured face mask that twists into the base, and a measuring cup for the water. Extremely easy to assemble. Heats up quick. I&#x27;ve only used it 1x so far and it was a good experience. My pores felt very open and clean. Good investment :)</li>
            <li> Great value for the price - clears my sinuses and helps with sinus headaches (side benefit, great for my skin!)</li>
            <li> Basic but effective.&lt;br /&gt;I primarily use it to sooth my breathing but adding a little essential oil on a cotton ball, but my skin does feel refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> This is my first personal steamer and I have to say it works as well as large ones I&#x27;ve used in the salon!</li>
            <li> It is very simple to use :-) I feel better whenever I use it, your skin looks really nice and your cheeks get very rosy :-) Love it !!!</li>
            <li> This is a great steamer for the price. It isn&#x27;t too hot and holds a good amount of water.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage daughters.  They love it.  Recently my youngest, 15, caught a cold.  She&#x27;s been using it to help her sinus&#x27; and cough.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this around small children as the machine gets hot.  Keep it on a flat sturdy surface.  It doesn&#x27;t require a lot of water and can be cleaned when done by letting it cool, remove any extra water and wipe with paper towel.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> to get maximum steam you need to put a towel over your head. other than that I love this product! Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is so convenient. I&#x27;m so done with standing over a pot of hot water and counting the minutes to just get off. With this, I get to lie down in front of the T.V, while steaming my face. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this once a week for the past few months and I still love it. I use it to give myself a facial and it works wonderfully. The plastic is kinda cheap and the construction is shoddy but it more than makes up for its deficient looks in the results it produces. If it ever breaks, I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> As long as you have it set on something stable, this thing is fool proof. There&#x27;s no nooks or crannies for the water to fall into, just a tiny little bowl for a reservoir, so it&#x27;s super easy to clean.  Great value.</li>
            <li> LOVE it! I only wish the water supply would last the 20 minutes for a maximum facial.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product. It functions as a mini sauna for your face.&lt;br /&gt;It provided me with a \\&quot;deeply\\&quot; cleansing. This device clearly helped me open my pores and purged impurities, but it made very easy to extract blackheads in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the benefits of purchasing a portable home facial sauna are evident when you compare the cost of the device with the cost of a treatment at a spa or salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S: It may also function to alleviate congestion, runny noses and other symptoms of the common cold.&lt;br /&gt;It is possible to increase the benefits by adding a few drops of an expectorant essential oil such as peppermint to your steam treatment.</li>
            <li> This is the first steamer I&#x27;ve ever used at home.  It does the job well, as I get a spa-quality amount of steam that is great for opening pores.  It is a little light, so I worry about it&#x27;s stability and spilling hot water all over myself, but the base is wide and I just might be paranoid.  It heats up quickly and is easy to store when done.</li>
            <li> This is basic technology--pour water in the well, well gets hot, water boils, steam comes out.  It works, but you do need to be careful with it.  Do not let a child use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that you cannot easily adjust the steam vent once it gets going (too hot to stick your fingers down there), so start with it closed or open halfway the first time.  If you want more intense steam, open it all the way the next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to note is that the base is small and not the most stable thing in the world.  I like to drape a towel over my head to trap the steam, but be careful if you do that.  A couple times the towel has gotten caught on the top edge of the pink funnel and when I moved my head, the whole thing tilted (meaning one side of the base lifted off the counter), nearly spilling boiling water on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get good use out of this product, and would recommend it with the precautions above. Even though the well is small, the steam keeps coming for a long time.  It hydrates the skin and is much safer and less hassle than hanging out over a pot of boiling water on the stove.  I like to add one or two drops of eucalyptus oil to the water.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because it is a really great product, works very quickly. But, it can get really hot and you have to adjust your face so the steam can penetrate all the areas.</li>
            <li> This is really poorly made. Very cheap quality and the packaging was horrible, all banged up. Looks like it could have been used.</li>
            <li> Good things cime in small packages.  Potent device and it gets the job done.  Light and portable too. Lightning speed shipping.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and put together.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using it. Product is sturdy and looks like a quality instrument. Looks user friendly and easy to use.</li>
            <li> cleans pores, easy to use</li>
            <li> This arrived sooner than I thought it would. The product was easy to assemble and use. One reviewer mentioned that this product had a horrible burnt plastic smell, but I noticed no such odor. For the price, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product performs like it is supposed to. The face cone is too wide for anyone&#x27;s face to fit well. My daughter and I use it together for the aromatherapy/respiratory therapy effect of the steam. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Steam gets very very hot. To hot for my face personally. I let it heat up then unplug it let it cool down so that I can actually put my face over it. The plastic stinks when it heats</li>
            <li> Really slow and doesn&#x27;t produce enough steam!</li>
            <li> I had low expectations from this product because of the price but this steamer works wonderfully. I have acne prone skin so I needed a facial steamer to bring the pore clogging impurities to the surface of my skin. My weekly at-home facials are much more effective with this tool. The large facial opening is also pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to be wary of (and the reason why I gave it 3 stars versus 4) is that you should only use it while its resting on a table or flat surface. Do not hold it in your hand and attempt to use it - I had a very painful accident when the boiling hot water in the system spilled on my lap. Be careful using it and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice facial steamer that does its job although I wish the steam would be a big stronger. I use this product for my dry eyes and sinus and it worked.  I do like this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nearly a year ago and at first, I really liked it. It&#x27;s very easy to use as you simply put a little water into the metal basin located in the grey base, then attach the pink facial piece, flip the switch, and within a minute you are steaming your face! Sounds perfect, right? Well whenever I would use this, I would smell a foreign, burning metal scent. The metal basin is a VERY cheap metal and discolored when I would use it. That, as well as the smell, makes me think that this is a very cheaply made product. I can&#x27;t seem to find any information from the box or this listing about the materials used to make this machine but I can practically guarantee you that there is BPA in the plastic. That&#x27;s not something you want in a machine that exposes these substances to your open pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a very health-conscious person so therefore, I don&#x27;t use this product anymore. You can get the same benefits of this machine by simply putting your face over a warm or barely simmering pot of water, and it&#x27;s much healthier for you. And free if you already have a pot at home :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if the above issues don&#x27;t bother you then go for it! The price is decent but be aware that you are definitely getting what you paid for. If what I mentioned above does bother you, I&#x27;d suggest to find something else made of higher quality materials. After all, this is your facial skin so it&#x27;s absolutely worth investing in!</li>
            <li> Good product!&lt;br /&gt;Wife uses it for relief from headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Kids use it for Sinus relief during winters.&lt;br /&gt;affordable for family.</li>
            <li> This was my first facial steamer and it does what I want it to do. I thoroughly hand washed the plastic facial &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; and found no lingering smelly plastic odors as in other reviews. I thought that there was a lot of HOT steam and stopped sticking my face in it before I ran out of steam. Putting a towel over your head helps keep it concentrated. No complaints and the price is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results? Opens up pores nicely so I can exfoliate with a cleansers more effectively. Smooth, clear skin!</li>
            <li> I did not like it, it is weak, you can do better with a bowl with hot water by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it!</li>
            <li> The concept is great but this model is poorly executed. It smells so bad (very strong plastic and burning plastic smell) that I almost threw up. Awkward shape and heat is not evenly distributed. If you want this for a stuffy nose/head I would suggest the Vicks vaporizer. If you want this for cosmetic purposes I do not recommend it. Rather than try to buy a more expensive model I used my insurance to see a dermatologist for any skin concerns. Otherwise I honestly believe a boiled pot of water and towel would be better.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I use this to open my pores when I want to clean my face really well. I use this when anyone in my house is troubled with nasal or sinus congestion. It helps alone with warm water, but I also use essential oils at times. The reservoir is metal...possibly aluminum. Perfect size. Great product!! Great seller!!</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean! It&#x27;s helped clear my skin a lot! I would recommend this product to any one!</li>
            <li> Bought this to help with dry eye before starting restatis. The product has been great for clearing my eye ducts and for my face. I already has fairly good skin but Instantly I could see softer, brighter, more glowing skin. No complaints</li>
            <li> I purchased the steamer to help clear up my sinus infections.  I added tea tree oil and used it every morning and evening for 5 minutes each time for three days.  The infections are gone.  My skin looks better.  I have talked two other allergy and sinus infection sufferers to purchase this.  They have had great results also.</li>
            <li> I had a facial steamer as a teenager.  I bought this for my daughter and it has really helped to clear up her acne.  Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and works great. I recommend it for sinus problems and facial moisturizing. works with any cream or gel applired to the face or nostrils.</li>
            <li> great product I have a lot of black heads and this product has open my pores and my face has clear up. Bonus Is a great Hydration product for your dry face.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. Its excellent.</li>
            <li> Great deal and works perfectly fine. The steam could be a little stronger, but hey, it was inexpensive. You get what you pay for and still gives great steam benefits.</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to finally warm up and get going. Once it starts producing steam, very little steam comes out and you really have to get close to the device for your face to feel warm. Overall, for the money, it was a decent purchase. It works.</li>
            <li> Does the job ! Though it will burn your face if you get close to it!</li>
            <li> Cheap and gets the job done! I definitely recommend this product for facial steaming. It is easy and convenient to use. Just make sure to put this on something sturdy as the water gets really hot.</li>
            <li> I was replacing a similar product that had &amp;#34;died.&amp;#34;  This item is like my former one - it is simple to use and does nothing extra beyond creating a steam mist.  People should not expect anything else.  One must be careful in using it so that they don&#x27;t get burned by the hot water left in the device when one is finished.  The steam probably lasts longer than one should steam their face.  I&#x27;m not sure the instructions were detailed enough for someone unfamiliar with a similar product.  For me, it is just what I wanted and it works well so far.</li>
            <li> good steamer does leak a little can&#x27;t complain because of price</li>
            <li> Perfect facial steamer. Just the right size for the bathroom counter top. I can leave it there so I remember to use it. It works like a charm. I love it. It&#x27;s absolutely adorable too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay - rather cheaply made.  The plastic mask is a little uncomfortable, so I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  I&#x27;d give it a mehhh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  The steam is a little weak and it tends to focus on one side, so I have to keep moving around.</li>
            <li> It works great product when used daily it will really help acne on your face.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and very light weight - just fill cup with water and put in the container and hit the on button - wait about 1 minute and it starts steaming</li>
            <li> Excellent product for a great price. I am very pleased with the results of using this facial steamer. It assembles and breaks down super fast and easy. The base comes off of the cone which makes it easy to store. I can fit it in it&#x27;s original box under the bathroom counter.  The water heats to a steam within about 2 to 3 minutes.  It holds about 1/4 cup of water that heats to a hot but not burning steam perfect for opening up pores but not scalding the face and the steam lasts for 8 to 10 minutes. It turns off and on with the flick of one switch and there is virtually no clean up.  It&#x27;s a low maintenance steamer with excellent results.  I love that I can use this in bathroom in the evening, instead of having to move into the kitchen over a boiling pot of water.  I read a review claiming that the metal cup in the base holding the water discolored.  I have used mine several times now and I have not seen this happen. I wipe the whole unit dry before putting it away. This same review also complained of a heavy plastic smell.  Again, I did not note any sort of smell when I received this product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t blow out enough steam</li>
            <li> does an excellent job . easy to use and no hot water splashes .</li>
            <li> Very simple but great. Easy to use and set up. Makes way more steam than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I like this steamer but, I thought it would put out more steam. But it does exactly what I needed it to do so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> works good. for the price its a good deal. not bulky. easy to use</li>
            <li> I like this face steamer.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much room; it is light weight; and the steam is hot enough for what we paid for.  My face fits in it perfectly; easily to clean, and they provided little cup for water to pour into steamer.</li>
            <li> Hardly produces any steam, leaks and takes about 5 minutes to even get hot.</li>
            <li> good for price but steam comes out kind of uneven</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless. i used it once and the water hardly got tepid. it&#x27;s going to the landfill even as we speak.</li>
            <li> It is perfect and heats very quick</li>
            <li> Omg this steamer leaves my skin so refreshing &amp; glowing like I left from getting a facial, I use it 3 times a week religiously.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. The product is light weight, very easy to set up and break down after use and simple. The simplicity of this product, however, does not affect its effectiveness. With just one measurement of water (from the cup provided), this facial hydration system directs ample heat/steam to your entire face. It does take a couple of minutes to heat but once the machine gets going, it does a phenomenal job. Some people complain that the cup is not deep enough but I think the depth is okay. The idea is not to burn your face but to get enough heat/steam from a safe enough distance.</li>
            <li> Love it! Takes a few minutes to start working but it really clears out the sinuses!</li>
            <li> very inexpensive, one setting is good- you can just move your face closer or farther or include a towel in the process. added some eucalyptus to the water, and it was great. perfect for a nice clean feeling</li>
            <li> steam your face weekly and keep it young  it is what i recommend to my clients.  clean your face then steam then use toner and rinse  apply restorative serums (optional)</li>
            <li> First time using a face hydration system.  Being in Southern California, it can get very dry.  After using it, your skin feels very soft and moist.</li>
            <li> This product came very fast and I have used twice so far. It is very simple to use and does steam your face. It is worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Cheap product and cheap quality&lt;br /&gt;Steam is way too weak&lt;br /&gt;When I moved new place I jus threw away this. Wasnt worth to pack this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even last one time use. The thing is clearly cheap; stopping working and would not turn on after that. Would not ever re-purchase or recommend. Save your money and boil a pot of water on the stove and shove your face on that- its more reliable than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> love this product it works very well!!! I was very pleased with the way my face felt and looked!!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> so convenient! Does exactly what is suppose to!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this for my face, I bought it for my asthma, and it works great. It works for my face too (moisture).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it but I don&#x27;t hate it. I will try and get a better quality one! If you could afford a better one then get it!</li>
            <li> Love this product for my sinus issues! Would recommend it to anyone who has a stuffy nose. Use daily for 10 minutes and it really helps.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as pictured and arrived on time. It boils the water quite fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait long for steam to come out. The only two minor issues I had with this system was that the steam payoff was quite average and the amount of water that you can put into the system is about 45 ml, but the steam payoff issue can be solved by laying a towel over your head and capturing the steam that escapes. Overall, it was a great purchase considering the pricing and it does what I need it to do plus after doing a hydration (steaming) facial for about 10-15 min my skin felt and looked better!</li>
            <li> I will use, but the material is to light, its ok to use at home for facial anyway. good price.</li>
            <li> Waste of time... The same could be accomplished in the shower but better. It only holds a pinch of water. It works and forms steam well, but I had to refill it a couple times every time I used it.</li>
            <li> This was pretty inexpensive so I can&#x27;t really complain on the quality. I guess you could say you get your moneys worth. I have a small face as I am a small person barely scratching that five foot mark and 100lbs soaking wet, so my face gets to close to the steamer inside and its super hot, it almost burns me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does what I need it to do. The reason I only gave it four stars is becuase there is only one temperature setting (on/off), and it could scald your face. But other than that, it works great for me. I just position my head about an inch and a half over the hydration system and lay a towel over my head and it works perfectly. It&#x27;s also great for colds/runny noses.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t if this little things was going to produce enough steam but the second time using it I let it heat up for a bit longer and it works just fantastic. I love how compact it is and I can fit it right on my desk. You really have to stand over it to get the best amount of steam. Unlike all the other steamers this one does not smell or cause any issues. Package came within two days!</li>
            <li> small, works, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Easy to use.  Sturdy.  The steam lasts about 15 minutes which is great for congestion as well as steaming pores.</li>
            <li> This is a facial steam that you can do at home. I&#x27;ve been using it a few times a month for the last 6 months. No issues or problems. It works best if you hold a towel over your head so the steam can&#x27;t escape. My pores tighten and my skin tone looks so much better after using it. For this price, I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> works well, good amount of steam - not too hot, not too little. No complaints</li>
            <li> My face felt so soft after using it i could feel my pores opening and put a mask on afterwards. the only thing is in the center it became to hot to handle so i had to lift my face up a little from it. i could have just been using it wrong. i would recommend this especially for its low price.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews on diff facial steamers, I opted for this less expensive ($9.99) Lure Facial Hydration System.  It is simple, which I wanted &amp; does the job.  It takes a few minutes to &amp;#34;get-going&amp;#34; which I&#x27;m sure they all do but the steam is satisfactory &amp; I pleased with my purchase..</li>
            <li> Its good for travel. I need a larger size for weekly use. Easy to store.</li>
            <li> The air does not distribute very well. Additionally, there is very limited space for the water so within 10 min, the base is empty! I should have returned the product, but didn&#x27;t get around to it.</li>
            <li> I wish the steam was a setting rather than a manual vent. It&#x27;s difficult to adjust to just the right amount of steam and it doesn&#x27;t feel as concentrated the further it goes up the funnel (duh, I know) But to stick your whole face in there to get the most steam is too hot.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I used to do the steam from the pot on the stove but this is so much nicer and safe!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Good for the price. I have small face so I have to move from 1 side then to the other side. I also like the fact that it is simple, does not have much buttons to choose or push. It is also lightweight. Packaging was good and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> this serves as a little stress reliever for me. i love it. its small and cute and not too fancy. serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> This product works great. Gives off the right amount of steam and covered my face well. I also used a hand towel for added steaming effect. Received the product quickly and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> With the hood it is absolutely useless, however, when I removed the hood and just used the little heating pot it works well enough.  I was hoping for a more focused full facial steam, though.</li>
            <li> Very simple design, easy to use. Just pour the water in and press the button! You can adjust the steam level by turning a small knob to open or close vents. I kept them all closed while I gave the unit a few minutes to heat up the water, then opened them wide and was very happy with the amount of steam. The facial shield is the perfect size and shape to let you get a face full of steam. Very relaxing, clears the sinuses, and opens pores. Performed just as expected. Much more affordable than visits to a spa, and in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> This is a way better alternative to putting a towel over my head and hanging my face over a sink of hot water</li>
            <li> It is a nice product that comes in very handy for me.  It is much better than just using a wach rag that gets cold way too fast.</li>
            <li> This steam system helped my chronic sinus problem greatly.</li>
