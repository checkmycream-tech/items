            <li>I absolutely love this perfume and am very happy I essentially got 3 products for $5 because the perfume alone is $65 at department stores.</li>

            <li>I was so glad to find such a great deal online.  </li>
            <li>Gift set was nice, smell is consistent across products.</li>
            <li>Its cool, seductive, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>my hair do-dads in fine presentation.  </li>

            <li>If you have ever tried this parfume and liked it you can absolutely get this gift set</li>
            <li>Really cheap price when I bought them.</li>

            <li>The lotion is great to apply before the parfume when I know I will be wearing it all day.&lt;br /&gt;Notes:  Mint, Brown Sugar, Lemon, Jasmine, Peony, Pink Pepper, Cedar Wood, Labdanum.&lt;br /&gt;Style:  Joyous.</li>
            <li>If you love a clean scent I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Such a better deal!</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more Giorgio Armani products!</li>
            <li>The smaller bottle which is hair mist can travel if you fly which worked fine when I flew to the Outer Banks last March.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest this product to be well worth the price that I paid for it.</li>
            <li>All 4 products were full and looked brand new.</li>
            <li>In the stores just the large bottle alone cost more than what I paid for the whole set which was only $70.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>.It was packaged really well.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter and originally had bought a different Aqua di Gioia.</li>
            <li>Yet I am glad there is not a strong mint scent.  </li>
            <li>I have to say this is my new fragrance</li>
            <li>this is what it feels like as you open such a huge delivery box.</li>
            <li>Was my Christmas present to myself ;-)</li>
            <li>I do not smell much of the mint, but for each person it is different.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s young w/o being immature.</li>
            <li>I bought this set a yr ago at Macy&#x27;s &amp; am only about 1/2 way through the main perfume bottle.  </li>
            <li>I got this complete set for only $71.</li>
            <li>Well I got this whole package for the same price I got the other that was a single bottle.</li>

            <li> Locally, I was unable to find this gift set at all the Department Stores</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a perfume that is fruity but not so musky for women.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this fragrance and it is hard to find.</li>
            <li> If it did, I would have a bad headache within 10 minutes.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and needless to say the perfume bottle is HUGE. Smells Great don&#x27;t pass up</li>
            <li> Smell is one of my favorites. Gift set was nice, smell is consistent across products.</li>
            <li> This is truly a signature scent. Its cool, seductive, and refreshing. LOVE, LOVE, this perfume. I receive many compliments on this.</li>
            <li> This parfume is perfect for everyday wear.  The notes are listed below.  I would agree with jasmine, peony, cedar wood. I do not smell much of the mint, but for each person it is different.  Yet I am glad there is not a strong mint scent.  I would not want that.&lt;br /&gt;I love the travel parfume roll on stick for my purse!  The lotion is great to apply before the parfume when I know I will be wearing it all day.&lt;br /&gt;Notes:  Mint, Brown Sugar, Lemon, Jasmine, Peony, Pink Pepper, Cedar Wood, Labdanum.&lt;br /&gt;Style:  Joyous. Aquatic.</li>
            <li> The perfect cologne for any occasion. I received this as a gift and am replacing my now empty bottles with this beautiful gift set</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loves it.  When she wears it I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> I have to say when I smelled this on my friend, it was a must have! It is hard to find a perfume that is fruity but not so musky for women. This is PERFECT!! I have to say this is my new fragrance and I love it. It also last a long time, you can find it on perfumania.com through amazon.com. You can also use a coupon on RetailMeNot.com, just plug in the company perfumania and you can get free shippinig and a discount off!! I got this complete set for only $71. Now that is a DEAL!! LOVE THIS PERFUME!!!! You also have to get the Aqua Di Gio for your man, it is also my top favorite!! Trust me when I say you will love this perfume and you will love the men&#x27;s as well!!!</li>
            <li> She loved this, got me out of the doghouse</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this fragrance and it is hard to find. She really liked the set and was happy with the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you have ever tried this parfume and liked it you can absolutely get this gift set it is nothing but spectacular! This isn&#x27;t a commercial reviewing this is what it feels like as you open such a huge delivery box. All items are located in the red box as same as on that picture and yes, they are originals and only for $74.95 with taxes. Take it.</li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged and so many products for an incredibly low price. Not sure how they did it, but I love it! Was my Christmas present to myself ;-)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and originally had bought a different Aqua di Gioia. Well I got this whole package for the same price I got the other that was a single bottle. Shipped fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Really cheap price when I bought them. My girlfriend loves this set and now she smells like Aqua di Gioia or w/e that is.</li>
            <li> The package deal cost the same as the big bottle at department stores. My wife will get three additional gifts this year; all in one.</li>
            <li> I bought this set a yr ago at Macy&#x27;s &amp; am only about 1/2 way through the main perfume bottle.  The scent itself truly delights people.  Honest to God!  It&#x27;s young w/o being immature.I&#x27;m often stopped when wearing this &amp; asked what it is.  Then there&#x27;s the inevitable spelling headache, it&#x27;s a joy to wear.  As a set, this is a steal.  It&#x27;s on par w/the Marc Jacobs line, but since it&#x27;s less known, the promotional pricing can&#x27;t compare.  The box is nice, too.  Great for localizing &amp; hiding away my hair do-dads in fine presentation.  Assuming it&#x27;s not a knock-off, I say grab this set while you can!</li>
            <li> I bought this set from Perfumania. In the desciption it says &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but it also says &amp;#34;unsealed&amp;#34; so I tried contacting the seller but never heard back. When I received my set it had a sticker on it that implied it was the model set that is used in stores to sell the product. The set did NOT appear to be tampered with but because it was the model I wanted to double check. Like I said I still haven&#x27;t heard back from the seller but I think it should be fine. All 4 products were full and looked brand new. For $70 bucks and free shipping this was a STEAL! I absolutely love this perfume and am very happy I essentially got 3 products for $5 because the perfume alone is $65 at department stores. If you like this perfume you should def buy it from Amazon! Such a better deal!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent.  I was so glad to find such a great deal online.  In the stores just the large bottle alone cost more than what I paid for the whole set which was only $70.  Very pleased with my order and it arrived in only 3 days.</li>
            <li> One year ago I began using GA Aqua di Gioia.  Locally, I was unable to find this gift set at all the Department Stores and I&#x27;m so glad I checked on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t order it until Dec. 20th and chose regular shipping because it wasn&#x27;t a gift.  To my surprise it arrived on the 23rd. Not only do I love, love, love this scent, everyone comments on how great it smells, even guys.  If you love a clean scent I highly recommend this.  I cannot wear anything that has vanilla in it. I don&#x27;t detect any.  If it did, I would have a bad headache within 10 minutes. This set will last the user at least one year if not longer. The only thing I reordered (from Amazon BTW) was the body lotion because the one in this set is small 2.5 oz.  The smaller bottle which is hair mist can travel if you fly which worked fine when I flew to the Outer Banks last March.</li>
            <li> awesome fragrance!!! Gave it as a gift to my fiance and she loved  it!! Definitely will buy more Giorgio Armani products!</li>
            <li> I rated it 5 stars.The reason was because I was very satisfied with my purchase.It wasnt broke when I received it .It was packaged really well.I would suggest this product to be well worth the price that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Great price...awesome fragrance</li>
